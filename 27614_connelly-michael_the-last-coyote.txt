michael connelly the last coyote the fourth book in the harry bosch series chapter one any thoughts that youd like to start with thoughts on what well on anything on the incident on the incident yes i have some thoughts she waited but he didnt continue he had decided before he even got to chinatown that this would be the way he would be hed make her have to pull every single word out of him could you share them with me detective bosch she finally asked that is the purpose of my thoughts are that this is bullshit total bullshit thats the purpose thats all no wait how do you mean bullshit i mean okay i pushed the guy i guess i hit him im not sure exactly what happened but im not denying anything so fine suspend me transfer me take it to a board of rights whatever but going this way is bullshit isl is bullshit i mean why do i have to come here three times a week to talk to you like im some kind ofyou dont even know me you dont know anything about me why do i have to talk to you why do you have to sign off on this well the technical answer is right there in your own statement rather than discipline you the department wants to treat you youve been placed on involuntary stress leave which means i know what it means and thats whats bullshit somebody arbitrarily decides im under stress and that gives the department the power to keep me off the job indefinitely or at least until i jump through enough hoops for you nothing about this was arbitrary it was predicated on your actions which i think clearly show what happened had nothing to do with stress what it was about wasnever mind like i said its bullshit so why dont we just cut through it and get to the point what do i have to do to get back to my job he could see the anger flare behind her eyes his total disavowal of her science and skill cut to her pride quickly the anger was gone though dealing with cops all the time she had to be used to it cant you see that all of this is for your own welfare i have to assume the top managers of this department clearly see you as a valued asset or you wouldnt be here theyd have put you on a disciplinary track and youd be on your way out instead they are doing what they can to preserve your career and its incumbent value to the department valued asset im a cop not an asset and when youre out there on the street nobodys thinking about incumbent value what does that mean anyway am i going to have to listen to words like that in here she cleared her throat before speaking sternly you have a problem detective bosch and it goes far beyond the incident that resulted in your being placed on leave thats what these sessions are going to be all about do you understand this incident is not unique you have had problems before what i am trying to do what i have to do before i can sign off on your return to duty in any capacity is get you to take a look at yourself what are you doing what are you about why do these problems happen to you i want these sessions to be an open dialogue where i ask a few questions and you speak your mind but with a purpose not to harass me and my profession or the leadership of the department but to talk about you this is about you in here no one else harry bosch just looked at her silently he wanted a cigarette but would never ask her if he could smoke he would never acknowledge in front of her that he had the habit if he did she might start talking about oral fixations or nicotine crutches he took a deep breath instead and looked at the woman on the other side of the desk carmen hinojos was a small woman with a friendly face and manner bosch knew she wasnt a bad person hed actually heard good things about her from others who had been sent to chinatown she was just doing her job here and his anger was not really directed at her he knew she was probably smart enough to know that too look im sorry she said i should not have started with that kind of open question i know that this is an emotional subject with you lets try to start again by the way you can smoke if youd like is that in the file too its not in the file it didnt need to be its your hand the way you keep bringing it up to your mouth have you been trying to quit no but its a city office you know the rules it was a thin excuse he violated that law every day at the hollywood station thats not the rule in here i dont want you to think of this as being part of parker center or part of the city thats the chief reason these offices are away from that there are no rules like that here doesnt matter where we are youre still working for the lapd try to believe that you are away from the los angeles police department when you are in here try to believe that youre just coming to see a friend to talk you can say anything here but he knew she could not be seen as a friend never there was too much at stake here just the same he nodded once to please her thats not very convincing he hiked his shoulders as if to say it was the best he could do and it was by the way if you want i could hypnotize you get rid of your dependency on nicotine if i wanted to quit i could do it people are either smokers or theyre not i am yes its perhaps the most obvious symptom of a selfdestructive nature excuse me am i on leave because i smoke is that what this is about i think you know what its about he said nothing else remembering his decision to say as little as possible well lets continue then she said youve been on leavelets see tuesday a week right what have you been doing with your time filling out fema forms mostly fema my house was redtagged the earthquake was three months ago why have you waited ive been busy ive been working i see did you have insurance dont say i see because you dont you couldnt possibly see things the way i do the answer is no no insurance like most everybody else i was living in denial isnt that what you people call it i bet you had insurance yes how bad was your house hit depends on who you ask the city inspectors say its totaled and i cant even go inside i think its fine just needs some work they know me by name at home depot now and ive had contractors do some of it itll be done soon and ill appeal the red tag ive got a lawyer youre living there still he nodded now thats denial detective bosch i dont think you should be doing that i dont think you have any say about what i do outside my job with the department she raised her hands in a handsoff manner well while i dont condone it i suppose it serves its purpose i think its good that you have something to keep you occupied though id much rather it be a sport or a hobby or maybe plans for a trip out of town i think its important to keep busy to keep your mind off the incident bosch smirked what i dont know everybody keeps calling it the incident it kindve reminds me of how people called it the vietnam conflict not the war then what would you call what happened i dont know but incidentit sounds likei dont know antiseptic listen doctor lets go back a minute i dont want to take a trip out of town okay my job is in homicide its what i do and id really like to get back to it i might be able to do some good you know if the department lets you if you do you know its going to be up to you perhaps do you notice that you speak of your job as if its a mission of some sort thats about right like the holy grail he said it with sarcasm this was getting intolerable and it was only the first session is it do you believe your mission in life is to solve murders to put bad people in jail he used the shoulder hike to say he didnt know he stood up and walked to the window and looked down on hill street the sidewalks were crowded with pedestrians every time he had been down here they were crowded he noticed a couple of caucasian women walking along they stood out in the sea of asian faces like raisins in rice they passed the window of a chinese butcher shop and bosch saw a row of smoked ducks hanging whole by their necks farther up the road he saw the hollywood freeway overpass the dark windows of the old sheriffs jail and the criminal courts building behind it to the left of that he could see the city hall tower black construction tarps hung around the top floors it looked like some kind of mourning gesture but he knew the tarps were to hold debris from falling while earthquake repairs were made looking past city hall bosch could see the glass house parker center police headquarters tell me what your mission is hinojos said quietly from behind him id like to hear you put it in words he sat back down and tried to think of a way to explain himself but finally just shook his head i cant well i want you to think about that your mission what is it really think about that whats your mission doctor thats not our concern here of course it is look detective this is the only personal question i will answer these dialogues are not to be about me they are about you my mission i believe is to help the men and women of this department thats the narrow focus and by doing that on a grander scale i help the community i help the people of this city the better the cops are that we have out on the street the better we all are the safer we all are okay thats fine when i think about my mission do you want me to shorten it to a couple sentences like that and rehearse it to the point that it sounds like im reading out of the dictionary mruh detective bosch if you want to be cute and contentious the whole time we are not going to get anywhere which means you are not going to get back to your job anytime soon is that what youre looking for here he raised his hands in surrender she looked down at the yellow legal pad on the desk with her eyes off him he was able to study her carmen hinojos had tiny brown hands she kept on the desk in front of her no rings on either hand she held an expensivelooking pen in her right hand bosch always thought expensive pens were used by people overly concerned with image but maybe he was wrong about her she wore her dark brown hair tied back she wore glasses with thin tortoiseshell frames she should have had braces when she was a kid but didnt she looked up from the pad and their eyes locked i am told this incithissituation coincided with or was close to the time of the dissolving of a romantic relationship told by who its in the background material given to me the sources of this material are not important well they are important because youve got bad sources it had nothing to do with what happened the dissolving as you call it was almost three months ago the pain of these things can last much longer than that i know this is personal and may be difficult but i think we should talk about this the reason is that it will help give me a basis for your emotional state at the time the assault took place is that a problem bosch waved her on with his hand how long did this relationship last about a year marriage no was it talked about no not really never out in the open did you live together sometimes we both kept our places is the separation final i think so saying it out loud seemed to be the first time bosch acknowledged that sylvia moore was gone from his life for good was this separation by mutual agreement he cleared his throat he didnt want to talk about this but he wanted it over with i guess you could say it was mutual agreement but i didnt know about it until she was packed you know three months ago we were holding each other in bed while the house was shaking apart on the pad you could say she was gone before the aftershocks ended they still havent just a figure of speech are you saying the earthquake was the cause of the breakup of this relationship no im not saying that all im saying is thats when it happened right after shes a teacher up in the valley and her school got wrecked the kids were moved to other schools and the district didnt need as many teachers they offered sabbaticals and she took one she left town was she scared of another earthquake or was she scared of you she looked pointedly at him why would she be scared of me he knew he sounded a little too defensive i dont know im just asking questions did you give her a reason to be scared bosch hesitated it was a question he had never really touched on in his private thoughts about the breakup if you mean in a physical way no she wasnt scared and i gave her no reason to be hinojos nodded and wrote something on her pad it bothered bosch that she would make a note about this look its got nothing to do with what happened at the station last week why did she leave what was the real reason he looked away he was angry this was how it was going to be she would ask whatever she wanted invade him wherever there was an opening i dont know that answer is not acceptable in here i think you do know or at least have your own beliefs as to why she would leave you must she found out who i was she found out who you were what does that mean youd have to ask her she said it but shes in venice the one in italy well then what do you think she meant by it it doesnt matter what i think shes the one who said it and shes the one who left dont fight me detective bosch please there is nothing i want more than for you to get back to your job as i said thats my mission to get you back there if you can go but you make it difficult by being difficult maybe thats what she found out maybe thats who i am i doubt the reason is as simplistic as that sometimes i dont she looked at her watch and leaned forward dissatisfaction with the session showing on her face okay detective i understand how uncomfortable you are were going to move on but i suspect we will have to come back to this issue i want you to give it some thought try to put your feelings into words she waited for him to say something but he didnt lets try talking about what happened last week again i understand it stemmed from a case involving the murder of a prostitute yes it was brutal thats just a word means different things to different people true but taking its meaning to you was it a brutal homicide yes it was brutal i think almost all of them are somebody dies its brutal for them and you took the suspect into custody yes my partner and i i mean no he came in voluntarily to answer questions did this case affect you more than say other cases have in the past maybe i dont know why would that be you mean why did i care about a prostitute i didnt not more than any other victim but in homicide there is one rule that i have when it comes to the cases i get what is that rule everybody counts or nobody counts explain it just what i said everybody counts or nobody counts thats it it means i bust my ass to make a case whether its a prostitute or the mayors wife thats my rule i understand now lets go to this specific case im interested in hearing your description of what happened after the arrest and the reasons you may have for your violent actions at the hollywood division is this being taped no detective whatever you tell me is protected at the end of these sessions i will simply make a recommendation to assistant chief irving the details of the sessions will never be divulged the recommendations i make are usually less than half a page and contain no details from the dialogues you wield a lot of power with that half page she didnt respond bosch thought for a moment while looking at her he thought he might be able to trust her but his natural instinct and experience was that he should trust no one she seemed to know his dilemma and waited him out you want to hear my side of it yes i do okay ill tell you what happened chapter two bosch smoked along the way home but realized that what he really wanted was not a cigarette but a drink to deaden his nerves he looked at his watch and decided it was too early to stop at a bar he settled for another cigarette and home after negotiating the drive up woodrow wilson he parked at the curb a half block from the house and walked back he could hear gentle piano music something classical coming from the home of one of his neighbors but he couldnt tell which house he didnt really know any of his neighbors or which one might have a piano player in the family he ducked under the yellow tape strung in front of the property and entered through the door in the carport this was his routine to park down the street and hide the fact that he lived in his own house the house had been redtagged as uninhabitable after the earthquake and ordered demolished by a city inspector but bosch had ignored both orders cut the lock on the electric box and had been living in it for three months it was a small house with redwood siding that stood on steel pylons anchored in the sedimentary bedrock folded and formed as the santa monica mountains rose out of the desert during the mesozoic and cenozoic eras the pylons had held true in their moorings during the quake but the overlying house had shifted atop them breaking partially free of the pylons and seismic bolts it slid all of about two inches still it was enough though short on distance the slide was long on damage inside the woodframe house flexed and window and door frames lost their square the glass shattered the front door became terminally closed frozen in a frame that had canted to the north with the rest of the house if bosch wanted to open that door he would probably need to borrow the police tank with the battering ram as it was hed had to use a crowbar to open the carport door now that door served as the main entrance to his home bosch had paid a contractor five thousand dollars to jack the house up and then over the two inches it had moved it was then put down in its proper space and rebolted to the pylons after that bosch was content to work as time allowed on reframing windows and interior doors himself the glass came first and in the months after that he reframed and rehung the interior doors he worked from books on carpentry and often had to do individual projects two and three times until he had them reasonably correct but he found the work enjoyable and even therapeutic working with his hands became a respite from his job in homicide he left the front door as it was thinking that somehow it was fitting that it was a salute to the power of nature and he was content to use the side door all of his efforts did not save the house from the citys list of condemned structures gowdy the building inspector who had been assigned to this section of the hills kept it redtagged as condemned despite boschs work and so began the hiding game in which bosch made his entrances and exits as surreptitiously as a spys to a foreign embassy he tacked black plastic tarps over the inside of the front windows so they would emit no telltale light and he always watched for gowdy gowdy was his nemesis in the meantime bosch hired a lawyer to appeal the inspectors edict the carport door granted entry directly into the kitchen after he came in bosch opened the refrigerator and retrieved a can of cocacola then stood in the doorway of the aging appliance letting its breath cool him while he studied its contents for something suitable for dinner he knew exactly what was on the shelves and in the drawers but still he looked it was as if he hoped for the surprise appearance of a forgotten steak or chicken breast he followed this routine with the refrigerator often it was the ritual of a man who was alone he knew this also on the back deck bosch drank the soda and ate a sandwich consisting of fivedayold bread and slices of meat from plastic packages he wished he had potato chips to go with it because he would undoubtedly be hungry later after having only the sandwich for dinner he stood at the railing looking down at the hollywood freeway near capacity now with the mondayevening commute he had gotten out of downtown just before the crest of the rushhour wave had broken he would have to guard against going overtime on the sessions with the police psychologist they were scheduled for pm on mondays wednesdays and fridays did carmen hinojos ever let a session go over he wondered or was hers a ninetofive mission from his vantage on the mountain he could see almost all northbound lanes of the freeway as it cut through the cahuenga pass to the san fernando valley he was reviewing what had been said during the session trying to decide whether it was a good or bad session but his focus drifted and he began to watch the point where the freeway came into view as it crested the pass absentmindedly he would choose two cars that came over about even with each other and follow them through the milelong segment of the freeway that was visible from the deck hed pick one or the other and follow the race unknown to its drivers until the finish line which was the lankershim boulevard exit after a few minutes of this he realized what he was doing and spun around away from the freeway jesus he said out loud he knew then that keeping his hands busy would not be enough while he was away from his job he went back inside and got a bottle of henrys from the refrigerator right after he opened the beer the phone rang it was his partner jerry edgar and the call was a welcome distraction from the silence harry hows things in chinatown because every cop secretly feared that he or she might one day crack from the pressures of the job and become a candidate for therapy sessions at the departments behavioral sciences section the unit was rarely spoken of by its formal name going to bss sessions was more often referred to as going to chinatown because of the units location there on hill street several blocks from parker center if it became known about a cop that he was going there the word would spread that he had the hill street blues the sixstory bank building where the bss was located was known as the fiftyonefifty building this was not its address it was the police radio code number for describing a crazy person codes like this were part of the protective structure used to belittle and therefore more easily contain their own fears chinatown was great bosch said sarcastically you ought to try it some day its got me sitting here counting cars on the freeway well at least you wont run out yeah whats going on with you pounds finally did it did what stuck me with somebody new bosch was silent a moment the news gave him a sense of finality the thought that maybe he would never get his job back began to creep into his mind he did yeah he finally did i caught a case this morning so he stuck one of his suckups with me burns burns from autos hes never worked homicide has he ever even worked caps detectives usually followed one of two paths in the department one was property crimes and the other was crimes against persons the latter included specializing in homicide rape assault and robbery caps detectives had the higherprofile cases and usually viewed property crime investigators as paper pushers there were so many property crimes in the city that the investigators spent most of their time taking reports and processing the occasional arrest they actually did little detective work there was no time to hes been a paper guy all the way edgar said but with pounds that doesnt matter all he cares about is having somebody on the homicide table who isnt going to give his shit back to him and burns is just the guy he probably started lobbying for the job the minute the word went out about you well fuck him im gonna get back to the table and then he goes back to autos edgar took his time before answering it was as if bosch had said something that made no sense to him you really think that harry pounds aint going to stand for you coming back not after what you did i told him when he told me i was with burns that you know no offense but id wait until harry bosch came back and he said if i wanted to handle it that way then id be waitin until i was an old man he said that well fuck him too i still got a friend or two in the department irving still owes you doesnt he i guess maybe ill find out he didnt go further with it he wanted to change the subject edgar was his partner but they had never gotten to the point where they completely confided in each other bosch played the mentor role in the relationship and he trusted edgar with his life but that was a bond that held fast on the street inside the department was another matter bosch had never trusted anyone never relied on anyone he wasnt going to start now so whats the case he asked to divert the conversation oh yeah i wanted to tell you about it this was weird man first the killings weird then what happened after the call out was to a house on sierra bonita this is about five in the am the citizen reports he heard a sound like a gunshot only muffledlike he grabs his deer rifle out of the closet and goes outside to take a look this is a neighborhood thats been picked clean lately by the hypes you know four b and es on his block alone this month so he was ready with the rifle anyway he goes down his driveway with the gunthe garage is in the backand he sees a pair of legs hanging out of the open door of his car it was parked in front of the garage he shoots him no thats the crazy thing he goes up with his gun but the guy in his car is already dead stabbed in the chest with a screwdriver bosch didnt get it he didnt have enough of the facts but he said nothing the air bag killed him harry what do you mean the air bag killed him the air bag this goddamn hype was stealing the air bag out of the steering wheel and somehow the thing went off it inflated instantly like it was supposed to and drove the screwdriver right into his heart man ive never seen anything like it he mustve been holding the screwdriver backwards or he was using the buttend to bang on the wheel we havent exactly figured out that part yet we talked to a guy at chrysler he says that you take the protective cover off like this dude had and even static electricity can set the thing off our dead guy was wearing a sweater i dont know couldve been it burns says its the first death by static cling while edgar chuckled at his new partners humor bosch thought about the scenario he remembered a department info bulletin going out on air bag thefts the year before they had become a hot commodity in the underground market with thieves getting as much as three hundred dollars apiece for air bags from unscrupulous body shops the body shops would buy them for three hundred and turn around and charge a customer nine hundred to install one that was double the profit derived when ordering from the manufacturer so it goes down as accidental bosch asked yeah accidental death but the story aint over both doors of the car were open the dead guy had a partner thats what we figure and so if we find the fucker we can charge him under the felony homicide law so we had sid laser the inside of the car and pull all the prints they could i took em down to latents and talked one of the techs into scanning them and running them on the afis and bingo you got the partner dead bang that afis computer has got a long reach harry one of the nets is the us military identification center in st louis we got a match on our guy outta there he was in the army ten years ago we got his id from that then got an address from the dmv and picked him up today he copped on the ride in hes gonna go away for a while sounds like a good day then didnt end there though i havent told you the weird part yet then tell me remember i said we lasered the car and took all the prints right well we got another match too this one on the crime indexes a case outta mississippi man all days should be like this one was what was the match bosch asked he was growing impatient with the way edgar was parceling out the story we matched prints put on the net seven years ago by something called the southern states criminal identification base its like five states that dont add up in population to half of la anyway one of the prints we put through today matched the doer on a double homicide in biloxi all the way back in seventysix some guy the papers there called the bicentennial butcher on account he killed two women on the fourth of july the cars owner the guy with the rifle damn right his fingerprints were on the cleaver left in one girls skull he was a bit surprised when we came back to his house this afternoon we said hey we caught the partner of the guy who died in your car and by the way youre under arrest for a twobagger motherfucker i think it blew his mind harry you shoulda been there edgar laughed loudly into the phone and bosch knew after only one week of being grounded how much he missed the job did he cop no he kept quiet you cant be that stupid and get away with a double murder for almost twenty years thats a nice run yeah whats he been doing looks like hes just been laying low owns a hardware on santa monica married and has a kid and a dog a total reform case but hes going back to biloxi i hope he likes southern cooking cause he wont be coming back here anytime soon edgar laughed again bosch said nothing the story was depressing because it was a reminder of what he was no longer doing it also reminded him about what hinojos had asked about defining his mission got a couple of mississippi state troopers comin out tomorrow edgar said talked to them a little while ago and they are happy campers bosch didnt say anything for a while harry you still there yeah i was just thinking about somethingwell it sounds like a hell of a day of crime fighting hows the fearless leader taking it pounds jesus hes got a hardon over this the size of a louisville slugger you know what hes doing hes trying to figure out a way to take credit for all three clearances hes trying to put the biloxi cases on our rate it didnt surprise bosch it was a widespread practice among department managers and statisticians to add positive credit to crime clearance levels whenever and wherever possible in the air bag case there was no actual murder it was an accident but because the death occurred during the commission of a crime california law held that an accomplice to the crime could be charged with his partners death bosch knew that based on the partners arrest for murder pounds intended to add a case to the murder clearance chart he would not balance this by adding a case to the murder occurrence chart because the death by air bag was an accident this little statistical twostep would result in a nice little boost for the hollywood divisions overall homicide clearance rate which in recent years had continually threatened to dip below fifty percent but unsatisfied with the modest jump this accounting deception would provide pounds intended to boldly add the two biloxi murders to the clearance chart as well after all it could be argued his homicide squad did clear two more cases adding a total of three cleared cases to one side of the chart without adding any to the other would likely give a tremendous boost to the overall clearance rateas well as to the image of pounds as a detective bureau commander bosch knew that pounds was probably delighted with himself and the accomplishments of the day he said our rate would jump six points edgar was saying he was a very pleased man harry and my new partner was very pleased he had pleased his man i dont want to hear any more i didnt think so so what are you doing to keep busy besides counting cars on the freeway you must be bored stiff harry not really bosch lied last week i finished fixing the deck this week ill harry im telling you youre wasting your time and money the inspectors are going to find you in there and kick you out on your ass then theyll tear the place down themselves and hand you the bill your deck and the whole house will be in the back of a dump truck then i hired a lawyer to work on it whats he gonna do i dont know i want to appeal the red tag hes a land use guy he said he can work it out i hope so i still think you ought to tear it down and start over i didnt win the lotto yet the fedsve got disaster loans you could get one and ive applied jerry but i like my house the way it is okay harry i hope your lawyer works it out anyway i gotta go burns wants to have a beer over at the short stop hes there waiting the last time bosch had been at the short stop a holeinthewall cop bar near the academy and dodger stadium it had still had i support chief gates bumper stickers on the wall for most cops gates was a dying ember of the past but the short stop was a place where oldliners went to drink and remember a department that no longer existed yeah have fun over there jerry take care man bosch leaned against a counter and drank his beer he came to the conclusion that edgars call had been a cleverly disguised way of telling bosch that he was choosing sides and cutting him loose that was okay bosch thought edgars first allegiance was to himself to surviving in a place that could be treacherous bosch couldnt hold that against him bosch looked at his reflection in the glass of the oven door the image was dark but he could see his eyes in the shadow and the line of his jaw he was fortyfour years old and in some ways looked older he still had a full head of curly brown hair but both the hair and the mustache were going to gray his blackbrown eyes seemed to him tired and used up his skin had the pallor of a night watchmans bosch was still leanly built but sometimes his clothes hung on him as if they had been issued at one of the downtown missions or he had recently been through a bad illness he broke away from his reflection and grabbed another beer out of the refrigerator outside on the deck he saw the sky was now brightly lit with the pastels of dusk it would be dark soon but the freeway below was a bright river of moving lights its current never ebbing for a moment looking down on the monday night commute he saw the place as an anthill with the workers moving along in lines someone or some force would soon come along and kick the hill again then the freeways would fall the houses would collapse and the ants would just rebuild and get in line again he was bothered by something but was not quite sure what it was his thoughts swirled and mixed he began to see what edgar had told him about his case in the context of his dialogue with hinojos there was some connection there some bridge but he couldnt get to it he finished his beer and decided that two would be enough he went to one of the lounge chairs and sat down with his feet up what he wanted to do was give everything a rest mind and body he looked up and saw the clouds had now been painted orange by the setting sun they looked like molten lava moving slowly across the sky just before he dozed off a thought pushed through the lava everybody counts or nobody counts and then in the last moment of clarity before sleep he knew what the connecting ribbon that had run through his thoughts had been and he knew what his mission was chapter three in the morning bosch dressed without showering so he could immediately begin work on the house and blank out the lingering thoughts from the night before with sweat and concentration but clearing the thoughts away was not easy as he dressed in old lacquerstained jeans he caught a glimpse of himself in the cracked mirror over the bureau and saw that his tshirt was on backward printed across his chest on the white shirt was the homicide squads motto our day begins when your day ends it was supposed to be on the back of the shirt he pulled it off turned it and put it back on now in the mirror he saw what he was supposed to see a replica of a detectives badge on the left breast of the shirt and the smaller printing that said lapd homicide he brewed a pot of coffee and took it and a mug out to the deck next he lugged out his toolbox and the new door he had bought at home depot for the bedroom when he was finally ready and had the mug filled with steaming black coffee he sat on the footrest of one of the lounge chairs and placed the door on its side in front of him the original door had splintered at the hinges during the quake he had tried to hang the replacement a few days earlier but it was too large to fit the door jamb he figured he needed to shave no more than an eighth of an inch off the opening side to make the fit he set to work with the plane moving the instrument slowly back and forth along the edge as the wood peels fell away in paperthin curls occasionally he would stop and study his progress and run his hand along the area of his work he liked being able to see the progress he was making few other tasks in life seemed that way to him but still he could not concentrate for long his focus on the door was interrupted by the same intrusive thought that had haunted him the night before everybody counts or nobody counts it was what he had told hinojos it was what he had told her he believed but did he what did it mean to him was it merely a slogan like the one on the back of his shirt or was it something he lived by these questions mingled with the echoes of the conversation hed had the night before with edgar and with a deeper thought that he knew he had always had he took the plane off the door edge and ran his hand along the smooth wood again he thought he had it right and carried it inside over a drop cloth in an area of the living room he had reserved for woodworking he ran a sheet of smallgrain sandpaper over the door edge until it was perfectly smooth to his touch holding the door vertically and balancing it on a block of wood he eased it into the hinges and then dropped the pins in he tapped them home with a hammer and they went in easily he had oiled the pins and hinges earlier and so the bedroom door opened and closed almost silently most important though was that it closed evenly in the jamb he opened and closed it several more times just staring at it pleased with his accomplishment the glow of his success was shortlived for having completed the project left his mind open to wander back out on the deck the other thoughts came back as he swept the wood shavings into a small pile hinojos had told him to stay busy now he knew how he would do it and in that moment he realized that no matter how many projects he found to take his time there was one job he still had to do he leaned the broom against the wall and went inside to get ready chapter four the lapd storage facility and aerosquad headquarters known as piper tech was on ramirez street in downtown not far from parker center bosch in a suit and tie arrived shortly before eleven at the gate he held his lapd identification card out the window and was quickly waved in the card was all he had the card along with his gold badge and gun had been taken from him when he was placed on leave the week before but it was later returned so that he could gain entry to the bss offices for the stress therapy sessions with carmen hinojos after parking he walked to the beigepainted storage warehouse that housed the citys history of violence the quarteracre building contained the files of all lapd cases solved or unsolved this was where the case files came when nobody cared anymore at the front counter a civilian clerk was loading files onto a cart so that they could be wheeled back into the expanse of shelves and forgotten by the way she studied bosch he knew it was rare that anyone ever showed up here in person it was all done by telephones and city couriers if youre looking for city council minutes thats building a across the lot the one with brown trim bosch held up his id card no i want to pull a case he reached into his coat pocket while she walked up to the counter and bent forward to read his card she was a small black woman with graying hair and glasses the name tag affixed to her blouse said her name was geneva beaupre hollywood she said why didnt you just ask for it to be sent out in dispatch there aint no hurry on these cases i was downtown over at parkeri wanted to see it as soon as i could anyway well you got a number from his pocket he pulled a piece of notebook paper with the number written on it she bent to study it and then her head jerked up nineteen sixtyone you want a case fromi dont know where nineteen sixtyone is its here ive looked at the file before i guess there was someone else clerking here back then but it was here well ill look youre going to wait yeah ill wait this seemed to disappoint her but bosch smiled at her in the most friendly way he could muster she took the paper with her and disappeared into the stacks bosch walked around the small waiting area by the counter for a few minutes and then stepped outside to smoke a cigarette he was nervous for a reason he could not exactly place he kept moving pacing harry bosch he turned and saw a man approaching him from the helicopter hangar he recognized him but couldnt immediately place him then it hit him captain dan washington a former hollywood patrol skipper who was now commander of the aerosquadron they shook hands cordially and bosch immediately hoped washington did not know of his isl situation howzit going in the wood same old same old captain you know i miss that place youre not missing much how is it with you cant complain i like the detail but its more like being an airport manager than a cop i guess its as good a place to lay low as any other bosch recalled that washington had gotten into a political scrap with the department weight and taken the transfer as a means of survival the department had dozens of outoftheway jobs like washington s where you could lay up and wait for your political fortunes to change whatre you doing over here there it was if washington knew bosch was on leave then admitting he was pulling an old case file would be admitting he was violating the leave order still as his position in the aerosquad attested washington was not a straightline company man bosch decided to run the risk im just pulling an old case i got some free time and thought id check a few things washington narrowed his eyes and bosch knew that he knew yeahwell listen i gotta run but hang in there man dont let the book men get you down he winked at bosch and moved on i wont captain you either bosch felt reasonably sure washington wouldnt mention their meeting to anybody he stepped on his cigarette and went back inside to the counter privately chastising himself anyway for having gone outside and advertised that he was there five minutes later he started hearing a squeaking sound coming from one of the aisles between the stacks in a moment geneva beaupre appeared pushing a cart with a blue threering binder on it it was a murder book it was at least two inches thick dusty and with a rubber band around it the band held an old green checkout card to the binder found it there was a note of triumph in her voice it would be the major accomplishment of her day bosch guessed great she dropped the heavy binder on the counter marjorie lowe homicide now she took the card off the binder and looked at it yes you were the last to take this out lets see that was five years ago you were with robberyhomicide then yes and now im in hollywood you want me to sign for it again she put the card down in front of him yes put your id number there too please he quickly did as he was told and he could tell she was studying him as he wrote a lefty yeah he slid the card back across the counter to her thanks geneva he looked at her wanting to say something else but decided it might be a mistake she looked back at him and a grandmotherly smile formed on her face i dont know what youre doing detective bosch but i wish you good luck i can tell its important you coming back to this after five years its been longer than that geneva a lot longer chapter five bosch cleared all the old mail and carpentry books off the dining room table and placed the binder and his own notebook on top of it he went to the stereo and loaded a compact disc clifford brown with strings he went to the kitchen and got an ashtray then he sat down in front of the blue murder book and looked at it for a long time without moving the last time hed had the file he had barely looked at it as he skimmed through its many pages he hadnt been ready then and had returned it to the archives this time he wanted to be sure he was ready before he opened it so he sat there a long time just studying the cracked plastic cover as if it held some clue to his preparedness a memory crowded into his mind a boy of eleven in a swimming pool clinging to the steel ladder at the side out of breath and crying the tears disguised by the water that dripped out of his wet hair the boy felt scared alone he felt as if the pool were an ocean that he must cross brownie was working through willow weep for me his trumpet as gentle as a portrait painters brush bosch reached for the rubber band he had put around the binder five years earlier and it broke at his touch he hesitated only another moment before opening the binder and blowing off the dust the binder contained the case file on the october homicide of marjorie phillips lowe his mother the pages of the binder were brownish yellow and stiff with age as he looked at them and read them bosch was initially surprised at how little things had changed in nearly thirtyfive years many of the investigative forms in the binder were still currently in use the preliminary report and the investigating officers chronological record were the same as those presently used save for word changes made to accommodate court rulings and political correctness description boxes marked negro had sometime along the line been changed to black and then africanamerican the list of motivations on the preliminary case screening chart did not include domestic violence or hatredprejudice classifications as they did now interview summary sheets did not include boxes to be checked after miranda warnings had been given but aside from those kinds of changes the reports were the same and bosch decided that homicide investigation was largely the same now as back then of course there had been incredible technological advances in the past thirtyfive years but he believed there were some things that were always the same and always would remain the same the legwork the art of interviewing and listening knowing when to trust an instinct or a hunch those were things that didnt change that couldnt the case had been assigned to two investigators on the hollywood homicide table claude eno and jake mckittrick the reports they filed were in chronological order in the binder on their preliminary reports the victim was referred to by name indicating she had immediately been identified a narrative on these pages said the victim was found in an alley behind the north side of hollywood boulevard between vista and gower her skirt and undergarments had been ripped open by her attacker it was presumed that she had been sexually assaulted and strangled her body had been dropped into an open trash bin located next to the rear door of a hollywood souvenir store called startime gifts gags the body was discovered at am by a foot patrol officer who walked a beat on the boulevard and usually checked the back alleys at the beginning of each shift the victims purse was not found with her but she was quickly identified because she was known to the beat officer on the continuation sheet it was made clear why she was known to him victim had a previous history of loitering arrests in the hollywood see ar and vice detective gilchrist and stano described victim as a prostitute who periodically worked in the hollywood area and had been repeatedly warned off victim lived at el rio efficiency apts located two blocks northerly of crime scene it was believed that the victim had been currently involved in call girl prostitution activities ro was able to make identification of the victim because of familiarity of having seen victim in the area in previous years bosch looked at the reporting officers serial number he knew that belonged to a patrolman then who was now one of the most powerful men in the department assistant chief irvin s irving once irving had confided to bosch that he had known marjorie lowe and had been the one who found her bosch lit a cigarette and read on the reports were sloppily written perfunctory and filled with careless misspellings in reading them it was clear to bosch that eno and mckittrick did not invest much time in the case a prostitute was dead it was a risk that came with her job they had other fish to fry he noticed on the death investigation report a box for listing the next of kin it said hieronymus bosch harry son age mcclaren youth hall notification made hrs custody of department of public social services since um see victims arrest reports and father unknown son remains in custody pending foster placement looking at the report bosch could easily decipher all of the abbreviations and translate what was written um stood for unfit mother the irony was not lost on him even after so many years the boy had been taken from a presumably unfit mother and placed in an equally unfit system of child protection what he remembered most was the noise of the place always loud like a prison bosch remembered mckittrick had been the one who came to tell him it was during the swimming period the indoor pool was frothing with waves as a hundred boys swam and splashed and yelled after being pulled from the water harry wore a white towel that had been washed and bleached so many times that it felt like cardboard over his shoulders mckittrick told him the news and he returned to the pool his screams silenced beneath the waves quickly leafing through the supplemental reports on the victims prior arrests bosch came to the autopsy report he skipped most of it not needing the details and settled on the summary page where there were a couple of surprises the time of death was placed at seven to nine hours before discovery near midnight the surprise was in the official cause of death it was listed as bluntforce trauma to the head the report described a deep contusion over the right ear with swelling but no laceration that caused fatal bleeding in the brain the report said the killer might have believed he strangled the victim after knocking her unconscious but it was the coroners conclusion that she was already dead when the killer wrapped marjorie lowes own belt around her neck and tied it off the report stated further that while semen was recovered from the vagina there were no other injuries commonly associated with rape rereading the summary with an investigators eyes bosch could see the autopsy conclusions only muddied the waters for the original two detectives the initial assumption based on the appearance of the body was that marjorie lowe was the victim of a sex crime that raised the specter of a random encounteras random as the couplings of her professionleading to her death but the fact that strangulation occurred after death and that there was no convincing physical evidence of rape raised another possibility as well they were factors from which it could also be speculated that the victim had been murdered by someone who then attempted to disguise his involvement and motivation in the randomness of a sex crime bosch could think of only one reason for such misdirection if that had been the case the killer knew the victim as he moved on he wondered if mckittrick and eno had made any of the same conclusions he had made there was an eightbyten envelope next in the file which was marked as containing crime scene and autopsy photos bosch thought about it a long moment and then put the envelope aside as with the last time he had pulled the murder book out of the archives he couldnt look next was another envelope with an evidence inventory list stapled to it it was almost blank evidence recovered case latent fingerprints taken from leather belt with silver sea shells sid report no murder weapon recoveredblack leather belt with sea shells attached property of victim victims clothing property filed w evidence custodianlocker b lapdhq blouse whiteblood stain black skirttorn at seam pair black high heel shoes pair black sheer stockings torn pair undergarments torn pair gold colored earrings gold colored hoop bracelet gold chain necklace wcross that was it bosch studied the list for a long time before jotting the particulars down in his notebook something about it bothered him but he couldnt draw it out not yet he was taking in too much information and he would have to let it settle some before the anomalies floated to the surface he dropped it for the moment and opened the evidence envelope breaking the seal of a red tape that had cracked with age inside was a yellowed print card on which two complete fingerprints from a thumb and an index finger and several partials had been taped after being lifted with black powder from the belt also in the envelope was a pink check card for the victims clothes which had been placed in an evidence locker the clothes had never been retrieved because a case had never been made bosch put both items aside wondering what would have happened to the clothing in the midsixties parker center had been built and the department moved out of the old headquarters it was long gone now falling to the wrecking ball what happened to the evidence from unsolved cases next in the file was a group of summary reports on interviews conducted during the first days of the investigation most of these were of people with peripheral knowledge of the victim or the crime people like other residents in the el rio apartments and other women in the same profession as the victim there was one short summary that caught boschs eye it was from an interview conducted three days after the murder with a woman named meredith roman she was described in the report as an associate and sometime roommate of the victim at the time of the report she also lived in the el rio one floor up from the victim the report had been typed up by eno who seemed to be the clearcut winner in illiteracy when comparing the reports of the two investigators assigned to the case meredith roman was interviewed at length this date at her apartment in the el rio efficiencies where she lived one floor above the victims apartment miss roman was able to provide this detective with very little useful information in relation to the activities of marjorie lowe during the period of the last week of live miss roman acknowledged that she has engaged in prostitutional acts while in the company of the victim on numerous occassion in the previous eight years but she has no booking record to date later confirmed she told the undersigned detective that such engagements were skeduled by a man named johnny fox who resides at ivar in hollywood fox age has no records of arrests but vice intelligence confirms he has been a suspect previously in cases of pandering malicious assault and sales of heroin miss roman states that the last time she saw the victim was at a party on second floor of the roosevelt hotl on miss roman did not attend party with victim but saw her there momentarily for a short conversation miss roman states that she now has plans to retire from the business of prostitution and leave los angeles she stated that she will provide detectives with a forwarding adress and telephone number so that she can be contacted if necessary her demenor was corperative with the undersigned bosch immediately looked through the summaries again for the report of johnny fox there was none there he flipped to the front of the binder to the chronological record and looked for an entry that would indicate whether they had even talked to fox the cr was just a log of oneline entries with references to other reports on the second page he found a single notation watched fox apt no show there was no other mention of fox in the record but as bosch read through the cr to the end another entry caught his eye a conklin called to skedule meeting bosch knew the name arno conklin had been a los angeles district attorney in the s as bosch remembered it was too early for conklin to have been da but he would still have been one of the offices top prosecutors his interest in a prostitutes murder seemed curious to bosch but there was nothing in the binder that held an answer there was no summary report of a meeting with conklin nothing he noted that the misspelling of the word schedule in the cr entry had been made earlier in the summary of the roman interview typed by eno bosch concluded from this that conklin had called eno to set the meeting however the significance of this if any he didnt know he wrote conklins name down at the top of a page in his notebook getting back to fox bosch could not understand why he was not located and interviewed by eno and mckittrick it seemed that he was a natural suspectthe victims pimp or if fox had been interviewed bosch could not understand why there was no report in the murder book on such a key part of the investigation bosch sat back and lit a cigarette already he was tense with the suspicion that things were amiss with the case he felt the stirring of what he knew was outrage the more he read the more he believed the case had been mishandled from the start he leaned back over the table and continued flipping through the pages of the binder while he smoked there were more meaningless interview summaries and reports it was all just filler any homicide cop worth his badge could churn out reports like these by the dozens if he wanted to fill a binder and make it look like hed done a thorough investigation it appeared that mckittrick and eno were as skilled at it as the best but any homicide cop worth his badge could also tell filler when he saw it and thats what bosch saw here the hollow feeling in his stomach grew more pronounced finally he came to the first followup homicide investigation report it was dated one week after the murder and written by mckittrick homicide of marjorie phillips lowe remains open at this time no suspects identified investigation at this time has determined that victim was engaged in prostitution in the hollywood area and may have fallen victim to a customer who committed the homicide preliminary suspect john fox denied involvement in the incident and has been cleared at this time through fingerprint comparison and confirmation of alibi through witnesses no suspects at this time have been identified john fox states that on friday at approximately hours the victim left her residence at the el rio apts to go to an unknown location for the purposes of prostitution fox states the arrangement was made by victim and he was not made privy to it fox siad it was not unusual practice for victim to make arrangements for liaissons without his knowledge victims undergarment was found with body in ripped condition noted however a pair of stockings also belonging to the victim showed no tears and were believed to possibly have been removed voluntarily experience and instinct of investigators leads to the conclusion that the victim met with foul play at the unknown location after voluntarily arriving and possibly removing some clothing the body was then transported to the trash bin in the alleyway between vista and gower where it was discovered the following morning witness meredith roman was reinterviewed this date and asked to amend her earlier statement roman informed this investigator that it was her belief that the victim had gone to a party in hancock park the night previous to the discovery of her body she could provide no address or name of party at the location miss roman said her plan was to attend with victim but on the previous evening she was assaulted by john fox in a dispute over money she could not attend the party because she believed a bruise on her face made her unpresentable fox readily acknowledged striking roman in subsequent telephone interview roman refused charges investigation is termed at standstill as no further leads have been provided at this time investigators are currently seeking the aid of vice section officers in regard to knowledge of similar incidents andor possible suspects bosch read the page again and tried to interpret what was really being said about the case one thing that was clear from it was that regardless of whether there was an interview summary report in the binder johnny fox had obviously been interviewed by eno and mckittrick he had been cleared the question bosch now had was why did they not type up a summary report or had it been typed up and later removed from the murder book and if so who removed it and why lastly bosch was curious about the lack of any mention of arno conklin in the summary or any other report save for the investigative chronology maybe bosch thought more than just the fox interview summary had been lifted from the binder bosch got up and went to his briefcase which he kept on the counter near the kitchen door from it he took his personal phone book he didnt have a number for lapd archives so he called the regular records number and was transferred a woman answered after nine rings uh mrs beaupre geneva yes hello this is harry bosch i was there earlier today to pick up a file yes from hollywood the old case yes could you tell me do you still have the checkout card there at the counter hold the line i already filed it a moment later she was back yes i have it here could you tell me who else has checked this binder out in the past why would you need to know that there are pages missing from the file mrs beaupre id like to know who might have them well you checked it out last i mentioned that be yes i know about five years ago is there any listing of it being taken out before that or since then i didnt notice when i signed the card today well hold the line and let me see he waited and she was back quickly okay ive got it according to this card the only other time that file was ever taken out was in youre talking way back who checked it out back then its scribbled here i cantit looks like maybe jackuh jack mckillick jake mckittrick could be bosch didnt know what to think mckittrick had the file last but that was more than ten years after the murder what did it mean bosch felt confusion ambush him he didnt know what he had been expecting but hed hoped there would have been something other than a name scribbled more than twenty years ago okay mrs beaupre thanks very much well if youve got missing pages im going to have to make a report and give it to mr aguilar i dont think that will be necessary maam i may be wrong about the missing pages i mean how could there be missing pages if nobodys looked at it since the last time i had it he thanked her again and hung up hoping his attempt at good humor would persuade her to do nothing about his call he opened the refrigerator and looked inside while he thought about the case then closed it and went back out to the table the last pages in the murder book were a due diligence report dated november the departments homicide procedures called for all unsolved cases to be reviewed after a year by a new set of detectives with an eye toward looking for something that the first set of investigators might have missed but in practice it was a rubber stamp process detectives didnt relish the idea of finding the mistakes of their colleagues additionally they had their own case loads to worry about when assigned dds as they were called they usually did little more than read through the file make a few calls to witnesses and then send the binder to archives in this case the dd report by the new detectives named roberts and jordan drew the same conclusions as the reports by eno and mckittrick after two pages detailing the same evidence and interviews already conducted by the original investigators the dd report concluded that there were no workable leads and the prognosis for successful conclusion of the case was hopeless so much for due diligence bosch closed the murder book he knew that after roberts and jordan had filed their report the binder had been shipped to archives as a dead case it had gathered dust there until according to the checkout card mckittrick pulled it out for unknown reasons in bosch wrote mckittricks name under conklins on the page in the notebook then he wrote the names of others he thought it would be useful to interview if they were still alive and could be found bosch leaned back in his chair realizing that the music had stopped and he hadnt even noticed he checked his watch it was twothirty he still had most of the afternoon but he wasnt sure what to do with it he went to the bedroom closet and took the shoebox off the shelf it was his correspondence box filled with letters and cards and photos he had wished to keep over the course of his life it contained objects dated as far back as his time in vietnam he rarely looked in the box but his mind kept an almost perfect inventory of what was in it each piece had a reason for being saved on top was the latest addition to the box a postcard from venice from sylvia it depicted a painting she had seen in the palace of the doges hieronymus boschs the blessed and the damned it showed an angel escorting one of the blessed through a tunnel to the light of heaven they both floated skyward the card was the last he had heard from her he read the back harry thought youd be interested in this piece of your namesakes work i saw it in the palace its beautiful by the way i love venice i think i could stay forever s but you dont love me bosch thought as he put the card aside and began to dig through the other pieces in the box he wasnt distracted again about halfway through the box he found what he was looking for chapter six the midday drive out to santa monica was long bosch had to take the long way the to the and then down because the was still a week away from being reopened by the time he got into sunset park it was after three the house he was looking for was on pier street it was a small craftsman bungalow set on the crest of a hill it had a full porch with red bougainvillea running along the railing he checked the address painted on the mailbox against the envelope that contained the old christmas card on the seat next to him he parked at the curb and looked at the card once more it had been addressed to him five years earlier care of the lapd he had never responded to it not until now as he got out he could smell the sea and guessed that there might be a limited ocean view from the houses western windows it was about ten degrees cooler than it had been at his home and so he reached back into his car for the sport coat he walked to the front porch while putting it on the woman who answered the white door after one knock was in her midsixties and looked it she was thin with dark hair but the gray roots were beginning to show and she was ready for another dye job she wore thick red lipstick a white silk blouse with blue seahorses on it over navy blue slacks she readily smiled a greeting and bosch recognized her but he could see that his own image was completely alien to her it had been almost thirtyfive years since she had seen him he smiled back anyway meredith roman she lost her smile as quickly as she had found it before thats not my name she said in a clipped tone you have the wrong place she moved to close the door but bosch put his hand on it to stop her he tried to be as unthreatening about it as he could but he could see panic starting in her eyes its harry bosch he said quickly she froze and looked bosch in the eyes he saw the panic go away recognition and memories flooded her eyes like tears the smile came back harry little harry he nodded oh darling cmere she drew him into a tight hug and talked in his ear oh so good to see you afterlet me look at you she pushed him back and held her hands wide as if appraising a roomful of paintings at once her eyes were animated and sincere it made bosch feel good and sad at the same time he shouldnt have waited so long he should have visited for reasons other than the one that brought him here now oh come in harry come in bosch entered a nicely furnished living room the floor was red oak and the stucco walls were clean and white the furniture was mostly matching white rattan the place was light and bright but bosch knew he was there to bring darkness meredith is no longer your name no harry not for a long time what do i call you my name is katherine with a k katherine register spelled like the cash register but you pronounce it ree as in reefer thats what my husband used to say boy he was so straight outside of me the closest that man ever came to something illegal was to say the word he used to say that have a seat harry for crying out loud yes used to he passed away five years ago last thanksgiving bosch sat down on the couch and she took the chair across the glass coffee table im sorry its okay you didnt know you never even knew him and ive been a different person for a long time can i get you something some coffee or maybe something stronger it occurred to him that she had sent him the card on the christmas soon after her husbands death he was hit with another wave of guilt for not having responded harry oh uh no im fine ido you want me to call you by your new name she started laughing at the ridiculousness of the situation and he joined in call me any damn thing you want she laughed girlishly a laugh he remembered from a long time before its great to see you you know to see how uh i turned out she laughed again i guess so you know i knew you were with the police because i had read your name in some of the news stories i know you knew i got the christmas card you sent to the station that must have been right after your husband died i uh im sorry i never wrote back or visited i should have thats okay harry i know youre busy with the job and a career and allim glad you got my card do you have a family uh no how about you any children oh no no children you have a wife dont you a handsome man like you no im alone right now she nodded seeming to sense that he wasnt here to reveal his personal history to her anyway for a long moment they just both looked at each other and bosch wondered what she really thought of his being a cop the initial delight in seeing each other was descending into the uneasiness that comes when old secrets come close to the surface i guess he didnt finish the thought he was grappling for a way into the conversation his interviewing skills had deserted him you know if its not too much trouble id take a glass of water it was all he could think of be right back she got up quickly and went to the kitchen he heard her getting ice out of a tray it gave him time to think it had taken him an hour to drive to her house but he hadnt given one thought to what this would be like or how he would get to what he wanted to say and ask she came back in a few minutes with a glass of ice water she handed it to him and put a round coaster made of cork on the glasstopped coffee table in front of him if youre hungry i can bring out some crackers and cheese i just didnt know how much time you no im fine this is great thanks he saluted her with the glass and drank half of it then put it down on the table harry use the coaster getting rings out of the glass is murder bosch looked down at what he had done oh sorry he corrected the placement of his glass youre a detective yes i work in hollywood nowuh but im not really working right now im on sort of a vacation oh that must be nice her spirits seemed to lift as if she knew there was a chance he was not here on business bosch knew it was time to get to the point uh meruh katherine i need to ask you about something what is it harry i look around here and i see you have a very nice home a different name a different life youre no longer meredith roman and i know you dont need me to tell you that youve goti think what im saying is the past may be a difficult thing to talk about i know it is for me and believe me i dont want to hurt you in any way youre here to talk about your mother he nodded and looked down at the glass on the cork coaster your mother and i were best friends sometimes i think i had almost as much a hand in raising you as she did until they took you away from her from us he looked back up at her her eyes were looking hard at distant memories i dont think a day goes by that i dont think about her we were just kids having a good time you know we never thought either of us could get hurt she suddenly stood up harry come here i want to show you something he followed her down a carpeted hallway and into a bedroom there was a fourposter bed with light blue coverings an oak bureau and matching bedside tables katherine register pointed to the bureau there were several photos in ornate standup frames on top most of them were of katherine and a man who seemed much older than she was in the photos her husband bosch guessed but she pointed to one that was to the right side of the grouping the photo was old its color faded it was a picture of two young women with a tiny boy of three or four ive always had that there harry even when my husband was alive he knew my past i told him it didnt matter we had twentythree great years together you see the past is what you make of it you can use it to hurt yourself or others or you can use it to make yourself strong im strong harry now tell me why you came to visit me today bosch reached for the framed photo and picked it up i want he looked up from the photo to her im going to find out who killed her an undecipherable look froze on her face for a moment and then she wordlessly took the frame out of his hands and put it back on the bureau then she pulled him into another deep embrace her head against his chest he could see himself holding her in the mirror over the bureau when she pulled back and looked up at him he saw the tears were already down her cheeks there was a slight tremor in her lower lip lets go sit down he said she pulled two tissues out of a box on the bureau and he led her back to the living room and to her chair do you want me to get you some water no im fine ill stop crying im sorry she wiped at her eyes with the tissues he sat back down on the couch we used to say we were the two musketeers both for one and one for both it was stupid but it was because we were so young and so close im starting from scratch with it katherine i pulled the old files on the investigation it she made a dismissing sound and shook her head there was no investigation it was a joke thats my sense of it too but i dont understand why look harry you know what your mother was he nodded and she continued she was a party girl we both were im sure you know thats the polite way of saying it and the cops really didnt care that one of us ended up dead they just wrote the whole damn thing off i know youre a policeman now but thats the way it was then they just didnt care about her i understand things probably are not too much different now believe it or not but there has to have been more to it than that harry i dont know how much you want to know about your mother he looked at her the past made me strong too i can handle it im sure it didi remember that place where they put you mcevoy or something like mcclaren thats it mcclaren what a depressing place your mother would come home from visiting you and just sit down and cry her eyes out dont change the subject katherine what is it i should know about her she nodded but hesitated for a moment before continuing mar knew some policemen you understand he nodded we both did it was the way it worked you had to get along to go along thats what we called it anyway and when you have that situation and she ends up dead its usually best for the cops to just sweep it under the rug let sleeping dogs lie as they say you pick the cliché they just didnt want anyone embarrassed are you saying you think it was a cop no im not saying that at all i have no idea who did it harry im sorry i wish i did but what im saying is i think those two detectives that were assigned to investigate this knew where it could lead and they werent going to go that way because they knew what was good for them in the department they werent stupid in that way and like i said she was a party girl they didnt care nobody did she got killed and that was that bosch looked around the room not sure what to ask next do you know who the policemen she knew were it was a long time ago you knew some of the same policemen didnt you yes i had to that was the way it worked you used your contacts to keep you out of jail everybody was for sale back then at least different people wanted different forms of payment some of them money some of them other things it said in the murthe file that you never had a record yes i was lucky i was picked up a few times but never booked once they always turned me loose once i could make a call i kept a clean record because i knew a lot of policemen honey you understand yes i understand she didnt look away when she said it all these years in the straight life and she still had a whores pride she could talk about the low points of her life without flinching or batting an eye it was because she had made it through and there was dignity in that enough to last the rest of her life do you mind if i smoke harry no not if i can they took out cigarettes and bosch got up to light them you can use that ashtray on the side table try not to get ashes on the rug she pointed to a small glass bowl on the table at the other end of the couch bosch reached over for it and then held it with one hand while he smoked with the other he looked down into it as he spoke the policemen you knew he said and who she probably knew you dont remember any names i said it was a long time ago and i doubt they had anything to do with this with what happened to your mother irvin s irving do you remember that name she hesitated a moment as the name rolled around in her mind i knew him i think she did too he was on the beat on the boulevard i think it would have been hard for her not to know himbut i dont know i could be wrong bosch nodded he was the one who found her she hiked her shoulders in a whatsthatprove gesture well somebody had to find her she was left out there in the open like that what about a couple of vice guys gilchrist and stano she hesitated before answering yes i knew themthey were mean men would my mother have known them in that way she nodded what do you mean that they were mean in what way they justthey just didnt care about us if they wanted something whether it was a little piece of information you might have picked up on a date or something morepersonal they just came and took it they could be rough i hated them did they but could they have been killers my feeling at the time and now is no they werent killers harry they were cops true they were bought and paid for but it seemed everybody was but it wasnt like it is today where you read the paper and you see some cop on trial for killing or beating or whatever itssorry its okay anybody else you can think of no no names i put that all out of my mind a long time ago okay bosch wanted to take out his notebook but he didnt want to make this seem like an interview he tried to remember what else he had read in the murder book that he could ask about what about this guy johnny fox yes i told those detectives about him they got all excited but then nothing ever happened he was never arrested i think he was but then he was let go his fingerprints didnt match the killers she raised her eyebrows well thats news to me they never told me anything about any fingerprints on your second interviewwith mckittrick you remember him not really i just remember that there were police you know two detectives one was smarter than the other thats what i remember but i dont remember which one was which it seemed like the dumber one was in charge and that was par for the course in those days well anyway mckittrick talked to you the second time in his report he said you changed your story and you told about this party in hancock park yes the party i didnt go because thatjohnny fox hit me the night before and i had a bruise on my cheek it was gorgeous i played around with makeup but i couldnt do anything about the swelling believe me there wasnt much business in hancock park for a party girl with a knot on her face who was having the party i dont remember i dont know if i even knew whose party it was something about the way she answered bothered bosch her tone had changed and it came across as almost a rehearsed answer are you sure dont remember of course im sure katherine stood up i think im going to get some water now she took his glass to refill and left the room again bosch realized that his familiarity with the woman his emotion in seeing her again after so long had blocked most of his investigative instincts he had no feel for the truth he could not tell whether there was more to what she was telling him or not he decided he had to somehow steer the conversation back to the party he thought she knew more than she had said all those years ago she came back with two glasses filled with ice water and placed his back down on the cork coaster something about the way she was so careful about putting the glass down gave him a knowledge about her that had not come through in her spoken words it was simply that she had worked hard to attain the level she was at in life that position and the material things it brought with itlike glass coffee tables and plush carpetsmeant a lot to her and were to be taken care of she took a long drink from her glass after sitting down let me tell you something harry she said i didnt tell them everything i didnt lie but i didnt tell them everything i was afraid afraid of what i became afraid on the day they found her you see id gotten a call that morning before i even knew what had happened to her it was a man but a voice i didnt recognize he told me if i said anything i would be next i remember he said my advice to you little lady is to get the hell out of dodge then of course i heard the police were in the building and had gone to her apartment then i heard she was dead so i did what i was told i left i waited about a week until the police said they were done with me then i moved to long beach i changed my name changed my life i met my husband down there and then years later we moved hereyou know ive never been back to hollywood not even to drive through its an awful place what was it that you didnt tell eno and mckittrick katherine looked down at her hands as she spoke i was afraid you see so i didnt tell everythingbut i knew who she was going to see there at the party we were like sisters lived in the same building shared clothes secrets everything we talked every morning had our coffee together we had no secrets between us and we were going to go to the party together of course after thatafter johnny hit me she had to go alone who was she going to meet there katherine bosch prompted you see that is the right question but the detectives never asked that they only wanted to know whose party it was and where it was that didnt matter what was important was who was she going to meet there and they never asked that who was it she looked away from her hands and to the fireplace she stared at the cold blackened logs left from an old fire the way some people stare mesmerized by a burning fire it was a man named arno conklin he was a very important man in the i know who he was you do his name came up in the records but not that way how could you not tell the cops this she turned and looked at him sharply dont you look at me that way i told you i was scared id been threatened and they wouldnt have done anything with it anyway they were bought and paid for by conklin they wouldnt go near him on just the word of acall girl who didnt see anything but knew a name i had to think of myself your mother was dead harry there was nothing i could do about it he could see the sharp edges of anger in her eyes he knew it was directed at him but more toward herself she could list all her reasons out loud but inside bosch thought she paid a price every day for not having done the right thing you think conklin did it i dont know all i know is that shed been with him before and there was never anything violent i dont know the answer to that any idea now who called you no none conklin i dont know i didnt know his voice anyway did you ever see them together my mother and him once at a dance at the masonic i think it was the night they met johnny fox introduced them i dont think arno knewanything about her at least then could it have been fox who called you no i wouldve recognized his voice bosch thought a moment did you ever see fox again after that morning no i avoided him for a week it was easy because i think he was hiding from the cops but after that i was gone whoever called me he put the fear of god in me i left town for long beach the day the cops said they were done with me packed one suitcase and took the busi remember your mother had some of my clothes in her apartment things that she had borrowed i didnt even bother to try to get them i just took what i had and left bosch was silent he had nothing else to ask i think about those days a lot you know katherine said we were in the gutter your mother and i but we were good friends and we had fun in spite of it all you know all my memoriesyoure in a lot of them you were always there with her we had a lot of laughs in spite of everything she said wistfully and you you were the highlight of it all you know when they took you away from her it nearly killed her right thenshe never stopped trying to get you back harry i hope you know that she loved you i loved you yes i know that but after you were gone she wasnt the same sometimes i think what happened to her was sort of inevitable sometimes i think it was like she had been heading toward that alley for a long time beforehand bosch stood up looking at the sorrow in her eyes i better go ill let you know what happens id like that id like to stay in touch id like that too he headed toward the door knowing that they wouldnt stay in touch time had eroded the bond between them they were strangers who shared the same story on the outside step he turned and looked back at her the christmas card you sent you wanted me to look into this back then didnt you she brought out the faraway smile again i dont know my husband had just died and i was taking stock you know i thought about her and you im proud of how i turned out little harry so i think about what there could have been for her and you im still mad whoever did this should she didnt finish but bosch nodded goodbye harry you know my mother she had a good friend i hope so chapter seven back in his car bosch took his notebook out and looked at the list conklin mckittrick eno meredith roman johnny fox he drew a line through meredith romans name and studied those left on it he knew that the way he had ordered the names was not the same order in which he would attempt to interview them he knew that before he could approach conklin or even mckittrick and eno he needed more information he took his phone book out of his coat pocket and his portable from his briefcase he dialed the department of motor vehicles law enforcement line in sacramento and identified himself to the clerk as lieutenant harvey pounds he gave poundss serial number and asked for a license check on johnny fox after checking his notebook he gave the appropriate date of birth as he did this he ran the numbers and figured that fox was now sixtyone years old as he continued to wait he smiled because pounds would have some explaining to do in about a month the department had recently begun to audit use of the dmv trace service because the daily news had reported that cops all over the department were secretly doing the traces for friendly reporters and private detectives with liberal expense accounts the new chief had cracked down by requiring all calls and computer linkups to dmv to be documented on the newly implemented dmvt form which required attribution of traces to a specific case or purpose the forms were sent to parker center and then audited against the list of traces provided each month by the dmv when the lieutenants name showed up on the dmv list in the next audit and there was no corresponding dmvt form hed get a call from the auditors bosch had gotten the lieutenants serial number off his id card one day when pounds had left it clipped to his jacket on the coat rack outside his office hed written it down in his phone book on a hunch that one day it would come in handy the dmv clerk finally came back on the line and said there was no drivers license presently issued to a johnny fox with the birth date bosch had provided anything close no honey thats lieutenant miss bosch said sternly lieutenant pounds thats ms lieutenant ms sharp and i bet you are tell me ms sharp how far back does that computer run go seven years anything else how do i check the years before that you dont if you want a hand records search you drop us a letter lootenant it will take ten to fourteen days in your case count on the fourteen anything else no but i dont like your demeanor that makes us even goodbye bosch laughed out loud after flipping the phone closed he was sure now that trace wouldnt get lost in the process ms sharpe would see to that the name pounds would probably be on the top of the list when it came in to parker center he dialed edgars number on the homicide table next and caught him before he had left the bureau for the day harry whats up you busy no nothing new can you run a name for me i already did dmv but i need somebody to do the computer uh look can you or cant you if youre worried about pounds then hey harry cool it whats wrong with you man i didnt say i couldnt do it just give me the name bosch couldnt understand why edgars attitude enraged him he took a breath and tried to calm down the names john fox johnny fox shit theres going to be a hundred john foxes you got a dob yeah i got a dob bosch checked his notebook again and gave it to him whatd he do to you say how you doing funny ill tell you later you going to run it yes i said ill do it okay you got my portable number if you cant get through leave me a message at home when i can get to it harry what you said nothings happening nothing is but im working man i cant be running around doing shit for you all the time bosch was stunned into a short moment of silence hey jerry fuck you ill do it myself look harry im not saying im no i mean it never mind i dont want to compromise you with your new partner or your fearless leader i mean after all thats what its about isnt it so dont give me this shit about working youre not working youre about to go out the door for home and you know it or wait a minute maybe its drinks with burnsie again tonight harry take care man bosch flipped the phone closed and sat there letting the anger work out of him like heat from the grill of a radiator the phone rang while it was still in his hand and he immediately felt better he flipped it open look im sorry okay he said forget it there was a long silence hello it was a womans voice bosch felt immediately embarrassed yes detective bosch yes im sorry i thought it was someone else like who who is this its dr hinojos oh bosch closed his eyes and the anger came back what can i do for you i was just calling to remind you that we have a session tomorrow threethirty you will be there i dont have a choice remember and you dont have to call to remind me about our sessions believe it or not i have an appointment calendar a watch an alarm clock all of that stuff now he immediately thought he had gone over the top with the sarcasm sounds like i caught you at a bad time ill let you did you go see you tomorrow detective bosch goodbye he snapped the phone closed again and dropped it on the seat he started the car he took ocean park out to bundy and then up toward the as he approached the freeway overpass he saw the eastbound cars on top werent moving and the on ramp was jammed with cars waiting to wait fuck it he said out loud he went by the freeway ramp without turning and then under the overpass he took bundy up to wilshire and then headed west into downtown santa monica it took him fifteen minutes to find street parking near the third street promenade he had been avoiding multilevel parking garages since the quake and didnt want to start using them now what a walking contradiction bosch thought as he prowled for a parking spot along the curb you live in a condemned house the inspectors claim is ready to slide down the hill but you wont go into a parking garage he finally found a spot across from the porno theater about a block from the promenade bosch spent the rush hours walking up and down the threeblock stretch of outdoor restaurants movie theaters and shops he went into the king george on santa monica which he knew was a hangout for some of the detectives out of west la division but didnt see anybody he knew after that he ate pizza from a togo joint and peoplewatched he saw a street performer juggling five butcher knives at once and he thought he might know something about how the man felt he sat on a bench and watched the droves of people pass him by the only ones who stopped and paid attention to him were the homeless and soon he had no change or dollar bills left to give them bosch felt alone he thought about katherine register and what she had said about the past she had said she was strong but he knew that comfort and strength could come from sadness that was what she had he thought about what she had done five years ago her husband dead she had taken stock of her life and found the hole in her memories the pain she had sent him the card in hopes he might do something then and it had almost worked he had pulled the murder book from the archives but hadnt had the strength or maybe it was the weakness to look at it after it got dark he walked down broadway to mr bs found a stool at the bar and ordered a draft with a jack daniels depth charge there was a quintet playing on the small stage in the back the lead on tenor saxophone they were finishing up do nothing till you hear from me and bosch got the idea he had come in at the end of a long set the sax was draggy it wasnt a clean sound disappointed he looked away from the group and took a large swallow of beer he checked his watch and knew hed have clear driving if he left now but he stayed he picked the shot up and dropped it into the mug and drank deeply from the brutal mix the group moved into what a wonderful world no one in the band stepped up to sing the words but of course nobody could touch louis armstrongs vocals if they tried it was okay though bosch knew the words i see trees of green red roses too i see them bloom for me and you and i think to myself what a wonderful world the song made him feel lonely and sad but that was okay loneliness had been the trash can fire he huddled around for most of his life he was just getting used to it again it had been that way for him before sylvia and it could be that way again it would just take time and the pain of letting her go in the three months since she had left there had been the one postcard and nothing else her absence had fractured the sense of continuity in his life before her his job had always been the iron rails as dependable as the sunset over the pacific but with her he had attempted to switch tracks the bravest jump he had ever made but somehow he had failed it wasnt enough to keep her and she was gone and now he felt he had run clear off the tracks inside he felt as fragmented as his city broken it seemed at times at every level he heard a female voice from nearby singing the words of the song he turned to see a young woman a few stools away her eyes closed as she sang very softly she sang only to herself but bosch could hear i see skies of blue and clouds of white the bright blessed day the dark sacred night and i think to myself what a wonderful world she wore a short white skirt a tshirt and a brightly colored vest bosch guessed she wasnt older than twentyfive and he liked the idea that she even knew the song she sat straight her legs crossed her back swayed with the music of the saxophone her face was framed by brown hair and was turned upward her lips slightly apart almost angelic bosch thought she was quite beautiful so totally lost in the majesty of the music clean or not the sound took her away and he admired her for letting it he knew that what he saw in her face was what a man would see if he made love to her she had what other cops called a getaway face so beautiful it would always be a shield no matter what she did or what was done to her her face would be her ticket it would open doors in front of her close them behind her it would let her get away the song ended and she opened her eyes and clapped no one else had applauded until she began then everyone in the bar bosch included joined in such was the power of the getaway face bosch turned and flagged the bartender for another shot and beer when it was down in front of him he took a glance over at the woman but she was gone he turned and checked the bars door and saw it closing hed missed her chapter eight on the way home he worked his way up to sunset and took that all the way into the city traffic was sparse he had stayed out later than he had planned he smoked and listened to the allnews channel on the radio there was a report about grant high finally reopening in the valley it was where sylvia had taught before going to venice bosch was tired and guessed that he probably wouldnt pass a breath test if stopped he dropped his speed to below the limit as sunset cut through beverly hills he knew the cops in bh wouldnt cut him a break and that would be all hed need on top of the involuntary stress leave he turned left at laurel canyon and took the winding road up the hill at mulholland he was about to turn right on red when he checked the traffic from the left and froze he saw a coyote step out of the brush of the arroyo to the left of the roadway and take a tentative look around the intersection there were no other cars only bosch saw this the animal was thin and ragged worn by the struggle to sustain itself in the urban hills the mist rising from the arroyo caught the reflection of the street lights and cast the coyote in almost a dim blue light and it seemed to study boschs car for a moment its eyes catching the reflection of the stoplight and glowing for just a moment bosch believed that the coyote might be looking directly at him then the animal turned and moved back into the blue mist a car came up behind him and honked bosch had the green light he waved and made the turn onto mulholland but then he pulled to the side he put the car in park and got out it was a cool evening and he felt a chill as he walked across the intersection to the spot where he had seen the blue coyote he wasnt sure what he was doing but he wasnt afraid he just wanted to see the animal again he stopped at the edge of the dropoff and looked down into the darkness below the blue mist was all around him now a car passed behind him and when the noise receded he listened and looked intently but there was nothing the coyote was gone he walked back to his car and drove on mulholland to woodrow wilson drive to home later as he lay in his bed after more drinks and with the light still on he smoked the last cigarette of the night and stared up at the ceiling hed left the light on but his thoughts were of the dark sacred night and the blue coyote and the woman with the getaway face soon all of those thoughts disappeared with him into the dark chapter nine bosch got little sleep and was up before the sun the last cigarette of the night before had nearly been his last for all time he had fallen asleep with it between his fingers only to be jolted awake by the searing pain of the burn he dressed the wounds on two fingers and tried to return to sleep but it wouldnt take him his fingers throbbed and all he could think of was how many times he had investigated the deaths of hapless drunks who had fallen asleep and selfimmolated all he could think of was what carmen hinojos would have to say about such a stunt how was that for a symptom of selfdestruction finally as dawns light began to leak into the room he gave up on sleep and got up while coffee brewed in the kitchen he went into the bathroom and rebandaged the burns on his fingers as he taped the fresh gauze on he glanced at himself in the mirror and saw the deep lines under his eyes shit he said to himself whats going on he had black coffee on the back deck while watching the silent city come awake there was a crisp chill in the air and the earthy smell of eucalyptus was rising from the tall trees down in the pass the marine fog layer had filled the pass and the hills were just mysterious silhouettes in the mist he watched the morning begin for nearly an hour fascinated by the show he had from his deck it wasnt until he went back inside for a second cup that he noticed the red light flashing on his phone machine he had two messages that had probably been left the day before and that he hadnt noticed after coming in last night he pressed the play button bosch this is lieutenant pounds calling on tuesday at three thirtyfive i have to inform you that while you are on leave and until your uh status with the department is decided you will be required to return your vehicle to the hollywood division garage i have here that it is a fouryearold chevrolet caprice tag number oneadamadamthreefourzerotwo please make arrangements immediately to have the car turned in and checked out this order is per standard practices manual citation three dash thirteen violation could result in suspension andor dismissal again this is an order from lieutenant pounds now three thirtysix on tuesday if there is any part of this message that you do not understand feel free to contact me at the office the machine reported the message had actually been left at pm tuesday probably right before pounds had gone home for the day fuck him bosch thought the cars a piece of shit anyway he can have it the second message was from edgar harry you there its edgarokay listen lets forget about today okay i mean it lets just say i was a prick and you were a prick and were both pricks and forget it whether it turns out you are my partner or you were my partner i owe you a lot man and if i ever act like i forgot that hit me alongside the head like you did today now to the bad news i checked everything on this johnny fox i got exactly nothing man thats from the ncic doj dpp corrections national warrants everything i ran the works on him looks like this guy is clean if hes alive you say he doesnt even have a dl so that makes me think maybe you got a phony name there or maybe this guy aint among the living so thats that i dont know what youre up to but if you want anything else give a calloh and hang in there buddy im tenseven after this so you can reach me at home if the message cut off edgar had run out of time bosch rewound the tape and poured his coffee back on the deck he mulled over the whereabouts of johnny fox when he had gotten nothing on the dmv trace bosch had assumed fox might be in prison where drivers licenses werent issued or needed but edgar had not found him there nor had he found his name on any national computer that tracks criminals now bosch guessed that johnny fox had either gone straight or as edgar had suggested was dead if bosch was betting hed take the latter men like johnny fox didnt go straight boschs alternative was to go down to the los angeles county hall of records and look for a death certificate but without a date of death it would be a needle in the haystack search it might take him days before hed do that he decided hed try an easier way the la times he went back inside to the phone and dialed a reporter named keisha russell she was new on the cop beat and still struggling to find her way she had made a subtle attempt to recruit bosch as a source a few months earlier the way reporters usually did that was to write an inordinate number of stories on a crime that did not merit such intense attention but the process put them in constant contact with the detectives on the case and that allowed them the chance to ingratiate themselves and hopefully procure the investigators as future sources russell had written five stories in a week about one of boschs cases it was a domestic violence case in which a husband had disregarded a temporary restraining order and gone to his separated wifes new apartment on franklin he carried her to the fiftyfloor balcony and threw her off he went over next russell had talked to bosch repeatedly during the stretch of stories the resultant dispatches were thorough and complete it was good work and she began to earn boschs respect still he knew that she hoped that the stories and her attention would be the building blocks of a long reporterinvestigator relationship since then not a week had gone by that she didnt call bosch once or twice to bullshit pass along departmental gossip she had picked up from other sources and ask the one question all reporters live and die by anything going on she answered on the first ring and bosch was a little surprised she was in so early he was planning on leaving a message on her voice mail keisha its bosch hey bosch how you doing okay i guess i guess you heard about me not everything but i heard you went on temporary leave but nobody would tell me why you want to talk about it no not really i mean not now i have a favor to ask if it works out ill give you the story thats the deal ive made in the past with other reporters what do i have to do just walk over to the morgue she groaned i mean the newspaper morgue right there at the times oh thats better what do you need ive got a name its old i know the guy was a dirtbag in the fifties and at least the early sixties but ive lost track of him after that thing is my hunch is that hes dead you want an obit well i dont know if this is the type of guy the times would write an obituary on he was strictly small time near as i can tell i was thinking that there might be a story you know if his death was sort of untimely you mean like if he got his shit blown away you got it okay ill take a look she seemed eager bosch sensed he knew that she thought that by doing this favor she would be cementing their relationship in place and it would only pay dividends in the future he said nothing that would dissuade her of this whats the name his name is john fox he went by johnny last i have a trace on him is he was a pimp general piece of trash white black yellow or brown general piece of white trash you could say you have a birth date it will help narrow it down if theres more than one johnny fox in the clips he gave it to her okay where you going to be bosch gave her his portable phone number he knew that would set the hook the number would go right onto the source list she kept in her computer like gold earrings in a jewelry box having the number where he could be reached at almost any time was worth the search in the morgue okay listen ive got a meeting with my editorthats the only reason im in this early but after ill go take a look ill call you as soon as i have something if there is something right after bosch hung up he ate some frosted flakes from a box he took out of the refrigerator and turned on the news radio he had discontinued the newspaper after the earthquake in case gowdy the building inspector happened by early and saw it out front a clue that someone was inhabiting the uninhabitable there was nothing much in the top of the news summary that interested him no homicides in hollywood at least he wasnt missing out on anything there was one story after the traffic report that caught his attention an octopus on display at a city aquarium in san pedro had apparently killed itself by pulling a water circulation tube out of its tank fitting with one of its tentacles the tank emptied and the octopus died environmental groups were calling it suicide a desperate protest by the octopus against its captivity only in la bosch thought as he turned the radio off a place so desperate even the marine life was killing itself he took a long shower closing his eyes and holding his head directly under the spray as he was shaving in front of the mirror after he couldnt help but study the circles under his eyes again they seemed even more pronounced than earlier and fit nicely with the eyes cracked with red from his drinking the night before he put the razor down on the edge of the sink and leaned closer to the mirror his skin was as pale as a recycled paper plate as he appraised himself the thought he had was that he had once been considered a handsome man not anymore he looked beaten it seemed that age was gripping him beating him down he thought that he resembled some of the old men hed seen after they were found dead in their beds the ones in the rooming houses the ones living in refrigerator boxes he reminded himself more of the dead than the living he opened the medicine cabinet so the reflection would go away he looked among the various items on the glass shelves and chose a squeeze bottle of murine he put in a heavy dose of the eye drops wiped the excess spill off his face with a towel and left the bathroom without closing the cabinet and having to look at himself again he put on his best clean suit a gray twopiece and a white buttondown shirt he added his maroon tie with gladiator helmets on it it was his favorite tie and his oldest one edge of it was fraying but he wore it two or three times a week hed bought it ten years earlier when he was first assigned to homicide he pegged it in place on his shirt with a gold tie tack that formed the number the california penal code for homicide as he did this he felt a measure of control come back to him he began to feel good and whole again and to feel angry he was ready to go out into the world whether or not it was ready for him chapter ten bosch pulled the knot of his tie tight against his throat before pulling open the back door of the station he took the hallway to the rear of the detective bureau and then the aisle between the tables toward the front where pounds sat in his office behind the glass windows that separated him from the detectives he commanded heads at the burglary table bobbed up as he was noticed then at the robbery and homicide tables bosch did not acknowledge anyone though he almost lost a step when he saw someone sitting in his seat at the homicide table burns edgar was there at his own spot but his back was to boschs path and he didnt see harry coming through the room but pounds did through the glass wall he saw boschs approach to his office and he stood up behind his desk the first thing bosch noticed as he got closer was that the glass panel that he had broken just a week before in the office had already been replaced he thought it was strange that this could happen so quickly in a department where more vital repairssuch as replacing the bulletriddled windshield of a patrol carnormally took a month of red tape and paper pushing but those were the priorities of this department henry pounds barked come in here an old man who sat at the front counter and took calls on the public line and gave general directions jumped up and doddered into the glass office he was a civilian volunteer one of several who worked in the station mainly retirees that most cops referred to collectively as members of the nod squad bosch followed the old man in and put his briefcase down on the floor bosch pounds yelped theres a witness here he pointed to old henry then out through the glass witnesses out there as well bosch could see that pounds still had deep purple remnants of broken capillaries under each eye the swelling was gone though bosch walked up to the desk and reached into the pocket of his coat witnesses to what to whatever youre doing here bosch turned to look at henry henry you can leave now im just going to talk to the lieutenant henry you stay pounds commanded i want you to hear this how do you know hell remember it pounds he cant even transfer a call to the right table bosch looked back at henry again and fixed him with a stare that left no doubt who was in charge in the glass room close the door on your way out henry made a timid glance back at pounds but then quickly headed out the door closing it as instructed bosch turned back to pounds the lieutenant slowly like a cat sneaking past a dog lowered himself into his seat perhaps thinking or knowing from experience that there might be more safety in not being at a facetoface level with bosch harry looked down and saw that there was a book open on the desk he reached down and turned the cover to see what it was studying for the captains exam lieutenant pounds shrank back from boschs reach bosch saw it was not the captains exam manual but a book on creating and honing motivational skills in employees it had been written by a professional basketball coach bosch had to laugh and shake his head pounds you know youre really something i mean at least youre entertaining i gotta give you that pounds grabbed the book back and shoved it in a drawer what do you want bosch you know youre not supposed to be in here youre on leave but you called me in remember i did not the car you said you wanted the car i said turn it in at the garage i didnt say come in here now get out bosch could see the rosy spread of anger on the other mans face bosch remained cool and took that as a sign of a declining level of stress he brought his hand out of his pocket with the car keys in them he dropped them on the desk in front of pounds its parked out by the drunk tank door you want it back you can have it but you take it through the checkout at the garage thats not a cops job thats a job for a bureaucrat bosch turned to leave and picked up his briefcase he then opened the door to the office with such force that it swung around and banged against one of the glass panels of the office the whole office shook but nothing broke he walked around the counter saying sorry about that henry without looking at the old man and then headed down the front hall a few minutes later he was standing on the curb on wilcox in front of the station waiting for the cab he had called with his portable a gray caprice almost a duplicate of the car he had just turned in pulled up in front of him and he bent down to look in it was edgar he was smiling the window glided down you need a ride tough guy bosch got in theres a hertz on la brea near the boulevard yeah i know it they drove in silence for a few minutes then edgar laughed and shook his head what nothingburns man i think he was about to shit his pants when you were in there with pounds he thought you were gonna come outta there and throw his ass outta your chair at the table he was pitiful shit i shouldve i didnt think of it silence came back again they were on sunset coming up to la brea harry you just cant help yourself can you i guess not what happened to your hand bosch held it up and studied the bandage ah i hit it last week when i was working on the deck hurt like a son of a bitch yeah you better be careful or pounds is going to be on you like a son of a bitch he already is man hes nothing but a bean counter a punk why cant you just leave it alone you know youre just you know youre beginning to sound like the shrink theyre sending me to maybe i should just sit with you for an hour today what you say maybe shes talking some sense to you maybe i shouldve taken the cab i think you should figure out who your friends are and listen to them for once here it is edgar slowed in front of the rental car agency bosch got out before the car was even stopped harry wait a minute bosch looked back in at him whats going on with this fox thing who is the guy i cant tell you now jerry its just better this way you sure bosch heard the phone in his briefcase start to ring he looked down at it and then back at edgar thanks for the ride he closed the car door chapter eleven the call was from keisha russell at the times she said shed found one small story in the morgue under foxs name but she wanted to meet with bosch to give it to him he knew it was part of the game part of making the pact he looked at his watch he could wait to see what the story said he told her hed buy her lunch at the pantry in downtown forty minutes later she was already in a booth near the cashiers cage when he got there he slipped into the opposite side of the booth youre late she said sorry i was renting a car they took your car huh must be serious were not going to talk about that i know you know who owns this place yeah the mayor doesnt make the food bad she curled her lip and looked around as if the place were crawling with ants the mayor was a republican the times had gone with the democrat what was worse for her at least was that the mayor was a supporter of the police department reporters didnt like that that was boring they wanted city hall infighting controversy scandal it made things more interesting sorry he said i guess i couldve suggested gorkys or some more liberal establishment dont worry about it bosch im just funnin with ya she wasnt more than twentyfive he guessed she was a darkcomplected black woman who had a beautiful grace about her bosch had no idea where she was from but he didnt think it was la she had the touch of an accent a caribbean lilt that maybe she had worked on smoothing out it was still there though he liked the way she said his name in her mouth it sounded exotic like a wave breaking he didnt mind that she was little more than half his age and addressed him only by his last name where you from keisha why why because im interested is all youre on the beat i wanna know who im dealing with im from right here bosch i came from jamaica when i was five years old i went to usc where are you from right here been here all my life he decided not to mention the fifteen months he spent fighting in the tunnels in vietnam and the nine in north carolina training for it what happened to your hand cut it working on my house been doing odd jobs while im off so whats it been like taking bremmers place on the cop beat hed been there a long time yeah i know its been difficult but im making my way slowly im making friends i hope youll be one of my friends bosch ill be your friend when i can lets see what you got she brought a manila file up onto the table but the waiter an old bald man with a waxed mustache arrived before she could open it she ordered an egg salad sandwich he ordered a welldone hamburger and fries she frowned and he guessed why youre vegetarian right yes sorry next time you pick the place i will she opened the file and he noticed she had several bracelets on her left wrist they were made of braided thread in many bright colors he looked in the file and saw a photocopy of a small newspaper clipping bosch could tell by the size of the clip that it was one of the stories that gets buried in the back of the paper she passed it over to him i think this is your johnny fox the age is right but it does not describe him like you did white trash you said bosch read the story it was dated september campaign worker victim of hit and run by monte kim times staff writer a yearold campaign worker for a candidate for the district attorneys office was killed saturday when he was struck by a speeding car in hollywood the los angeles police reported the victim was identified as johnny fox who lived in an apartment on ivar street in hollywood police said fox had been distributing campaign literature supporting district attorney hopeful arno conklin at the corner of hollywood boulevard and la brea avenue when he was cut down by the speeding car as he crossed the street fox was crossing the southbound lanes of la brea about pm when the car struck him police said it appeared fox was killed on impact and his body was dragged for several yards by the car the car that hit fox slowed momentarily after the collision but then sped away police said witnesses told investigators the car proceeded south on la brea at a high rate of speed police have not located the vehicle and witnesses could not provide a clear description of the make and model year police said an investigation is continuing conklin campaign manager gordon mittel said fox had joined the campaign only a week ago reached at the district attorneys office where he is in charge of the special investigation branch under retiring da john charles stock conklin said he had not yet met fox but regretted the death of the man working for his election the candidate declined further comment bosch studied the clip for a long moment after reading it this monte kim is he still at the paper are you kidding thats like a millennium ago back then the newsroom was a bunch of white guys sitting around in white shirts and ties bosch looked down at his own shirt then at her sorry she said anyway hes not around and i dont know about conklin a little before my time did he win yeah i think he had two terms then i think he ran for attorney general or something and got his ass handed to him something like that i wasnt here then i thought you said youve been here all your life i went away for a while vietnam right right yeah a lot of cops your age were there mustve been a trip is that why you all became cops so you could keep carrying guns something like that anyway if conklins still alive hes probably an old man but mittels still around obviously you know that hes probably in one of these booths eating with the mayor she smiled and he ignored it yeah hes a big shot whats the story on him mittel i dont know first name on a big downtown law firm friend of governors and senators and other powerful people last i heard hes running the financing behind robert shepherd robert shepherd you mean that computer guy more like computer magnate yeah dont you read the paper shepherd wants to run but doesnt want to use up his own money mittel is doing the fundraising for an exploratory campaign run for what jesus bosch you dont read the paper or watch tv ive been busy run for what well like any egomaniac i guess he wants to run for president but for now hes looking at the senate shepherd wants to be a thirdparty candidate says the republicans are too far right and the democrats too left hes right down the middle and from what i hear if anybody can get the money together for him to do the thirdcandidate dance its mittel so mittel wants to make himself a president i guess but what are you asking me about him for anyway im a cop reporter youre a cop whats this have to do with gordon mittel she pointed to the photocopy bosch became aware that he might have asked too many questions im just trying to catch up he said like you said i dont read the papers thats paper not papers she said smiling i better not catch you reading or talking to the daily snews hell hath no fury like a reporter scorned right something like that he felt assured that he had deflected her suspicions he held up the photocopy there was no followup to this they never caught anybody i guess not or there would be a story can i keep this sure you feel like taking another walk back to the morgue for what stories about conklin there will be hundreds bosch you said he was da for two terms i only want stories from before he was elected and if you have the time throw in stories on mittel too you know youre asking a lot i could get in trouble if they knew i was doing clip searches for a cop she put on a fake pout and he ignored that too he knew what she was driving at you want to tell me what this is about bosch he still didnt say anything i didnt think so well look ive got two interviews to do this afternoon im going to be gone what i can do is get an intern to get the clips together and leave it all for you with the guard in the globe lobby it will be in an envelope so nobody will know what it is would that be okay he nodded hed been to times square before on a handful of occasions usually meetings with reporters it was a blocksized building with two lobbies the centerpiece of the lobby at the first and spring entrance was a huge globe that never stopped rotating just as the news never stopped happening youll just leave it under my name wont that get you in trouble you know like you said being too friendly with a cop thats got to be against the rules over there she smiled at his sarcasm dont worry if an editor or somebody asks ill just say its an investment in the future you better remember that bosch friendship is a twoway street dont worry i never forget that he leaned forward across the table so he was up close to her face i want you to remember something too one of the reasons im not telling you why i need this stuff is because im not sure what it means if anything but dont you get too curious dont you go making any calls you do that and you might mess things up i might get hurt you might get hurt got it got it the man with the waxed mustache appeared at the side of the table with their plates chapter twelve i noticed you arrived early today am i to take that as a sign that you want to be here not especially i was downtown having lunch with a friend so i just came over well its good to hear you were out with a friend i think that is good carmen hinojos was behind her desk the notebook was out and open but she sat with her hands clasped together in front of her it was as if she was going out of her way to make no move that could be construed as threatening to the dialogue what happened to your hand bosch held it up and looked at the bandages on his fingers i hit it with a hammer i was working on my house thats too bad i hope its okay ill live why are you so dressed up i hope you dont feel you have to do that for these sessions no ii just like following my routine even if im not going to work i got dressed like i was i understand after she made an offer of coffee or water and bosch declined she got the session going tell me what would you like to talk about today i dont care youre the boss id rather that you not look at the relationship in that way im not your boss detective bosch im just a facilitator someone to help you talk about whatever you want whatever you want to get off your chest bosch was silent he couldnt think of anything to volunteer carmen hinojos drummed her pencil on her yellow tablet for a few moments before taking up the slack nothing at all huh nothing comes to mind then why dont we talk about yesterday when i called you to remind you of our session today you obviously seemed upset about something was that when you hit your hand no that wasnt it he stopped but she said nothing and he decided to give in a little bit he had to admit to himself that there was something about her that he liked she was not threatening and he believed she was telling the truth when she said she was there only to help him what happened when you called was that i had found out earlier that my partner you know my partner before all of this had been paired up with a new man ive been replaced already and howd that make you feel you heard how i was i was mad about it i think anybody would be then i called my partner up later and he treated me like yesterdays news i taught that guy a lot and and what i dont know it hurt i guess i see no i dont think you do youd have to be me to see it the way i did i guess thats true but i can sympathize lets leave it at that let me ask you this shouldnt you have expected your partner to be paired up again after all isnt it a department rule that detectives work in pairs you are on leave for a sofarunknown period of time wasnt it a given that hed get a new partner whether permanent or otherwise i suppose isnt it safer to work in pairs i suppose what is your own experience did you feel safer the times you were with a partner on the job as opposed to those times when you were alone yes i felt safer so what happened was inevitable and inarguable yet still it made you angry it wasnt that it happened that brought it on i dont know it was the way he told me and then the way he acted when i called i really felt left out i asked him for a favor and hei dont know he what he hesitated partners dont do that not with each other theyre supposed be there for each other its supposedly a lot like a marriage but ive never been married she paused to write some notes which made bosch wonder what had just been said that was so important you seem she said while still writing to have a low threshold for the toleration of frustrations her statement immediately made him angry but he knew that if he showed it then he would be confirming her statement he thought maybe it was a trick designed to elicit such a response he tried to calm himself doesnt everybody he said in a controlled voice i suppose to a degree when i reviewed your records i saw that you were in the army during the vietnam war did you see any combat did i see any combat yes i saw combat i was in the middle of combat too i was even under it why do people always ask did you see combat like it was a goddamn movie they took you to over there she was quiet for a long time holding the pen but doing no writing it seemed like she was simply waiting for the sails of his anger to lose the wind he waved his hand in a gesture he hoped told her that he was sorry that it was behind him that they should move on sorry he said just to make sure she still didnt say anything and her stare was beginning to weigh on him he looked away from her to the bookshelves along one wall of the office they were filled with heavy leatherbound psychiatry texts i am sorry to intrude on such an emotionally sensitive area she finally said the reason but thats what this is all about right what you have is a license to intrude and i cant do anything about it so then accept it she said sternly weve been over this before to help you we have to talk about you accept it and maybe we can move on now as i was saying the reason i mentioned the war was that i wanted to ask you if you are familiar with posttraumatic stress syndrome have you ever heard of it he looked back at her he knew what was coming yes of course ive heard of it well detective in the past its primarily been associated with servicemen returning from the war but its not just a war or postwar problem it can happen in any kind of stressful environment any kind and i have to say i think that you are a walking talking example of this disorders symptoms jesus he said shaking his head he turned in his seat so he wasnt looking at her or her bookcase he stared at the sky through the window it was cloudless you people sit up here in these offices and have no idea he didnt finish he just shook his head he reached to his neck and loosened his tie it was like he couldnt get enough air into his chest hear me out detective okay just look at the facts here can you think of anything more stressful to be in this city during the last few years than a police officer between rodney king and the scrutiny and villainy that brought the riots fires floods and earthquakes each officer on this force has had to write the book on stress management and of course mismanagement you left out killer bees im being serious so am i it was on the news with all thats happened and gone on in this city with every one of these calamities who is in the middle every time the police officers the ones who have to respond the ones who cant stay at home duck down and wait until its over so lets go from that generalization to the individual you detective you have been a frontline contender with all of these crises at the same time youve had your real job to contend with homicide its one of the higheststress jobs in the department tell me how many murders have you investigated in the last three years look im not looking for an excuse i told you before that i did what i did because i wanted to it had nothing to do with riots or how many dead bodies have you looked at just answer my question please how many dead bodies how many widows did you break the news to how many mothers did you tell about their dead children he brought his hands up and rubbed his face all he knew was that he wanted to hide from her a lot he finally whispered more than a lot he exhaled loudly thank you for answering im not trying to corner you the point of my questions and the treatise on the social cultural and even geologic fragmentation of this city is that what im saying here is that youve been through more than most okay and this doesnt even include the baggage you might still have from vietnam or the loss of the romantic relationship but whatever the reasons the symptoms of stress are showing they are there plain as day your intolerance your inability to sublimate frustrations most of all your assault on your commanding officer she paused but bosch didnt say anything he had a feeling she wasnt finished she wasnt there are other signs as well she continued your refusal to leave your damaged home can be perceived as a form of denial of what is happening around you there are physical symptoms have you looked at yourself in the mirror lately i dont think i need to ask to know that youre drinking too much and your hand you didnt hurt yourself with a hammer you fell asleep with a cigarette in your hand that is a burn and id bet my state license on it she opened a drawer and took out two plastic cups and a bottle of water she filled the cups and pushed one across the desk to him a peace offering he watched her silently he felt exhausted unrepairable he also couldnt help but be amazed by her at the same time she was so expertly cutting him open after she took a sip of water she continued these things are all indicative of a diagnosis of posttraumatic stress syndrome however we have one problem with that the word post when used in such a diagnosis indicates the time of stress has passed thats not the case here not in la not with your job harry you are in a nonstop pressure cooker you owe yourself some breathing room thats what this leave is all about breathing room time to recoup and recover so dont fight it grab it thats the best advice i can give you grab it and use it to save yourself bosch breathed out heavily and held up his bandaged hand you can keep your state license thank you they rested a moment until she continued in a voice meant to soothe him you also have to know you are not alone this is nothing to be embarrassed about there has been a sharp increase in incidents of officer stress in the last three years behavioral sciences services just made a request to the city council for five more psychologists our caseload went from eighteen hundred counseling sessions in to more than double that last year weve even got a name for whats going on here the blue angst and you have it harry bosch smiled and shook his head still clinging to what denial he had left the blue angst sounds like the name of a wambaugh novel doesnt it she didnt answer so what youre saying is that im not going to get my job back no im not saying that at all all i am saying is that we have a lot of work ahead of us i feel like ive been broken down by the world champ you mind if i call you sometime when im trying to get a confession out of a hump who wont talk to me believe me just saying that is a start what do you want me to do i want you to want to come here thats all dont look at it as a punishment i want you to work with me not against me when we talk i want you to talk about everything and nothing anything that comes to mind hold back nothing and one other thing im not telling you to completely cut it out but you have to cut back on the drinking you have to have a clear mind as you obviously know the effects of alcohol stay with an individual long after the night they were consumed ill try all of it ill try thats all i ask and since you suddenly seem so willing i have another thought i have a cancellation of a session tomorrow at three can you make it bosch hesitated didnt say anything we seem to finally be working well and i think it will help the sooner we get through with our work the sooner you should be able to get back to your work what do you say three yes okay ill be here good lets get back to our dialogue why dont you start whatever you want to talk about he leaned forward and reached for the cup of water he looked at her as he drank from it then put the cup back on the desk just say anything anything whatever is happening in your life or mind that you want to talk about he thought for a long moment i saw a coyote last night near my house ii was drunk i guess but i know i saw him why was that significant to you he tried to compose the proper answer im not surei guess theres not too many left in the hills in the cityleast near where i live so whenever i see one i get this feeling that it might be the last one left out there you know the last coyote and i guess that would bother me if it ever turned out to be true if i never saw one again she nodded as if he had scored some point in a game he wasnt sure how to play there used to be one that lived in the canyon below my house id see him down there and how do you know it was a he and i think you called the one you saw last night a he how are you sure im not sure i guess i dont even know its just a guess okay go on um heitlived down there below my house and i used to see him from time to time after the earthquake it was gone i dont know what happened to it then i saw this one last night something about the mist and the light out thereit looked like its coat was blue he looked hungry there is somethingtheyre kind of sad and threatening at the same time you know yes i do anyway i thought about him when i got in bed after i got home that was when i burned my hand i fell asleep with the cigarette but before i woke up i had this dream i mean i think it was a dream maybe like a daydream like i was still kind of awake and in it whatever it was the coyote was there again but it was with me and we were in the canyon or on a hill or something and i wasnt really sure he held up his hand and then i felt the fire she nodded but didnt say anything so what do you think he asked well interpretation of dreams is not something i do often frankly im not sure of its value the real value i think i see in what you just told me was the willingness to tell me it shows me a oneeightydegree turn in your approach to these sessions for what its worth i think its clear you identify with the coyote perhaps there are not many policemen like you left and you feel the same threat to your existence or your mission i dont really know but look at your own words you called them sad and threatening at the same time could that be you also he drank from his cup before answering ive been sad before but ive found comfort in it they sat in silence for a while digesting what had been said she looked at her watch we still have some time is there anything else you want to talk about maybe something related to this story he contemplated the question for a while and took out a cigarette how much time do we have as long as you want dont worry about the time i want to do this youve talked about my mission you told me to think about my mission and you said the word again just a minute ago yes he hesitated what i say here is protected right she furrowed her brow im not talking about anything illegal what i mean is whatever i tell you in here youre not going to tell people right it wont get back to irving no what you tell me stays right here thats an absolute i told you i make a single narrowly focused recommendation for or against return to duty that i give to assistant chief irving thats it he nodded hesitated again and then made his decision he would tell her well you were talking about my mission and your mission and so on and well i think ive had a mission for a long time only i didnt know it or i meani didnt accept it i didnt acknowledge it i dont know how to explain it right maybe i was afraid or something i put it off for a lot of years anyway what im telling you is that ive accepted it now im not sure im following you harry you have to come out and tell me what youre talking about he looked down at the gray rug in front of him he spoke to it because he didnt know how to say it to her face im an orphani never knew my father and my mother was murdered in hollywood when i was a kid nobodythere never was any arrest made youre looking for her killer arent you he looked up at her and nodded thats my mission right now she showed no shock on her face which in turn surprised him it was as if she expected him to say what he had just said tell me about it chapter thirteen bosch sat at his dining room table with his notebook out and the newspaper clips that keisha russell had had a times intern gather for him sitting in front of him in two separate stacks one stack for conklin stories and one for mittel stories there was a bottle of henrys on the table and through the evening he had been nursing it like cough syrup the one beer was all he would allow himself the ashtray however was loaded and there was a pall of blue smoke around the table he had placed no limit on cigarettes hinojos had said nothing about smoking shed had plenty to say about his mission though shed flatly counseled him to stop until he was better emotionally prepared to face what he might find he told her that he was too far down the road to stop then she said something that he kept thinking about as he drove home and it intruded even now you better think about this and make sure its what you want she said subconsciously or not you may have been working toward this all your life it could be the reason you are who you are a policeman a homicide investigator resolving your mothers death could also resolve your need to be a policeman it could take your drive your mission away from you you have to be prepared for that or you should turn back bosch considered what she had said to be true he knew that all his life it had been there what had happened to his mother had helped define everything he did after and it was always there in the dark recesses of his mind a promise to find out a promise to avenge it was never anything that had been spoken aloud or even thought about with much focus for to have done that was to plan and this was no part of a grand agenda still he was crowded with the feeling that what he was doing was inevitable something scheduled by an unseen hand a long time ago his mind put hinojos aside and focused on a memory he was under the surface of the water eyes open and looking up toward the light above the pool then the light was eclipsed by a figure standing above the image murky a dark angel hovering above bosch kicked off the bottom and moved toward the figure bosch picked up the bottle of beer and finished it in one pull he tried to concentrate again on the newspaper clips in front of him he had initially been surprised at how many stories there were about arno conklin prior to his ascendance to the throne of the district attorneys office but as he started to read through them he saw most of the stories were mundane dispatches from trials in which conklin was the prosecuting attorney still bosch got somewhat of a feel for the man through the cases he tried and his style as a prosecutor it was clear that his star rose both in the office and the publics eyes with a series of highly publicized cases the stories were in chronological order and the first dealt with the successful prosecution in of a woman who poisoned both her parents and then stored their bodies in trunks in the garage until neighbors complained about the smell to the police a month later conklin was quoted at length in several articles on the case one time he was described as the dashing deputy district attorney the case was one of the early forerunners of the insanity defense the woman claimed diminished capacity but judging by the number of articles there was a public furor over the case and the jury only took a half hour to convict the defendant received the death penalty and conklins place in the public arena as a champion of public safety a seeker of justice was secured there was a photo of him talking to the reporters after the verdict the papers earlier description of him had him down perfectly he was a dashing man he wore a dark threepiece suit had short blond hair and was cleanshaven he was lean and tall and had the ruddy allamerican look that actors pay surgeons thousands for arno was a star in his own right there were more stories about more murder cases in the clips after that first one conklin won every one of them and he always asked forand gotthe death penalty bosch noticed that in the stories from the later fifties he had been elevated in title to senior deputy district attorney and then by the end of the decade to assistant one of the top jobs in the office it was a meteoric rise to have taken place in only a decade there was one report on a press conference in which da john charles stock announced he was placing conklin in charge of the special investigations unit and charging him with cleaning up the myriad vice problems that threatened the social fabric of los angeles county ive always gone to arno conklin with the toughest jobs the da said and i go to him again the people of the los angeles community want a clean community and by god we will have it to those who know we are coming for you my advice is move out san francisco will have you san diego will have you but the city of angels wont have you following that there were several stories spread over a couple of years with splashy headlines about crackdowns on gambling parlors pipe dens whorehouses and the street prostitution trade conklin worked with a task force of forty cops comprised of loaners from all departments in the county hollywood was the main target of conklins commandos as the times dubbed the squad but the scourge of the law came down on wrongdoers all over the county from long beach to the desert all those who labored for the wages of sin were running scaredat least according to the newspaper articles bosch had no doubt that the vice lords conklins commandos were targeting operated business as usual and that it was only the bottom feeders the replaceable employees that were getting the hook the last conklin story in the stack was on his february announcement that he would run for the top spot in the district attorneys office on a campaign of renewed emphasis on ridding the county of the vices that threatened any great society bosch noted that part of the stately speech he delivered on the steps of the old downtown courthouse was a wellknown police philosophy that conklin or his speechwriter had apparently appropriated as original thought people sometimes say to me whats the big deal arno these are victimless crimes if a man wants to place a bet or sleep with a woman for money whats wrong with that wheres the victim well my friends ill tell you whats wrong with that and who the victim is were the victim all of us when we allow this kind of activity to occur when we simply look the other way then it weakens us all every one of us i look at it this way these socalled little crimes are each like a broken window in an abandoned house doesnt seem like a big problem right wrong if nobody fixes that window pretty soon kids come along and think nobody cares so they throw a few rocks and break a few more windows next the burglar drives down the street and sees the house and thinks nobody around there cares so he sets up shop and starts breaking into houses while the owners are at work next thing you know another miscreant comes along and steals cars right off the street and so on and so on the residents start to see their own neighborhood with different eyes then they think nobody cares anymore so why should i they wait an extra month before cutting the grass they dont tell the boys hanging on the corner to put the cigarettes out and go back to school its gradual decay my friends it happens all across this great country of ours it sneaks in like weeds in our yard well when im district attorney the weeds are coming out by the roots the story ended by reporting that conklin had chosen a young firebrand from his office to manage his campaign he said that gordon mittel would resign from the das office and begin work immediately bosch reread the story and immediately became transfixed by something that hadnt registered during his first read it was in the second paragraph for the wellknown and notpressshy conklin it will be his first run for public office the yearold bachelor and hancock park resident said he has planned the run for a long time and has the backing of retiring da john charles stock who also appeared at the press conference bosch turned the pages of his notebook back to the list of names he had written before and wrote hancock park after conklins name it wasnt much but it was a little piece of verification of katherine registers story and it was enough to get boschs juices going it made him feel that at least he had a line in the water fucking hypocrite he whispered to himself he drew a circle around conklins name in the notebook he absentmindedly kept circling it as he tried to decide what he should do next marjorie lowes last known destination was a party in hancock park according to katherine register she was more specifically going to meet conklin after she was dead conklin had called the detectives on the case to make an appointment but any record of the interview if any occurred was missing bosch knew it was all a general correlation of facts but it served to deepen and solidify the suspicion he had felt from the night he had first looked through the murder book something was not right about the case something didnt fit and the more he thought about it the more he believed conklin was the wrong piece he reached into his jacket which was on the chairback behind him and took out his small phone book he took it into the kitchen where he dialed the home line of deputy district attorney roger goff goff was a friend who shared boschs affection for the tenor saxophone theyd spent many days in court sitting side by side during trials and many nights in jazz bars side by side on stools goff was an oldline prosecutor who had been with the office nearly thirty years he had no political aspirations inside or outside of the office he just liked his job he was a rarity because he never tired of it a thousand deputies had come in burned out and gone on to corporate america during goffs watch but he stayed he now labored in the criminal courts building with prosecutors and public defenders twenty years his junior but he was still good at it and more important still had the fire in his voice when he stood before a jury and called down the outrage of god and society against those in the defendants chair his mixture of tenacity and plain fairness had made him a legend in downtown legal and law enforcement circles and he was one of the few prosecutors bosch had unconditional respect for roger harry bosch hey goddamnit how you doing im fine what are you up to watching the tube like everybody else whatre you doing nothing i was just thinking you remember gloria jeffries gloshit of course i do lets see shesyeah shes the one with the husband got quaded in the motorcycle accident right recalling the case it sounded as if he were reading it off one of his yellow tablets she got tired of caring for him so one morning hes in bed and she sits on his face until she smothers him it was about to go by as a natural but a suspicious detective named harry bosch wouldnt let it go he came up with a witness who gloria had told everything to the clincher the thing that got the jury was that she told the wit that when she smothered him it was the first orgasm the poor devil had ever been able to give her how is that for a memory damn youre good so what about her shes raising up at frontera getting ready to i was wondering if youd have time to write a letter fuck already what was that three four years ago almost five i hear shes got the book now and goes to the board next month ill write a letter but itd be good if there was one from the prosecutor too dont worry about it i got a standard in my computer all i do is change the name and the crime throw in a few of the gruesome details the basic line is that the crime was too heinous for parole to be considered at this time its a good letter ill send it out tomorrow it usually works charms good thanks you know they gotta stop giving the book to those women they all get religion when theyre coming up you ever go to one of those hearings a couple yeah sit through a half a day of them if you have the time and arent feeling particularly suicidal sometime they sent me out to frontera once when one of the manson girls was up see with the big ones like that they send a body out instead of a letter so i went out and i sat through about ten of these things waiting for my girl to come up and let me tell you everybodys quoting corinthians theyre quoting revelations matthew paul john threesixteen john this john that and it works it goddamn works these old guys on the board eat that shit up plus i guess theyre all sitting up there getting thick in their pants having all these women groveling in front of them anyway you got me started harry its your fault not mine sorry about that its okay so what else is new havent seen you in the building you got anything coming my way it was the question bosch had been waiting for goff to get to so he could nonchalantly steer the conversation toward arno conklin ah nothing much its been slow but hey let me ask you did you know arno conklin arno conklin sure i knew him he hired me what are you asking about him for nothing i was going through some old files making room in one of the cabinets and i came across some old newspapers they were pushed into the back there were some stories about him and i thought of you thought it was about when you started yeah arno tried to be a good man a little high and mighty for my taste but i think he was a decent man overall especially considering he was both a politician and a lawyer goff laughed at his own line but bosch was silent goff had used the past tense bosch felt a heavy presence push into his chest and he only realized then how strong the desire to avenge could be hes dead he closed his eyes he hoped goff wouldnt detect the urgency he had let slip into his voice oh no hes not dead i meant you know when i knew him he was a good man then hes still practicing law somewhere oh no hes an old man retired once a year they wheel him out at the annual prosecutors banquet he personally hands out the arno conklin award whats that some piece of wood with a brass plate on it that goes to the administrative prosecutor of the year if you can believe that thats the guys legacy an annual award to a socalled prosecutor who doesnt set foot inside a courtroom all year it always goes to one of the division heads i dont know how they decide which one probly whoever got his or her nose farthest up the das ass that year bosch laughed the line wasnt that funny but he was also feeling the relief of learning that conklin was still alive its not funny bosch its fucking sad administrative prosecutor whoever heard of such a thing an oxymoron like andrew and his screenplays he deals with these studio people called get this creative executives theres your classic contradiction well there you go bosch you got me going again bosch knew andrew was goffs roommate but he had never met him sorry roger anyway what do you mean they wheel him out arno well i mean they wheel him out hes in a chair i told you hes an old man last i heard he was in some fullcare retirement home one of the classy ones in park la brea i keep saying im going to see him one day thank him for hiring me way back when who knows maybe i could put in a word for that award or something funny guy you know i heard that gordon mittel used to be his frontman oh yeah he was the bulldog outside the door ran his campaigns thats how mittel got started now thats one meanim glad he got out of criminal law and into politics hed be a motherfucker to come up against in court yeah ive heard bosch said whatever youve heard you can double it you know him not now and not then i just knew to keep clear he was already out of the office by the time i came in but there were stories supposedly in those early days when arno was the heir apparent and everybody knew it there was a lot of maneuvering you know to get next to him there was one guy sinclair i think his name was that was set to run arno s campaign then one night the cleaning lady found some porno shots under his blotter there was an internal investigation and the photos proved to be stolen from another prosecutors case files sinclair was dumped he always claimed he was set up by mittel think he was yes it was mittels stylebut who knows bosch sensed that he had said and asked enough to pass it off as conversation and gossip anything further and goff might get suspicious about the call so whats the deal he asked you zipped up for the night or you want to go by the catalina i heard redmans in town to do leno id bet you the cover charge that he and branford drop by to sit in on the late set sounds tempting harry but andrews making a late dinner now and i think were just going to stay at home tonight hes counting on it you mind not at all anyway im trying not to bend the elbow so much lately i need to give it a rest now that sir is quite admirable i think you deserve a piece of wood with a brass plate on it or a shot of whiskey after hanging up bosch sat back down at the desk and wrote notes on the highlights of the conversation with goff into his notebook next he pulled the stack of clips on mittel in front of him these were more recent clips than those on conklin because mittel had not made a name for himself until much later conklin had been his first step up the ladder most of the stories were just mentions of mittel as being in attendance at various galas in beverly hills or as host of various campaign or charity dinners from the start he was a money man a man politicians and charities went to when they wanted to cast their nets into the rich enclaves of the westside he worked both sides republican democrat it didnt seem to matter his profile grew though when he started working for candidates on a larger scale the current governor was a client so too were a handful of congressman and senators from other western states a profile written several years earlierand apparently without his cooperationran under the headline the presidents main money man it said mittel had been tapped to round up california contributors for the presidents reelection war chest it said the state was one of the cornerstones of the national campaigns funding plan the story also noted the irony that mittel was a recluse in the highprofile world of politics he was a backstage man who abhorred the spotlight so much so that he had repeatedly turned down patronage jobs from those hed helped elect instead mittel elected to stay in los angeles where he was the founding partner of a powerful financial district law firm mittel anderson jennings rountree still it seemed to bosch that what this yaleeducated lawyer did had little to do with law as bosch knew it he doubted mittel had been inside a courtroom in years that made harry think of the conklin award and he smiled too bad mittel had quit the das office he mightve been in line for it someday there was a photo that ran with the profile it showed mittel at the bottom of the steps of air force one greeting the then president at lax though the article had been published years earlier bosch was nevertheless startled by how young mittel was in the photo he looked at the story again and checked the mans age doing the arithmetic he realized that currently mittel was barely sixty years old bosch pushed the newspaper clips aside and got up for a long time he stood at the sliding glass door to the deck and stared at the lights across the pass he began to consider what he knew about circumstances thirtythree years old conklin according to katherine register knew marjorie lowe it was clear from the murder book that he had somehow reached into the investigation of her death for reasons unknown his reach was then apparently covered up for reasons unknown this had occurred only three months before he announced his candidacy for district attorney and less than a year before a key figure in the investigation johnny fox died while in his political employ bosch thought that it was obvious that fox would have been known to mittel the campaign manager therefore he further concluded whatever it was that conklin did or knew it was likely that mittel his frontman and the architect of his political run had knowledge of it as well bosch went back to the table and turned to the list of names in his notebook now he picked up the pen and circled mittels name as well he felt like having another beer but he settled for a cigarette chapter fourteen in the morning bosch called the lapd personnel office and asked them to check whether eno and mckittrick were still current he doubted they were still around but knew he had to make the check it would be embarrassing if he went through a search for them only to find one or both still on the payroll the clerk checked the roll and told him no such officers were currently on the force he decided he would have to put on his harvey pounds pose after that he dialed the dmv in sacramento gave the lieutenants name and asked for ms sharp again by the tone she inflected in the single word hello after picking up the phone bosch had no doubt that she remembered him is this ms sharp thats who you asked for isnt it i did indeed then its ms sharp what can i do for you well i wanted to mend our fences so to speak i have a few more names i need drivers license addresses for and i thought that directly working with you would expedite the matter and perhaps repair our working relationship honey we dont have a working relationship hold the line please she punched the button before he could say anything the line was dead for so long that he began to believe his scam to burn pounds wasnt worth it finally a different clerk picked up and said ms sharp had instructed her to help bosch gave her poundss serial number and then the names gordon mittel arno conklin claude eno and jake mckittrick he said he needed the home addresses on their licenses he was put on hold again during the time he waited he held the phone to his ear with his shoulder and fried an egg over easy in a pan on the stove he made a sandwich out of it with two slices of white toast and cold salsa from a jar he kept in the refrigerator he ate the dripping sandwich while leaning over the sink he had just wiped his mouth and poured himself a second cup of coffee when the clerk finally picked back up sorry it took so long no problem he then remembered he was pounds and wished he hadnt said that the clerk explained that she had no addresses or license information on eno or mckittrick then gave him addresses for conklin and mittel goff had been right conklin lived in park la brea mittel lived above hollywood on hercules drive in a development called mount olympus bosch was too preoccupied at that point to continue the pounds charade he thanked the clerk without further confrontation and hung up he thought about what his next move should be eno and mckittrick were either dead or out of state he knew he could get their addresses through the departments personnel office but that might take all day he picked up the phone again and called robberyhomicide asking for detective leroy ruben ruben had put nearly forty years in on the department half of it in rhd he might know something about eno and mckittrick he might also know bosch was on stress leave ruben can i help you leroy its harry bosch what do you know not much harry enjoying the good life right away he was telling bosch he knew of his situation bosch knew now that his only alternative was to be straight with him to a point it aint bad but im not sleeping late every day no whatre you getting up for im kindve freelancing on an old case leroy thats why i called i want to try to track down a couple of old dicks thought maybe youd know of them they were out of hollywood who are they claude eno and jake mckittrick remember them eno and mckittrick noi mean yeah i think i remember mckittrick he checked outit mustve been ten fifteen years ago he went back to florida i think yeah florida he was here in rhd for a year or so at the end there the other one eno i dont remember any eno well it was worth a try ill see what i can find in florida thanks leroy hey harry what gives anyway its just an old case i had in my desk its giving me something to do while i see what happens any word not yet they got me talking to the shrink if i can talk my way past her ill get back to the table well see okay well good luck you know me and some of the boys here when we heard that story we laughed our asses off we heard about that guy pounds hes an asshole you done good kid well lets hope i didnt do so good that i lost my job ah youll be all right they send you to chinatown a few times brush you off and send you back into the ring youll be okay thanks leroy after hanging up bosch got dressed for the day putting on a fresh shirt and the same suit as the day before he headed downtown in his rented mustang and spent the next two hours in a bureaucratic maze he first went to the personnel office at parker center told a clerk what he wanted and then waited half an hour for a supervisor to tell him all over again the supervisor told him he had wasted his time and that the information he sought was at city hall he walked across the street to the city hall annex took the stairs up and then crossed on the tramway over main street into the white obelisk of city hall he took the elevator up to the finance department on nine showed his id card to another counter clerk and told her that in the interest of streamlining the process maybe he should talk to a supervisor first he waited on a plastic chair in a hallway for twenty minutes before he was ushered into a small office cramped with two desks four file cabinets and several boxes on the floor an obese woman with pale skin and black hair sideburns and the slight hint of a mustache sat behind one of the desks on her calendar blotter bosch noticed a food stain from some prior mishap there was also a reusable plastic quart soda container with a screwon top and straw on her desk a plastic name plate on the desk said mona tozzi im carlas supervisor she said you are a police officer detective he pulled the chair away from the empty desk and sat down in front of the fat woman excuse me but cassidy is probably going to need her chair when she gets back thats her desk whens she coming back anytime she went up for coffee well maybe if we hurry well be done by then and ill be out of here she gave a short whodoyouthinkyouare laugh that sounded more like a snort she said nothing ive spent the last hour and a half trying to get just a couple addresses from the city and all i get are a bunch of people who want to send me to someone else or make me wait out in the hall and whats funny about that is that i work for the city myself and im trying to do a job for the city and the city isnt giving me the time of day and you know my shrink tells me ive got this posttraumatic stress stuff and should take life easier but mona i gotta tell you im getting pretty fucking frustrated with this she stared at him a moment probably wondering if she could possibly make it out the door if he decided to go nuts on her she then pursed her lips which served to change her mustache from a hint to an announcement and took a hard pull on the straw of her soda container bosch saw a liquid the color of blood go up through the straw into her mouth she cleared her throat before talking in a comforting tone tell you what detective why dont you tell me what it is you are trying to find bosch put on his hopeful face great i knew there was somebody who cared i need to get the addresses where pension checks for two different retired officers are sent each month her eyebrows mated as she frowned im sorry but those addresses are strictly confidential even within the city i couldnt give mona let me explain something im a homicide investigator like you i work for the city i have leads on an old unsolved murder that i am following up on i need to confer with the original case detectives were talking about a case more than thirty years old a woman was killed mona i cant find the two detectives that originally worked the case and the police personnel people sent me over here i need the pension addresses are you going to help me detectiveis it borsch bosch detective bosch let me explain something to you just because you work for the city does not give you access to confidential files i work for the city but i dont go over to parker center and say let me see this or let me see that people have a right to privacy now this is what i can do and it is all i can do if you give me the two names i will send a letter to each person asking them to call you that way you get your information i protect the files would that work for you theyll go out in the mail today i promise she smiled but it was the phoniest smile bosch had seen in days no that wouldnt work at all mona you know im really disappointed i cant help that but you can dont you see i have work to do detective if you want me to send the letter give me the names if not thats your decision he nodded that he understood and brought his briefcase up from the floor to his lap he saw her jump when he angrily unsnapped the locks he opened it and took out his phone he flipped it open and dialed his home number then waited for the machine to pick up mona looked annoyed what are you doing he held his hand up for silence yes can you transfer me to whitey springer he said to his tape he watched her reaction while acting like he wasnt he could tell she knew the name springer was the city hall columnist for the times his specialty was writing about the small bureaucratic nightmares the little guy against the system bureaucrats could largely create these nightmares with impunity thanks to civil service protections but politicians read springers column and they wielded tremendous power when it came to patronage jobs transfers and demotions at city hall a bureaucrat vilified in print by springer might be safe in his or her job but there likely would never be advancement and there was nothing stopping a city council member from calling for an audit on an office or a council observer to sit in the corner the word to the wise was to stay out of springers column everybody knew that including mona yeah i can hold bosch said into the phone then to mona he said hes gonna love this one hes got a guy trying to solve a murder the victims family waiting for thirtythree years to know who killed her and some bureaucrat sitting in her office sucking on a quart of fruit punch isnt giving him the addresses he needs just to talk to the other cops who worked the case im not a newspaper man but i think thats a column hell love it what do you think he smiled and watched her face flush almost as red as her fruit punch he knew it was going to work okay hang up the phone she said what why hang up hang up and ill get the information bosch flipped the phone closed give me the names he gave her the names and she got up angrily and silently to leave the room she could barely fit around the desk but made the maneuver like a ballerina the pattern instilled in her bodys memory by repeated practice how long will this take he asked as long as it takes she answered regaining some of her bureaucratic bluster at the door no mona you got ten minutes thats all after that you better not come back cause whiteys gonna be sitting here waiting for you she stopped and looked at him he winked after she left he got up and went around the side of the desk he pushed it about two inches closer to the opposite wall narrowing her path back to her chair she was back in seven minutes carrying a piece of paper but bosch could see it was trouble she had a triumphant look on her face he thought of that woman who had been tried a while back for cutting off her husbands penis maybe it was the same face she had when she ran out the door with it well detective borsch youve got a little problem what is it she started around the desk and immediately rammed her thick thigh into its formicatopped corner it looked more embarrassing than painful she had to flail her arms for balance and the impact of the collision shook the desk and knocked her container over the red liquid began leaking out of the straw onto the blotter shit she quickly moved the rest of the way around the desk and righted the container before sitting down she looked at the desk suspicious that it had been moved are you all right bosch asked what is the problem with the addresses she ignored his first question forgot her embarrassment and looked at bosch and smiled she sat down she spoke as she opened a desk drawer and took out a wad of napkins stolen from the cafeteria well the problem is you wont be talking to former detective claude eno anytime soon at least i dont think you will hes dead she started wiping up the spill yes the checks go to his widow what about mckittrick now mckittrick is a possibility i have his address here hes over in venice venice so whats the problem with that thats venice florida she smiled delighted with herself florida bosch repeated he had no idea there was a venice in florida its a state over on the other side of the country i know where it is oh and one other thing the address i have is only a po box sorry about that yeah i bet what about a phone she tossed the wet napkins into a trash can in the corner of the room we have no phone number try information i will does it say there when he retired you didnt ask me to get that then give me what youve got bosch knew he could get more that theyd have to have a phone number somewhere but he was handicapped because this was an unauthorized investigation if he pushed things too far then hed only succeed in having his activities discovered and then halted she floated the paper across the desk to him he looked at it it had two addresses on it the po box for mckittrick and the street address in las vegas for enos widow her name was olive bosch thought of something when do the checks go out funny you should ask why because todays the last day of the month they always go out the last day of the month that was a break and he felt like he deserved it that he had worked for it he picked up the paper she had given him and slipped it into his briefcase then he stood up always a pleasure to do work with the public servants of the city likewise and uh detective could you return the chair to the place you found it as i said cassidy will need it of course mona pardon my forgetfulness chapter fifteen a fter the bout with bureaucratic claustrophobia bosch decided he needed some air to recover he took the elevator down to the lobby and out the main doors to spring street as he walked out he was directed by a security officer to walk down the right side of the widestaired entrance to the great building because there was a film location shoot taking place on the left side bosch watched what they were doing as he stepped down the stairs and then decided to take a break and have a smoke he sat down on one of the concrete sidings along the stairs and lit a cigarette the film shoot involved a group of actors posing as reporters who rushed down the stairs of city hall to meet and question two men getting out of a car at the curb they rehearsed it twice and then shot it twice while bosch sat there and smoked two cigarettes each time the reporters all yelled the same thing at the two men mr barrs mr barrs did you do it did you do it the two men refused to answer and pushed through the pack and up the stairs with the reporters backtracking on one of the takes one of the reporters stumbled as he moved backwards fell on his back on the stairs and was partially trampled by the others the director kept the scene going perhaps thinking that the fall added a touch of realism to the scene bosch figured that the filmmakers were using the steps and front facade of city hall as a courthouse setting the men coming from the car were the defendant and his highpriced lawyer he knew that city hall was frequently used for such shots because it actually looked more like a courthouse than any real courthouse in the city bosch was bored after the second take though he guessed there would be many more he got up and walked down to first and then over to los angeles street he took that back to parker center along the way he was asked for spare change only four times which he thought was a low count for downtown and possibly a sign of improving economic times in the lobby of the police building he passed the bank of pay phones and on a whim stopped picked one of the phones off the hook and dialed he had dealt with metrodade police in miami several times over the years and was the only florida area code that readily came to mind when the operator came on he asked for venice and she informed him that was the proper area code he then redialed and got information in venice first he asked the operator what the nearest large city to venice was she told him that was sarasota and he asked what the nearest large city was to that when she said st petersburg he finally started getting his bearings he knew where st petersburg was on a mapthe west coast of floridabecause he knew the dodgers occasionally played spring training games there and he had looked it up once he finally gave the operator mckittricks name and promptly got a tape recording saying the number was unlisted at the customers request he wondered if any of the detectives he had dealt with by phone at metrodade could get the number for him he still had no idea exactly where venice was or how far it was from miami then he decided to leave it alone mckittrick had taken steps to make it difficult to be contacted he used a po box and had an unlisted phone bosch didnt know why a retired cop would take such steps in a state three thousand miles away from where he had worked but he felt sure that the best approach to mckittrick was going to have to be in person a telephone call even if bosch got the number was easy to avoid someone standing right at your door was different besides bosch had caught a break he knew mckittricks pension check was in the mail to his po box he was sure he could use it to find the old cop he clipped his id card to his suit and went up to the scientific investigation division he told the woman behind the counter that he had to talk to someone in latent prints and pushed through the half door and down the hall to the print lab like he always did without waiting for her goahead the lab was a large room with two rows of work tables with overhead fluorescent lights at the end of the room were two desks with afis computer terminals on them behind them was a glasswalled room with the mainframes inside there was condensation on the glass because the mainframe room was kept cooler than the rest of the lab because it was lunchtime there was only one technician in the lab and bosch didnt know him he was tempted to turn around and come back later when someone else might be there but the tech looked up from one of the computer terminals and saw him he was a tall skinny man with glasses and a face that had been ravaged by acne when he was younger the damage gave him a permanently sullen expression yes yeah hi howya doin im doing fine what can i do for you harry bosch hollywood division he put out his hand and the other man hesitated then shook it tentatively brad hirsch yeah i think ive heard your name weve never worked together but that probably wont last i work homicide so it seems i basically get around to working with everybody in here eventually probably bosch sat down on a chair to the side of the computer module and pulled his briefcase onto his lap he noticed that hirsch was looking into his blue computer screen he seemed more comfortable looking there than at bosch reason im here is at the moment its kind of slow out in tinseltown and so ive been going through some old cases i came across this one from nineteen sixtyone nineteen sixtyone yeah its old a femalecause of death blunt force trauma then he made it look like a strangulation a sex crime anyway nobody was ever popped for it it never went anywhere in fact i dont think anyones really looked at it since the due diligence in sixtytwo a long time anyway the thing is the reason im here is that back then the cops on this pulled a decent set of prints at the crime scene they got a bunch of partials and some full rounds and ive got them here bosch took the yellowed print card out of the briefcase and held it out to the man hirsch looked at it but didnt take it he looked back at the computer screen and bosch placed the print card down on the keyboard in front of him and well as you know that was before we had these fancy computers and all of this technology you got here all they did with this back then was use it to compare these to a suspects prints they got no match they let the guy go and then they just shoved these in an envelope theyve been sitting in the case file ever since so what i was thinking was we could you want to run them through afis yeah right you know take a shot at it spin the dice maybe we get lucky and pick up a hitchhiker on the information highway its happened before edgar and burns out on the hollywood table nailed an old one this week with an afis run i was talking to edgar and he said one of you guys down herei think it was donovansaid the computer has access to millions of prints from all across the country hirsch nodded unenthusiastically and thats not just criminal print files right bosch asked youve got military law enforcement civil service everything that right yes thats right but look detective bosch we harry okay harry this is a great tool thats getting better all the time youre correct about that but there still are human and time elements here the comparison prints have to be scanned and coded and then those codes have to be entered into the computer and right now we have a backup thats running twelve days he pointed to the wall above the computer there was a sign with changeable numbers on it like the signs in the union office that said x number of days since the last death in the line of duty automated fingerprint identification system search requests will take days to process no exception so you see we cant take everybody who walks in here and put them at the front of the pack okay now if you want to fill out a search request form i can look i know there are exceptions especially in homicide cases somebody made that run for burns and edgar the other day they didnt wait twelve days they were put through right away and they cleared three homicides just like that bosch snapped his fingers hirsch looked at him and then back to the computer yes there are exceptions but that comes from on high if you want to talk to captain levalley maybe shell approve it if you burns and edgar didnt talk to her somebody just did it for them well then that was against the rules they must have known somebody who did it for them well i know you hirsch why dont you just fill out a request and ill see what i mean whats it take ten minutes no in your case much longer this print card you have is an antique its obsolete id have to run it through the livescan machine which would then assign codes to the prints then id have to handenter the codes it gives me then depending on the restrictions on the run you want it could take i dont want any restrictions i want it compared to all data bases then the computer time can run as long as thirty forty minutes with a finger hirsch punched his glasses back up his nose as if punctuating his resolve not to break the rules well brad bosch said the problem is i dont know how much time ive got on this certainly not twelve days no way im working on it now because i have the time but the next time i get a fresh call that will be it ill be off it thats the nature of homicide you know so are you sure there isnt something we can do right now hirsch didnt move he just stared at the blue screen it reminded bosch of the youth hall when kids would literally shut down like a computer on standby when the bullies taunted them what are you doing now hirsch we could do it right now hirsch looked at him for a long moment before talking im busy and look bosch i know who you are okay thats an interesting story about pulling old cases but i know its a lie i know youre on a stress leave the storys getting around and you shouldnt even be here and i shouldnt be talking to you so could you please leave me alone i dont want to get into trouble i dont want people to get the wrong idea you know bosch looked at him but hirschs eyes had moved back onto the computer screen okay hirsch let me tell you a real story one i really dont want any more stories bosch why dont you just im going to tell you this story then im leaving okay just this one story okay bosch okay you tell the story bosch looked at him silently and waited for hirsch to make eye contact but the latent print technicians eyes remained on the computer screen as if it were his security blanket bosch told the story anyway one time a long time ago i was almost twelve and im swimming in this pool you see and im under the water but ive got my eyes open and i look up and i see up through the water up to the edge of the pool i see this dark figure you know it was hard to figure out what it was all wavy and all but i could tell it was a man and there wasnt supposed to be a man up there so i came up for air at the side of the pool and i was right it was a man he was wearing this dark suit and he reached down and grabbed me by the wrist i was just a scrawny little runt it was easy for him to do he pulled me out and he gave me this towel to put on my shoulders and he led me over to a chair and he told mehe told me that my mother was dead murdered he said they didnt know who did it but whoever he was he left his fingerprints he said dont worry son we got the fingerprints and theyre as good as gold well get him i remember those words exactly well get him only they never did and now im going to thats my story hirsch hirschs eyes dropped down to the yellowed print card on the keyboard look man its a bad story but i cant be doing this im sorry bosch stared at him a moment and then slowly stood up dont forget the card hirsch said he picked it up and held it up to bosch ill leave it here youre going to do the right thing hirsch i can tell no dont i cant do im leaving it here the power of his voice shocked even bosch and it seemed to have scared hirsch the print tech replaced the card on the keyboard after a few seconds of silence bosch leaned down and spoke quietly everybody wants the chance to do the right thing hirsch it makes them feel good inside even if doing it doesnt exactly fit inside the rules sometimes you have to rely on the voice inside that tells you what to do bosch stood back up and took out his wallet and a pen he pulled out a business card and wrote some numbers on it he put it down on the keyboard next to the print card thats got my portable and my home on it dont bother calling the office you know i wont be there ill be waiting to hear from you hirsch he walked slowly out of the lab chapter sixteen waiting for the elevator bosch guessed that his effort to persuade hirsch had fallen on deaf ears hirsch was the type of guy whose exterior scars masked deeper interior wounds there were a lot in the department like him hirsch had grown up intimidated by his own face hed probably be the last person to dare go outside the bounds of his job or the rules another department automaton for him doing the right thing was ignoring bosch or turning him in he punched at the elevator button with his finger again and contemplated what else he could do the afis search was a long shot but he still wanted it done it was a loose end and any thorough investigation took care of loose ends he decided he would give hirsch a day and then hed make another run at him if that didnt work hed try another tech hed try them all until he got the killers prints into that machine the elevator finally opened and he squeezed on that was one of the only things you could rely on inside parker center cops would come and go chiefs even political power structures but the elevators would always move slowly and always be crowded when they got to you bosch pushed the unlighted button marked b as the doors slowly closed and the square room started to descend while everyone stood and stared blankly at the lighted numbers over the door bosch looked down at his briefcase no one in the small space spoke until as the car slowed to its next stop bosch heard his first name spoken from behind he turned his head slightly not sure if it had been someone speaking to him or the name had been directed toward someone else his eyes fell on assistant chief irvin s irving standing in the rear of the elevator they exchanged nods just as the doors opened on the first floor bosch wondered if irving had seen him push the button for the basement there was no reason for a man on involuntary stress leave to be going to the basement bosch decided the car was too crowded for irving to have seen what button he had pushed he stepped off the elevator into the alcove off the main lobby and irving followed him out and caught up with him chief what brings you all the way in harry it was said casually but the question signaled that there was more than passing interest from irving they started walking toward the exit bosch quickly putting a story together i have to go over to chinatown anyway so i dropped by to go to payroll i wanted to see about them sending my check to my house instead of out to hollywood since im not sure when ill be back irving nodded and bosch was pretty sure he had bought it he was about boschs size but had the standout feature of a completely shaved head that feature and his reputation for intolerance for corrupt cops got him the nickname within the department of mr clean youre in chinatown today i thought you were monday wednesday friday that was the schedule i approved yes thats the schedule but she had an opening come up today and wanted me to come in well im glad to hear you being so cooperative what happened to your hand oh this bosch held up his hand as if it were someone elses that he had just noticed at the end of his arm ive been using some of my free time to do some work around the house and i cut it on a piece of broken glass im still doing cleanup from the quake i see bosch guessed that he didnt buy that one but he didnt really care im getting a quick lunch in the federal plaza irving said you want to come along thanks just the same chief i already ate okay well take care of yourself i mean that i will thanks irving started off and then stopped you know were handling this situation with you a little differently because i hope to get you back in there at hollywood homicide without any change in grade or position im waiting to hear from dr hinojos but i understand it will be a few more weeks at least thats what she tells me you know if youre willing to do it an apology in the form of a letter to lieutenant pounds could be beneficial when push comes to shove im going to have to sell him on letting you back in there that will be the hard part i think getting you a clean bill from the doctor wont be a problem i can simply issue the order and lieutenant pounds will have to accept it but that wont ease the pressure there i would rather work it that he accepts your return and everybodys happy well i heard he alreadys got a replacement for me pounds he paired my partner with somebody off autos doesnt sound to me like hes expecting or planning on me coming back chief well thats news to me ill talk to him about that what do you think about this letter it could go a long way toward helping your situation bosch hesitated before answering he knew irving wanted to help him the two of them shared an unspoken bond once they had been complete enemies in the department but contempt had eroded into a truce which now was more a line of wary mutual respect ill think about the letter chief bosch finally said ill let you know very well you know harry pride gets in the way of a lot of the right decisions dont let that happen to you ill think about it bosch watched him bound off around the fountain memorial to officers killed in the line of duty he watched until irving got to temple and started to cross los angeles street to the federal plaza where there was an array of fastfood emporiums then bosch figured it was safe and turned to go back inside he skipped waiting for the elevator again and went down the stairs to the basement most of the underground floor of parker center was taken up by the evidence storage division there were a few other offices like the fugitives division but it was generally a quiet floor bosch found no pedestrian traffic on the long yellow linoleum hallway and was able to get to the steel double doors of esd without running into anyone else he knew the police department held physical evidence on investigations that had not yet gone to the district attorney or city attorney for filing once that happened the evidence usually stayed with the prosecutors office essentially that made esd the citys temple of failure what was behind the steel doors bosch opened was the physical evidence from thousands of unsolved crimes crimes that had never resulted in prosecution it even smelled of failure because it was in the basement of the building there was a damp odor here that bosch always believed was the rank stink of neglect and decay of hopelessness bosch stepped into a small room that was essentially a wiremesh cage there was another door on the other side but there was a sign on it that said esd staff only there were two windows cut in the mesh one was closed and a uniform officer sat behind the other working on a crossword puzzle between the two windows was another sign that said do not store loaded firearms bosch walked up to the open window and leaned on the counter the officer looked up after filling in a word on the puzzle bosch saw the name tag on his uniform said nelson nelson read boschs id card so bosch didnt have to bother to introduce himself either it worked out nicely heronhow you say that hieronymus rhymes with anonymous hieronymus isnt there a rock and roll band named that maybe what can i do for you hieronymus from hollywood i got a question shoot bosch put the pink evidence check slip on the counter i want to pull the box on this case its pretty old would it still be around anywhere the cop took the slip looked at it and whistled when he saw the year while writing the case number down on a request log he said should be here dont see why not nothing gets tossed you know you want to look at the black dahlia case we got that thats what fiftysomething years old we got em going back even further if it aint solved its here he looked up at bosch and winked be right back why dont you fill out the form nelson pointed with his pen out the window to a counter on the back wall where the standard request forms were he got up and disappeared from the window bosch heard him yell to someone else in the back charlie hey charlee a voice from somewhere in the back yelled a response that was unintelligible take the window nelson called back im taking the time machine bosch had heard about the time machine it was a golf cart they used to get back to the deep recesses of the storage facility the older the case the farther back in time it went the farther away it was from the front windows the time machine got the window cops back there bosch walked over to the counter and filled out a request form then reached in the window and put it on the crossword puzzle while he was waiting he looked around and noticed another sign on the back wall narcotics evidence not released without form bosch had no idea what that form was somebody came through the steel doors then carrying a murder book a detective but bosch didnt recognize him he opened it on the counter got a case number and then filled out a form he then went to the window there was no sign of charlie after a few minutes the detective turned to bosch anybody working back there yeah one guy went to get me a box he told another guy to watch i dont know where he is shit he rapped sharply with his knuckles on the counter in a few minutes another uniform cop came to the window he was an old horse with white hair and a pear shape bosch guessed hed been working in the basement for years his skin was as white as a vampires he took the other detectives evidence request slip and was gone then both bosch and the other detective were left waiting bosch could tell the other man had started looking at him but was acting like he wasnt youre bosch right he finally asked from hollywood bosch nodded the other man put out his hand and smiled tom north pacific weve never met no bosch shook his hand but didnt act enthusiastic about the introduction we never met but listen i worked devonshire burglary for six years before i got my homicide gig in pacific know who my co was up there back then bosch shook his head he didnt know and he didnt care but north didnt seem to realize that pounds lieutenant harvey ninetyeight pounds the fuck he was my co so anyway i heard through the network you know what you did to his ass put his face right through the fuckin window thats great man fuckin great more power to you i laughed my ass off when i heard that well im glad it entertained you no really i know youre getting piped for it i heard about that too but i just wanted to let you know you made my day and a lot of people are with you man thanks so what are you doing down here i heard they had you on the fiftyonefifty list it annoyed bosch to realize that there were those in the department whom he didnt even know who knew what had happened to him and what his situation was he tried to keep calm listen i bosch you gotta box it was the time traveler nelson he was at the window pushing a light blue box through the opening it was about the size of a boot box and was held closed with red tape that was cracking with age it looked like the box was powdered with dust bosch didnt bother finishing his sentence he waved off north and went to the box sign here nelson said he put a yellow slip down on top of the box it kicked up a small dust cloud which he waved away with his hand bosch signed the paper and took the box in two hands he turned and saw north looking at him north just nodded once he seemed to know it wasnt the right time to ask questions bosch nodded back and headed to the door uh bosch north said i didnt mean anything about what i said about the list no offense okay bosch stared at him as he pushed through the door with his back but he didnt say anything he then proceeded down the hall carrying the box with two hands as if it contained something precious chapter seventeen carmen hinojos was in her waiting room when bosch got there a few minutes late she ushered him in and waved off his apology for lateness as if it was unnecessary she wore a dark blue suit and as he passed her in the doorway he smelled a light soapy fragrance he took the seat on the right side of the desk near the window again hinojos smiled and bosch wondered why there were two chairs on the other side of the desk from her so far in three meetings he had taken the same one each time the one closest to the window he wondered if she had taken note of this and what if anything it meant are you tired she asked you dont look like you got much sleep last night i guess i didnt but im fine have you changed your mind about anything we discussed yesterday no not really you are continuing this private investigation for now she nodded in a way that told him she expected his reply i want to talk about your mother today why its got nothing to do with why im here why im on leave i think its important i think it will help us get to what is happening with you what has made you take on this private investigation of yours it might explain a lot about your recent actions i doubt it what do you want to know when you spoke yesterday you made several references to her lifestyle but you never really came out and said what she did what she was thinking about it after the session i was wondering if you have trouble accepting what she was to the point of not being able to say she was a prostitute there i said it she was a prostitute im a grown man doctor i accept the truth i accept the truth in anything as long as its the truth i think youre going far afield here perhaps what do you feel about her now what do you mean anger hatred love i dont think about it certainly not hate i loved her at the time after she was gone that didnt change what about abandonment im too old for that what about back then back when it happened bosch thought a moment im sure there was some of that her lifestyle her line of work got her killed and i was left behind the fence i guess i was mad about that and felt abandoned i was also hurt the hurt was the worst part she loved me what do you mean left behind the fence i told you yesterday i was in mcclaren the youth hall right so her death prevented you from leaving there correct for a while how long i was there on and off until i was sixteen i lived a few months two different times with some fosters but i always got sent back then when i was sixteen another couple took me i was with them until i was seventeen i found out later that they kept getting the dpss checks for a year after id split dpss department of public social services now they call it the division of youth services anyway when you took a kid into your home as foster parents you got a monthly support payment a lot of people took kids in just for those checks im not saying these people did but they never told dpss i wasnt in their home anymore after i left i understand where were you vietnam wait a minute lets go back you said that two different times before this you lived with foster parents but were then sent back what happened why were you sent back i dont know they didnt like me they said it wasnt working out i went back into the dorms behind the fence and waited i think getting rid of a teenage boy was about as easy as selling a car with no wheels the fosters always wanted the younger ones did you ever run away from the hall a couple times i always got caught in hollywood if placing teenagers was so difficult how did it happen to you the third time when you were even older sixteen bosch laughed falsely and shook his head youll get a kick out of this i was chosen by this guy and his wife because i was lefthanded lefthanded i dont follow i was a lefty and i could throw a pretty good fastball what do you mean ah jesus it wassee sandy koufax was with the dodgers then he was a lefty and i guess they were paying him about a zillion bucks a year to pitch this guy the foster his name was earl morse he had played semipro baseball or something and never really made it so he wanted to create a lefthanded major league prospect good lefthanders were pretty rare back then i guess or he thought that anyway they were the hot commodity earl thought hed grab some kid with some potential slap him into shape and then be his manager or agent or something when it came to contract time he saw it as his way back into the game it was crazy but i guess hed seen his own big league dream crash and burn so he came out to mcclaren and took a bunch of us into the field for a catch we had a team we played other halls sometimes the schools in the valley let us play them anyway earl took us out to throw the ball around and it was a tryout but none of us knew it at the time it didnt even enter my mind what was going on until later anyway he glommed on to me when he saw i was a lefty and could throw he forgot the others like they were last seasons program bosch shook his head again at the memory what happened you went with him yeah i went with him there was a wife too she never said much to me or him he used to make me throw a hundred balls a day at a tire hanging in the back yard then every night hed have these coaching sessions i put up with it for about a year and then i split you ran away sort of i joined the army i had to get earl to sign for me though at first he wouldnt do it he had major league plans for me but then i told him i was never going to pick up another baseball as long as i lived he signed then he and the wife kept cashing those dpss checks while i was overseas i guess the extra money helped make up for losing the prospect she was quiet for a long time it looked to bosch like she was reading her notes but he had not seen her write anything during this session you know he said into the silence about ten years later when i was still in patrol i pulled over a drunk driver coming off the hollywood freeway onto sunset he was all over the place when i finally got him over and got up there to the window i bent over to look in and it was earl it was a sunday he was coming home from the dodgers i saw the program on the seat she looked at him but didnt say anything he was looking at the memory still i guess hed never found that lefty he was looking foranyway he was so drunk he didnt recognize me what did you do took his keys and called his wifei guess it was the only break i ever gave the guy she looked back down at the pad while asking her next question what about your real father what about him did you ever know who he was did you have any relationship at all i met him once i was never curious about it until i came back from overseas then i traced it down turned out he was my mothers lawyer he had a family and all of that he was dying when i met him looked like a skeletonso i never really knew him his name was bosch no my name was just something she came up with the painter you know she thought la was a lot like his paintings all the paranoia the fear once she gave me a book that had his paintings in it more silence followed as she thought about this one too these stories harry she finally said these stories that you tell are heartbreaking in their own way it makes me see the boy who became the man it makes me see the depth of the hole left by your mothers death you know you would have a lot to blame her for and no one would blame you for doing it he looked at her pointedly while composing a response i dont blame her for anything i blame the man who took her from me see these are stories about me not her you cant get the feel for her you cant know her like i did all i know is that she did all she could to get me out of there she never stopped telling me that she never stopped trying she just ran out of time she nodded accepting his answer a few moments passed did there come a time when she told you what she didfor a living not really how did you know i cant remember i think i really didnt know for sure what she did until she was gone and i was older i was ten when they took me away i didnt really know why did she have men stay with her while you were together no that never happened but you must have had some idea about this life she was leading that you both were leading she told me she was a waitress she worked nights she used to leave me with a lady who had a room at the hotel mrs detorre she watched four or five kids whose mothers were doing the same thing none of us knew he finished there but she didnt say anything and he knew he was expected to continue one night i snuck out when the old lady fell asleep and i walked down to the boulevard to the coffee shop where she said she worked she wasnt in there i asked and they didnt know what i was talking about did you ask your mother about it nothe next night i followed her she left in her waitress uniform and i followed her she went to her best friends place upstairs meredith roman when they came out they were both wearing dresses makeup the whole thing then they both left in a cab and i couldnt follow them but you knew i knew something but i was like nine or something how much could i know what about the charade she followed dressing every night like a waitress did that anger you no the opposite i thought that wasi dont know there was something noble about her doing that for me she was protecting me in a way hinojos nodded that she saw his point close your eyes close my eyes yes i want you to close your eyes and think back to when you were a boy go ahead what is this indulge me please bosch shook his head as if annoyed but did as she asked he felt stupid okay okay i want you to tell me a story about your mother whatever image or episode with her that you have the clearest in your mind i want you to tell it to me he thought hard images of her passed through and disappeared finally he came to one that stayed okay okay tell it it was at mcclaren she had come to visit and we were out at the fence at the ballfield why do you remember this story i dont know because she was there and that always made me feel good even though we always ended up crying you should have seen that place on visiting day everybody cryingand i remember it too because it was near the end it wasnt too long after that she was gone maybe a few months do you remember what you talked about a lot of stuff baseball she was a dodgers fan i remember one of the older kids had taken my new sneakers that she had given me for my birthday she noticed i didnt have em on and she got pretty mad about it why did the older boy take your sneakers she asked the same thing what did you tell her i told her the kid took my shoes because he could you see they could call that place whatever they wanted but basically it was a prison for kids and it had the same societies as a prison has your dominant cliques your submissives everything what were you i dont know i pretty much kept to myself but when some older bigger kid took my shoes i was a submissive it was a way of surviving your mother was unhappy about this well yeah but she didnt know the score she wanted to go complain or something she didnt know that if she did that it would only make it worse for me there then she suddenly did realize what the deal was she started crying bosch was silent picturing the scene perfectly in his mind he remembered the dampness in the air and the smell of the orange blossoms from the nearby groves hinojos cleared her throat before breaking into his memory what did you do when she started crying i probably started crying too i usually did i didnt want her to feel bad but there was a comfort in knowing she knew what was happening to me only mothers can do that you know make you feel good when youre sad bosch still had his eyes closed and was seeing only the memory what did she tell you sheshe just told me she was going to get me out she said that her lawyer was going to go to court soon to appeal the custody ruling and the unfit mother finding she said there were other things she could do too the point was she was getting me out that lawyer was your father yes but i didnt know itanyway what im saying is that the courts were wrong about her thats the thing that bothers me she was good to me and they didnt see thatanyway i remember she promised me that she would do what she had to do but she would get me out but she never did no like i said she ran out of time im sorry bosch opened his eyes and looked at her so am i chapter eighteen bosch had parked in a public lot off hill street it cost him twelve dollars for his car he then got onto the and headed north toward the hills as he drove he occasionally looked over at the blue box on the seat next to him but he didnt open it he knew that he had to but he would wait for home he turned the radio on and listened as the dj introduced a song by abbey lincoln bosch had never heard it before but he immediately liked the words and the womans smoky voice bird alone flying high flying through a clouded sky sending mournful soulful sounds soaring over troubled grounds after he got to woodrow wilson and followed his usual routine of parking a half block away from his home bosch brought the box inside and placed it on the dining room table he lit a cigarette and paced the room looking down occasionally at the box he knew what was in it he had the evidence list from the murder book but he couldnt overcome a feeling that by opening the box he was invading some secret privacy committing a sin that he didnt understand finally he took his keys out there was a small pen knife on the ring and he used it to slice through the red tape that sealed the box he put the knife down and without thinking about it any further lifted the top off the box the victims clothes and other belongings were wrapped individually in plastic bags which bosch took out of the box one by one and placed on the table the clear plastic was yellowed but he could see through it he did not remove anything from the bags but instead just held each piece of evidence up and studied it in its sterile covering he opened the murder book to the evidence list and made sure nothing was missing it was all there he held the small bag containing the gold earrings up to the light they were like frozen tear drops he put the bag back down and at the bottom of the box he saw the blouse folded neatly in plastic the spot of blood exactly where the evidence sheet said it was on the left breast about two inches from the center button bosch ran his finger over the plastic where the spot was it was then that he realized something there was no other blood he knew that it was the thing that had bothered him as he read the murder book but he had been unable to get ahold of the thought then now he had it the blood no blood on the undergarments the skirt or the stockings or pumps only on the blouse bosch also knew the autopsy had described a body with no lacerations then where had the blood come from he wanted to look at the crime scene and autopsy photos but knew that he couldnt there was no way he would open that envelope bosch pulled the bag containing the blouse from the box and read the evidence tag and other markings nowhere did it mention or give any reference code for any analysis ever being done on the blood this invigorated him there was a good chance that the blood spot came from the killer not the victim he had no idea whether blood that old could still be typed or even submitted for dna analysis but he intended to find out the problem he knew was comparison it didnt matter if the blood could still be analyzed if there was nothing to compare it to to get blood from conklin or mittel or anyone for that matter he would need a court order and to get that he needed evidence not just suspicions and hunches he had gathered the evidence bags together to replace in the box when he stopped to study one he had not considered closely before it contained the belt that had been used to strangle the victim bosch studied it a few moments as if it were a snake he was trying to identify before cautiously reaching into the box and picking it up he could see the evidence tag tied through one of the belt holes on the smooth silver sea shell buckle there was black powder he could see that part of the ridge lines from a thumbprint were still there he held the belt up to the light it pained him to look at it but he did the belt was an inch in width made of black leather the sea shell buckle was the largest ornamentation but smaller silver shells were attached along its length looking at it brought back the memory he hadnt really chosen it meredith roman had taken him to the may co on wilshire she had seen the belt on a rack with many others and told him his mother would like it she paid for it and allowed him to give it to his mother as a birthday present meredith had been right his mother wore the belt often including every time she visited him after the court took him away and including the night she was murdered bosch read the evidence tag but all it said was the case number and mckittricks name on the tongue he noticed that the second and fourth holes were imperfect circles distended by the spoke of the buckle during wear he guessed that maybe his mother wore it tighter at times maybe to impress someone or looser at times over bulkier clothing he now knew everything about the belt except who had used it last to kill her he realized then that whoever had held this belt this weapon before the police had been responsible for taking a life and indelibly changing his own he carefully replaced it in the box and put the other clothing in on top of it he then put the lid back on top bosch couldnt stay in the house after that he felt he had to get out he didnt bother changing his clothes he just got in the mustang and started driving it was dark now and he took cahuenga down into hollywood he told himself he didnt know or care where he was going but that was a lie he knew when he got to hollywood boulevard he turned east the car took him to vista where he turned north and then cut into the first alley the headlights sliced through the darkness and he saw a small homeless encampment a man and woman huddled under a cardboard leanto two other bodies wrapped in blankets and newspapers lay nearby a small glow from dying flames came from the rim of a trash can bosch cruised by slowly his eyes further down the alley to the spot he knew from the crime scene drawing that was in the murder book the hollywood souvenir store was now an adult book and video store there was an alley entrance for shy customers and several cars were parked alongside the rear of the building bosch stopped near the door and killed the lights he just sat in the car feeling no need to get out he had never been to the alley to the spot before he just wanted to sit and watch and feel for a few moments he lit a cigarette and watched as a man carrying a bag walked quickly out the door of the adult shop to a car parked at the end of the alley bosch thought about a time when he was a small boy and still with his mother theyd had a small apartment on camrose then and during the summer theyd sit in the back courtyard on the nights she wasnt working or on sunday afternoons and listen to the music coming over the hill from the hollywood bowl the sound was bad attacked by traffic and the white noise of the city before it got to them but the high notes were clear what he liked about it wasnt the music but that she was there it was their time together she always told him that she would take him one day to the bowl to hear scheherazade it was her favorite they never got the chance the court took him away from her and she was dead before she could get him back bosch finally heard the philharmonic perform scheherazade the year he spent with sylvia when she saw tears welling in the corners of his eyes she thought it was because of the pure beauty of the music he never got around to telling her it was something else a blur of motion caught his attention and someone banged a fist on the drivers side window boschs left hand instinctively went under his jacket to his waist but there was no gun there he turned and looked into the face of an old woman whose years were etched like hash marks on her face it looked like she was wearing three sets of clothes when she was done knocking on the window she opened her palm and held it out still startled bosch quickly reached into his pocket and pulled out a five he started the car so he could put the window down and handed the money out to her she said nothing she just took it and walked away bosch watched her go and wondered how had she ended up in this alley how had he bosch drove out of the alley and back out to hollywood boulevard he started cruising again at first aimlessly but soon he found his purpose he wasnt yet ready to confront conklin or mittel but he knew where they were and he wanted to see their homes their lives the places they had ended up he stayed on the boulevard until alvarado and then took that down to third where he started west the drive took him from the third world poverty of the area known as little salvador past the faded mansions of hancock park and then to park la brea a huge complex of apartments condominiums and attendant rest homes bosch found ogden drive and cruised slowly down it until he saw the park la brea lifecare center theres another irony he thought lifecare the only thing the place probably cared about was when you were going to die so your space could be sold to the next one it was a nondescript twelvestory building of concrete and glass through the glass facade of the lobby bosch could see a security guard at a post in this town even the elderly and infirm werent safe he glanced up the front of the building and saw most of the windows were dark only nine oclock and the place was already dead someone honked at him from behind and he sped up and away thinking about conklin and what his life might be like he wondered if the old man in his room up there ever gave a thought to marjorie lowe after so many years boschs next stop was mount olympus the gaudy outcropping of modern romanstyle homes above hollywood the look was supposed to be neoclassical but he had heard it referred to more than once as neocrassical the huge expensive homes were jammed side by side as close as teeth there were ornate columns and statues but the only thing that seemed classic about most of the place was the kitsch bosch took mount olympus drive off laurel canyon turned on electra and then went to hercules he was driving slowly looking for addresses on curbs to match the one he had written in his notebook that morning when he found mittels house he stopped on the street stunned it was a house that he knew he had never been inside it of course but everyone knew it it was a circular mansion that sat atop one of the most recognizable promontories in the hollywood hills bosch looked at the place with awe imagining its interior size and its exterior oceantomountain views its rounded walls lit from the outside with white lights it looked like a spaceship that had alighted on a mountaintop and was poised to take to the air once again classic kitsch it wasnt this was a home that bespoke its owners power and influence an iron gate guarded a long driveway that went up a hill to the house but tonight the gate was open and bosch could see several cars and at least three limousines parked along one side of the drive other cars were parked in the circle at the top it only dawned on bosch that there was a party underway at the house when a red blur passed the car window and the door was suddenly sprung open bosch turned and looked into the face of a swarthy latino man in a white shirt and red vest good evening sir we will take your car here if you could walk up the drive on the left side the greeters will find you bosch stared at the man unmoving thinking sir bosch tentatively stepped out of the mustang and the man in the vest gave him a slip of paper with a number on it he then slipped into the car and drove away bosch stood there aware that he was about to let events control him something he knew he should avoid he hesitated and looked back at the tail lights of the mustang gliding away he let the temptation take him bosch fastened his top button and pulled his tie back into place as he walked up the driveway he passed a small army of men in red vests and as he came all the way up past the limousines a startling view of the lighted city came into view he stopped and just looked for a moment he could see from the moonlit pacific in one direction to the towers of downtown in the other the view alone was worth the price of the house no matter how many millions that was the sound of soft music laughter and conversation came from his left he followed it down a stone path that curved along the form of the house the dropoff to the houses down the hill was steep and deadly he finally came to a flat yard that was lighted and full of people milling about beneath a tent as white as the moon bosch guessed there were at least a hundred and fifty welldressed people sipping cocktails and taking small hors doeuvres off trays carried by young women wearing short black dresses sheer stockings and white aprons he wondered where the red vests were putting all the cars bosch immediately felt underdressed and was sure he would be identified in seconds as a gatecrasher but there was something so otherworldly about the scene that he held his ground a surfer in a suit approached him he was about twentyfive with short sunbleached hair and a dark tan he wore a customfitted suit that looked as if it had cost more than every piece of clothing bosch owned combined it was light brown but the wearer probably described it as cocoa he smiled the way enemies smile yes sir how are we doing tonight im doing fine i dont know about you yet the surfer in a suit smiled a little more brightly at that im mr johnson and im providing security for the benefit tonight might i inquire if you brought your invitation with you bosch hesitated for only a moment oh im sorry i didnt realize i needed to bring that along i didnt think gordon would need security at a benefit like this he hoped dropping mittels first name would give the surfer pause before he did anything rash the surfer frowned for only a moment then could i ask you just to sign in for me of course bosch was led to a table to the side of the entrance area taped across the front of it was a red white and blue banner that said robert shepherd now it told bosch all he needed to know about the affair there was a guest registry on the table and a woman sat behind it in a black crushedvelvet cocktail dress that did little to camouflage her breasts mr johnson seemed more intent on these two items than on bosch as he signed the name harvey pounds in the registry as he signed bosch noticed a stack of pledge cards and a champagne goblet filled with pencils on the table he picked up an information sheet and started to read about the unannounced candidate johnson finally pulled his eyes away from the table hostess and checked the name bosch had written thank you mr pounds enjoy yourself he disappeared into the crowd then probably to check on whether a harvey pounds was on the list of invitees bosch decided hed stay a few minutes see if he could spot mittel and then leave before the surfer came looking for him he stepped away from the entrance and out from beneath the tent after crossing a short lawn to a retainer wall he tried to act like he was just enjoying the view and it was a view the only higher one would have been from a jet coming in to lax but on the jet you wouldnt have the breadth of vision the cool breeze or the sounds from the city below bosch turned around and looked back at the crowd under the tent he studied the faces but could not spot gordon mittel there was no sign of him there was a large knot of people beneath the center of the tent and bosch realized that it was a grouping of people trying to reach their hands toward the unannounced candidate or at least the man bosch assumed was shepherd harry noticed that while the crowd seemed to exhibit solidarity in terms of wealth it cut across all age lines he guessed that many were there to see mittel as much as shepherd one of the women in blackandwhite came out from under the white canopy and toward him with a tray of champagne glasses he took one thanked her and turned back to the view he sipped at it and supposed that it was top quality but he wouldnt be able to tell the difference he decided he should gulp it and go when a voice from his left interrupted wonderful view isnt it better than a movie i could stand here for hours bosch turned his head to acknowledge the speaker but didnt look at him he didnt want to get involved yeah its nice but ill take the mountains i have really where is that the other side of the hill on woodrow wilson oh yes there are some very nice properties there not mine bosch thought unless you like neoearthquake classic the san gabriels are brilliant in the sun the conversationalist said i looked there but then i bought here bosch turned he was looking at gordon mittel the host put out his hand gordon mittel bosch hesitated but then figured mittel was used to people losing a step or stuttering in his presence harvey pounds bosch said taking his hand mittel was wearing a black tuxedo he was as overdressed for the crowd as bosch was underdressed his gray hair was cropped short and he had a smooth machine tan he was as trim and tight as a rubber band stretched around a stack of hundreds and looked at least five to ten years younger than he was glad to meet you glad you could come he said did you meet robert yet no hes kind of in the middle of the pack there yes thats true well hell be happy to meet you when he gets the chance i guess hell be happy to take my check as well that too mittel smiled seriously though i hope you can help us out hes a good man and we need people like him in office his smile seemed so phony that harry wondered if mittel had already pegged him as a crasher bosch smiled back and patted the right breast of his jacket ive got the checkbook right here doing that bosch remembered what he really had in his pocket and got an idea the champagne though only a single glass had emboldened him he suddenly realized he wanted to spook mittel and maybe get a look at his real colors tell me he said is shepherd the one i dont quite follow is he going all the way to the white house someday is he the one thats going to take you mittel sloughed off a frown or maybe it was a glimmer of annoyance i guess we shall see weve got to get him into the senate first thats the important thing bosch nodded and made a show of scanning the crowd well it looks like you have the right people here but you know i dont see arno conklin are you still tight with him he was your first wasnt he mittels forehead creased with a deep furrow well mittel seemed to be uncomfortable but then it quickly passed to tell the truth we havent spoken in a long time hes retired now an old man in a wheelchair do you know arno never spoken to him in my life then tell me what prompts a question about ancient history bosch hiked his shoulders i guess im just a student of history thats all what do you do for a living mr pounds or are you a fulltime student im in law we have something in common then i doubt it im a stanford man how about you bosch thought a moment vietnam mittel frowned again and bosch saw the interest go out of his eyes like water down a drain well i tell you i ought to mingle a little more watch the champagne and if you decide you dont want to drive one of the boys on the driveway can get you home ask for manuel the one in the red vest uh yes one of them bosch held up his glass dont worry this is only my third mittel nodded and disappeared back into the crowd bosch watched him cross beneath the tent stop to shake a few hands but eventually make it to the house he entered through a wall of french doors into what looked like a living room or some sort of viewing area mittel walked to a couch and bent down to speak quietly to a man in a suit this man looked to be about the same age as mittel but with a harder appearance he had a sharp face and though sitting clearly had a much heavier body as a younger man he had probably used his strength not his brain mittel straightened up and the other man just nodded mittel then disappeared into the further recesses of his house bosch finished his glass of champagne and started moving through the crowd under the tent toward the house as he got near the french doors one of the blackandwhite women asked if he needed help finding something he said he was looking for the bathroom and she directed him to another door to the left he went where he was told and found the door was locked he waited for a few moments and the door finally opened emitting a man and a woman they giggled when they saw bosch waiting and headed back to the tent inside the bathroom bosch opened his jacket and took a folded piece of paper from the inside pocket on the left it was the photocopy of the johnny fox story that keisha russell had given him he unfolded it and took out a pen he circled the names johnny fox arno conklin and gordon mittel then under the story wrote what prior work experience got johnny the job he refolded the page twice and ran his fingers tightly over the creases then on the outside he wrote for gordon mittel only back under the tent bosch found a blackandwhite woman and gave her the folded paper you have to find mr mittel right away he told her give him this note hes waiting on it he watched her go and then made his way back out through the crowd to the signin table at the entry area he quickly bent over the guest registry and wrote his mothers name down the table hostess protested that he had already signed in this is for somebody else he said for an address he wrote hollywood and vista he left the line for a telephone number blank bosch scanned the crowd again and saw neither mittel nor the woman he had given the note to then he looked into the room beyond the french doors and mittel appeared with the note in his hand he walked slowly into the room studying it bosch could tell by the direction of his eyes that he was studying the note scribbled on the bottom even with his phony tan he seemed to bosch to go pale bosch took a step back into the entrance alcove and watched he could feel his heart beating at a quicker pace he felt like he was watching some secret play on a stage there was a look of perplexed anger on mittels face now bosch saw him hand the page to the rough man who still sat in the cushioned chair then mittel turned to the glass panels and looked out at the people under the tent he said something and bosch thought he could read his lips son of a bitch then he started talking more quickly barking orders the man on the chair rose and bosch knew instinctively that it was his cue to leave he walked quickly back out to the driveway and trotted down to the group of men in red vests he handed his valet ticket and a tendollar bill to one of them and said in spanish that he was in a great hurry still it seemed to take forever as he waited nervously bosch kept his eyes on the house waiting for the rough man to appear he had watched which direction the valet had gone for his car and he was ready to bolt that way if necessary he began to wish he had his gun whether he really needed it or not did not matter in this moment he knew it gave him a sense of security that he felt naked without the surfer in a suit appeared at the top of the driveway and strode down toward bosch at the same time bosch saw his mustang approaching he walked out into the street ready to take it the surfer got to him first hey buddy hold on a sec bosch turned from his approaching car and hit him in the jaw sending him backward onto the driveway he moaned and rolled onto his side both hands clutching his jaw bosch was sure the jaw was dislocated if not broken he shook away the pain in his hand as the mustang screeched to a stop the man in the red vest was slow in getting out bosch pulled him away from the open door and jumped in as he settled in behind the wheel he looked up the driveway and saw the rough man was now coming when he saw the surfer on the ground he started running but his steps were unsteady on the downgrade of the driveway bosch saw his heavy thighs pressing the fabric of his pants and suddenly he slipped and fell two of the red vests went to help him up but he angrily shoved them away bosch gunned the car and sped away he worked his way up to mulholland and turned east toward home he could feel adrenaline surging through him not only had he gotten away but it was clear he had struck a nerve with a hammer let mittel think about that for a while he thought let him sweat then he yelled out loud in the car though no one could hear except himself spooked ya didnt i you fuck he banged his palm triumphantly on the steering wheel chapter nineteen he dreamed of the coyote again the animal was on a mountain path where there were no homes no cars no people it was moving very quickly through the dark as if it was trying to get away but the path and place were his he knew the land and knew he would escape what it was he fled from was never clear never seen but it was there behind him in the dark and the coyote knew by instinct it must get away the phone woke bosch breaking into the dream like a knife stabbed through paper bosch pulled the pillow off his head rolled to his right and his eyes were immediately assaulted by the light of dawn he had forgotten to close the blinds he reached for the phone on the floor hold on he said he put the phone down on the bed sat up and rubbed a hand across his face he squinted at the clock it was ten minutes after seven he coughed and cleared his throat then picked the phone back up yeah detective bosch yeah its brad hirsch im sorry to call so early bosch had to think a moment brad hirsch he had no idea who it was yeah its okay he said while he continued to search his mind for the name a silence followed im the onein latents remember you hirsch yeah hirsch i remember whats up i wanted to tell you i made the afis run you wanted i came in early and ran it with another search im doing for devonshire homicide i dont think anybody will know bosch kicked his legs over the side of the bed opened a drawer in the bed table and took out a pad and a pencil he noticed that he had taken the pad from the surf and sand hotel in laguna beach he remembered he had spent a few days with sylvia there the year before yeah you made the run whatd you get well thats the thing im sorry but i got nothing bosch threw the pad back into the open drawer and threw himself backward on the bed no hits well the computer came up with two candidates i then did a visual comparison and it was no good no matches im sorry i know this case means he didnt finish you took it through all the data bases every one on our network let me ask you something all those data bases do they include das employees and lapd personnel there was silence as hirsch must have been mulling over what the question might mean you there hirsch yes the answer is yes how far back you know what i mean these bases have prints going how far back well each data base is different the lapds is extensive id say we have prints on everybody whos worked here since world war ii well that clears irving and the rest of the cops bosch thought but that didnt bother him much his sights were definitely somewhere else what about people working for the da the das office would be different hirsch said i dont think they started printing employees until the middle sixties conklin had been there during that time bosch knew but he would already have been elected da it would seem that he would not have submitted his own prints especially if he knew there was a print card in a murder book somewhere that could possibly be matched to him he thought of mittel he would have been out of the das office by the time employees prints were taken as a matter of course what about the federal base he asked what if some guy worked for a president and got the kind of clearance you need to go visit the white house would those prints be in that base yes theyd be in twice in the federal employees base and in the fbis they keep prints on record of everyone they do background investigations on if thats what you mean but remember just because somebody visits the president it doesnt mean they get printed well mittel isnt a scratch but its close bosch thought so what youre saying bosch said is that whether or not we have complete data files going back to whoever belongs to those prints i gave you hasnt been printed since then thats not one hundred percent but its close the person who left these prints probably hasnt been printedat least by any contributor to the data banks we can only reach so far with this one way or another we can pull prints on one out of about every fifty or so people in the country but i just didnt get anything this time sorry thats okay hirsch you tried well i guess ill be getting back to work now what do you want me to do with the print card bosch thought a moment he wondered if there was any other avenue to chase down tell you what can you just hold on to it ill come by the lab and pick it up when i can probably be by later today okay ill put it in an envelope for you in case im not here goodbye hey hirsch yeah it feels good dont it whats that you did the right thing you didnt get a match but you did the right thing yeah i guess he was acting like he didnt understand because he was embarrassed but he understood yeah ill see you hirsch after hanging up bosch sat on the side of the bed lit a cigarette and thought about what he was going to do with the day the news from hirsch was not good but it wasnt daunting it certainly didnt clear arno conklin it might not even have cleared gordon mittel bosch wasnt sure whether mittels work for presidents and senators would have required a fingerprint check he decided his investigation was still intact he wasnt changing any plans he thought about the night before and the wildass chance he had taken confronting mittel the way he had he smiled at his own recklessness and thought about what hinojos might make of it he knew shed say it was a symptom of his problem she wouldnt see it as a tactful way of flushing the bird from the bush he got up and started the coffee and then showered shaved and got ready for the day he took his coffee and the box of cereal from the refrigerator out to the deck leaving the sliding door open so he could hear the stereo he had kfwb news on it was cool and crisp outside but he could tell it would get warmer later blue jays were swooping in and out of the arroyo below the deck and he could see black bees the size of quarters working in the yellow flowers of the primrose jasmine there was a story on the radio about a building contractor making a fourteenmilliondollar bonus for completing the rebuilding of the freeway three months ahead of schedule the officials who gathered to announce the engineering feat likened the fallen freeway to the city itself now that it was back upright so too was the city the city was on the move again they had a lot to learn bosch thought afterward he went in and got out the yellow pages and started working the phone in the kitchen he called the major airlines shopped around and made arrangements to fly to florida but flying on one days notice the best deal he could get was still seven hundred dollars a shocking amount to him he put it on a credit card so that he could pay it off over time he also reserved a rental car at tampa international airport when he had that finished he went back out to the deck and thought about the next project he had to tackle he needed a badge for a long time he sat on the deck chair and contemplated whether he needed it for his own sense of security or because it was a bona fide necessity to his mission he knew how naked and vulnerable he had felt this week without the gun and the badge extremities he had carried on his body for more than twenty years but he had avoided the temptation to carry the backup gun that he knew was in the closet next to the front door that he could do he knew but the badge was different more so than the gun the badge was the symbol of what he was it opened doors better than any key it gave him more authority than any words than any weapon he decided the badge was a necessity if he was going to florida and was going to scam mckittrick he had to look legit he had to have a badge he knew his badge was probably in a desk drawer in assistant chief irving s irvings office there was no way he could get to it and not be discovered but he knew where there was another one that would work just as well bosch looked at his watch ninefifteen it was fortyfive minutes until the daily command meeting at hollywood station he had plenty of time chapter twenty bosch pulled into the rear parking lot of the station at five minutes after ten he was sure that pounds who was punctual about everything he did would already have gone down the front hall to the captains office with the overnight logs the meeting was held every morning and included the stations co patrol captain watch lieutenant and detective commander who was pounds they were routine affairs and never lasted longer than twenty minutes the members of the stations command staff simply drank coffee and went through the overnight reports and ongoing problems complaints or investigations of particular note bosch went in the back door by the drunk tank and then up the hallway to the detective bureau it had been a busy morning there were already four men handcuffed to benches in the hallway one of them a drug hype bosch had seen in the station before and used as an unreliable informant on occasion asked bosch for a smoke it was illegal to smoke in any cityowned building bosch lit a cigarette anyway and put it in the mans mouth because both his needlescarred arms were cuffed behind his back what is it this time harley bosch asked shit a guy leaves his grage open hes asking me to come in isnt that right tell that one to the judge as bosch walked away one of the other lockdowns yelled at him from down the hallway what about me man i need a smoke im out bosch said fuck you man yeah thats what i thought he came into the detective bureau through the rear door the first thing he did was confirm that poundss glass office was empty he was at the command meeting then he checked the coatrack up at the front and saw he was in business as he walked down the aisle formed by the separation of the investigation tables he exchanged nods with a few of the other detectives edgar was at the homicide table sitting across from his new partner who was in boschs old chair edgar heard one of the hi harry greetings and turned around harry wassup hey man just came in to get a couple things hang on a sec its hot outside bosch walked to the front of the bureau where old henry of the nod squad sat at the desk behind the counter he was working on a crossword puzzle and bosch could see several erasure marks had turned the grid gray henry howzit hanging you getting anywhere with that detective bosch bosch slipped his sport coat off and hung it on a hook on the rack next to a jacket with a gray crosshatch pattern it was on a hanger and bosch knew it belonged to pounds as he put his coat on the hook with his back to henry and the rest of the bureau he snaked his left hand inside the other coat felt for the interior pocket and then pulled out poundss badge wallet he knew it would be there pounds was a creature of habit and bosch had seen the badge wallet in the suit coat once before he put the wallet into his pants pocket and turned around as henry continued talking bosch had only a momentary tinge of hesitation at the seriousness of what he was doing taking another cops badge was a crime but bosch looked at pounds as being the reason he did not have his own badge in the inventory of his morality what pounds had done to him was equally wrong if you want to see the lieutenant hes down the hall at a meeting henry said no i dont want to see the lieutenant henry in fact dont even tell him i was here i dont want his blood pressure to go up you know im just going to get a few things and get out of here okay thats a deal i dont want him cranky either bosch didnt have to worry about anyone else in the bureau telling pounds he had been in he gave henry a friendly clasp on the shoulder as he walked behind him sealing the agreement he went back to the homicide table and as he approached burns began to rise from boschs old spot you need to get in here harry he asked bosch thought he could detect nervous energy in the other mans voice he understood his predicament and wasnt going to make it a difficult time for him yeah if you dont mind he said i figured id get my personal stuff out of there so you can move in the right way bosch came around and opened the drawer at the table there were two boxes of junior mints on top of old paperwork that had been shoved in long ago oh those are mine sorry burns said he reached in for the two boxes of candy and stood next to the table holding them like a big kid in a suit while bosch went through the paperwork it was all a show bosch took some of the paperwork and dumped it in a manila file and then pointed with his hand signaling to burns he could put his candy back be careful bob its bill careful of what ants bosch went to the bank of file cabinets that ran along the wall to the side of the table and opened one of the drawers with his business card taped to it it was three up from the bottom waisthigh and it was one he knew was almost empty with his back to the table again he pulled the badge wallet out of his pocket and put it in the drawer then with his hands in the drawer and out of sight he opened the wallet and took out the gold badge he then put it in one pocket and the wallet back in the other for good measure he pulled a file out of the drawer and closed it he turned around and looked at jerry edgar okay thats it just some personal stuff i might need anything going on nah quiet back at the coatrack bosch turned his back on the bureau again and used one hand to reach for his coat while using the other to take the badge wallet from his pocket and slip it back into poundss coat he then put his coat on said goodbye to henry and went back to the homicide table im outta here he said to edgar and burns while picking up the two files he had pulled i dont want ninetyeight to see me and throw a fit good luck boys on the way out bosch stopped and gave the hype another cigarette the lockdown who had complained before was no longer on the bench or bosch would have given him one too back in the mustang he dumped the files on the backseat and took his empty badge wallet out of his briefcase he slipped poundss badge into place next to his own id card it would work he decided as long as no one looked too closely at it the badge said lieutenant across it boschs id card identified him as a detective it was a minor discrepancy and bosch was happy with it best of all he thought there was a good chance pounds would not notice that the badge was missing for some time he rarely left the station to go to crime scenes and so rarely had to open the wallet or show his badge there was a good chance its disappearance would go unnoticed all he had to do was get it back into place when he was done with it chapter twentyone bosch ended up outside the door of carmen hinojoss office early for his afternoon session he waited until exactly threethirty and knocked she smiled as he entered her office and he noticed that the lateafternoon sun came through the window and splashed light directly across her desk he moved toward the chair he usually took but then stopped himself and sat on the chair to the left of the desk she noticed this and frowned at him as if he were a schoolboy if you think i care which chair you sit in you are wrong am i okay he got up and moved to the other chair he liked being near the window i might not be here for mondays session he said after settling in she frowned again this time more seriously why not im going away ill try to be back away what happened to your investigation its part of it im going to florida to track down one of the original investigators ones dead the other ones in florida so ive got to go to him couldnt you just call i dont want to call i dont want to give him the chance to put me off she nodded when do you leave tonight im taking a redeye to tampa harry look at you you practically look like the walking dead cant you get some sleep and take a plane in the morning no ive gotta get out there before the mail arrives whats that mean nothing its a long story anyway i wanted to ask you something i need your help she contemplated this for several seconds apparently weighing how far she wanted to go into the pool without knowing how deep it was what is it you want do you ever do any forensic work for the department she narrowed her eyes not seeing where this was going a little from time to time somebody will bring me something or maybe ask me to do a little profiling of a suspect but mostly the department uses outside contractors forensic psychiatrists who have experience with this but youve been to crime scenes actually no ive only looked at photos brought to me and worked from them perfect bosch pulled his briefcase onto his lap and opened it he took out the envelope of crime scene and autopsy photos that had been in the murder book and gently placed them on her desk those are from this case i dont want to look at them i cant look at them but i need someone to do it and tell me whats there theres probably nothing but id like another opinion the investigation these two guys did on this case waswell it was almost like there was no investigation oh harry she shook her head im not sure this is wise why me because you know what im doing and because i trust you i dont think i can trust anybody else would you trust me if there was no ethical constraint on me telling others about what weve talked about here bosch studied her face i dont know he finally said i thought so she slid the envelope to the side of the desk lets put these aside for now and go on with the session i really have to think about this okay you can take them but let me know okay i just want your feel for them as a psychiatrist and as a woman well see what do you want to talk about what is happening with the investigation is that a professional question dr hinojos or are you just curious about the case no im curious about you and im worried about you im still not convinced that what you are doing is safeeither psychologically or physically youre mucking around in the lives of powerful people and im caught in the middle i know what youre doing but am almost powerless to make you stop im afraid you tricked me tricked you you pulled me into this i bet youve wanted to show me these pictures since you told me what youre doing youre right i have but there was no trick i thought this was a place where i could talk about anything isnt that what you said okay i wasnt tricked just led down the path i shouldve seen it coming lets move on i want to talk more about the emotional aspect of what you are doing i want to know more about why finding this killer is so important to you after so many years it should be obvious make it more obvious for me i cant i cant put it into words all i know is that everything changed for me after she was gone i dont know how things would have been if she hadnt been taken away buteverything changed do you understand what youre saying and what it means youre looking at your life in two parts the first part is with her which you seem to have imbued with a happiness im sure was not always there the second part is your life after which you acknowledge has not met expectations or is in some way unsatisfactory i think youve been unhappy for a long time possibly all of that time this recent relationship you had may have been a highlight but you were still and i think have always been an unhappy man she rested a moment but bosch didnt speak he knew she wasnt done now maybe the traumas of the last few yearsboth personally for you and for your community at largehave made you take stock of yourself and i fear that you believe whether subconsciously or not that by going back and bringing some form of justice to what happened to your mother you will be righting your life and theres the problem whatever happens with this private investigation of yours its not going to change things it just cant be done youre saying that i cant blame what happened then for what i am now no listen to me harry all im saying is you are the sum of many parts not the sum of one its like dominoes several different blocks must click together for you to arrive at the end at the point you are at now you dont jump from the first domino to the last so i should just give it up just let it go im not saying that but i am finding it hard to see the emotional benefit or healing you will get from this in fact i think there is the possibility that you may do yourself more damage than repair does that make any sense bosch stood up and went to the window he stared out but didnt compute what he saw he felt the warmth of the sun on him he didnt look at her as he spoke i dont know what makes sense all i know is that on every level it seems to make sense that i do this in fact i feeli dont know what the word is maybe ashamed i feel ashamed that i havent done this long before now a lot of years have gone by and i just let them go i feel like i let her down somehowthat i let myself down thats understa remember what i told you the first day everybody counts or nobody counts well for a long time she didnt count not with this department this society not even with me i have to admit that not even with me then i opened that file this week and i could see that her death was just put away it was buried just like i had buried it somebody put the fix in because she didnt count they did it because they could and then when i think about how long ive let it goit makes me want toi dont know just hide my face or something he stopped unable to put into words what he wanted to say he looked down and noticed there were no ducks in the butcher shop window you know he said she mightve been what she was but sometimes i feel like i didnt even deserve thati guess i got what i deserved in life he stayed at the window not looking at her it was several moments before hinojos spoke i guess this is the point where i should tell you that youre being too hard on yourself but i dont think that would help much no it wouldnt could you come back here and sit down please bosch did as he was asked finally after he was seated his eyes met hers she spoke first what i want to say is that you are mixing things up putting the cart before the horse you cant take the blame because this case may have been covered up first of all you had nothing to do with that and secondly you didnt even realize that until you read through the file this week but dont you see why didnt i look at it before im not new here ive been a cop twenty years i shouldve been there before this i mean so what that i didnt know the details i knew she was killed and nothing was ever done about it that was enough look harry think about this okay on the plane over tonight just give it some thought youve engaged yourself in a noble pursuit but you have to safeguard against damaging yourself further the bottom line is that it is not worth that its not worth the toll you may have to pay not worth it theres a killer out there he thinks he made it away free for years he has thought that decades and im going to change that youre not understanding what im saying i dont want any guilty person to get away especially with murder but what i am talking about here is you you are my only concern here there is a basic rule of nature no living thing sacrifices itself or hurts itself needlessly its the will of survival and i fear the circumstances of your life may have blunted your own survival skills you may be throwing it to the wind not caring what happens to you emotionally physically in every way in this pursuit i dont want to see you hurt she took a breather he said nothing i have to say she continued quietly im very nervous about this ive never had this situation come up before and ive counseled a lot of cops in nine years here well i got bad news for you he smiled i went and crashed a party last night at mittels i think i may have spooked him at least i spooked myself shit is that some new psychiatric term im not familiar with it this isnt funny whyd you do that bosch thought a moment i dont know it was kind of a whim type of thing i was just driving by his house and there was a party it kind ofit just made me angry for some reason him having a party and my mother did you speak to him about the case no i didnt even tell him my name we just kindve sparred around for a few minutes but then i left him something remember that newspaper clip i showed you wednesday i left that for him i saw him read it i think it struck a nerve she exhaled loudly now step outside yourself and look as an uninvolved observer at what you did if you can was that a smart thing to do going there like that i already have thought about it no it wasnt smart it was a mistake hell probably warn conklin theyll both know somebodys out there coming for them theyll close ranks you see you are proving my point for me i want you to promise me you wont do anything foolish like that again i cant well then i have to tell you that a patientdoctor relationship can be broken if the therapist believes the patient is endangering himself or others i told you i was almost powerless to stop you not completely youd go to irving i will if i believe you are being reckless bosch felt anger as he realized she had ultimate control over him and what he was doing he swallowed the anger and held up his hands surrendering all right i wont go crashing any parties again no i want more than that i want you to stay away from these men that you think may have been involved what ill promise you is that i wont go to them until i have the whole thing in the bag i mean it so do i i hope so they were silent for nearly a minute after that it was a coolingoff period she turned slightly in her chair not looking at him probably thinking what to say next lets move on she finally said you understand that this whole thing this pursuit of yours has eclipsed what were supposed to be doing here i know so were prolonging my evaluation well that doesnt bother me as much anymore i need the time off the job for this other thing well as long as you are happy she said sarcastically okay then i want to go back to the incident that brought you to me the other day you were very general and very short in your description of what happened i understand why i think we were both feeling each other out at that point but we are far past that now id like a fuller story you said the other day that lieutenant pounds set things into motion thats right how first of all hes a commander of detectives who has never been a detective himself oh technically he probably spent a few months on a table somewhere along the line so hed have it on his résumé but basically hes an administrator hes what we call a robocrat a bureaucrat with a badge he doesnt know the first thing about clearing cases the only thing he knows about it is how to draw a line through the case on this little chart he keeps in his office he doesnt know the first thing about the differences between an interview and an interrogation and thats fine the department is full of people like him i say let them do their job and let me do mine the problem is pounds doesnt realize where hes good and where hes bad its led to problems before confrontations it finally led to the incident as you keep calling it what did he do he touched my suspect explain what that means when youve got a case and you bring someone in hes all yours nobody goes near him understand the wrong word the wrong question and it could spoil a case thats a cardinal rule dont touch somebody elses suspect it doesnt matter if youre a lieutenant or the damn chief you stay clear until you check first with the guys with the collar so what happened like i told you the other day my partner edgar and i brought in this suspect a woman had been killed one of these ones who puts ads in the sex tabs you can buy on the boulevard she gets called to one of those shithole motel rooms on sunset has sex with the guy and ends up stabbed to death thats the short story the stab wounds to the upper right chest the john he plays it cool though he calls the cops and says it was her knife and she tried to rob him with it he says he turned her arm and put it into her selfdefense okay so thats when me and edgar show up and right away we see some things dont fit with that story like what first of all shes a lot smaller than he is i dont see her coming at him with a knife then theres the knife itself its a serrated steak knife bout eight inches long and she had one of those little purses without a strap a clutch yeah i guess anyway that knife wouldntve fit in it so howd she bring it in as they say on the street her clothes fit tighter than the rubbers in her purse so she wasnt hiding it on her either and there was more if her purpose was to rip the guy off why have sex first why not pull the knife take his shit and go but that didnt happen his story was that they did it first then she came at him which explained why she was still naked which of course raised another question why rob the guy when youre naked where you going to run like that the guy was lying seemed obvious then we got something else in her pursethe clutchwas a piece of paper on which she had written down the motels name and the room number it was consistent with a righthanded person like i said the stab was to the upper right chest of the victim so it doesnt add up if she came at him the chances are the knife would be in her right hand if the john then turns it into her its likely the wound would be on the left side of the chest not the right bosch made a motion of pulling his right hand toward his chest showing how awkward it would be for it to stab his right side there was all kinds of stuff that wasnt right it was a downwardgrade wound also inconsistent with it being in her hand that would have been upwardgrade hinojos nodded that she understood the problem was we had no physical evidence contradicting his story nothing just our feeling that she wouldnt have done it the way he said the wound stuff wasnt enough and then in his favor was the knife it was on the bed we could see it had fingerprints in the blood i had no doubt theyd be hers thats not hard to do once shes dead so while it didnt impress me that didnt matter its what the da would think and then what a jury would think after that reasonable doubt is a big black hole that swallows cases like this we needed more so what happened its what we call a hesaidshesaid one persons word against the other but only the other is dead in this case makes it even harder we had nothing but his story so what you do in a case like that is you sweat the guy you turn him and theres a lot of ways to do it but basically you gotta break him down in the rooms we the rooms the interrogation rooms in the bureau we took this guy into a room as a witness we didnt formally arrest him we asked if hed come down said that we had to straighten a few things out about what she did and he said sure you know mr cooperative still cool we stuck him in a room and then edgar and i went down to the watch office to get some of the good coffee theyve got good coffee there one of those big urns that was donated by some restaurant that got wrecked in the quake everybody goes in there to get coffee anyway were takin our time talkin about how were going to go at this guy which one of us wanted him first and so on meantime fuckin poundsexcuse mesees the guy in the room through the little window and goes in and informs him and what do you mean informs him reads him his rights this is our goddamn witness and pounds who doesnt know what the hell hes doing thinks hes gotta go in there and give the guy the spiel he thinks like we forgot or something bosch looked at her with outrage on his face but immediately saw she didnt understand wasnt that the right thing to do she asked arent you required by law to inform people of their rights bosch struggled to contain his anger reminding himself that hinojos might work for the department but she was an outsider her perceptions of police work were likely based more on the media than on the actual reality let me give you a quick lesson on whats the law and whats real wethe copshave the deck stacked against us what miranda and all the other rules and regs amount to is that we have to take some guy we know is or at least think is guilty and basically say hey look we think you did it and the supreme court and every lawyer on the planet would advise you not to talk to us but how about it will you talk to us it just doesnt work you gotta get around that you gotta use guile and some bluffing and you gotta be sneaky the rules of the courts are like a tightrope that youre walking on you have to be very careful but there is a chance you can walk on it to get to the other side so when some asshole who doesnt know shit walks in on your guy and informs him it can pretty much ruin your whole day not to mention the case he stopped and studied her he still saw skepticism he knew then that she was just another citizen who would be scared shitless if she ever got a dose of the way things really were on the street when someone is informed thats it he said its over me and edgar came back in from coffee and the john sits there and says he thinks he wants his lawyer i said what lawyer whos talking about lawyers youre a witness not a suspect and he tells us that the lieutenant just read him his rights i dont know at that moment who i hated more pounds for blowing it or this guy for killing the girl well tell me this what would have happened if pounds had not done what he did we wouldve made friendly with the guy asked him to tell his story in as much detail as possible and hoped there would be inconsistencies when compared to what hed told the uniforms then we would have said the inconsistencies in your statements make you a suspect then we would have informed him and hopefully clubbed the shit out of him with the inconsistencies and the problems we found with the scene we would have tried and maybe succeeded in finessing a confession most of what we do is just get people to talk its not like the stuff on tv its a hundred times harder and dirtier but just like you what we do is get people to talkanyway thats my view but well never know now what couldve happened because of pounds well what did happen after you found out hed been informed i left the room and walked straight into where pounds was in his office he knew something was wrong because he stood up i remember that i asked him if hed informed my guy and when he said yes we got into it both of us screamingthen i dont really remember how it happened im not trying to deny anything i just dont remember the details i mustve grabbed him and pushed him and his face went through the glass what did you do when that happened well some of the guys came running in and pulled me out of there the station commander sent me home pounds had to go to the hospital to fix his nose iad took a statement from him and i was suspended and then irving stepped in and changed it to isl here i am what happened with the case the john never talked he got his lawyer and waited it out edgar went with what we had to the da last friday and they kicked it they said they werent going into court with a nowitness case with a few minor inconsistenciesher prints were on the knife big surprise what it came down to is that she didnt count at least not enough for them to take the chance of losing neither of them spoke for a few moments bosch guessed that she was thinking about the corollaries between this case and his mothers so what weve got he finally said is a murderer out there on the street and the guy who allowed him to go free is back behind his desk the broken glass already replaced business as usual thats our system i got mad about it and look what it got me stress leave and maybe the end of my job she cleared her throat before going into her appraisal of the story as you have set down the circumstances of what happened it is quite easy to see your rage but not the ultimate action you took have you ever heard the phrase a mad minute bosch shook his head its a way of describing a violent outburst that has its roots in several pressures on an individual it builds up and is released in a quick momentusually violently often against a target not wholly responsible for the pressure if you need me to say pounds was an innocent victim im not going to say it i dont need that i just need you to look at this situation and how it could happen i dont know shit just happens when you physically attack someone dont you feel that you lower yourself to the same level as the man who was set free not by a long shot doctor let me tell you something you can look at all parts of my life you can throw in earthquakes fires floods riots and even vietnam but when it came down to just me and pounds in that glass room none of that mattered you can call it a mad minute or whatever you want sometimes the moment is all that matters and in that moment i was doing the right thing and if these sessions are designed to make me see i did something wrong forget it irving buttonholed me the other day in the lobby and asked me to think about an apology fuck that i did the right thing she nodded adjusted herself in her seat and looked more uncomfortable than she had through his long diatribe finally she looked at her watch and he looked at his his time was up so he said i guess ive set the cause of psychotherapy back a century huh no not at all the more you know of a person and the more you know of a story the more you understand how things happen its why i enjoy my job same here have you spoken to lieutenant pounds since the incident i saw him when i dropped off the keys to my car he had it taken away i went into his office and he practically got hysterical hes a very small man and i think he knows it they usually do bosch leaned forward ready to get up and leave when he noticed the envelope she had pushed to the side of her desk what about the photos i knew youd bring that up one more time she looked at the envelope and frowned i need to think about it on several levels can i keep them while you go to florida or will you need them you can keep em chapter twentytwo at fourforty in the morning california time the air carrier landed at tampa international airport bosch leaned blearyeyed against a window in the coach cabin watching the sun rising in the florida sky for the first time as the plane taxied he took off his watch and moved the hands ahead three hours he was tempted to check into the nearest motel for some real sleep but knew he didnt have the time from the aaa map he had brought with him it looked like it was at least a twohour drive down to venice its nice to see a blue sky it was the woman next to him in the aisle seat she was leaning over toward him looking out the window herself she was in her midforties with prematurely gray hair it was almost white they had talked a bit in the early part of the flight and bosch knew she was heading back to florida rather than visiting as he was she had given la five years but had had enough she was going home bosch didnt ask who or what she was coming home to but had wondered if her hair was white when she had first landed in la five years before yeah he replied these night flights take forever no i meant the smog there is none bosch looked at her and then out the window studying the sky not yet but she was right the sky had a quality of blue he rarely saw in la it was the color of swimming pools with billowing white cumulus clouds floating like dreams in the upper atmosphere the plane cleared out slowly bosch waited until the end got up and rolled his back to relieve the tension the joints of his backbone cracked like dominoes going down he got his overnighter out of the compartment above and headed out as soon as he stepped off the plane into the jetway the humidity surrounded him like a wet towel with an incubating warmth he made it into the airconditioned terminal and decided to scratch his plan to rent a convertible a half hour later he was on the freeway crossing tampa bay in another rented mustang he had the windows up and the airconditioning on but he was sweating as his body still had not acclimated to the humidity what struck him most about florida on this first drive was its flatness for fortyfive minutes not a hillrise came in sight until he reached the concreteandsteel mountain called the skyway bridge bosch knew that the steeply graded bridge over the mouth of the bay was a replacement for one that had fallen but he drove across it fearlessly and above the speed limit after all he came from postquake los angeles where the unofficial speed limit under bridges and overpasses was on the far right side of the speedometer after the skyway the freeway merged with the and he reached venice two hours after landing cruising along the tamiami trail he found the small pastelpainted motels inviting as he struggled with fatigue but he drove on and looked for a gift shop and a pay phone he found both in the coral reef shopping plaza the tackys gifts and cards store wasnt due to open until ten and bosch had five minutes to waste he went to a pay phone on the outside wall of the sandcolored plaza and looked up the post office in the book there were two in town so bosch took out his notebook and checked jake mckittricks zip code he called one of the post offices listed in the book and learned that the other one catered to the zip code bosch had he thanked the clerk who had provided the information and hung up when the gift shop opened bosch went to the cards aisle and found a birthday card that came with a bright red envelope he took it to the counter without even reading the inside or the outside of the card he picked a local street map out of a display next to the cash register and put that on the counter as well thats a nice card said the old woman who rang up the sale im sure shell just love it she moved as if she were underwater and bosch wanted to reach over the counter and punch in the numbers himself just to get it going in the mustang bosch put the card in the envelope without signing it sealed it and wrote mckittricks name and post office box number on the front he then started the car and got back on the road it took him fifteen minutes working with the map to find the post office on west venice avenue when he got inside he found it largely deserted an old man was standing at a table slowly writing an address on an envelope two elderly women were in line for counter service bosch stood behind them and realized that he was seeing a lot of senior citizens in florida and hed only been here a few hours it was just like he had always heard bosch looked around and saw the video camera on the wall behind the counter he could tell by its positioning it was there more for recording customers and possible robbers than for surveilling the clerks though their workstations were probably fully in view as well he was undeterred he took a tendollar bill out of his pocket folded it cleanly and held it with the red envelope he then checked his loose change and came up with the right amount it seemed like an excruciatingly long time as the one clerk waited on the women next in line it was bosch he walked up to the counter where the clerk waited he was about sixty and had a perfect white beard he was overweight and his skin seemed too red to bosch as if he was mad or something i need a stamp for this bosch put down the change and the envelope the tendollar bill was folded on top of it the postman acted like he didnt see it i was wondering did they put the mail out yet in the boxes theyre back there doin it now he handed bosch a stamp and swiped the change off the counter he didnt touch the ten or the red envelope oh really bosch picked up the envelope licked the stamp and put it on he then put the envelope back down on top of the ten he was sure the postman had observed this well jeez i really wanted to get this to my uncle jake its his birthday today any way somebody could run it back there that way hed get it when he came in today id deliver it in person but ive got to get back to work bosch slid the envelope with the ten underneath it across the counter closer to white beard well he said ill see what i can do the postman shifted his body to the left and turned slightly shielding the transaction from the video camera in one fluid motion he took the envelope and the ten off the counter he quickly transferred the ten to his other hand and it dove for cover in his pocket be right back he called to the people still in line out in the lobby bosch found box and looked through the tiny pane of glass inside the red envelope was there along with two white letters one of the white envelopes was upside down and its return address was partially visible city of departm po bo los ang bosch felt reasonably sure the envelope carried mckittricks pension check he had beaten the mail to him he walked out of the post office bought two cups of coffee and a box of doughnuts in the convenience store next door and then returned to the mustang to wait in the days growing heat it wasnt even may yet he couldnt imagine what a summer must be like here bored with watching the post office door after an hour bosch turned on the radio and found it tuned to a channel featuring a southern evangelical ranter it took several seconds before harry realized that the speakers subject was the los angeles earthquake he decided not to change the station and ah ask is it a coincidence that this cataclysmic calamity was centered in the very heart of the indstry that poeloots this entarh nation with the smut of poneography i think not i believe the lahd struck a mighty blow to the infidels engaged in this vile and multiebillyondollah trade when he cracked the uth asundah it is a sign mah frens a sign of things that ah to come a sign that all is not right in bosch turned it off a woman had just come out of the post office holding a red envelope among other pieces of mail bosch watched her cross the parking lot to a silver lincoln town car bosch instinctively jotted the plate number down though he had no law enforcement contact in this part of the state who would run it for him the woman was in her midsixties bosch guessed he had been waiting for a man but her age made her fit he started the mustang and waited for her to pull out she drove north on the main highway toward sarasota traffic moved slowly after about fifteen minutes and maybe two miles the town car took a left on vamo road and then almost immediately took a right on a private road camouflaged by tall trees and green growth bosch was only ten seconds behind her as he came up to the drive he slowed but didnt turn in he saw a sign set back in the trees welcome to pelican cove condominium homes dockage the town car passed by a guard shack with a redandwhitestriped gate arm coming down behind it shit bosch hadnt anticipated anything like a gated community he assumed that such things were rare outside of los angeles he looked at the sign again then turned around and headed out to the main road he remembered seeing another shopping plaza right before he had turned on to vamo there were eight homes in pelican cove listed in the for sale section of the sarasota heraldtribune but only three were for sale by owner bosch went to a pay phone in the plaza and called the first one he got a tape on the second call the woman who answered said her husband was golfing for the day and she felt uncomfortable showing the property without him on the third call the woman who answered invited bosch to come over right away and even said shed have fresh lemonade prepared when he got there bosch felt a momentary pang of guilt about taking advantage of a stranger who was just trying to sell her home but it passed quickly as he considered that the woman would never know she had been used in such a way and he had no other alternative for getting to mckittrick after he was cleared at the gate and got directions to the lemonade ladys unit bosch drove through the densely wooded complex looking for the silver town car it didnt take him long to see that the complex was mostly a retirement community he passed several elderly people in cars or on walks almost all of them with white hair and skin browned by the sun he quickly found the town car checked his location against the map given to him at the guard shack and was about to make a cursory visit to the lemonade lady to avoid suspicion but then he saw another silver town car it was a popular car with the older set he guessed he took out his notebook and checked the plate number he had written down neither car had been the one he had followed earlier he drove on and finally found the right town car in a secluded spot in the far reaches of the complex it was parked in front of a twostory building of dark wood siding surrounded by oak and paper trees it looked to bosch as if there were six units in the building easy enough he thought he consulted the map and got back on course to the lemonade lady she was on the second floor of a building on the other side of the complex youre young she said when she answered the door bosch wanted to say the same thing back to her but held his tongue she looked like she was in her mid to late thirties which put her three decades behind anyone bosch had seen around the complex so far she had an attractive and evenly tanned face framed in brown shoulderlength hair she wore blue jeans a blue oxford shirt and a black vest with a colorful pattern in the front she didnt bother with much makeup which bosch liked she had serious green eyes which he also didnt disagree with im jasmine are you mr bosch yes harry i just called that was quick i was nearby she invited him in and started the rundown its three bedrooms like the paper said master suite has a private bath second bath off the main hall the view is what makes the place though she pointed bosch toward a wall of sliding glass doors that looked out on a wide expanse of water dotted with mangrove islands hundreds of birds perched in the branches of these otherwise untouched islands she was right the view was beautiful what is that bosch asked the water thatsyoure not from around here are you thats little sarasota bay bosch nodded while computing the mistake he had made by blurting out the question no im not from around here im thinking of moving here though where from los angeles oh yes ive heard a lot of people are bailing out because the ground wont stop shaking something like that she led him down a hallway to what must have been the master suite bosch was immediately struck by how the room didnt seem to fit this woman it was all dark and old and heavy a mahogany bureau that looked like it weighed a ton matching bedside tables with ornate lamps and brocaded shades the place smelled old it couldnt be where she slept he turned and noticed on the wall next to the door an oil painting that was a portrait of the woman standing next to him it was a younger likeness of her the face much gaunter more severe bosch was wondering what kind of person hangs a painting of herself in her bedroom when he noticed that the painting was signed the artists name was jazz jazz is that you yes my father insisted on hanging that in here i actually should have taken it down she went to the wall and began to lift the painting off your father he moved to the other side of the painting to help her yes i gave this to him a long time ago at the time i was thankful he didnt hang it out in the living room where his friends would see it but even here is a little too much she turned the painting so the back faced outward and leaned it against the wall bosch put together what she had been saying this is your fathers place oh yes ive just been staying here while the ad ran in the paper you want to check out the master bath it has a jacuzzi tub that wasnt mentioned in the ad bosch moved closely by her to the bathroom door he looked down at her hands a natural instinct and saw no rings on any of her fingers he could smell her as he passed and the scent he picked up was the same as her name jasmine he was beginning to feel some kind of attraction to her but wasnt sure if it was the titillation of being there under false pretenses or an honest pull he was exhausted he knew and decided that was it his defenses were down he gave the bathroom a quick onceover and stepped out nice did he live here alone my father yes alone my mother died when i was little my father passed away over christmas im sorry thank you what else can i tell you nothing i was just curious about who had been living here no i mean what else can i tell you about the condo oh inothing its very nice im still in the lookingaround stage i guess not sure what im going to do i what are you really doing excuse me what are you doing here mr bosch youre not looking to buy a condo in here youre not even looking at the place there was no anger in her voice it was a voice full of the confidence she had in reading people bosch felt himself turning red he had been found out im justim just here to look at places it was a terribly weak comeback and he knew it but it was all he could think of to say she sensed his predicament and let him off the hook well im sorry if i embarrassed you do you want to see the rest of the place yesuh well did you say it was three bedrooms thats really too big for what im looking for yes three but it said that in the newspaper ad too luckily bosch knew he probably couldnt get any redder than he already was oh he said i mustve missed that uh thanks for the tour though its a very nice place he moved quickly through the living room toward the door as he opened it he looked back at her she spoke before he could say anything something tells me its a good story whats that whatever it is youre doing if you ever feel like telling it the numbers in the paper but you already know that bosch nodded he was speechless he stepped through the door and closed it behind him chapter twentythree by the time he drove back to where he had seen the town car his face had returned to its normal color but he still felt embarrassed about being cornered by the woman he tried to dismiss it and concentrate on the task at hand he parked and went to the firstfloor door that was nearest the town car and knocked eventually an old woman opened the door and stared at him with frightened eyes one hand clasped the handle of a small twowheeled cart that carried an oxygen bottle two clear plastic tubes snaked over her ears and across both cheeks to her nose im sorry to disturb you he said quickly i was looking for the mckittricks she raised a frail hand formed a fist with the thumb out and jerked it up toward the ceiling her eyes went up that way too upstairs she nodded he thanked her and headed for the stairs the woman who had picked up the red envelope answered the next door he knocked on and bosch exhaled as if he had spent a lifetime looking for her it almost felt that way mrs mckittrick yes bosch pulled out his badge case and flipped it open he held the wallet so that his first two fingers crossed most of the badge obscuring the lieutenant my names harry bosch im a detective with the lapd i was wondering if your husband was here id like to talk to him an immediate concern clouded her face lapd he hasnt been out there in twenty years its about an old case i was sent out to ask him about it well you couldve called we didnt have a number is he here no hes down with the boat hes going fishing wheres that maybe i can catch him well he doesnt like surprises i guess it will be a surprise whether you tell him or i tell him doesnt make any difference to me i just have to talk to him mrs mckittrick maybe she was used to the nodebate tone that cops can put into their voice she gave in you walk around the building here and go straight back past the next three buildings go left youll see the docks after that wheres his boat its slip six it says trophy in big letters on the side you cant miss it he hasnt left yet because im supposed to bring his lunch down thanks he had started away from the door to the side of the building when she called after him detective bosch are you going to be a while should i make you a sandwich too i dont know how long ill be but that would be nice of you as he headed toward the docks he realized that the woman named jasmine had never offered him the lemonade she had promised chapter twentyfour it took bosch fifteen minutes to find the little inlet where the docks were after that mckittrick was easy enough to spot there were maybe forty boats in slips but only one of them was occupied a man with a deep tan set off by his white hair stood in the stern bending over the outboard engine bosch studied him as he got closer but saw nothing recognizable about the man he did not fit with the image bosch had in his minds eye of the man who had pulled him from the pool so long ago the cover was off the boat engine and the man was doing something with a screwdriver he wore khaki shorts and a white golf shirt that was too old and stained for golf but was fine for boating the boat was about twenty feet long bosch guessed and had a small cabin near the bow where the helm was there were fishing rods erected in holders along the sides of the boat two rods per side bosch stopped on the dock at the bow of the boat on purpose he wanted to be at a distance from mckittrick when he showed the badge he smiled never thought id see somebody from the hollywood homicide table so far away from home he said mckittrick looked up but showed no surprise he showed nothing nope youre wrong this is home when i was over there thats when i was far away bosch gave a thatsfairenough nod and showed the badge he held it the same way as when hed showed it to mckittricks wife im harry bosch from hollywood homicide yeah thats what i heard bosch was the one who showed surprise he could not think of who in la would have tipped mckittrick to his arrival no one knew he had only told hinojos and he could not fathom that she would betray him mckittrick relieved him by gesturing to the portable phone on the dashboard of the boat the wife called oh so whats this all about detective bosch when i used to work there we did things in pairs it was safer that way you folks that understaffed youre going singleton not really my partners chasing down another old case these are such long shots theyre not wasting money sending two i assume youre going to explain that yeah as a matter of fact i am mind if i come down there suit yourself im fixing to shove off as soon as the wife comes with the food bosch began walking along the finger dock to the side of mckittricks boat he then stepped down into the craft it wobbled on the water with the added weight but then steadied mckittrick lifted the engine cover and began snapping it back in place bosch felt grossly out of place he wore street shoes with black jeans an army green tshirt and a black lightweight sport jacket and he was still hot he took the jacket off and folded it over one of the two chairs in the cockpit what are you going for whatevers biting what are you going for he looked directly at bosch when he asked this and harry saw that his eyes were brown like beerbottle glass well you heard about the earthquake didnt you sure who didnt you know ive been through quakes and canes and you can keep the quakes at least with a hurricane you see it coming you take andrew he left a lot of devastation but think how much it woulda been if nobody knew he was about to hit thats what you get with your earthquakes it took bosch a few moments to place andrew the hurricane that had slammed the south florida coast a couple of years earlier it was hard to keep track of all the disasters in the world there were enough just in la he looked out across the inlet he saw a fish jump and its reentry create a stampede of jumping among the others in the school he looked at mckittrick and was about to tell him when he realized it was probably something mckittrick saw every day of his life whend you leave la twentyone years ago i got my twenty in and pffft i was gone you can have la bosch shit i was out there for the sylmar quake in seventyone knocked down a hospital and a couple freeways at the time we were living in tujunga a few miles from the epicenter ill always remember that one it was like god and the devil meetin in the room and you were there with em playin referee goddamnso whats the quake got to do with you being here well its kind of a strange phenomenon but the murder rates fallen off people are being more civil i guess we maybe theres nothing left there worth killing for maybe anyway were usually running seventy eighty murders a year in the division i dont know what it was like when you wed do less than half that easy well were running way below the average this year its given us time to go back through some of the old ones everybody on the tables taken a share one of the ones ive got has your name on it i guess you know your partner from back then passed away and enos dead goddamn i didnt know that i thought i wouldve heard about that not that it wouldve mattered a whole hell of a lot yeah hes dead his wife gets the pension checks sorry you hadnt heard thats okay eno and mewell we were partners thats about it anyway im here because youre alive and he isnt whats the case marjorie lowe he waited a moment for a reaction from mckittricks face and got none you remember it she was found in the trash in an alley off vista behind hollywood boulevard between vista and gower i remember them all bosch cleared or not i remember every goddamn one of them but you dont remember me bosch thought but didnt say yeah thats the one between vista and gower what about it it was never cleared i know that mckittrick said his voice rising i worked sixtythree cases during seven years on the homicide table i worked hollywood wilshire then rhd cleared fiftysix ill put that up against anybody today theyre lucky if they clear half of em ill put it up against you blind and youd win thats a good record this isnt about you jake its about the case dont call me jake i dont know you never seen you before in my life iwait a minute bosch stared at him astonished that he might actually remember the pool but then he realized that mckittrick had stopped because of his wifes approach along the dock she was carrying a plastic cooler mckittrick waited silently for her to put it down on the dock near the boat and he hoisted it aboard oh detective bosch youll be way too hot in that mrs mckittrick said do you want to come back up and borrow a pair of jakes shorts and a white tshirt bosch looked at mckittrick then up at her no thanks maam im fine you are going fishing arent you well i havent exactly been invited and i oh jake invite him fishing youre always looking for somebody to go out with you besides you can catch up on all that bloodandguts stuff you used to love in hollywood mckittrick looked up at her and bosch could see the horses fighting against the restraints he was able to get it under control mary thanks for the sandwiches he said calmly now could you go back up to the house and leave us be she threw him a frown and shook her head as if he were a spoiled boy she went back the way she had come without another word the two of them left on the boat let some time go by before bosch finally spoke and tried to recover the situation look im not here for any reason other than to ask you a few questions about this case im not trying to suggest there was anything wrong with the way it was handled im just taking another look at it thats all you left something out whats that that youre full of shit bosch could feel the horses rearing up in himself he was angry at this mans questioning his motives even though he was right to do so he was on the verge of shedding the niceguy skin and going at him but he knew better he knew that for mckittrick to act this way there must be a reason something about the old case was like a pebble in his shoe he had worked it over to the side where it didnt hurt when he walked but it was still in there bosch had to make him want to take it out he swallowed his own anger and tried to stay level why am i full of shit he said mckittricks back was to him the former cop was reaching down under the steering console bosch couldnt see what he was trying to do except he guessed he was maybe looking for a hidden set of boat keys why are you full of shit mckittrick answered as he turned around ill tell you why because you come here flashing that bullshit badge around when we both know you dont have a badge mckittrick was pointing a beretta twentytwo at bosch it was small but it would do the job at this distance and bosch had to believe that mckittrick knew how to use it jesus man whats the problem with you i had no problem until you showed up bosch held his hands chesthigh in a nonthreatening pose just take it easy you take it easy put your fucking hands down i want to see that badge again take it out and toss it over here slowly bosch complied all the while trying to look around the docks without turning his head more than a few inches he didnt see anyone he was alone and unarmed he threw the badge wallet down on the deck near mckittricks feet now i want you to walk around the bridge to the bow up there stand against the bow rail where i can see you i knew somebody would try to fuck with me someday well you picked the wrong guy and the wrong day bosch did as instructed and went up to the bow he grabbed the railing for support and turned around to face his captor without taking his eyes off bosch mckittrick bent and picked up the wallet then he moved into the cockpit and put the gun down on top of the console bosch knew if he tried for it mckittrick would get there first mckittrick reached down and turned something and the engine kicked over what are you doing mckittrick oh now its mckittrick what happened to the friendly jake well whats doing is were going fishing you wanted to fish thats what well do you try to jump and ill shoot you in the water i dont care im not going anywhere just take it easy now reach down to that cleat and unhook that line throw it up on the dock when bosch had finished completing the order mckittrick picked up the gun and stepped back three paces into the stern he untied the other line and pushed off from a pylon he returned to the helm and gently put the boat in reverse it glided out of the slip mckittrick then put it in forward and they started moving through the inlet toward the mouth of the canal bosch could feel the warm salt breezes drying the sweat on his skin he decided he would jump as soon as they got to some open water or where there were other boats with people on them kind of surprised youre not carrying what kind of guy says hes a cop then doesnt carry a piece i am a cop mckittrick let me explain you dont have to boy i already know know all about you mckittrick flipped open the badge wallet and bosch watched him study the id card and the gold lieutenants badge he threw it on the console what do you know about me mckittrick dont worry i still have a few teeth left bosch and i still have a few friends in the department after the wife called i made a call one of my friends he knew all about you youre on leave bosch involuntary so i dont know about this bullshit story about earthquakes you were spinning makes me think maybe you picked up a little freelance work while youre off the job you got it wrong yeah well well see once we get out into some open water youre gonna tell me who sent you or youre gonna be fish food makes no difference to me nobody sent me i sent myself mckittrick slapped his palm against the red ball on the throttle lever and the boat surged forward its bow rose and bosch grabbed the railing to hold on bullshit mckittrick yelled above the engine noise youre a liar you lied before youre lying now listen to me bosch yelled you said you remember every case i do goddamnit i cant forget them cut it back mckittrick pulled the throttle back and the boat evened off and the noise reduced on the marjorie lowe case you pulled the dirty work you remember that remember what we call the dirty work you had to tell the next of kin you had to tell her kid out at mcclaren that was in the reports bosch so he stopped and stared at bosch for a long moment then he flipped open the badge case and read the name he looked back at bosch i remember that name the swimming pool youre the kid im the kid chapter twentyfive mckittrick let the boat drift in the shallows of little sarasota bay while bosch told the story he asked no questions he simply listened at a moment where bosch paused he opened the cooler his wife had packed and took out two beers handing one to bosch the can felt icecold in boschs hand bosch didnt pull the tab on his beer until he finished the story he had told everything he knew to mckittrick even the nonessential part about his runin with pounds he had a hunch based on mckittricks anger and bizarre behavior that he had been wrong about the old cop he had flown out to florida believing he was coming to see either a corrupt or a stupid cop and he wasnt sure which he would dislike more but now he believed that mckittrick was a man who was haunted by memories and the demons of choices made badly many years ago bosch thought that the pebble still had to come out of the shoe and that his own honesty was the best way to get to it so thats my story he said at the end i hope she packed more than two of these he popped the beer and drank nearly a third of it it tasted delicious going down his throat in the afternoon sun oh theres plenty more where that came from mckittrick replied you want a sandwich not yet no what you want is my story now thats what i came for well lets get out there to the fish he restarted the engine and they followed a trail of channel markers south through the bay bosch finally remembered he had sunglasses in the pocket of his sport coat and put them on it seemed like the wind was cutting in on him from all directions and on occasion its warmth would be traded for a cool breeze that would come up off the surface of the water it was a long time since bosch had been on a boat or had even been fishing for a man who had had a gun pointed at him twenty minutes earlier he realized he felt pretty good as the bay tapered off into a canal mckittrick pulled back on the throttle and cut their wake he waved to a man on the bridge of a giant yacht tied up outside a waterside restaurant bosch couldnt tell if he knew the man or was just being neighborly take it on a line even with the lantern on the bridge mckittrick said what take it mckittrick stepped away from the wheel and into the stern of the boat bosch quickly stepped behind the wheel sighted the red lantern hanging at center point beneath the span of a drawbridge a half mile ahead and adjusted the wheel to bring the boat into line he looked back and saw mckittrick pull a plastic bag of small dead fish out of a compartment in the deck lets see who weve got here today he said he went to the side of the boat and leaned well over the gunwale bosch saw him start slapping an open palm on the side of the boat mckittrick then stood up surveyed the water for about ten seconds and repeated the banging whats going on bosch asked just as he said it a dolphin crested the water off the port stern and reentered no more than five feet from where mckittrick was standing it was a slippery gray blur and bosch wasnt exactly sure at first what had happened but the dolphin quickly resurfaced next to the boat its snout out of the water and chattering it sounded like it was laughing mckittrick dropped two of the fish into its open mouth thats sergeant see the scars bosch took a quick look back at the bridge to make sure they were still reasonably on line and then stepped back to the stern the dolphin was still there mckittrick pointed down into the water beneath its dorsal fin bosch could see three white stripes slashed across its smooth gray back he got too close to a prop one time and it cut him up the people up at mote marine took care of him but he was left with those sergeants stripes bosch nodded as mckittrick fed the dolphin again without looking up to see if they were off course mckittrick said you better get the wheel bosch turned and saw that they had drifted far off line he went back to the wheel and corrected the course he stayed there while mckittrick remained in the back throwing fish to the dolphin until they passed under the bridge bosch decided he could wait him out whether it was while they were going out or coming in didnt matter he was going to get mckittricks story he was not going to leave without it ten minutes after the bridge they came to a channel that took them out to the gulf of mexico mckittrick dropped lures from two of the poles into the water and put out about a hundred yards of line on each one he took the wheel back from bosch then yelling into the wind and engine noise i want to take it out to the reefs well troll until were there and then well do some drift fishing in the shallows well talk then sounds like a plan bosch yelled back nothing hit either of the lures and about two miles from the shore mckittrick killed the engines and told bosch to bring in one line while he handled the other it took bosch who was left handed a few moments to get himself coordinated on the righthanded reel but then he started smiling i dont think ive done this since i was a kid at mcclaren every now and then theyd put us on a bus and take us out to the malibu pier jesus that pier still there yeah must be like fishing in a cesspool by now i guess mckittrick laughed and shook his head why do you stay there bosch doesnt sound like they particularly want you bosch thought a moment before answering the comment was on point but he wondered if it was on point from mckittrick or whoever the source was he had called whod you call back there about me im not telling you thats why he talked to me because he knew i wouldnt tell you bosch nodded signaling hed let it go well youre right he said i dont think they particularly want me back there but i dont know its kindve like the more they push one way the more i push the other i feel like if theyd stop asking or trying to make me leave then id probably want to do it i guess i know what you mean mckittrick stowed the two rods they had used and set to work outfitting the other two with hooks and buckshot weights were going to use mullet bosch nodded he didnt know the first thing about it but he watched mckittrick closely he thought it might be a good time to start so you punched out after your twenty in la whatd you do after that youre looking at it i moved back hereim from palmetto up the coast originally i bought a boat and became a fishing guide did that another twenty retired and now i fish for my own damned self bosch smiled palmetto isnt that the name of those big cockroaches no well yeah but its also the name of a scrub palm thats what the towns named for not the bug bosch nodded and watched as mckittrick opened a bag of mullet strips and hooked pieces on each line after opening fresh beers they cast on separate sides of the boat and then sat on the gunwales waiting then howd you end up in la bosch asked what was that somebody said about going west young man well after japan surrendered i passed through la on my way back home and i saw those mountains going all the way up from the sea to the skydamn i ate dinner at the derby my first night in town i was going to blow my whole wallet and you know who saw me there in uniform and picked up the tab goddamn clark gable im not kidding you i fuckin fell in love with that place and it took me almost thirty years to see the lightmarys from la you know born and raised she likes it out here fine he nodded to reassure himself bosch waited a few moments and mckittrick was still looking off at distant memories he was a nice guy whos that clark gable bosch crunched the empty beer can in his hand and got another so tell me about the case he said after popping it what happened you know what happened if you read the book it was all in there it got dumped one day we had an investigation the next we were writing no leads at this time it was a joke thats why i remember the case so well they shouldntve done what they did whos they you know the big shots what did they do they took it away from us and eno let them he cut some deal with them himself shit he shook his head bitterly jake bosch tried he got no protest this time over using the first name why dont you start at the beginning i need to know everything i can from you mckittrick was quiet while he reeled in his bait hadnt been touched he recast it put the rod in one of the gunwale pipes and got another beer from beneath the console he grabbed a tampa bay lightning cap and put it on he leaned on the gunwale with his beer and looked at bosch okay kid listen i got nothin against your mother im just gonna tell you this the way it fell okay thats all i want you want a hat youre gonna get burned im fine mckittrick nodded and finally started okay so we got the call out from home it was a saturday morning one of the footbeat guys had found her she hadnt been killed in that alley that much was clear shed been dropped off by the time i got down there from tujunga the crime scene investigation was already underway my partner was there too eno he was the senior man he was there first he took charge of it bosch put his rod in a pipe and went to his jacket you mind if i take notes no i dont mind i guess ive been waiting for somebody to care about this one since i walked away from it go ahead eno was in charge yeah he was the man youve got to understand something wed been a team maybe three four months at that time we werent tight after this one wed never be tight i switched off after about a year i went in for the transfer they moved me to wilshire dicks homicide table never had much to do with him after that he never had much to do with me okay what happened with the investigation well it was like anything else that youd expect we were going through the routine we had a list of her kasgot it mostly from the vice guysand were working our way through it the known associates did they include clients there was no list in the murder book i think there were a few clients and the list didnt go into the book because eno said so remember he was the lead okay johnny fox was on the list yeah he was at the top of it he was heruh manager and her pimp you mean mckittrick looked at him yeah thats what he was i wasnt sure what you uh forget it go on yeah johnny fox was on the list we talked to about everybody who knew her and this guy was described by everybody as one mean guy he had a history bosch thought of meredith romans report that he had beaten her wed heard that she was trying to get away from him i dont know either to go out on her own or maybe go straight who knows we heard she wanted to be a straight citizen bosch interrupted that way she could get me out of the hall he felt foolish for saying it knowing his saying it was not convincing yeah whatever mckittrick said point is fox was none too happy about that that put him at the top of our list but you couldnt find him the chrono says you watched his place yeah he was our man we had prints we had taken off the beltthe murder weaponbut we had no comparisons from him johnny had been pulled in a few times in the past but never booked never printed so we really needed to bring him in what did it tell you that hed been picked up but never booked mckittrick finished his beer crunched it in his hand and walked the empty over to a large bucket in the corner of the deck and dropped it to be honest at the time it didnt hit me now of course its obvious he had an angel watching over him who well on one of the days we were watching foxs place waiting for him to show up we got a message on the radio to call arno conklin he wanted to talk about the case asap now this was a holy shit kind of call for two reasons one arno was going great guns then he was running the citys moral commandos at the time and had a lock on the das office which was coming open in a year the other reason was that wed only had the case a few days and hadnt come near the das office with anything so now all of a sudden the most powerful guy in the agency wants to see us im thinkingi dont really know what i was thinking i just knew ithey you got one bosch looked at his pole and saw it bend from a violent jerk on the line the reel started spinning as the fish pulled against the drag bosch grabbed the pole out of the pipe and jerked it back the hook was set well he started reeling but the fish had a lot of fight and was pulling out more line than he was reeling in mckittrick came over and tightened the drag dial which immediately put a more pronounced bend in the pole keep the pole up keep the pole up mckittrick counseled bosch did as he was told and spent five minutes battling the fish his arms started to ache he felt a strain on his lower back mckittrick put on gloves and when the fish finally surrendered and bosch had it alongside the boat he bent over and hooked his fingers into the gills and brought it on board bosch saw a shiny blueblack fish that looked beautiful in the sunlight wahoo mckittrick said what mckittrick held the fish up horizontally wahoo over there in your fancy la restaurants i think they call it ono here we just call it wahoo meat cooks up white as halibut you wanna keep it no put it back its beautiful mckittrick roughly pulled the hook from the gulping mouth of the fish and then held the catch out to bosch you want to hold it must be twelve thirteen pounds nah i dont need to hold it bosch stepped closer and ran his finger along the slick skin of the fish he could almost see himself in the reflection of its scales he nodded to mckittrick and the fish was thrown back into the water for several seconds it remained motionless about two feet below the surface posttraumatic stress syndrome bosch thought finally the fish seemed to come out of it and darted down into the depths bosch put the hook through one of the eyelets on his pole and put the pole back in its pipe he was done fishing he got another beer out of the cooler hey you want a sandwich go ahead mckittrick said no im fine bosch wished the fish hadnt interrupted them you were saying that you guys got the call from conklin yeah arno only i had it wrong the request for a meeting was only for claude not me eno went alone why only eno i never knew and he acted like he didnt know either i just assumed it was because he and arno had a prior relationship of some kind but you dont know what no claude eno was about ten years older than me hed been around so what happened well i cant tell you what happened i can only tell you what my partner said happened understand he was telling bosch that he didnt trust his own partner bosch had known that feeling himself at times and nodded that he understood go ahead he came back from the meeting saying conklin asked him to lay off fox because fox was clear on this case and fox was working as an informant on one of the commando investigations he said fox was important to him and he didnt want him compromised or roughed up especially over a crime he didnt commit how was conklin so sure i dont know but eno told me that he told conklin that assistant das no matter who they are didnt decide whether someone was clear or not for the police and that we werent backing off until we talked to fox for ourselves faced with that conklin said he could deliver fox to be interviewed and fingerprinted but only if we did it on conklins turf which was his office in the old courthouse thats gone now they built that big square thing right before i left horriblelooking thing what happened in the office were you there for that yeah i was there but nothing happened we interviewed him fox was there with conklin so was the nazi the nazi conklins enforcer gordon mittel he was there yup i guess he was sort of watching out for conklin while conklin was watching out for fox bosch showed no surprise okay so what did fox tell you like i said not much at least thats how i remember it he gave us an alibi and the names of the people who could verify it i took his prints whatd he say about the victim he said pretty much what wed already heard from her girlfriend meredith roman yeah i think thats it he said she went to a party was hired as kind of a decoration to be on some guys arm he said it was in hancock park he didnt have the address he said he had nothing to do with setting it up that didnt make sense to us you know a pimp not knowing wherenot knowing where one of his girls was it was the one thing we had and when we started leaning on him about it conklin stepped in like a referee he didnt want you leaning on him craziest thing i ever saw here was the next daeverybody knew he was going to run here he was taking this bastards side against ussorry about that bastard comment forget it conklin was trying to make it seem like we were out of line while all the time this bigpieceofshit fox was sitting there smiling with a toothpick in the side of his mouth its what thirtysomethin years ago and i can still remember that toothpick galled the jesus out of me so to make a long story short we never did get to brace him on having set up the date she went on the boat rocked on a high wake and bosch looked around and didnt see any other boat it was weird he looked out across the water and for the first time realized how different it was from the pacific the pacific was a cold and forbidding blue the gulf a warm green that invited you we left mckittrick continued i figured wed have another shot at him so we left and started to work on his alibi it turned out to be good and i dont mean it was good because his own witnesses said it was we did the work we found some independent people people that didnt know him as i remember it it was rock solid you remember where he was spent part of the night in a bar over there on ivar place a lot of the pimps hung around cant remember the name of it then later he drove out to ventura spent most of the rest of the night in a card room until he got a phone call then he split the other thing about this was that it didnt smack of an alibi set up for this particular night this was his routine he was well known in all of these places what was the phone call we never knew we didnt know about it until we started checking his alibi and somebody mentioned it we never got to ask fox about it but to be honest we didnt care too much at that point like i said his alibi was solid and he didnt get the call until later in the morning four five oclock the vicyour mother had been dead a good long while by then tod was midnight the call didnt matter bosch nodded but it was the kind of detail he would not have left open if it had been his investigation it was too curious a detail who calls a poker room that early in the morning what kind of call would make fox up and leave the game what about the prints i had em checked anyway and they didnt match those on the belt he was clean the dirtbag was clear bosch thought of something you did check the prints on the belt against the victims right hey bosch i know you highfalutin guys think youre the cats ass now but we were known for having a brain or two back in those days sorry there were a few prints on the buckle that were the victims thats it the rest were definitely the killers because of their location we got good direct lifts and partials on two other spots where it was clear the belt had been grasped by the full hand you dont hold a belt that way when youre putting it on you hold it that way when youre putting it around someones neck they were both silent after that bosch couldnt figure out what mckittrick was telling him he felt deflated he had thought that if he got mckittrick to open up the old cop would point the finger at fox or conklin or somebody but he was doing none of that he really wasnt giving bosch anything how come you remember so many details jake its been a long time ive had a long time to think about it when you finish up bosch youll see therell always be one one case that stays with you this is the one that stayed with me so what was your final take on it my final take well i never got over that meeting at conklins office i guess you had to be there but it justit just seemed that the one that was in charge of that meeting was fox it was like he was calling the shots bosch nodded he could see that mckittrick was struggling for an explanation of his feelings you ever interview a suspect with his lawyer there jumpin in and out of the conversation mckittrick asked you know dont answer this dont answer that shit like that all the time well it was like that it was like conklin the next da for chrissake was this shitheels lawyer objecting all the time to our questions what it came down to was that if you didnt know who he was or where we were youdve sworn he was working for fox both of them mittel too so i felt pretty sure fox had his hooks into arno somehow he did and i was right it was all confirmed later you mean when fox died yeah he got killed in a hit and run while working for the conklin campaign i remember the newspaper story on it didnt say nothin about his background as a pimp as a hollywood boulevard hoodlum no he was just this guy who got run down joe innocent i tell ya that story mustve cost arno a few dollars and made a reporter a little richer bosch could tell there was more so he said nothing i was in wilshire dicks by then mckittrick continued but i got curious when i heard about it so i called over to hollywood to see who was on it it was eno big surprise and he never made a case on anybody so that about confirmed what i was thinking about him too mckittrick stared off across the water to where the sun was getting low in the sky he threw his empty beer can at the bucket it missed and bounced over the side into the water fuck it he said i guess we should head in he started reeling in his line what do you think eno got out of all of this i dont know exactly he mightve just been trading favors something like that im not saying he got rich but i think he got something out of the deal he wouldnt do it for nothing i just dont know what it was mckittrick started taking the rods out of the pipes and stowing them on hooks along the sides of the stern in you checked the murder book out of archives how come mckittrick looked at him curiously i signed the same checkout slip a few days ago bosch explained your name was still on it mckittrick nodded yeah that was right after i put in my papers i was leaving going through my files and stuff id hung on to the prints we took off the belt kept the card also hung on to the belt why you know why i didnt think it would be safe in that file or in the evidence room not with conklin as da not with eno doing him favors so i kept the stuff then a bunch of years went by and it was there when i was cleaning shit out and going to florida so right before i decided to punch out i put the print card back in the murder book and went down and put the belt back in the evidence box eno was already in vegas retired conklin had crashed and burned was out of politics the case was long forgotten i put the stuff back i guess maybe i hoped someday somebody like you would take a look at it what about you did you look at the book when you put the card back yeah and i saw i had done the right thing somebody had gone through it stripped it they pulled the fox interview out of it probably was eno as the second man on the case you had to do the paper right right the paperwork was mine most of it what did you put on the fox interview summary that would have made eno need to pull it i dont remember anything specific just that i thought the guy was lying and that conklin was out of line something like that anything else you remember that was missing nah nothing important just that i think he just wanted to get conklins name out of it yeah well he missed something youd noted his first call on the chronological record thats how i knew did i well good for me and here you are yeah all right were heading in too bad they werent really biting today im not complaining i got my fish mckittrick stepped behind the wheel and was about to start the engine when he thought of something oh you know what he moved to the cooler and opened it i dont want mary to be disappointed he pulled out the plastic bags that contained the sandwiches his wife had made you hungry not really me neither he opened the bags and dumped the sandwiches over the side bosch watched him jake when you pulled out that gun whod you think i was mckittrick didnt say anything as he neatly folded the plastic bags and put them back in the cooler when he straightened up he looked at bosch i didnt know all i knew was that i thought i might have to take you out here and dump you like those sandwiches seems like ive been hiding out here all my life waiting for them to send somebody you think theyd go that far over time and distance i dont have any idea the more time that goes by the more i doubt it but old habits die hard i always keep a gun nearby doesnt matter that most times i dont even remember why they rode in from the gulf with the engine roaring and the soft spray of the sea in their faces they didnt talk that was done with occasionally bosch glanced over at mckittrick his old face fell under the shadow of his cap brim but bosch could see his eyes in there looking at something that had happened a long time before and no longer could be changed chapter twentysix after the boat trip bosch felt the onset of a headache from the combination of too much beer and too much sun he begged off an invitation to dinner from mckittrick saying he was tired once in his car he took a couple of tylenol caplets out of his overnighter downed them without any liquid chaser and hoped they would do the job he took out his notebook and reviewed some of the things he had written about mckittricks story he had come to like the old cop by the end of the fishing trip maybe he saw some of himself in the older man mckittrick was haunted because he had let the case go he had not done the right thing and bosch knew he was guilty of the same during all the years he had ignored the case that he knew was there waiting for him he was making up for that now and so was mckittrick by talking to him but both of them knew it might be too little too late bosch wasnt sure what he would do next when he got back to los angeles it seemed to him that his only move was to confront conklin he was reluctant to do this because he knew he would go into such a confrontation soft with only his suspicions and no hard evidence conklin would have the upper hand a wave of desperation came over him he did not want the case to come to this conklin hadnt flinched in almost thirtyfive years he wouldnt with bosch in his face now harry knew he needed something else but he had nothing he started the car but left it in park he turned the air conditioner on high and added what mckittrick had told him into the stew of what he already knew he began formulating a theory for bosch this was one of the most important components of homicide investigation take the facts and shake them down into hypothesis the key was not to become beholden to any one theory theories changed and you had to change with them it seemed clear from mckittricks information that fox had a hold on conklin what was it well bosch thought fox dealt in women the theory that emerged was that fox had gotten a hook into conklin through a woman or women the news clips at the time reported conklin was a bachelor the morals of the time would have dictated then as now that as a public servant and soontobe candidate for top prosecutor conklin needed not necessarily to be celibate but at least not to have succumbed privately to the very vices he was publicly attacking if he had done that and was exposed he could kiss his political career goodbye let alone his position as commander of the da commandos so bosch concluded if this was conklins flaw and it was through fox that such dalliances were arranged then fox would hold an almost unbeatable hand when it came to having juice with conklin it would explain the unusual circumstances of the interview mckittrick and eno conducted with fox the same theory bosch knew would work to an even greater degree if conklin had done more than succumb to the vice of sex but had gone further if he had killed a woman fox had sent to him marjorie lowe for one thing it would explain how conklin knew for sure that fox was in the clear on the murderbecause he was the killer himself for another it would explain how fox got conklin to run interference for him and why he was later hired as a conklin campaign worker the bottom line was if conklin was the killer foxs hook would be set even deeper and it would be set for good conklin would be like that wahoo at the end of the line a pretty fish unable to get away unless bosch knew the man at the other end of the line and holding the rod were to go away somehow he thought about foxs death and saw how it fit conklin let some time separate one death from the other he played like a hooked fish even agreeing to foxs demand for a straight job with the campaign and then when all seemed clear fox was run down in the street maybe a payoff to a reporter kept the victims background quietif the reporter even knew it and a few months later conklin was crowned district attorney bosch considered where mittel would fit into the theory he felt it was unlikely that all of this had transpired in a vacuum it was boschs guess that mittel as conklins righthand man and enforcer would know what conklin knew bosch liked his theory but it angered him largely because that was all it was theory he shook his head as he realized he was back to ground zero all talk no evidence of anything he grew weary thinking about it and decided to put the thoughts aside for a while he turned the air down because it was too cool against his sunburned skin and put the car in gear as he slowly cruised through pelican cove toward the gatehouse his thoughts drifted to the woman who was trying to sell her dead fathers condo she had signed the name jazz on the selfportrait he liked that he turned the car around and drove toward her unit it was still daylight and no lights shone from behind the buildings windows when he got there he couldnt tell if she was there or not bosch parked nearby and watched for a few minutes debating what he should do if anything at all fifteen minutes later when it seemed that indecisiveness had paralyzed him she stepped out the front door he was parked nearly twenty yards away between two other cars his paralytic affliction eased enough for him to slide down in his seat to avoid detection she walked out into the parking lot and behind the row of cars which included boschs rental he didnt move or turn to follow her movement he listened he waited for the sound of a car starting then what he wondered follow her what are you doing he jerked upright at the sound of sharp rapping on the window next to him it was her bosch was flustered but managed to turn the key so he could lower the window yes mr bosch what are you doing what do you mean youve been sitting out here i saw you i he was too humiliated to finish i dont know whether to call security or not no dont do that i uh i was justi was going to go to your door to apologize apologize apologize for what for today for earlier when i was inside iyou were right i wasnt looking to buy anything then what were you doing bosch opened the car door and stepped out he felt disadvantaged with her looking down at him in the car im a cop he said i needed to get in here to see someone i used you and im sorry i am i didnt know about your father and all of that she smiled and shook her head thats the dumbest story ive ever heard what about la was that part of the story no im from la im a cop there i dont know if id go around admitting that if i were you you guysve got some bad pr problems yeah i know so he felt his courage rising he told himself he was flying out in the morning and it didnt matter what happened because hed never see her or this state again you said something before about lemonade but i never got any i was thinking maybe i could tell you the story apologize and have some lemonade or something he looked over toward the door of the condo you la cops are pushy she said but she was smiling one glass and the story better be good after that we both gotta go im driving up to tampa tonight they started walking toward the door and bosch realized he had a smile on his face whats in tampa its where i live and i miss it ive been down here more than up there since i put the condo on the market i want to spend a sunday at my own place and in my own studio thats right a painter i try to be she opened the door for him and allowed him in first well thats okay by me i have to get to tampa sometime tonight i fly out in the morning while nursing a tall glass of lemonade bosch explained his scam of using her to get into the complex to see another resident and she didnt seem upset in fact he could tell she admired the ingenuity of it bosch didnt tell her how it had backfired anyway when mckittrick had pulled a gun on him he gave her a vague outline of the case never mentioning its personal connection to himself and she seemed intrigued by the whole idea of solving a murder that happened thirtythree years earlier the one glass of lemonade turned into four and the last two were spiked nicely with vodka they took care of what was left of boschs headache and put a nice bloom on everything between the third and the fourth she asked if he would mind if she smoked and he lit cigarettes for both of them and as the sky darkened over the mangroves outside he finally turned the conversation toward her bosch had sensed a loneliness about her a mystery of some sort behind the pretty face there were scars the kind that couldnt be seen her name was jasmine corian but she said that friends called her jazz she spoke of growing up in the florida sun of never wanting to leave it she had married once but it was a long time ago there was nobody in her life now and she was used to it she said she concentrated most of her life on her art and in a way bosch understood what she meant his own art though few would call it that took most of his life as well what do you paint portraits mostly who are they just someone i know maybe ill paint you bosch someday he didnt know what to say to that so he made a clumsy transition to safer ground why dont you give this place to a realtor to sell that way you could stay in tampa and paint because i wanted the diversion i also didnt want to give a realtor the five percent this is a nice complex these units sell pretty well without realtors a lot of canadian investment i think ill sell it this was only the first week ive run the ad bosch just nodded and wished he had kept the conversation on her painting instead of realtors the clumsy change seemed to have clogged things up a bit i was thinking you want to have dinner she looked at him solemnly as if the request and her answer had far deeper implications they probably did at least he thought they did where would we go that was a stall but he played along i dont know its not my town not my state you could pick a place around here or on the way up to tampa i dont care id like your company though jazz if you want to how long has it been since you were with a woman i mean on a date on a date i dont know a few months i guess but look im not a hardluck case im just in town and alone and thought maybe youd its okay harry lets go to eat yes to eat i know a place on the way up its above longboat youll have to follow me he smiled and nodded she drove a volkswagen beetle convertible that was powder blue with one red fender he couldnt lose her in a hailstorm let alone the slowmoving florida highways bosch counted two drawbridges that they had to stop for before they got to longboat key from there they headed north for the length of the island crossed a bridge onto anna maria island and finally stopped at a place called the sandbar they walked through the bar and sat on a deck overlooking the gulf it was cool and they ate crabs and oysters chased with mexican beer bosch loved it they didnt talk much but didnt need to it was always in the silences that bosch felt most comfortable with the women who had moved through his life he felt the vodka and beer working on him warming him toward her sanding off any sharp edges to the evening he felt a desire for her growing and tugging at him mckittrick and the case had somehow been pushed into the darkness at the back of his mind this is good he said when he was finally nearing his capacity for food and drink its great yeah they do it right can i tell you something bosch go ahead i was only kidding about what i was saying about la cops before but i have known some cops beforeand you seem different i dont know what it is but its like youve got too much of yourself left you know i guess he nodded thanks i think they both laughed and then in a hesitant move she leaned over and kissed him quickly on the lips it was nice and he smiled he could taste garlic im glad youre already sunburned or youd be turning red again no i wouldnt i mean that was a nice thing to say you want to come home with me bosch now he hesitated not because there was any deliberation in his answer but he wanted her to have the chance to withdraw it in case she had spoken too quickly after a moment of silence from her he smiled and nodded yes i would like that they left then and cut inland to the freeway bosch wondered as he tailed the volkswagen if she would change her mind as she drove alone he got his answer at the skyway bridge as he pulled up to the tollbooth with his dollar already in hand the tolltaker shook his head and waved off the money nope that lady in the bug got ya covered yeah yeah you know her not yet i think youre goin to good luck thanks chapter twentyseven now bosch couldnt lose her in a blizzard as the drive grew longer he found himself in a growing sense of an almost adolescent euphoria of anticipation he was captured by the directness of this woman and he was wondering how and what that would translate to when they were making love she led him north to tampa and then into an area called hyde park overlooking the bay the neighborhood consisted of old victorian and craftsmanstyle houses with sweeping front porches her home was an apartment above the threecar garage set behind a gray victorian with green trim as they got to the top of the steps and she was putting the key into the knob bosch thought of something and didnt know what to do she opened the door and looked at him she read him whats wrong nothing but i was thinking maybe i should go find a drugstore or something and then come back dont worry ive got what youll need but can you stand out here for a second i just want to make a mad dash inside and clean up a few things he looked at her i dont care about that please okay take your time he waited for about three minutes and then she opened the door and pulled him in if she had cleaned up she had done it in the dark the only light came from what bosch could see was the kitchen she took his hand and led him away from the light to a darkened hallway that gave way to her bedroom here she turned on the light revealing a sparely furnished room a wroughtiron bed with a canopy was the centerpiece there was a night table of unfinished wood next to it a matching unfinished bureau and an antique singer sewing machine table on which stood a blue vase with dead flowers in it there was nothing hung on any of the walls though bosch saw a nail protruding from the plaster above the vase jasmine noticed the flowers and quickly took the vase off the table and headed out the door i have to go dump this i havent been here in a week and forgot to change them moving the flowers raised a slightly acrid smell in the room while she was gone bosch looked at the nail again and thought he could see the delineation of a rectangle on the wall something had hung there he decided she hadnt come in to clean up if she had she would have gotten rid of the flowers shed come in to take down a painting when she came back into the room she put the empty vase back on the table would you like another beer i have some wine too bosch moved toward her intrigued even more by her mysteries no im fine without further word they embraced he could taste beer and garlic and cigarette smoke as he kissed her but didnt care he knew she was getting the same from him he pressed his cheek against hers and with his nose he came across the spot on her neck where she had dabbed perfume nightblooming jasmine they moved onto the bed each taking pieces of clothing off between hard kisses her body was beautiful the tan lines distinct he kissed her lovely small breasts and gently pushed her back on the bed she told him to wait and she rolled to the side and from the drawer of the bed table extracted a strip of three condom packages and handed it to him is this wishful thinking he asked they both burst out laughing and it seemed to make things all the better i dont know she said well see for bosch sexual encounters had always been a question of timing the desires of two individuals rose and subsided on their own courses there were emotional needs separate from physical needs and sometimes all of those things clicked together in a person and then clicked in tandem with those of the other person boschs encounter with jasmine corian was one of those times the sex created a world without intrusion one so vital that it could have lasted an hour or maybe only a few minutes and he wouldnt have known the difference at the end he was above her looking into her open eyes and she clutched his upper arms as if she were holding on for her life both of their bodies shuddered in unison and then he lay still on top of her catching his breath from the hollow between her neck and shoulder he felt so good he had the urge to laugh out loud but he didnt think shed understand he stifled it and made it sound like a muffled cough are you okay she asked softly ive never felt better eventually he moved off her backing down over her body he kissed both of her breasts then sat up with her legs on either side of him he removed the condom while using his body to shield her view of the process he got up and walked to the door he hoped was the bathroom and found it was a closet the next door he tried was the bathroom and he flushed the condom down the toilet he absentmindedly wondered if it would end up somewhere in tampa bay when he came back from the bathroom she was sitting up with the sheet bunched around her waist he found his sport coat on the floor and got out his cigarettes he gave her one and lit it then he bent over and kissed her breasts again her laugh was infectious and it made him smile you know i like it that you didnt come equipped equipped what are you talking about you know that you offered to go to the drugstore it shows what kind of man you are what do you mean if you had come over here from la with a condom in your wallet that wouldve been soi dont know premeditated like some guy just on the make the whole thing would have had no spontaneity im glad you werent like that harry bosch thats all he nodded trying to follow her line of thought he wasnt sure he understood and he wondered what he should think of the fact that she was equipped he decided to drop it and lit his cigarette howd you hurt your hand like that she had noticed the marks on his fingers bosch had taken the bandaids off while flying over the burns had healed to the point that they looked like red welts on two of his fingers cigarette i fell asleep he felt he could tell her the truth about everything about himself god thats scary yeah i dont think it will happen again do you want to stay with me tonight he moved closer to her and kissed her on the neck yes he whispered she reached over and touched the zipper scar on his left shoulder the women he was with in bed always seemed to do this it was an ugly mark and he never understood why they were drawn to touch it you got shot yeah thats even scarier he hiked his shoulders it was history and he never really thought about it anymore you know what i was trying to say before is that youre not like most cops ive known youve got too much of your humanity left howd that happen he shook his shoulders again like he didnt know are you okay bosch he stubbed out his cigarette yeah im fine why i dont know you know what that guy marvin gaye sang about dont you before he got killed by his own dad he sang about sexual healing said its good for the soul something like that anyway i believe it do you i suppose i think you need healing in your life bosch thats the vibe im getting you want to go to sleep now she lay down again and pulled the sheet up he walked around the room naked turning out the lights when he was under the sheet in the dark she turned on her side so her back was to him and told him to put his arm around her he moved up close behind her and did he loved her smell how come people call you jazz i dont know they just do because it goes with the name after a few moments she asked him why he had asked that because you smell like both your names like the flower and the music what does jazz smell like it smells dark and smoky they were silent for a long while after that and eventually bosch thought she was asleep but he still could not make it down he lay with his eyes open looking at the shadows of the room then she spoke softly to him bosch whats the worst thing youve ever done to yourself what do you mean you know what i mean whats the worst thing whats the thing that keeps you awake at night if you think about it too hard he thought for a few moments before answering i dont know he forced an uneasy and short laugh i guess ive done a lot of bad things i suppose a lot of them are to myself at least i think about them a lot whats one of them you can tell me and he knew that he could he thought he could tell her almost anything and not be judged harshly when i was a kidi grew up mostly in a youth hall like an orphanage when i was new there one of the older kids took my shoes my sneakers they didnt fit him or anything but he did it because he knew he could do it he was one of the rulers of the roost and he took em i didnt do anything about it and it hurt but you didnt do it thats not what i no im not done i just told you that because you had to know that part see when i got older and i was one of the big shots in the place i did the same thing i took this new kids shoes he was smaller i couldnt even put em on i just took them and ii dont know i threw them out or something but i took them because i could i did the same thing that was done to meand sometimes even now i think about it and i feel bad she squeezed his hand in a way he thought was meant to be comforting but said nothing is that the kind of story you wanted she just squeezed his hand again after a while he spoke i think the one thing i did that i regret the most though was maybe letting a woman go you mean like a criminal no i mean like we livedwe were lovers and when she wanted to go i didnt reallydo anything i didnt put up a fight you know and when i think about it sometimes i think that maybe if i had i couldve changed her mindi dont know did she say why she was leaving she just got to know me too well i dont blame her for anything ive got baggage i guess maybe i can be hard to take ive lived alone most of my life silence filled the room again and he waited he sensed that there was something more she wanted to say or be asked but when she spoke he wasnt sure if she was talking about him or herself they say when a cat is ornery and scratches and hisses at everybody even somebody who wants to comfort it and love it its because it wasnt held enough when it was a kitten i never heard that before i think its true he was quiet a moment and moved his hand up so that it was touching her breasts is that what your story is he asked you werent held enough who knows what was the worst thing you ever did to yourself jasmine i think you want to tell me he knew she wanted him to ask it it was true confessions time and he began to believe that the whole night had been directed by her to arrive at this one question you didnt try to hold on to someone you should have she said i held on to someone i shouldnt have i held on too long thing is i knew what it was leading to deep down i knew it was like standing on the tracks and seeing the train coming at you but being too mesmerized by the bright light to move to save yourself he had his eyes open in the dark still he could barely see the outline of her shoulder and cheek he pulled himself closer to her kissed her neck and in her ear whispered but you got out thats whats important yeah i got out she said wistfully i got out she was silent for a while and then reached up under the covers and touched his hand it was cupped over one of her breasts she held her hand on top of it good night harry he waited a while until he heard the measured breathing of her sleep and then he was finally able to drift off there was no dream this time just warmth and darkness chapter twentyeight in the morning bosch awoke first he took a shower and borrowed jasmines toothbrush without asking then he dressed in the clothes hed worn the day before and went out to his car to retrieve his overnight bag once he was dressed in fresh clothes he ventured into the kitchen to see about coffee all he found was a box of tea bags leaving the idea behind he walked around the apartment his steps creaking on the old pine floors the living room was as spare as the bedroom a sofa with an offwhite blanket spread on it a coffee table an old stereo with a cassette but no cd player no television again nothing on the walls but the telltale indication that there had been he found two nails in the plaster they werent rusted or painted over they hadnt been there very long through a set of french doors the living room opened up to a porch enclosed in windows there was rattan furniture out here and several potted plants including a dwarf orange tree with fruit on it the entire porch was redolent with its smell bosch stepped close to the windows and by looking south down the alley behind the property he could see the bay the morning suns reflection on it was pure white light he walked back across the living room to another door on the wall opposite the french doors immediately upon opening this door he could smell the sharp tang of oils and turpentine this was where she painted he hesitated but only for a moment then walked in the first thing he noticed was that the room had a window that gave a direct view of the bay across the backyards and garages of three or four houses down the alley it was beautiful and he knew why she chose this room for her art at center on a paintdappled drop cloth was an easel but no stool she painted standing he saw no overhead lamp or artificial light source anywhere else in the room she painted only by true light he walked around the easel and found the canvas on it had been untouched by the painter along one of the side walls was a high work counter with various tubes of paint scattered about there were palette boards and coffee cans with brushes stacked in them at the end of the counter was a large laundry sink for washing up bosch noticed more canvases leaning against the wall under the counter they were faced inward and appeared to be unused pieces like the one on the easel waiting for the artists hand but bosch suspected otherwise not with the exposed nails in the walls in the other rooms of the apartment he reached under the counter and slid a few of the canvases out as he did this he almost felt as if he was on some case solving some mystery the three portraits he pulled out were painted in dark hues none were signed though it was obvious all were the work of one hand and that hand was jasmines bosch recognized the style from the painting he had seen at her fathers house sharp lines dark colors the first one he looked at was of a nude woman with her face turned away from the painter and into the shadows the sense bosch felt was that the darkness was taking the woman rather than her turning to the darkness her mouth was completely in shadow it was as if she was mute the woman bosch knew was jasmine the second painting seemed to be part of the same study as the first it was the same nude in shadow though she was now facing the viewer bosch noted that in the portrait jasmine had given herself fuller breasts than in reality and he wondered if this was done on purpose and had some meaning or was perhaps a subliminal improvement made by the painter he noticed that beneath the veneer of gray shadow over the painting there were red highlights on the woman bosch knew little about the art but he knew this was a dark portrait bosch looked at the third painting he had pulled out and found this to be unattached to the first two save for the fact that again it was a nude portrait of jasmine but this piece he clearly recognized as a reinterpretation of the scream by edvard munch a painting that had always fascinated bosch but that he had only seen in books in the piece before him the figure of the frightened person was jasmine the location had been transferred from munchs horrific swirling dreamscape to the skyway bridge bosch clearly recognized the bright yellow vertical piping of the bridges support span what are you doing he jumped as if stabbed in the back it was jasmine at the door of the studio she wore a silk bathrobe she held closed with her arms her eyes were puffy she had just woken up im looking at your work is that okay this door was locked no it wasnt she reached to the doorknob and turned it as if that could disprove his claim it wasnt locked jazz im sorry i didnt know you didnt want me in here could you put those back under there please sure but whyd you take them off the walls i didnt was it because theyre nudes or is it because of what they mean please dont ask me about this put them back she left the doorway and he put the paintings back where he found them he left the room and found her in the kitchen filling a tea kettle with water from the sink her back was to him and he walked in and lightly put a hand on her back even so she started slightly at his touch jazz look im sorry im a cop i get curious its okay are you sure yes im sure you want some tea she had stopped filling the kettle but did not turn around or make a move to put it on the stove no i was thinking maybe i could take you out for breakfast when do you leave i thought you said the planes this morning that was the other thing i was thinking about i could stay another day leave tomorrow if you want me to i mean if youll have me id like to stay she turned around and looked at him i want you to stay too they embraced and kissed but she quickly pulled back its not fair you brushed your teeth i have monster breath yeah but i used your toothbrush so it evens out gross now i have to get a new one thats right they smiled and she gave him a tight hug around the neck his trespass in her studio seemingly forgotten you call the airline and ill get ready i know where we can go when she pulled away he held her in front of him he wanted to bring it up again he couldnt help it i want to ask you something what how come those paintings arent signed theyre not ready to be signed the one at your fathers was signed that was for him so i signed it those others are for me the one on the bridge is she going to jump she looked at him a long time before answering i dont know sometimes when i look at it i think she is i think the thought is there but you never know it cant happen jazz why not because it cant ill get ready she broke away from him then and left the kitchen he went to the wall phone next to the refrigerator and dialed the airline while making the arrangements to fly out monday morning he decided on a whim to ask the airline agent if it was possible to route his new flight back to los angeles through las vegas she said not without a threehourandfourteenminute layover he said hed take it he had to pay fifty dollars on top of the seven hundred they already had from him in order to make the needed changes he put it on his credit card he thought about vegas as he hung up claude eno might be dead but his wife was still cashing his checks she might be worth the fiftydollar layover ready it was jasmine calling from the living room bosch stepped out of the kitchen and she was waiting for him in cutoff jeans and a tank top beneath a white shirt she left open and tied above her waist she already had on sunglasses she took him to a place where they poured honey on top of the biscuits and served the eggs with grits and butter bosch hadnt had grits since basic training at benning the meal was delicious neither of them spoke much the paintings and the conversation they had before falling asleep the night before were not mentioned it seemed that what they had said was better left for the dark shadows of night and maybe her paintings too when they were done with their coffee she insisted on picking up the check he got the tip they spent the afternoon cruising in her volkswagen with the top down she took him all over the place from ybor city to st petersburg beach burning up a tank of gas and two packs of cigarettes by late in the afternoon they were at a place called indian rocks beach to look at the sunset over the gulf ive been a lot of places jasmine told him i like the light here the best ever been out to california no not yet sometimes the sunset looks like lava pouring down on the city that must be beautiful it makes you forgive a lot forget a lotthats the thing about los angeles its got a lot of broken pieces to it but the ones that still work really do work i think i know what you mean im curious about something here we go again what if you dont show your paintings to anybody how do you make a living it was from out of left field but he had been thinking about it all day i have money from my father even before he died its not a lot but i dont need a lot its enough if i dont feel the need to sell my work when it is finished then as i am doing it it wont be compromised it will be pure it sounded to bosch like a convenient way of explaining away the fear of exposing oneself but he let it go she didnt are you always a cop always asking questions no only when i care about someone she kissed him quickly and walked back to the car after stopping by her place to change they had dinner in a tampa steak house where the wine list was actually a book so thick it came on its own pedestal the restaurant itself seemed to be the work of a slightly delusional italian decorator a dark blend of gilded rococo garish red velvet and classical statues and paintings it was the kind of place he would expect her to suggest she mentioned that this meateaters palace was actually owned by a vegetarian sounds like somebody from california she smiled and was quiet for a while after that boschs mind wandered to the case he had spent the entire day without giving it a thought now a pang of guilt thrummed in his mind it was almost as if he felt he was shunting his mother aside to pursue the selfish pleasure of jasmines company jasmine seemed to read him and to know he was privately debating something can you stay another day harry he smiled but shook his head i cant i gotta go but ill be back as soon as i can bosch paid for dinner with a credit card he guessed was reaching its limit and they headed back to her apartment knowing their time together was drawing to a close they went right to the bed and made love the feel of her body its taste and its scent seemed perfect to bosch he didnt want the moment to end hed had immediate attractions to women before in his life and had even acted on them but never one that felt so fully engaging and complete he guessed that it was because of all he did not know about her that was the hook she was a mystery physically he could not get any closer than he was to her during these moments yet there was so much of her hidden unexplored they made love in gentle rhythm and held each other in a deep long kiss at the end later he lay on his side next to her his arm across the flatness of her belly one of her hands traced circles in his hair the true confessions began harry you know i havent been with a lot of men in my life he didnt respond because he didnt know what the proper response could be he was well past caring about a womans sexual history for anything other than health reasons what about you she asked he couldnt resist i havent been with a lot of men either in fact none as far as i know she punched him on the shoulder you know what i mean the answer is no i havent been with a lot of women in my life not enough at least i dont know the men that ive been with most of them its like they wanted something from me i didnt have i dont know what it was but i just didnt have it to give then i either left too soon or stayed too long he propped himself up on one elbow and looked at her sometimes i think that i know strangers better than i know anybody else even myself i learn so much about people in my job sometimes i think i dont even have a life i only have their lifei dont know what im talking about i think you do i understand maybe everybodys like this i dont know i dont think so they were quiet for a while after that bosch leaned down and kissed her breasts holding a nipple between his lips for a long moment she brought her hands up and held his head to her chest he could smell the jasmine harry have you ever had to use your gun he pulled his head up the question seemed out of place but through the darkness he could see her eyes on him watching and waiting for an answer yes you killed someone it wasnt a question yes she said nothing else what is it jazz nothing i was just wondering how that would be how you would go on well all i can tell you is that it hurts even when there was no choice and they had to go down it hurts you just have to go on she was silent whatever she had needed to hear from him he hoped she had gotten bosch was confused he didnt know why she had asked such questions and wondered if she was testing him in some way he lay back on his pillow and waited for sleep but confusion kept it away from him after a while she turned on the bed and put her arm over him i think you are a good man she whispered close to his ear am i he whispered back and you will come back wont you yes ill come back chapter twentynine bosch went to every rental counter in mccarran international airport in las vegas but none had a car left he silently chastised himself for not making a reservation and walked outside the terminal into the dry crisp air to catch a cab the driver was a woman and when bosch gave the address on lone mountain drive he could clearly see her disappointment in the rearview mirror the destination wasnt a hotel so she wouldnt be picking up a return fare dont worry bosch said understanding her problem if you wait for me you can take me back to the airport how long you gonna be i mean lone mountain thats way out there in the sand pits i might be five minutes i might be less maybe a half hour id say no longer than a half hour you waiting on the meter on the meter or you whatever you want to do she thought about it a moment and put the car in drive where are all the rental cars anyway big convention in town electronics or something it was a thirtyminute ride out into the desert northwest of the strip the neonandglass buildings retreated and the cab passed through residential neighborhoods until these too became sparse the land was a ragged brown out here and dotted unevenly with scrub brush bosch knew the roots of every bush spread wide and sucked up what little moisture was in the earth it made for a terrain that seemed dying and desolate the houses too were few and far between each one an outpost in a nomansland the streets had been gridded and paved long ago but the boomtown of las vegas hadnt quite caught up yet it was coming though the city was spreading like a patch of weeds the road began to rise toward a mountain the color of cocoa mix the cab shook as a procession of eighteenwheel dump trucks thundered by with loads of sand from the excavation pits the driver had mentioned and soon the paved roadway gave way to gravel and the cab sent up a tail of dust in its wake bosch was beginning to think the address the smarmy supervising clerk at city hall had given him was a phony but then they were there the address to which claude enos pension checks were mailed each month was a sprawling ranchstyle house of pink stucco and dusty white tile roof looking past it bosch could see where even the gravel road ended just past it it was the end of the line nobody had lived farther away than claude eno i dont know about this the driver said you want me to wait this is like the goddamn moon out here she had pulled into the driveway behind a late smodel olds cutlass there was a carport where another car was parked hidden beneath a tarp that was blue in the further recesses of the carport but bleached nearly white along the surfaces sacrificed to the sun bosch took out his fold of money and paid the driver thirtyfive dollars for the ride out then he took two twenties ripped them in half and handed one side of each over the seat to her you wait you get the other half of those plus the fare back to the airport plus that bosch got out realizing it would probably be the quickest forty bucks ever lost in las vegas if nobody answered the door but he was in luck a woman who looked to be in her late sixties opened the door before he could knock and why not he thought in this house you could see visitors coming for a mile bosch felt the blast of airconditioning escaping through the open door mrs eno no bosch pulled out his notebook and checked the address against the black numbers tacked on the front wall next to the door they matched olive eno doesnt live here you didnt ask that im not mrs eno can i please speak with mrs eno then annoyed with the womans preciseness bosch showed the badge he had gotten back from mckittrick after the boat ride its police business well you can try she hasnt spoken to anybody at least anybody outside her imagination in three years she motioned bosch in and he stepped into the cool house im her sister i take care of her shes in the kitchen we were in the middle of lunch when i saw the dust come up on the road and heard you arrive bosch followed her down a tiled hallway toward the kitchen the house smelled like old age like dust and mold and urine in the kitchen a gnomelike woman with white hair sat in a wheelchair barely taking up half of the space it gave for an occupant there was a slideon tray in front of it and the womans gnarled pearlwhite hands were folded together on top of it there were milky blue cataracts on both eyes and they seemed dead to the world outside the body bosch noticed a bowl of applesauce on the nearby table it only took him a few seconds to size up the situation shell be ninety in august said the sister if she makes it how long has she been like this long time ive been taking care of her for three years now she then bent into the gnomes face and loudly added isnt that right olive the loudness of the question seemed to kick a switch and olive enos jaw started working but no sound that was intelligible issued she stopped the effort after a while and the sister straightened up dont worry about it olive i know you love me she wasnt as loud with that sentence maybe she feared olive might actually muster a denial whats your name bosch asked elizabeth shivone whats this about i saw that badge of yours says los angeles not las vegas arent you off the beat here a bit not really its about her husband one of his old cases claudes been dead going on five years now how did he die just died his pump went out died right there on the floor about where youre standing they both looked down at the floor as if maybe his body was still there i came to look through his things bosch said what things i dont know i was thinking maybe he kept files from his time with the police you better tell me what youre doing here this doesnt sound right to me im investigating a case he worked back in its still open parts of the file are missing i thought maybe hed taken it i thought maybe there might be something important that he kept i dont know what anything i just thought it was worth a try he could see that her mind was working and her eyes suddenly froze for a second when her memory snagged on something there is something isnt there he said no i think you should go its a big house did he have a home office claude left the police thirty years ago he built this house in the middle of nowhere just to be away from all of that what did he do when he moved out here he worked casino security a few years at the sands then twenty at the flamingo he was getting two pensions and took good care of olive speaking of which whos signing those pension checks these days bosch looked at olive eno to make his point the other woman was silent a long moment then went on the offense look i could get power of attorney look at her it wouldnt be a problem i take care of her mister yeah you feed her applesauce i have nothing to hide you want somebody to make sure or do you want to let it end right here i dont really care what youre doing lady i dont really care if youre even her sister or not if i was betting id say youre not but i dont really care right now im busy i just want to look through enos things he stopped there and let her think about it he looked at his watch no warrant then right i dont have a warrant ive got a cab waiting you make me get a warrant and im going to stop being such a nice guy her eyes went up and down his body as if to measure how nice and how not nice he could be the office is this way she said the words as if they were bites out of wood planks she swiftly led him down the hall again and then off to the left into a study there was an old steel desk as the rooms centerpiece a couple of fourdrawer file cabinets an extra chair and not much else after he died olive and i moved everything into those file cabinets and havent looked at it since theyre all full all eight have at it bosch reached his hand into his pocket and took out another twentydollar bill he tore it in half and gave one side to shivone take that out to the cab driver tell her im going to be a little longer than i thought she exhaled loudly snatched the half and left the room after she was gone bosch went to the desk and opened each of the drawers the first two he tried were empty the next contained stationery and office supplies the fourth drawer contained a checkbook that he quickly leafed through and saw it was an account covering household expenses there was also a file containing recent receipts and other records the last drawer in the desk was locked he started with the bottom file drawers and worked his way up nothing in the first few seemed even remotely connected with what bosch was working on there were files labeled with the names of different casinos and gaming organizations the files in another drawer were labeled by peoples names bosch looked through a few of these and determined they were files on known casino cheats eno had built a library of home intelligence files by this time shivone had come back from her errand and had taken the seat opposite the desk she was watching bosch and he threw a few idle questions at her while he looked so what did claude do for the casinos he was a bird dog whats that kindve an undercover thing he mingled in the casinos gambled with house chips watched people he was good at picking out the cheats and how they did it guess it takes one to know one right whats that crack supposed to mean he did a good job im sure he did is that how he met you im not answering any of your questions okay by me he had only the two top drawers left he opened one and found it contained no files at all just an old dustcovered rolodex and other items that had probably sat on the top of the desk at one point there was an ashtray a clock and a pen holder made of carved wood that had enos name carved on it bosch took the rolodex out and put it on top of the cabinet he blew the dust off it and then began turning it until he came to the cs he looked through the cards but found no listing for arno conklin he met with similar failure when he tried to find a listing for gordon mittel youre not going to look through that whole thing are you shivone asked in exasperation no im just going to take it with me oh no you dont you cant just come in here and im taking it if you want to make a complaint about it be my guest then ill make a complaint about you she went quiet after that bosch went on to the next drawer and found it contained about twelve files on old lapd cases from the s and early s again he didnt have the time to study them but he checked all the labels and none was marked marjorie lowe by randomly pulling out a few of the files it became clear to him that eno had made copies of files on some of his cases to take with him when he left the department of the random selections all were murders including two of prostitutes only one of the cases was closed go get me a box or a bag or something for these files bosch said over his shoulder when he sensed the woman in the room had not moved he barked do it she got up and left bosch stood gazing at the files and thinking he had no idea if these were important or not he had no idea what they meant he only knew he should take them in case they turned out to be important but what bothered him more than what the files that were in the drawer could mean was the feeling that something was certainly missing this was based on his belief in mckittrick the retired detective was sure his former partner eno had some kind of hold on conklin or at the very least some kind of deal with him but there was nothing here about that and it seemed to bosch that if eno was holding something on conklin it would still be here if he kept old lapd files then he kept whatever he had on conklin in fact he would have kept it in a safe place where the woman came back and dropped a cardboard box on the floor it was the kind a case of beer had come in bosch put a footthick stack of files in it along with the rolodex you want a receipt he asked no i dont want anything from you well there is still something i need from you this doesnt end does it i hope it does what do you want when eno died did you help the old ladyuh your sister that isdid you help her clear out his safe deposit box howd she stopped herself but not soon enough howd i know because its obvious what im looking for he would have kept in a safe place what did you do with it we threw everything away it was meaningless just some old files and bank statements he didnt know what he was doing he was old himself bosch looked at his watch he was running out of time if he was going to make his plane get me the key for this desk drawer she didnt move hurry up i dont have a lot of time you open it or ill open it but if i do it that drawer isnt going to be much use to you anymore she reached into the pocket of her house dress and pulled out the house keys she reached down and unlocked the desk drawer pulled it open and then stepped away we didnt know what any of it was or what it meant thats fine bosch moved to the drawer and looked in there were two thin manila files and two packs of envelopes with rubber bands holding them together the first file he looked through contained enos birth certificate passport marriage license and other personal records he put it back in the drawer the next file contained lapd forms and bosch quickly recognized them as the pages and reports that had been removed from the marjorie lowe murder book he knew he had no time to read them at the moment and put the file in the beer box with the other files the rubber band on the first package of envelopes snapped when he tried to remove it and he was reminded of the band that had been around the blue binder that contained the case files everything about this case was old and ready to snap he thought the envelopes were all from a wells fargo bank branch in sherman oaks and each one contained a statement for a savings account in the name of mccage inc the address of the corporation was a post office box also in sherman oaks bosch randomly took envelopes from different spots in the pack and studied three of them though separated by years in the late s each statement was basically the same a deposit of one thousand dollars was made in the account on the tenth of each month and on the fifteenth a transfer of an equal amount was made to an account with a nevada savings and loan branch in las vegas without looking further bosch concluded that the bank statements might be the records of some kind of payoff account eno kept he quickly looked through the envelopes at the postmarks looking for the most recent one he found none more recent than the late s what about these envelopes when did he stop getting them what you see is what you get i have no idea what they mean and olive didnt know either back when they drilled his box drilled his box yeah after he died olive wasnt on the safe deposit box only him we couldnt find his key so we had to have it drilled there was money too wasnt there she waited a moment probably wondering if he was going to demand that too some but youre too late its already spent im not worried about that how much was there she pinched her lips and acted like she was trying to remember it was a bad act cmon im not here for the money and im not from the irs it was about eighteen thousand bosch heard a horn honk from outside the cabdriver was getting restless bosch looked at his watch he had to go he tossed the envelope packs into the beer box what about his account at nevada savings and loan how much was in it it was a scam question based on his guess that the account that the money from sherman oaks was transferred to was enos shivone hesitated again a delay punctuated by another horn blast it was about fifty but most of thats gone too taking care of olive you know yeah i bet between that and the pensions its gotta be rough bosch said with all the sarcasm he could put into it i bet your accounts arent too thin though look mister i dont know who you think you are but im the only one in the world that she has and who cares about her thats worth something too bad she doesnt get to decide what its worth instead of you answer one question for me and then im out of here and you can go back to taking whatever you can off herwho are you youre not her sister who are you its none of your business thats right but i could make it my business she put on a look that showed bosch what an affront he was to her delicate sensibilities but then seemed to gain a measure of selfesteem whoever she was she was proud of it you want to know who i am i was the best woman he ever had i was with him for a long time she had his wedding band but i had his heart near the end when they were both old and it didnt matter we dropped the pretension and he brought me in here to live with them take care of them so dont you dare tell me i dont deserve something out of it bosch just nodded somehow as sordid as the story seemed he found a measure of respect for her for just having told the truth and he felt sure it was when did you meet you said one question when did you meet when he was at the flamingo we both were i was a dealer like i said he was a bird dog he ever talk about la about any cases any people from back there no never he always said that was a closed chapter bosch pointed to the envelope stacks in the box does the name mccage mean anything not to me what about these account statements i never saw any of those things until the day we opened that box didnt know he even had an account over at nevada savings claude had secrets he even kept secrets from me chapter thirty at the airport bosch paid off the cab driver and struggled into the main terminal with his overnighter and the beer box full of files and other things in one of the stores along the main terminal mall he bought a cheap canvas satchel and transferred the items he had taken from enos office into it it was small enough so he didnt have to check it printed on the side of the bag was las vegas land of sun and fun there was a logo depicting the sun setting behind a pair of dice at his gate he had a half hour before they loaded the plane so he found a section of open seats as far away as possible from the cacophony of the rows of slot machines set in the center of the circular terminal he began going through the files in the satchel the one he was most interested in was the one containing records stolen from the marjorie lowe murder book he looked through the documents and found nothing unusual or unexpected the summary of the mckittrickeno interview of johnny fox with arno conklin and gordon mittel present was here and bosch could sense the contained outrage at the situation in mckittricks writing in the last paragraph it was no longer contained interview with suspect was regarded by the undersigned as fruitless because of the intrusive behavior of a conklin and g mittel both prosecutors refused to allow their witness to answer questions fully or in the undersigns opinion with the whole truth j fox remains suspect at this time until verification of his alibi and fingerprint analysis nothing else in the documents was of note and bosch realized that they were probably removed from the file by eno solely because they mentioned conklins involvement in the case eno was covering up for conklin when bosch asked himself why eno was doing this he immediately thought of the bank statements that had been in the safe deposit box with the stolen documents they were records of the deal bosch took out the envelopes and going by the postmarks began putting them in chronological order the earliest one he could find was mailed to the mccage inc postal drop in november that was one year after the death of marjorie lowe and two months after the death of johnny fox eno had been on the lowe case and then according to mckittrick he had investigated the fox killing bosch felt in his gut that he was right eno had squeezed conklin and maybe mittel he somehow knew what mckittrick didnt that conklin had been involved with marjorie lowe maybe he even knew conklin had killed her he had enough to put conklin on the line for a thousand bucks a month for life it wasnt a lot eno wasnt greedy though a thousand a month in the early sixties probably more than matched what he was making on the job but the amount didnt matter to bosch the payment did it was an admission if it could be traced to conklin it was hard evidence bosch felt himself getting excited the records hoarded by a corrupt cop dead five years now might be all he needed to go head to head with conklin he thought of something and looked around for the usual bank of phones he checked his watch and looked over at the gate people were milling about ready to board and getting anxious bosch put the file and envelopes back into the satchel and carried his things to the phone using his at t card he dialed information in sacramento and then dialed the state offices and asked for the corporate records unit in three minutes he knew that mccage inc was not a california corporation and never was at least in records going back to he hung up and went through the same process again this time calling the nevada state offices in carson city the phone clerk told him the incorporation of mccage inc was defunct and asked if he was still interested in what information the state had he excitedly said yes and was told by the clerk that she had to switch to microfiche and it would take a few minutes while he waited bosch got out a notebook and got ready to take notes he saw the gate door had been opened and people were just starting to board the plane he didnt care hed miss it if he had to he was too juiced to do anything but hang on to the phone bosch studied the rows of slot machines in the center of the terminal they were crowded with people trying their last chance at luck before leaving or their first chance after stepping off planes from all over the country and the world gambling against the machines had never appealed much to bosch he didnt understand it as he watched those milling about it was easy to pick who was winning and who wasnt it didnt take a detective to study the faces and know he saw one woman with a stuffed teddy bear clamped under her arm she was working two machines at once and bosch could see that all she was doing was doubling her losses to her left was a man in a black cowboy hat who was filling the machine with coins and pulling the arm back as quickly as he could bosch could see he was playing a dollar machine and was going to the fivedollar max on every roll bosch figured that in the few minutes he watched the man had spent sixty dollars with no return at least he wasnt carrying a stuffed animal bosch turned back to check the gate the line of boarders had thinned to a few stragglers bosch knew he was going to miss it but that was okay he hung on and stayed calm suddenly there was a shout and bosch looked over and saw the man with the cowboy hat waving it as his machine was paying off a jackpot the woman with the stuffed animal stepped back from her machines and solemnly watched the payoff each metallic ching of the dollars dropping in the tray must have been like a hammer pounding in her skull a steady reminder that she was losing take a look at me now baby the cowboy whooped it didnt appear that the exclamation was directed at anyone in particular he stooped down and started scooping the coins into his hat the woman with the teddy bear went back to work on her machines just as the gate door was being closed the clerk came back on the phone she told bosch the immediately available records showed mccage was incorporated in november and was dissolved by the state twentyeight years later when a year went by without renewal fees or taxes being paid to keep the incorporation current bosch knew this had occurred because eno had died do you want the officers the clerk asked yes i do okay president and chief executive officer is claude eno thats eno vice president is gordon mittel with two ts and the treasurer is listed as arno conklin that first names spelled i got it thanks bosch hung up the phone grabbed his overnighter and the satchel and ran to the gate just in time the attendant said with a tone of annoyance couldnt leave those onearmed bandits alone huh yeah bosch said not caring she opened the door and he went down the hallway and onto the plane it was only half filled he ignored his seat assignment and found an empty row while he was pushing his luggage into the overhead storage bin he thought of something once in his seat he took out his notebook and opened it to the page where he had just written the notes of his conversation with the incorporation clerk he looked at the abbreviated notations prez ceoce vpgm treasac he then wrote only the initials in a line ce gm ac he looked at the line for a moment and then smiled he saw the anagram and wrote it on the next line mc cage bosch felt the blood jangling through his body it was the feeling of knowing he was close he was on a roll those people out there at the slot machines and all the casinos in the desert could never understand it was a high they would never feel no matter how many sevens came up on the dice or how many black jacks they were dealt bosch was getting close to a killer and that made him as juiced as any jackpot winner on the planet chapter thirtyone driving the mustang out of lax an hour later bosch rolled the windows down and bathed his face in the cool dry air the sound of the breeze through the grove of eucalyptus trees at the airport gateway was always there like a welcome home somehow he always found it reassuring when he came back from his trips it was one of the things he loved about the city and he was glad it always greeted him he caught the light at sepulveda and used the time to change the time on his watch it was five minutes after two he decided that he would have just enough time to get home change into fresh clothes and grab something to eat before heading to parker center and his appointment with carmen hinojos he drove quickly under the overpass and then took the curving onramp up onto the crowded freeway as he turned the wheel to negotiate the turn he realized that his upper arms ached deep in the biceps and he wasnt sure if it was from his fight with the fish on saturday or from the way jasmine had gripped his arms while they made love he thought about her for a few more minutes and decided he would call her at the house before heading downtown their parting that morning already seemed long ago to him they had made promises to meet again as soon as possible and bosch hoped the promises would be kept she was a mystery to him one in which he knew he had not yet even begun to scratch the surface the wasnt set to reopen until the following day so bosch bypassed the exit and stayed on the until it rose over the santa monica mountains and dropped into the valley he took the long way because he bet it would be faster and because he had a mail drop in studio city that he had been using since the post office refused to deliver mail to a redtagged structure he transferred onto the and promptly hit a wall of traffic inching its way along the six lanes he stayed with it until impatience got the better of him he exited coldwater canyon boulevard and started taking surface streets on moorpark road he passed several apartment buildings that still hadnt been demolished or repaired the red tags and yellow tape bleached nearwhite by the months in the sun many of the condemned buildings still had signs like moves you in and newly remodeled on one redtagged structure with the telltale crisscross stress fractures running along its entire length someone had spraypainted a slogan that many took as the epitaph of the city in the months since the earthquake the fat lady has sung somedays it was hard not to believe it but bosch tried to keep the faith somebody had to the newspaper said more people were leaving than coming but no matter bosch thought im staying he cut over to ventura and stopped at the private mailbox office there was nothing but bills and junk mail in his box he stopped at a deli next door and ordered the special turkey on wholewheat with avocado and bean sprouts to go after that he stayed on ventura until it became cahuenga and then took the turn off to woodrow wilson drive and the climb up the hill to home on the first curve he had to slow on the narrow road to squeeze by an lapd squad car he waved but he knew they wouldnt know him they would be out of north hollywood division they didnt wave back he followed his usual practice of parking a half block away from his house and then walking back he decided to leave the satchel in the trunk because he might need the files downtown he headed down the street to his house with his overnighter in one hand and the sandwich bag in the other as he got to the carport he noticed a patrol car coming up the road he watched it and noticed it was the same two patrolmen he had just passed they had turned around for some reason he waited at the curb to see if they would stop to ask him for directions or maybe an explanation of his wave and because he didnt want them to see him enter the condemned house but the car drove by with neither of the patrolmen even looking at him the driver had his eyes on the road and the passenger was talking into the radio microphone it must be a call bosch thought he waited until the car had gone around the next curve and then headed into the carport after opening the kitchen door bosch stepped in and immediately felt that something was amiss he took two steps in before placing it there was a foreign odor in the house or at least the kitchen it was the scent of perfume he realized no he corrected it was cologne a man wearing cologne had either recently been in the house or was still there bosch quietly placed his overnighter and the sandwich bag on the kitchen floor and reached to his waist old habits died hard he still had no gun and he knew his backup was on the shelf in the closet near the front door for a moment he thought about running out to the street in hopes of catching the patrol car but he knew it was long gone instead he opened a drawer and quietly withdrew a small paring knife there were longer blades in there but the small knife would be easier to handle he stepped toward the archway that led from the kitchen to the houses front entry at the threshold still hidden from whoever might be out there he stopped tilted his head forward and listened he could hear the low hiss of the freeway down the hill behind the house but nothing from within nearly a minute of silence passed he was about to step out of the kitchen when he heard a sound it was the slight whisper of cloth moving maybe the crossing or uncrossing of legs he knew someone was in the living room and he knew by now that they would know that he knew detective bosch a voice said from the silence of the house it is safe for you you can come out bosch knew the voice but was operating at such an acute level of intensity he couldnt immediately compute it and place it all he knew was that he had heard it before its assistant chief irving detective bosch the voice said could you please step out that way you dont get hurt and we dont get hurt yes that was the voice bosch relaxed put the knife down on the counter the sandwich bag in the refrigerator and stepped out of the kitchen irving was there sitting in the living room chair two men in suits whom bosch didnt recognize sat on the couch looking around bosch could see his box of letters and cards from the closet sitting on the coffee table he saw the murder book that he had left on the dining room table was sitting on the lap of one of the strangers they had been searching his house going through his things bosch suddenly realized what had happened outside i saw your lookout anybody want to tell me whats going on whereve you been bosch one of the suits asked bosch looked at him not a single glimmer of recognition hit him who the fuck are you he bent down and picked the box of cards and letters up off the coffee table where it had been in front of the man detective irving said this is lieutenant angel brockman and this is earl sizemore bosch nodded he recognized one of the names ive heard of you he said looking at brockman youre the one who sent bill connors to the closet that mustve been good for iad man of the month quite an honor the sarcasm in boschs voice was unmistakable as he intended it to be the closet was where most cops kept their guns while off duty going to the closet was department slang for a cop killing himself connors was an old beat cop in hollywood division who had killed himself the year before while he was under iad investigation for trading dime bags of heroin to runaway girls for sex after he was dead the runaways had admitted making up the complaints because connors was always hassling them to move off his beat he had been a good man but saw everything stacked against him and decided to go to the closet that was his choice bosch and now youve got yours you want to tell us where youve been the last twentyfour you want to tell me what this is about he heard a clunking sound coming from the bedroom what the hell he walked to the door and saw another suit in his bedroom standing over the open drawer of the night table hey fuckhead get out of there get out now bosch stepped in and kicked the drawer closed the man stepped back raised his hands like a prisoner and walked out to the living room and this is jerry toliver irving added hes with lieutenant brockman iad detective sizemore has joined us here from rhd fantastic bosch said so everybody knows everybody whats going on he looked at irving as he said this believing if he was going to get a straight answer from anyone here it would be him irving was generally a straight shooter when it came to his dealings with bosch deharry we have got to ask you some questions irving said it would be best if we explain things later bosch could tell this one was serious you got a warrant to be in here well show it to you later brockman said lets go where are we going downtown bosch had had enough runins with the internal affairs division to know things were being handled differently here just the fact that irving the secondhighestranking officer in the department was with them was an indication of the gravity of the situation he guessed it was more than their simply finding out about his private investigation if it was just that irving wouldnt have been here there was something terribly wrong all right bosch said whos dead all four looked at him with faces of stone confirming that in fact someone was dead bosch felt his chest tighten and for the first time he began to be scared the names and faces of people he had involved flashed through his mind meredith roman jake mckittrick keisha russell the two women in las vegas who else jazz could he have possibly put her in some kind of danger then it hit him keisha russell the reporter had probably done what he told her not to she had gone to conklin or mittel and asked questions about the old clip she had pulled for bosch she had walked in blindly and was now dead because of her mistake keisha russell he asked he got no reply irving stood up and the others followed sizemore kept the murder book in his hand he was going to take it brockman went into the kitchen picked up the overnighter and carried it to the door harry why dont you ride with earl and i irving said how bout i meet you guys down there you ride with me it was said sternly it invited no further debate bosch raised his hands acknowledging he had no choice and moved toward the door bosch sat in the back of sizemores ltd directly behind irving he looked out the window as they went down the hill he kept thinking of the young reporters face her eagerness had killed her but bosch couldnt help but share the blame he had planted the seed of mystery in her mind and it had grown until she couldnt resist it whered they find her he asked he was met only with silence he couldnt understand why they said nothing especially irving the assistant chief had led him to believe in the past that they had an understanding if not a liking between each other i told her not to do anything he said i told her to sit on it a few days irving turned his body so that he could partially see bosch behind him detective i dont know who or what youre talking about keisha russell dont know her he turned back around bosch was puzzled the names and faces went through his mind again he added jasmine but then subtracted her she knew nothing about the case mckittrick detective irving said and again struggled to turn around to look at bosch we are involved in the investigation of the homicide of lieutenant harvey pounds these other names are not involved if you think they are people that should be contacted please let me know bosch was too stunned to answer harvey pounds that made no sense he had nothing to do with the case didnt even know about it pounds never left the office how could he have gotten into danger then it came to him washing over him like a wave of water that brought with it a chill he understood it made sense and in the moment that he saw that it did he also saw his own responsibility as well as his own predicament am i he couldnt finish yes irving said you are currently considered a suspect now maybe you will be quiet until we can set up a formal interview bosch leaned his head against the window glass and closed his eyes ah jesus and in that moment he realized he was no better than brockman was for having sent a man to the closet for bosch knew in the dark part of his heart that he was responsible he didnt know how or when it had happened but he knew he had killed harvey pounds and he carried poundss badge in his pocket chapter thirtytwo bosch was numb to most of what was going on around him after they reached parker center he was escorted up to irving s office on the sixth floor and then placed in a chair in the adjoining conference room he was in there alone for a half hour before brockman and toliver came in brockman sat directly across from bosch toliver to harrys right it was obvious to bosch by their being in irving s conference room instead of an iad interview room that irving wanted to keep a tight control on this one if it turned out to be a copkilledcop case hed need all the control he could muster to contain it it could be a publicity debacle to rival those of the rodney king days through his daze and the jarring images of pounds being dead a pressing thought finally got boschs attention he was in serious trouble himself he told himself he couldnt retreat into a shell he must be alert the man sitting across from him would like nothing better than to hang a killing on bosch and he was willing to go to any extreme to do it it wasnt good enough that bosch knew in his own mind that he had not at least physically killed pounds he had to defend himself and so he resolved that he would show brockman nothing he would be just as tough as anybody in the room he cleared his throat and began before brockman got the chance when did it happen im asking the questions i can save you time brockman tell me when it happened and ill tell you where i was well get this over with i understand why im a suspect i wont hold it against you but youre wasting your time bosch dont you feel anything at all a man is dead you worked with him bosch stared at him a long moment before answering in an even voice what i feel doesnt matter nobody deserves to be killed but im not going to miss him and i certainly wont miss working for him jesus brockman shook his head the man had a wife a kid in college maybe they wont miss him either you never know the guy was a prick at work no reason to expect him to be anything else at home whats your wife think about you brockman save it bosch im not falling for any of your do you believe in god brickman bosch used brockmans nickname in the department awarded to him for his methodical way of building cases against other cops like the late bill connors this isnt about me or what i believe in bosch were talking about you thats right were talking about me so ill tell you what i think im not sure what i believe my lifes more than half over and i still havent figured it out but the theory im leaning toward is that everybody on this planet has some kind of energy that makes them what they are its all about energy and when you die it just goes somewhere else and pounds he was bad energy and now its gone somewhere else so i dont feel too bad about him dying to answer your question but id like to know where that bad energy went hope you didnt get any brickman you already have a lot he winked at brockman and saw the momentary confusion in the iad detectives face as he tried to interpret what the jibe had meant he seemed to shake it off and go on enough of the bullshit why did you confront lieutenant pounds in his office on thursday you know that was off limits while you are on leave well it was kindve like one of those catch situations i think thats what they call em it was off limits to go there but then pounds my commanding officer called me up and told me i had to turn in my car see it was that bad energy working i was already on involuntary leave but he couldnt leave well enough alone he had to take my car too so i brought him in the keys he was my supervisor and it was an order so going there broke one of the rules but not going would have broken one too whyd you threaten him i didnt he filed an addendum to the assault complaint of two weeks earlier i dont care what he filed there was no threat the guy was a coward he probably felt threatened but there was no threat there is a difference bosch looked over at the other suit toliver it looked as if he was going to be silent the whole time that was his role he just stared at bosch as if he were a tv screen bosch looked around the rest of the room and for the first time noticed the phone on the banquette to the left of the table the green light signaled a conference call was on the interview was being piped out of the room probably to a tape recorder probably to irving in his office next door there is a witness brockman said to what the threat ill tell you what lieutenant why dont you tell me exactly what the threat was so i know what were talking about after all if you believe i made it whats wrong with me knowing what it was i said brockman gave it some thought before answering very simple as most are you told him if he ever quote fucked with you again youd kill him not too original but damning as hell right well fuck you brockman i never said that i dont doubt that that asshole wrote up an addendum that was just his style but whoever this wit is you got theyre full of shit you know henry korchmar henry korchmar bosch had no idea whom he was talking about then he realized brockman meant old henry of the nod squad bosch had never known his last name and so hearing it in this context had confused him the old guy he wasnt in the room hes no witness i told him to get out and he did whatever he told you he probably backed pounds because he was scared but he wasnt there you go ahead with it brockman ill be able to pull twelve people out of that squadroom who watched the whole thing through the glass and theyll say henry wasnt in there theyll say pounds was a liar and everybody knew it and then wheres your threat brockman said nothing into the silence so bosch continued see you didnt do your work my guess is that you know everybody who works in that squadroom thinks people like you are the bottom feeders of this department theyve got more respect for the people they put in jail and you know that brickman so you were too intimidated to go to them instead you rely on some old mans word and he probably didnt even know pounds was dead when you talked to him bosch could tell by the way brockmans eyes darted away that he had nailed him empowered with the victory he stood up and headed toward the door where are you going to get some water jerry go with him bosch paused at the door and looked back what do you think im going to run brockman you think that and you dont know the first thing about me you think that and you havent prepared for this interview why dont you come over to hollywood one day and ill teach you how to interview murder suspects free of charge bosch walked out toliver following at the water fountain down the hall he took a long drink of water and then wiped his mouth with his hand he felt nervous frayed he didnt know how long it would be before brockman could see through the front he was putting up as he walked back to the conference room toliver stayed a silent three paces behind him youre still young bosch said over his shoulder there might be a chance for you toliver bosch stepped back into the conference room just as brockman stepped through a door from the other side of the room bosch knew it was a direct entrance to irving s office he had once worked an investigation of a serial killer out of this room and under irving s thumb both men sat down across from each other again now then brockman started im going to read you your rights detective bosch he took a small card from his wallet and proceeded to read to bosch the miranda warning bosch knew for sure the phone line was going to a tape recorder this was something they would want on tape now brockman said when he was finished do you agree to waive those rights and talk to us about this situation its a situation now huh i thought it was a murder yeah ill waive jerry go get a waiver i dont have one here jerry got up and left through the hallway door bosch could hear his feet moving quickly on the linoleum then a door open he was taking the stairs down to iad on the fifth uh lets start by dont you want to wait until you have your witness back or is this being secretly recorded without my knowledge this immediately flustered brockman yes bosch its being secits being recorded but not secretly we told you before we started that wed be taping good coverup lieutenant that last line that was a good one ill have to remember that one now lets start with the door opened and toliver came in with a sheet of paper he handed it to brockman who studied it a moment made sure it was the correct form and slid it across the table to bosch harry grabbed it and quickly scribbled a signature on the appropriate line he was familiar with the form he slid it back and brockman put it off to the side of the table without looking at it so he didnt notice the signature bosch had written was fuck you all right lets get this going bosch give us your whereabouts over the last seventytwo hours you dont want to search me first do you how bout you jerry bosch stood up opening his jacket so they could see he was not armed he thought by taunting them like this they would do the exact opposite and not search him carrying poundss badge was a piece of evidence that would probably put him in the ground if they discovered it siddown bosch brockman barked were not going to search you were trying to give you every benefit of the doubt but you make it damn hard bosch sat back down relieved for the time being now just give us your whereabouts we dont have all day bosch thought about this he was surprised by the window of time they wanted seventytwo hours he wondered what had happened to pounds and why they hadnt narrowed time of death to a shorter span seventytwo hours ago well about seventytwo hours ago it was friday afternoon and i was in chinatown at the fiftyonefifty building which reminds me im due over there in ten minutes so boys if youll excuse me he stood up siddown bosch thats been taken care of sit down bosch sat down and said nothing he realized though that he actually felt disappointed he would miss the session with carmen hinojos come on bosch lets hear it what happened after that i dont remember all the details but i ate over at the red wind that night also stopped at the epicentre for a few drinks then i got to the airport about ten i took a redeye to florida to tampa spent the weekend there and got back about an hour and a half before i found you people illegally inside my home its not illegal we had a warrant ive been shown no warrant never mind that what do you mean you were in florida i guess i mean i was in florida what do you think it means you can prove this bosch reached into his pocket took out his airline folder with the ticket receipt and slid it across the table for starters theres the ticket receipt i think theres one in there for a rental car too brockman quickly opened the ticket folder and started reading what were you doing there he asked without looking up dr hinojos thats the company shrink said i should try to get away and i thought how bout florida id never been there and all my life ive liked orange juice i thought what the hell florida brockman was flustered again he wasnt expecting something like this bosch could tell most cops never realized how important the initial interview with a suspect or witness was to an investigation it informed all other interviews and even court testimony that followed you had to be prepared like lawyers you had to know most of the answers before you asked the questions the iad relied so much on its presence as an intimidating factor that most of the detectives assigned to the division never really had to prepare for interviews and when they hit a wall like this they didnt know what to do okay bosch uh what did you do in florida you ever heard that song marvin gaye sang before he got killed its called what are you talking about sexual healing it says its good for the soul ive heard it toliver said both brockman and bosch looked at him sorry he offered again bosch brockman said what are you talking about im talking about that i spent most of the time with a woman i know there most of the other time i spent with a fishing guide on a boat in the gulf of mexico what im talking about asshole is that i was with people almost every minute and the times i wasnt werent long enough for me to fly back here and kill pounds i dont even know when he was killed but ill tell you right now you dont have a case brockman because there is no case youre looking in the wrong direction bosch had chosen his words carefully he was unsure what if anything they knew about his private investigation and he wasnt going to give them anything if he could help it they had the murder book and the evidence box but he thought that he might be able to explain all of that away they also had his notebook because he had stuffed it into his overnighter at the airport in it were the names numbers and addresses of jasmine and mckittrick the address of the eno house in vegas and other notes about the case but they might not be able to put together what it all meant not if he was lucky brockman pulled a notebook and pen from the inside pocket of his jacket okay bosch give me the name of the woman and this fishing guide i need their numbers everything i dont think so brockmans eyes widened i dont care what you think give me the names bosch said nothing just stared down at the table in front of him bosch youve told us your whereabouts now we need to confirm them i know where i was at thats all i need if youre in the clear as you claim let us check it out clear you and move on to other things other possibilities youve got the airlines and the car rental right there start with that im not dragging people into this who dont need to be theyre good people and unlike you they like me im not going to let you spoil that by having you come in with your concrete block feet and step all over the relationships you dont have a choice bosch oh yes i do right now i do you want to try to make a case against me do it if it gets to that point ill bring these people out and theyll blow your shit away brockman you think at the moment youve got pr problems in the department over sending bill connors to the closet youll end this case with worse pr than nixon had im not giving you the names if you want to write something down there in your notebook just write that i said fuck you that ought to cover it brockmans face got kind of blotchy with pinks and whites he was quiet a moment before speaking know what i think i still think you did it i think you hired somebody to do it and you went waltzing off to florida so youd be nowhere near here a fishing guide if that doesnt sound like a conjuredup piece of shit i dont know what does and the woman who was she some hooker you picked up in a bar what was she a fiftydollar alibi or did you go a hundred in one explosive move bosch shoved the table toward brockman catching him completely by surprise it slid under his arms and crashed into his chest his chair tipped back against the wall behind him bosch kept the pressure on his end and pinned brockman against the wall bosch pushed back on his own chair until it was against the wall behind him he raised his left leg and put his foot against the table to keep the pressure on it he saw the blotches of color on brockmans face become more pronounced as he went without air his eyes bugged but he had no leverage and couldnt move the table off himself toliver was slow to react stunned he seemed to look at brockman for a long moment as if awaiting orders before jumping up and moving toward bosch bosch was able to fend off his first effort shoving the younger man back into a potted palm tree that was in the corner of the room while bosch did this he saw in his peripheral vision a figure enter the room through the other door then his chair was abruptly knocked over and he was on the ground with a heavy weight on top of him by turning his head slightly he could see it was irving dont move bosch irving yelled in his ear settle down right now bosch went limp to signify his compliance and irving got off him bosch stayed still for a few moments and then put a hand up on the table to pull himself up as he got up he saw brockman hacking and trying to get air into his lungs while holding both hands against his chest irving held one hand out to boschs chest as a calming gesture and a means of stopping him from taking another run at brockman with his other hand he pointed at toliver who was trying to right the potted palm it had become uprooted and wouldnt stand up he finally just leaned it against the wall you irving snapped at him out but sir the get out toliver quickly left through the hallway door as brockman was finally finding his voice buhbosch you sonova bitch youyoure going to jail you nobodys going to jail irving said sternly nobodys going to jail irving stopped to gulp down some air bosch noticed that the assistant chief seemed just as winded as anybody in the room there will be no charges on this irving finally continued lieutenant you baited him and got what you got irving s tone invited no debate brockman his chest still heaving put his elbows on the table and began running his fingers through his hair trying to look as if he still had some composure but all he had was defeat irving turned to bosch anger bunching the muscles of his jaw into hard surfaces and you bosch i dont know how to help you youre always the loose cannon you knew what he was doing youve done it yourself but you couldnt sit there and take it what kind of man are you bosch didnt say anything and he doubted irving wanted a spoken answer brockman started coughing and irving looked back at him are you all right i think go across the street have one of the paramedics check you out no im all right good then go down to your office take a break i have someone else i want to have talk to bosch i want to continue the inter the interview is over lieutenant you blew it then looking at bosch he added you both did chapter thirtythree irving left bosch alone in the conference room and in a few moments carmen hinojos walked in she took the same seat that brockman had sat in she looked at bosch with eyes that seemed filled with equal parts anger and disappointment but bosch didnt flinch under her gaze harry i cant believe he held a finger up to his mouth silencing her what is it are our sessions still supposed to be private of course even in here yes what is it bosch got up and walked to the phone on the counter he pushed the button that disconnected the conference call he returned to his seat i hope that was left on unintentionally im going to speak to chief irving about that youre probably speaking to him right now the phone was too obvious hes probably got the room wired cmon harry this isnt the cia no its not sometimes its even worse all im saying is irving the iad they still might be listening somehow be careful what you say carmen hinojos looked exasperated im not paranoid doctor ive been through this before all right never mind i really dont care whos listening or not i cant believe what you just did it makes me very sad and disappointed what have our meetings been about nothing im sitting in there hearing you resort to the same type of violence that brought you to me in the first place harry this isnt some joke this is real life and i have to make a decision that could very well decide your future this makes it all the more difficult to do he waited until he was sure she was done you were in there with irving the whole time yes he called and explained the situation and asked me to come over and sit in i have to say wait a minute before we go any further did you talk to him did you tell him about our sessions no of course not okay for the record i just want to reiterate that i do not give up any of my protections under the patientdoctor relationship we okay on that for the first time she looked away from him he could see her face turning dark with anger do you know what an insult that is for you to tell me that what do you think id tell him about our sessions just because he may have ordered me to did he you dont trust me at all do you did he no he didnt thats good its not just me you dont trust anyone bosch realized that he had been out of line he could see though that there was more hurt than anger in her face im sorry youre right i shouldnt have said that im justi dont know ive got my back to the corner here doctor when that happens sometimes you forget whos on your side and who isnt yes and as a matter of course you respond with violence against those who you perceive are not on your side this is not good to see its very very disappointing he looked away from her and over to the potted palm in the corner before leaving the room irving had replanted it getting his hands dirty with black soil bosch noticed it was still slightly tilted to the left so what are you doing up here he asked what does irving want he wanted me to sit in his office and listen to your interview on the conference line he said he was interested in my evaluation of your answers as to whether i believed you could have been responsible for the death of lieutenant pounds thanks to you and your attack on your interviewer he didnt need any evaluation from me its clear at this point you are prone to and quite capable of violence against fellow police officers thats bullshit and you know it damn it what i did in here to that guy masquerading as a cop was a lot different than what they think i did youre talking about things that are worlds apart and if you dont see that youre making your living in the wrong business im not so sure have you ever killed anyone doctor saying the question reminded him of his true confessions conversation with jasmine of course not well i have and believe me its a lot different than roughing up some pompous ass in a suit with a shine on its ass a lot different if you or they think that doing one means you can do the other you all have a lot to learn they were both quiet for a long while letting their anger ebb away all right he finally said so what happens now i dont know chief irving just asked me to sit in with you to calm you i guess hes figuring out what to do next i guess im not doing a very good job of calming you what did he say when he first asked you to come up here and listen he just called me and explained what happened and said he wanted my take on the interview you have to understand something despite your problems with authority he is one person who i think is in your court on this i dont think he honestly believes youre involved in the death of your lieutenantat least directly but he realizes that you are a viable suspect who needs to be questioned i think if you had held your temper during the interview this all mightve been over for you soon they wouldve checked your story in florida and that would have been the end of it i even told them that you told me you were going to florida i dont want them checking my story i dont want them involved well its too late he knows youre up to something how when he called to ask me to come over he mentioned the file on your mothers case the murder book he said it was found at your house he also said they found the stored evidence from the case there and and he asked if i knew what you were doing with all of it so he did ask you to reveal what weve talked about in our sessions in an indirect way sounds pretty direct to me did he say specifically that it was my mothers case yes he did what did you tell him i told him that i was not at liberty to discuss anything that was talked about in our sessions it didnt satisfy him im not surprised another wave of silence washed between them her eyes wandered the room his stayed on hers listen what do you know about what happened to pounds very little irving must have told you something you mustve asked he said pounds was found in the trunk of his car sunday evening i guess he had been there a while a day maybe the chief said hethe body showed signs of torture particularly sadistic mutilation he said he didnt go into detail it had happened before pounds was dead they do know that he said that hed been in a lot of pain he wanted to know if you were the type of man who couldve done that bosch said nothing he was imagining the crime scene in his mind his guilt came crushing back down on him and for a moment he thought he might even get nauseous for what its worth i said no what i told him you werent the type of man who couldve done that bosch nodded but his thoughts were already a great distance away again what had happened to pounds was becoming clear and bosch carried the guilt of having set things in motion though legally innocent he knew he was morally culpable pounds was a man he despised had less respect for than some of the murderers he had known but the weight of the guilt was bearing down on him he ran his hands hard over his face and through his hair he felt a shudder move through his body are you all right hinojos asked im fine bosch took out his cigarettes and started to light one with his bic harry you better not this isnt my office i dont care where was he found what pounds where was he found i dont know you mean where was the car i dont know i didnt ask she studied him and he noticed the hand that held his cigarette was shaking all right harry thats it whats the matter what is going on bosch looked at her for a long moment and nodded okay you want to know i did it i killed him her face immediately reacted as if perhaps she had seen the killing firsthand so close that she had been spattered with blood it was a horrible face repulsed and she moved back in her chair as if even a few more inches of separation from him were needed youyou mean this story about florida was no i dont mean i killed him not with my hands i mean what ive done what ive been doing it got him killed i got him killed how do you know you cant know for sure that i know believe me i know he looked away from her to a painting on the wall over the banquette it was a generic depiction of a beach scene he looked back at hinojos its funny he said but didnt finish he just shook his head what is he got up and reached to the potted palm and stubbed the cigarette out in the dark soil what is funny harry he sat back down and looked at her the civilized people in the world the ones who hide behind culture and art and politicsand even the law theyre the ones to watch out for theyve got that perfect disguise goin for them you know but theyre the most vicious theyre the most dangerous people on earth chapter thirtyfour it seemed to bosch that the day would never end that he would never get out of the conference room after hinojos left it was irving s turn he came in silently took the brockman seat and folded his hands on the table and said nothing he looked irritated bosch thought maybe he smelled the smoke bosch didnt care about that but he found the silence discomforting what about brockman hes gone you heard me tell him he blew it so did you hows that you couldve talked your way out of it couldve let him check your story and be done with it but you had to make another enemy you had to be harry bosch thats where you and i differ chief you oughta get out of the office and come out on the street again sometime i didnt make brockman an enemy he was my enemy before i even met him they all are and you know im really getting tired of everybody analyzing me and sticking their noses up my ass its getting real old somebodys got to do it you dont you dont know a thing about it irving waved boschs pale defense away like cigarette smoke so what now bosch continued why are you here you going to try to break my alibi now is that it brockmans out and youre in i dont need to break your alibi its been checked and it looks like it holds brockman and his people have already been instructed to follow other avenues of investigation what do you mean its been checked give us some credit here bosch the names were in your notebook he reached into his coat and pulled out the notebook he tossed it across the table to bosch this woman that you spent some time with over there she told me enough to the point that i believed it you might want to call her yourself though she certainly seemed confused by my call i was rather circumspect in my explanation i appreciate that so then i guess im free to split bosch stood up in a technical sense and the other senses sit down for a minute detective bosch held his hands up hed gone this far he decided he might as well go all the way and hear it all he sat back down in his chair with a meager protest my butts getting sore from all this sitting i knew jake mckittrick irving said knew him well we worked hollywood together many years ago but you know that already as nice as it is to touch base with an old colleague i cant say i enjoyed anything about the conversation i had with my old friend jake you called him too while you were in here with the doctor so then what do you want from me you got the story from him whats left irving drummed his fingers on the tabletop what do i want what i want is for you to tell me that what you are doing what you have been doing is in no way connected to what has happened to lieutenant pounds i cant chief i dont know what happened to him other than that hes dead irving studied bosch for a long moment contemplating something deciding whether to treat him as an equal and tell him the story i guess i expected an immediate denial your answer already suggests that you think there might be a correlation i cant tell you how much that bothers me anything is possible chief let me ask you this you said brockman and his crew were out chasing other leadsi guess avenues is what you said are any of these avenues viable i mean did pounds have a secret life or are they just out there chasing their tails theres nothing that stands out im afraid you were the best lead brockman still thinks so he wants to pursue the theory that you hired a hitman of some sort and then flew to florida to establish an alibi yeah thats a good one i think it stretches credibility some i told him to drop it for the moment and im telling you to drop what you are doing this woman in florida sounds like the kind of person you could spend some time with i want you to get on a plane and go back to her stay a couple weeks when you come back well talk about going back on the homicide table at hollywood bosch was unsure whether there was a threat in all that irving had just said if not a threat then maybe a bribe and if i dont if you dont then you are stupid and you deserve whatever happens to you what is it that you think im doing chief i dont think i know what youre doing its easy you pulled the book on your mothers homicide why at this particular point in time youve done this i dont know but youre out running a freelance investigation and thats a problem for us you have to stop it harry or ill stop you ill shut you down permanently who are you protecting bosch saw the anger move into irving s face as his skin turned from pink to an intense red his eyes seemed to grow smaller and darker with fury dont you ever suggest such a thing ive dedicated my life to this depart its yourself isnt it you knew her you found her youre afraid of being dragged into this if i put something together on it i bet you already knew everything mckittrick told you on the phone thats ridiculous i is it is it i dont think so ive already talked to one witness who remembers you from those days on the boulevard beat what witness she said she knew you she knows my mother knew you too the only person i am protecting is you bosch cant you see that im ordering you to stop this investigation you cant i dont work for you anymore im on leave remember involuntary leave that makes me a citizen now and i can do whatever i goddamn want to do as long as its legal i could charge you with possession of stolen documentsthe murder book it wasnt stolen besides what if you bullshit a case whats that a misdemeanor theyll laugh you out of the city attorneys office on your ass with that but youd lose your job that would be it youre a little late with that one chief a week ago that wouldve been a valid threat id have to consider it but it doesnt matter anymore im free of all of that bullshit now and this is all that matters to me and i dont care what i have to do im doing it irving was silent and bosch guessed that the assistant chief was realizing that bosch had moved beyond his reach irving s hold over boschs job and future had been his leverage before but bosch had finally broken free bosch began again in a low calm voice if you were me chief could you just walk away what does doing what i do for the department matter if i cant do this for herand for me he stood up and put the notebook into his jacket pocket im going wheres the rest of my stuff no bosch hesitated irving looked up at him and bosch saw the anger was gone now i did nothing wrong irving said quietly sure you did bosch said just as quietly he leaned over the table until he was only a few feet away we all did chief we let it go that was our crime but not anymore at least not with me if you want to help you know how to reach me he headed toward the door what do you want bosch looked back at him tell me about pounds i need to know what happened its the only way ill know if its connected then sit down bosch took the chair by the door and sat down they both took some time to calm down before irving finally spoke we started looking for him saturday night we found his car sunday noon in griffith park one of the tunnels closed after the quake it was like they knew wed be looking from the air so they put the car in a tunnel whyd you start looking before you knew he was dead the wife she started calling saturday morning she said hed gotten a call friday night at home she didnt know who but whoever it was managed to convince pounds to leave the house and meet him pounds didnt tell his wife what it was about he said hed be back in an hour or two he left and never came back in the morning she called us pounds is unlisted i assume yes that gives rise to the probability it was someone in the department bosch thought about this not necessarily it just had to be someone with connections to people in the city people that could get his number with a phone call you ought to put out the word grant amnesty to anyone who comes forward and says they gave up the number say youll go light in exchange for the name of the person they gave it to thats who you want chances are whoever gave out the number didnt know what was going to happen irving nodded thats an idea within the department there are hundreds who could get his number there may be no other way to go tell me more about pounds we went to work right there in the tunnel by sunday the media had wind that we were looking for him so the tunnel worked to our advantage no helicopters flying over bothering us we just set up lights in the tunnel he was in the car bosch was acting like he knew nothing he knew that if he expected hinojos to respect his confidences he must in turn respect hers yes he was in the trunk and my god was it bad hehed been stripped of his clothes hed been beaten thenthen there was the evidence of torture bosch waited but irving had stopped what what did they do to him they burned him the genitals nipples fingersmy god irving ran his hand over his shaven scalp and closed his eyes while he did it bosch could see that he could not get the images out of his mind bosch was having trouble with it too his guilt was like a palpable object in his chest it was like they wanted something from him irving said but he couldnt give it he didnt have it andand they kept at him suddenly bosch felt the slight tremor of an earthquake and reached for the table to steady himself he looked at irving for confirmation and realized there was no tremor it was himself shaking again wait a minute the room tilted slightly then righted itself what is it wait a minute without another word bosch stood up and went out the door he quickly went down the hall to the mens room by the water fountain there was someone in front of one of the sinks shaving but bosch didnt take the time to look at him he pushed through one of the stall doors and vomited into the toilet barely making it in time he flushed the toilet but the spasm came again and then again until he was empty until he had nothing left inside but the image of pounds naked and dead tortured you okay in there buddy a voice said from outside the stall just leave me alone sorry just asking bosch stayed in the stall a few more minutes leaning against the wall eventually he wiped his mouth with toilet paper and then flushed it down he stepped out of the stall unsteadily and went to the sink the other man was still there now he was putting on a tie bosch glanced at him in the mirror but didnt recognize him he bent over the sink and rinsed his face and mouth out with cold water he then used paper towels to dry off he never looked at himself once in the mirror thanks for asking he said as he left irving looked as if he hadnt moved while bosch was gone are you all right bosch sat down and took out his cigarettes sorry but im gonna smoke you already have been bosch lit up and took a deep drag he stood up and walked to the trash can in the corner there was an old coffee cup in it and he took it to use as an ashtray just one he said then you can open the door and air the place out its a bad habit in this town so is breathing how did he die what was the fatal injury the autopsy was this morning heart failure the strain on him was too much his heart gave way bosch paused a moment he felt the beginning of his strength coming back why dont you tell me the rest of it there is no rest of it thats it there was nothing there no evidence on the body no evidence in the car it had been wiped clean there was nothing to go on what about his clothes they were there in the trunk no help the killer kept one thing though what his shield the bastard took his badge bosch just nodded and averted his eyes they were both silent for a long time bosch couldnt get the images out of his mind and he guessed irving was having the same problem so bosch finally said looking at what had been done to him the torture and everything you immediately thought of me thats a real vote of confidence look detective you had put the mans face through a window two weeks earlier we had gotten an added report from him that you had threatened him what there was no threat he i dont care if there was or wasnt he made the report thats the point true or false he made the report therefore he felt threatened by you what were we supposed to do ignore it just say harry bosch oh no theres no way our own harry bosch could do this and go on dont be ridiculous all right youre right forget it he didnt say anything at all to his wife before leaving only that someone called and he had to go out for an hour to a meeting with a very important person no name was mentioned the call came in about nine friday night is that exactly how she said he said it i believe so why because if he said it in that way then it sounds like two people may be involved how so it just sounds as though one person called him to set up a meeting with a second person this very important person if that person had made the call then he would have told the wife that so and so the big important guy just called and i have to go meet him see what i mean i do but whoever called could have also used the name of an important person as bait to draw pounds out that actual person may not have been involved at all thats also true but i think that whatever was said it would have to have been convincing to get pounds out at night by himself maybe it was someone he already knew maybe but then he probably would have told his wife the name true did he take anything with him a briefcase files anything not that we know of the wife was in the tv room she didnt see him actually go out the door weve been over all of this with her weve been all over the house theres nothing his briefcase was in his office at the station he didnt even take it home with him theres nothing to go on to be honest you were the best candidate and youre clear now it brings me back to my question could what youve been doing have had anything to do with this bosch could not bring himself to tell irving what he thought what he knew in his gut had happened to pounds it wasnt the guilt that stopped him though it was the desire to keep his mission to himself in that moment he realized that vengeance was a singular thing a solo mission something never to be spoken of out loud i dont know the answer he said i told pounds nothing but he wanted me to go down you know that the guys dead but he was an asshole and he wanted me to go down so hed have had his ear to the ground for anything about me a couple people have seen me around in the last week word couldve gotten back to him and he couldve blundered into something he wasnt much of an investigator he couldve made a mistake i dont know irving looked at him through dead eyes bosch knew he was trying to determine how much was true and how much was bullshit bosch spoke first he said he was going to meet someone important yes look chief i dont know what mckittrick told you about the conversation i had out there with him but you know there were important people involved backyou know with my mother you were there yes i was there but i wasnt part of the investigation not after the first day did mckittrick tell you about arno conklin not today but back then i remember once when i asked him what was happening with the case he told me to ask arno he said arno was running interference for someone on it well arno conklin was an important person but now hes an old man if hes even still alive hes alive chief and you have to remember something important men surround themselves with important men theyre never alone conklin may be old but there could be someone else who isnt what are you telling me bosch im telling you to leave me alone i have to do this im the only one who can im telling you to keep brockman and everybody else away from me irving stared at him a long moment and bosch could tell he didnt know which way to go with this bosch stood up ill keep in touch youre not telling me everything its better that way he stepped through the door into the hallway remembered something and then stepped back into the room with irving how am i going to get home you brought me here irving reached over to the phone chapter thirtyfive bosch went through he fifthfloor door to the internal affairs division and found no one behind the counter he waited a few moments for toliver to show up since irving had just ordered him to drive bosch home but the young iad detective never showed bosch figured it was just one more mind game they were trying to play with him he didnt want to walk around the counter and have to find toliver so he just yelled his name out behind the counter was a door that was slightly ajar and he was reasonably sure toliver heard the call but the person who stepped through the door was brockman he stared at bosch for a long moment without saying anything look brockman toliver is supposed to run me home bosch said to him i dont want anything else to do with you yeah well thats too bad just get toliver you better watch out for me bosch yeah i know ill be watching yeah and you wont see me coming bosch nodded and looked past him to the door where he expected toliver to step out any moment he just wanted to diffuse the situation and get his ride home he considered walking out and catching a cab but he knew in rush hour it would probably cost him fifty bucks he didnt have it on him plus he liked the idea of having an iad shine chauffeur him home hey killer bosch looked back at brockman he was getting tired of this whats it like to fuck another killer must really be something to go all the way to florida for it bosch tried to stay cool but he felt his face betray himself for he suddenly knew who and what brockman was talking about what are you talking about brockmans face lit up with a bullys delight as he read boschs surprised look oooh baby she didnt even bother telling you did she tell me what bosch wanted to reach over the counter and drag brockman across it but at least outwardly he maintained his cool tell you what ill tell you what i think your whole story stinks and im going to bust it open then mr clean upstairs isnt going to be able to protect you he said you were told to leave me alone that i was clear fuck him and fuck you when i come in with your alibi in a bag hes not going to have a choice but to cut you loose toliver stepped through the doorway behind the counter he was holding a set of car keys in his hands he stood silently behind brockman with his eyes down first thing i did was run her on the computer brockman said shes got a record bosch you didnt know that shes a killer just like you takes one to know one i guess nice couple bosch wanted to ask a thousand questions but he wouldnt ask any of this man he felt a deep void opening inside as he began jettisoning his feelings for jazz he realized that she had left all the signs out for him but he hadnt read them even so the feeling that descended on him with the strongest grip was one of betrayal bosch pointedly ignored brockman and looked at toliver hey kid you going to give me a ride or what toliver moved around the counter without answering bosch i already got you on an association beef brockman said but im not satisfied bosch went to the hallway door and opened it it was against lapd regulations to associate with known criminals whether brockman could make a charge like that stick was the least of boschs worries he headed out the door with toliver following before it closed brockman yelled after them give her a kiss for me killer chapter thirtysix at first bosch sat silently next to jerry toliver on the ride back to his house he had a waterfall of thoughts dropping through his mind and decided to simply ignore the young iad detective toliver left the police scanner on and the sporadic chatter was the only thing resembling conversation in the car they had caught the crest of the evening commute out of downtown and were moving at an excruciatingly slow pace toward the cahuenga pass boschs guts ached from the wracking convulsions of nausea of an hour earlier and he kept his arms crossed in front of him as if he were cradling a baby he knew he had to compartmentalize his thoughts as much as he was confused and curious about what brockman had alluded to in regard to jasmine he knew he had to put it aside at the moment pounds and what had happened to him were more important he tried to piece together the chain of events and the conclusion he drew was obvious his stumbling into the party at mittels and delivery of the photocopy of the times clip had set off a reaction that ended with the murder of harvey pounds the man whose name he had used though he had given mittel only the name at the party it was somehow traced back to the real pounds who was then tortured and killed bosch guessed that it was the dmv calls that had doomed pounds fresh from receiving the threatening news clip at the fundraiser from a man who had introduced himself as harvey pounds mittel likely would have put his lengthy arm out to find out who this man was and what his purpose was mittel had connections from la to sacramento to washington dc he could have quickly found out that harvey pounds was a cop mittels campaign financing work had put a good number of legislators in seats in sacramento he would certainly have the connections in the capital city to find out if anyone was running traces on his name and if he had that done then he would have learned that harvey pounds an lapd lieutenant had inquired not only about him but about four other men who would be of vital interest to him as well arno conklin johnny fox jake mckittrick and claude eno true all the names were involved in a case and conspiracy almost thirtyfive years old but mittel was at the center of that conspiracy and the snooping around by pounds would be more than enough bosch believed for someone of his position to take some kind of action to find out what pounds was doing because of the approach the man he thought was pounds had made at the party mittel had probably concluded he was being set upon by a chiseler an extortionist and he knew how to eliminate the problem like johnny fox had been eliminated that was the reason pounds had been tortured bosch knew for mittel to make sure the problem went no further than pounds he had to know who else knew what pounds knew the problem was that pounds didnt know anything himself he had nothing to give he was tormented until his heart could take it no longer a question that remained unanswered in boschs mind was what arno conklin knew of all this he had not yet been contacted by bosch did he know of the man who approached mittel did he order the hit on pounds or was it solely mittels reaction then bosch saw a bump in his theory that needed refining mittel had come face to face with him posing as harvey pounds at the fundraiser the fact that pounds was tortured before he died indicated that mittel was not present at the time or he would have seen that they were brutalizing the wrong man bosch wondered now if they understood that they had in fact killed the wrong man and if they would be looking for the right one he mulled over the point that mittel could not have been there and decided that it fit mittel was not the type to get involved in the blood work hed have no problem calling the shots he just wouldnt want to see them fired bosch realized the surfer in a suit had also seen him at the party and therefore could not have been directly involved in the killing of harvey pounds either that left the man bosch had seen through the french doors at the house the man with the wide body and thick neck whom he had seen mittel show the newspaper clip to the man who had slipped and fallen while coming down the driveway for bosch bosch realized that he didnt know how close he had come to being where pounds was now he reached into his jacket pocket for his cigarettes and started to light one do you mind not smoking toliver asked his first words of the thirtyminute journey yeah i do mind bosch finished lighting the smoke and put his bic away he lowered the window there you happy the exhaust fumes are worse than the smoke its a nonsmoking vehicle toliver tapped his finger on a plastic magnet that was on the dashboard ashtray cover it was one of the little doodads that were distributed when the city passed a widespread antismoking law that forbade the practice in all city buildings and allowed for half of the departments fleet to be declared nonsmoking vehicles the magnet showed a cigarette in the middle of a red circle with a slash through it beneath the circle it said thank you for not smoking bosch reached over peeled the magnet off and threw it out the open window he saw it bounce once on the pavement and stick on the door of a car one lane over now its not now its a smoking car bosch youre really fucked you know that write me up kid add it to the association beef your boss is working on i dont care they were silent for a few moments and the car crept further away from hollywood hes bluffing you bosch i thought you knew that how so he was surprised that toliver was turning hes just bluffing thats all hes still hot about what you did with that table but he knows it wont stick its an old case voluntary manslaughter a domestic violence case she walked on five years probation all you have to do is say you didnt know and it gets shitcanned bosch could almost guess what the case was about she had practically told him during true confessions she stayed too long with someone that was what she had said he thought of the painting he had seen in her studio the gray portrait with the highlights red like blood he tried to pull his mind away from it whyre you telling me this toliver why are you going against your own because theyre not my own because i want to know what you meant by what you said to me in the hallway bosch couldnt even remember what he said you told me it wasnt too late too late for what too late to get out bosch said recalling the words he had thrown as a taunt youre still a young guy you better get yourself out of iad before its too late you stay too long and youll never get out is that what you want spend your career busting cops for trading hookers dime bags look i want to work out of parker and i dont want to wait ten years like everybody else its the easiest and fastest way for a white guy to get in there its not worth it is what im telling you anybody stays in iad more than two three years theyre there for life because nobody else wants em nobody else trusts em theyre lepers you better think about it parker center isnt the only place in the world to work a few moments of silence passed as toliver tried to muster a defense somebodys got to police the police a lot of people dont seem to understand that thats right but in this department nobody polices the police who police the police think about that the conversation was interrupted by the sharp tone he recognized as his mobile phone on the back seat of the car were the items the searchers had taken from his apartment irving had ordered it all returned among them was his briefcase and inside it he heard his phone he reached back flipped the briefcase open and grabbed the phone yeah its bosch bosch its russell hey i got nothing to tell you yet keisha im still working on it no i have something to tell you where are you im in the soup the coming up to barham my exit well i have to talk to you bosch im writing a story for tomorrow you will want to comment i think if only in your defense my defense a dull thud went through him and he felt like saying what now but he held himself in check what are you talking about did you read my story today no i havent had the time what its about the death of harvey pounds today i have a followit concerns you bosch jesus he thought but he tried to keep calm he knew that if she detected any panic in his voice she would gain confidence in whatever it was she was about to write he had to convince her she had bad information he had to undermine that confidence then he realized toliver was sitting next to him and would hear everything he said i have a problem talking now when is your deadline now we have to talk now bosch looked at his watch it was twentyfive minutes until six you can go to six right hed worked with reporters before and knew that was the deadline for the timess first edition no i cant go to six if you want to say something say it now i cant give me fifteen minutes and then call back i cant talk now there was a pause and then she said bosch i cant push it far past then you better be able to talk then they were at the barham exit now and theyd be up to his house in ten minutes dont worry about it in the meantime you go warn your editor that you might be pulling the story i will not look keisha i know what youre going to ask me about its a plant and its wrong you have to trust me ill explain in fifteen minutes how do you know its a plant i know it came from angel brockman he flipped the phone closed and looked over at toliver see toliver is that what you want to do with your job with your life toliver said nothing when you get back you can tell your boss that he can shove tomorrows times up his ass there isnt going to be any story see even the reporters dont trust iad guys all i had to do was mention brockman shell start backpedaling when i tell her i know whats going on nobody trusts you guys jerry get out of it oh and like everybody trusts you bosch not everybody but i can sleep at night and ive been on the job twenty years think youll be able to what have you got in five six years ill give you ten jerry thats all for you ten and out but youll look like one of these guys who puts in thirty his prediction was met with a stony silence from toliver bosch didnt know why he even cared toliver was part of the team trying to put him in the dirt but something about the young cops fresh face gave him the benefit of the doubt they made the last curve on woodrow wilson and bosch could see his house he could also see a white car with a yellow plate parked in front of it and a man wearing a yellow construction helmet standing in front holding a toolbox it was the city building inspector gowdy shit bosch said this one of iads tricks too i dontif it is i dont know anything about it yeah sure without a further word toliver stopped in front of the house and bosch got out with his returned property gowdy recognized him and immediately came over as toliver pulled away from the curb listen youre not living in this place are ya gowdy asked its been redtagged we gotta call said somebody bootlegged the electric i gotta call too see anybody i was just going to check it out dont bullshit me mr bosch i can see youve made some repairs you gotta know something you cant repair this place you cant even go in you gotta demolition order and its overdue im gonna put in a work order and have a city contractor do it youll get the bill no use waitin any longer now you might as well get out of here because im going to pull the electric and padlock it he bent down to put the toolbox on the ground and proceeded to open it up and retrieve a set of stainless steel hinges and hasp locks he would apply to the doors look ive got a lawyer bosch said hes trying to work it out with you people theres nothing to work out im sorry now if you go in there again youre subject to arrest if i find these locks have been tampered with youre also subject to arrest ill call north hollywood division im not fooling with you anymore for the first time it occurred to bosch that it might be a show that the man might want money he probably didnt even know bosch was a cop most cops couldnt afford to live up here and wouldnt want to if they could the only reason bosch could afford it was he had bought the property with a chunk of money he had made years earlier on a tv movie deal based on a case he had solved look gowdy he said just spell it out okay im slow about these things tell me what you want and youve got it i want to save the house thats all i care about gowdy looked at him for a long moment and bosch realized he had been wrong he could see the indignation in gowdys eyes you keep talking like that and you could go to jail son ill tell you what im going to do im going to forget what you just said i look im sorry bosch looked back at the house its just like i dont know the house is the only thing ive got youve got more than that you just havent thought about it now im going to cut you a break here ill give you five minutes to go inside and get what you need after that im putting the locks on it im sorry but thats the way it is if that house goes down the hill on the next one maybe youll thank me bosch nodded go on five minutes bosch went inside and grabbed a suitcase from the top shelf of the hallway closet first he put his second gun in it then he dumped in as much of the clothing from the bedroom closet as he could he walked the overstuffed suitcase out to the carport then came back inside for another load he opened the drawers of his bureau and dumped them on the bed then wrapped everything in the bedclothes and carried that out as well he went past the fiveminute mark but gowdy didnt come in after him bosch could hear him working with a hammer on the front door after ten minutes he had a large stack of belongings gathered in the carport included there was the box in which he kept his keepsakes and photos a fireproof box containing his financial and personal records a stack of unopened mail and unpaid bills the stereo and two boxes containing his collection of jazz and blues lps and cds looking at the pile of belongings he felt forlorn it was a lot to fit into a mustang but he knew it wasnt much to show for almost fortyfive years on the planet that it bosch turned around it was gowdy he was holding a hammer in one hand and a steel latch in the other bosch saw a keyed lock was hooked through one of the belt loops on his pants yeah bosch said do it he stepped back and let the inspector go to work the hammering had just begun when his phone rang he had forgotten about keisha russell he had the phone in his jacket pocket instead of his briefcase now he took it out and flipped it open yeah its bosch detective its dr hinojos ohhi something wrong no uh yeah i was expecting somebody else ive got to keep this line open for a few minutes ive got a call coming in can i call you back bosch looked at his watch it was five minutes until six yes hinojos said ill be at the office until sixthirty i want to talk to you about something and to see how you fared on the sixth floor after i left im fine but ill call you back as soon as he flipped the phone closed it rang again in his hand bosch bosch im up against it and dont have time for bullshit it was russell she also didnt have time to identify herself the story is that the investigation into the killing of harvey pounds has turned inward and detectives spent several hours with you today they searched your home and they believe you are the prime suspect prime suspect we dont even use those words keisha now i know youre talking to one of those squints in iad they wouldnt know how to run a homicide investigation if the doer came up and bit them on their shiny ass dont try to deflect what were talking about here its really simple do you or dont you have a comment on the story for tomorrows paper if you want to say something i have just enough time to get it in the first run on the record i have no comment and off off the record not for attribution or any use at all i can tell you that youre full of shit keisha your story is wrong flatout wrong if you run it as you have just summarized it for me you will have to write another one tomorrow correcting it it will say i am not a suspect at all then after that youll have to find another beat to cover and why is that she asked haughtily because this is a smear orchestrated by internal affairs its a plant and when it is read tomorrow by everybody else in the department theyll know it is and theyll know you fell for it they wont trust you theyll think youre just a front for people like brockman no one that it is important for you to have a source relationship with will want to have that relationship with you including me youll be left covering the police commission and rewriting the press releases out of media relations and then of course whenever brockman wants to cream somebody else hell pick up the phone and call there was silence on the line bosch looked up at the sky and saw it turning pink with the start of sunset he looked at his watch it was one minute until her deadline you there keisha bosch youre scaring me you should be scared you got about a minute to make a big decision let me ask you this did you attack pounds two weeks ago and throw him through a window on or off the record it doesnt matter i just need an answer quick off the record thats more or less accurate well that would seem to make you a suspect in his death i dont see keisha ive been out of the state for three days i got back today brockman brought me in and talked to me for less than an hour my story checked and i was kicked free im not a suspect im talking to you from the front of my house you hear that hammering thats my house ive got a carpenter here are prime suspects allowed to go home at night how can i confirm all of this today you cant youve got to pick brockman or me tomorrow you can call assistant chief irving and hell confirmif he is willing to talk to you shit bosch i cant believe this if i go to my editor at deadline and tell him a story that they had budgeted for the front page since the three oclock meeting is not a storyi might be looking for a new beat and a new paper to cover it for theres other news in the world keisha they can find something for the front page this will pay off for you in the long run anyway ill spread the word about you there was a brief silence while she made her decision i cant talk i have to get in there and grab him goodbye bosch i hope im still working here the next time we talk she was gone before he could say goodbye he walked up the street to the mustang and drove it down to the house gowdy had finished with the latches and both doors now had locks on them the inspector was out at his car using the front hood as a desk he was writing on a clipboard and bosch guessed he was moving slowly so as to make sure bosch left the property bosch started loading his pile of belongings into the mustang he didnt know where he was going to take himself he put the thought of his homelessness aside and began thinking about keisha russell he wondered if she would be able to stop the story so late in the game it had probably taken on a life of its own like a monster in the newspapers computer and she its dr frankenstein would likely have little power over stopping it when he had everything in the mustang he waved a salute to gowdy got in and drove down the hill down at cahuenga he didnt know which way to turn because he still didnt know where he should go to the right was hollywood to the left was the valley then he remembered the mark twain in hollywood only a few blocks from the station on wilcox the mark twain was an old residence hotel with efficiencies that were generally clean and neata lot more so than the surrounding neighborhood bosch knew this because he had stashed witnesses there on occasion he also knew that there were a couple of units that were tworoom efficiencies with private baths he decided he would go for one of them and turned right the phone rang almost as soon as he had made the decision it was keisha russell you owe me big time bosch i killed it he felt relief and annoyance at the same time it was typical thinking for a reporter what are you talking about he countered you owe me big time for saving your ass well well see about that im still going to check this out tomorrow if it falls the way you said im going to irving to complain about brockman ill burn him you just did realizing she had just confirmed brockman as the source she laughed uneasily what did your editor say he thinks im an idiot but i told him theres other news in the world good line yeah im going to keep that one in my computer so whats going on and whats happening with those clips i got you the clips are still percolating i cant really talk about anything yet figures i dont know why i keep helping you bosch but here goes remember you asked about monte kim the guy who wrote that first clip i gave you yeah monte kim i asked about him around here and one of the old rewrite guys told me hes still alive turns out that after he left the times he worked for the das office for a while i dont know what hes doing now but i got his number and his address hes in the valley can you give it to me i guess so since it was in the phonebook damn i never thought of that you might be a good detective bosch but you wouldnt make much of a reporter she gave him the number and address said shed be in touch and hung up bosch put the phone down on the seat and thought about this latest piece of information as he drove into hollywood monte kim had worked for the district attorney bosch had a pretty good idea which one that would be chapter thirtyseven the man behind the front desk at the mark twain didnt seem to recognize bosch though harry was reasonably sure he was the same man he had dealt with before while renting rooms for witnesses the counterman was tall and thin and had the hunchedover shoulders of someone carrying a heavy burden he looked like hed been behind the desk since eisenhower you remember me from down the street yeah i remember i didnt say anything cause i didnt know if this was an undercover job or not no no undercover i wanted to know if you have one of the big rooms in the back open one with a phone you want one thats why im asking who you going to put in there this time i dont want no gangbangers again last time they no no gangbangers only me i want the room you want the room thats right and i wont paint on the walls how much the desk man seemed nonplussed by the fact that bosch wanted to stay there himself he finally recovered and told bosch he had his choice thirty dollars a day two hundred a week or five hundred a month all in advance bosch paid for a week with his credit card and waited anxiously while the man checked to make sure the charge would clear now how much for the parking space in the loading zone out front you cant rent that i want to park out front make it harder for one of your other tenants to rip my car off bosch took out his money and slid fifty dollars across the counter if parking enforcement comes by tell them its cool yeah you the manager and owner twentyseven years sorry bosch went out to get his things it took him three trips to bring everything up to room the room was in the back and its two windows looked across an alley to the back of a onestory building that housed two bars and an adult film and novelties store but bosch had known all along it would be no garden spot it wasnt the kind of place where he would find a terry cloth robe in the closet and mints on the pillow at night it was just a couple of notches up from the places where you slid your money to the clerk through a slot in the bulletproof glass one room had a bureau and a bed which had only two cigarette burns in the bedspread and a television mounted in a steel frame that was bolted to the wall there was no cable no remote and no courtesy tv guide the other room had a worn green couch a small table for two and a kitchenette that had a half refrigerator a bolteddown microwave and a twocoil electric range the bathroom was off the hallway that connected the two rooms and came complete with white tile that had yellowed like old mens teeth despite the drab circumstances and his hopes that his stay would be temporary bosch tried his best to transform the hotel room into a home he hung some clothes in the closet put his toothbrush and shaving kit in the bathroom and set the answering machine up on the phone though nobody knew his number he decided that in the morning hed call the telephone company and have a forwarding tape put on his old line next he set up the stereo on the bureau for the time being he just placed the speakers on the floor on either side of the bureau he then rummaged through his box of cds and came across a tom waits recording called blue valentine he hadnt listened to it in years so he put it on he sat down on the bed near the phone and listened and thought for a few minutes about calling jazz in florida but he wasnt sure what he could say or ask he decided it might be better to just let it go for now he lit a cigarette and went to the window there was nothing happening in the alley across the tops of the buildings he could see the ornate tower of the nearby hollywood athletic club it was a beautiful building one of the last in hollywood he closed the musty curtains turned around and studied his new home after a while he yanked the spread off the bed along with the other covers and then remade it with his own sheets and blanket he knew it was a small gesture of continuity but it made him feel less lonely it also made him feel a little bit as though he knew what he was doing with his life at that point and it made him forget for a few more moments about harvey pounds bosch sat on the newly made bed and leaned back on the pillows propped against the headboard he lit another cigarette he studied the wounds on his two fingers and saw that the scabs had been replaced with hard pink skin they were healing nicely he hoped the rest of him would too but he doubted it he knew he was responsible and he knew he had to pay somehow he absentmindedly pulled the phone off the bed table and placed it on his chest it was an old one with a rotary dial bosch lifted the receiver and looked at the dial who was he going to call what was he going to say he replaced the receiver and sat up he decided he had to get out chapter thirtyeight monte kim lived on willis avenue in sherman oaks in the midst of a ghost town of apartment buildings redtagged after the quake kims apartment building was a grayandwhite cape cod affair that sat between two empties at least they were supposed to be empty as bosch pulled up he saw lights go out in one of the buildings squatters he guessed like bosch had been always on alert for the building inspector kims building looked as though it had been either completely spared by the quake or already completely repaired bosch doubted it was the latter he believed the building was more a testament to the serendipitous violence of nature and maybe a builder who didnt cut corners the cape cod had stood up while the buildings around it cracked and slid it was a common rectangular building with apartment entrances running down each side of it but to get to one of the doors you had to be buzzed through a sixfoottall electronic gate the cops called them feel good gates because they made the dwellers inside feel safer but they were worthless all they did was put up a barrier for legitimate visitors to the building others could simply climb over and they did all over the city feel good gates were everywhere he said only that it was the police when kims voice sounded on the intercom and he was buzzed in he took the badge wallet out of his pocket as he walked down to apartment eight when kim opened up bosch shoved the open badge wallet through the door and about six inches from his face he held it so his finger was across the badge and obscured the marking that said lieutenant he then pulled the wallet back quickly and put it away im sorry i didnt catch the name on there kim said still blocking the way hieronymus bosch but people call me harry youre named for the painter sometimes i feel old enough that i think he was named for me tonights one of those nights can i come in this shouldnt take long kim led him into the living room with a confused look on his face it was a decentsized and neat room with a couch and two chairs and a gas fireplace next to the tv kim took one of the chairs and bosch sat on the end of the couch he noticed a white poodle sleeping on the carpet next to kims chair kim was an overweight man with a wide florid face he wore glasses that pinched his temples and what was left of his hair was dyed brown he wore a red cardigan sweater over a white shirt and old khakis bosch guessed kim wasnt quite sixty he had been expecting an older man i guess this is where i ask whats this all about yeah and i guess this is where i tell you problem is im not sure how to begin im investigating a couple of homicides you can probably help but i wonder if youd indulge me and let me ask you some questions going a while back then when were done ill explain why seems unusual but kim raised his hands and waved off any problems he made a movement in his chair as if to get more comfortable he checked the dog and then squinted his eyes as if that might better help him understand and answer the questions bosch could see a film of sweat developing in the defoliated landscape that had once been his scalp you were a reporter for the times how long did that last oh boy that was just a few years in the early sixties how do you know that mr kim let me ask these questions first what kind of reporting did you do back then they called us cub reporters i was on the crime beat what do you do now currently i work out of my home im in public relations i have an office upstairs in the second bedroom i had an office in reseda but the building was condemned you could see daylight through the cracks he was like most people in la he didnt have to preface his remarks by saying he was talking about earthquake damage it was understood i have several small accounts he continued i was a local spokesman for the gm plant in van nuys until they closed it down then i went out on my own what made you quit the times back in the sixties i gotam i a suspect in something not at all mr kim im just trying to get to know you indulge me ill get to the point you were saying why you quit the times yes well i got a better job i was offered the position of press spokesman for the district attorney at the time arno conklin i took it better pay more interesting than the cop beat and a brighter future what do you mean brighter future well actually i was wrong about that when i took the job i thought the sky would be the limit with arno he was a good man i figured id eventuallyyou know if i stayed with himride with him to the governors mansion maybe the senate in washington but things didnt turn out i ended up with an office in reseda with a crack in the wall i could feel the wind come through i dont see why the police would be interested in all what happened with conklin why didnt things turn out well im not the expert on this all i know is that in sixtyeight he was planning on running for attorney general and the office was practically his for the taking then he justdropped out he quit politics and went back to practice law and it wasnt to harvest the big corporate bucks that sit out there when these guys go into private practice he opened a oneman law firm i admired him as far as i heard sixty percent or better of his practice was pro bono he was working for free most of the time like he was serving a penance or something i dont know i guess whyd he drop out i dont know werent you part of the inner circle no he didnt have a circle he had one man gordon mittel right you want to know why he didnt run ask gordon then it clicked in kims brain that bosch had introduced the name gordon mittel to the conversation is this about gordon mittel let me ask the questions first why do you think conklin didnt run you must have some idea he wasnt officially in the race in the first place so he didnt have to make any public statement about dropping out he just didnt run there were a lot of rumors though like what oh lots of stuff like he was gay there were others financial trouble supposedly there was a threat from the mob that if he won theyd kill him just stuff like that none of it was ever more than backroom talk amongst the town politicos he was never married not as far as i know but as far as him being gay i never saw anything like that bosch noted that the top of kims head was slick now with sweat it was already warm in the room but he kept the cardigan on bosch made a quick change of tracks okay tell me about the death of johnny fox bosch saw the quick glimmer of recognition pass behind the glasses but then it disappeared but it was enough johnny fox whos that cmon monte its old news nobody cares what you did i just need to know the story behind the story thats why im here youre talking about when i was a reporter i wrote a lot of stories that was thirtyfive years ago i was a kid i cant remember everything but you remember johnny fox he was your ticket to that brighter future the one that didnt happen look what are you doing here youre not a cop did gordon send you after all these years you people think i he stopped i am a cop monte and youre lucky i got here before gordon did somethings coming undone the ghosts are coming back you read in the paper today about that cop found in his trunk in griffith park i saw it on the news he was a lieutenant yeah he was my lieutenant he was looking into a couple old cases johnny fox was one of them then he ended up in his trunk so youll have to excuse me if im a little nervous and pushy but i need to know about johnny fox and you wrote the story you wrote the story after he got killed that made him out to be an angel then you end up on conklins team i dont care what you did i just want to know what you did am i in danger bosch hiked his shoulders in his best whoknowsandwhocares gesture if you are then we can protect you you dont help us we cant help you you know how it goes oh my god i knew thiswhat other cases one of johnnys girls who got killed about a year before him her name was marjorie lowe kim shook his head he didnt recognize the name he ran his hand over his scalp using it like a squeegee to move the sweat into the thicker hair bosch could tell he had perfectly primed the fat man to answer the questions so what about fox bosch asked i dont have all night look i dont know anything all i did was a favor for a favor tell me about it he composed himself for a long moment before speaking look you know who jack ruby was in dallas yeah the guy who killed oswald well johnny fox was the jack ruby of la okay same era same kind of guy fox ran women was a gambler knew which cops could be greased and greased them when he needed to it kept him out of jail he was a classic hollywood bottom feeder when he ended up dead on the hollywood division blotter i saw it but was going to pass he was trash and we didnt write about trash then a source i had in the cop shop told me johnny had been on conklins payroll that made it a story yeah so i called up mittel conklins campaign manager and ran it by him i wanted a response i dont know how much you know about that time but conklin had this squeakyclean image he was the guy attacking every vice in the city and here he had a vice hoodlum on the payroll it was a great story though fox didnt have a record i dont think there were intel files on him and i had access to them the story was going to do damage and mittel knew it he stopped there at the edge of the story he knew the rest but to speak of it out loud he had to be pushed over the edge mittel knew it bosch said so he offered you a deal hed make you conklins flak if you cleaned up the story not exactly then what what was the deal im sure any kind of statute has passed dont worry about it just tell me and only me you and your dog will ever know it kim took a deep breath and continued this was midcampaign so conklin already had a spokesman mittel offered me a job as deputy spokesman after the election id work out of the office in the van nuys courthouse handle the valley stuff if conklin won yeah but that was a given unless this fox story caused a problem but i held out used some leverage i told mittel i wanted to be the main spokesman after arno s election or forget it he got back to me later and agreed after he talked to conklin i guess anyway i wrote a story that left out the details of foxs past i read it thats all i did i got the job it was never mentioned again bosch sized kim up for a moment he was weak he didnt see that being a reporter was a calling just the same as being a cop you took an oath to yourself kim had seemingly had no difficulty breaking it bosch could not imagine someone like keisha russell acting the same way under the same circumstances he tried to cover his distaste and move on think back now this is important when you first called up mittel and told him about foxs background did you get the impression that he already knew the background yes he knew i dont know if the cops had told him that day or he had known all along but he knew fox was dead and he knew who he was i think he was a little surprised that i knew and he became eager to make a deal to keep it out of the paperit was the first time i ever did anything like that i wish i hadnt done it kim looked down at the dog and then to the beige rug and bosch knew it was a screen on which he saw how his life diverged sharply the moment he took the deal it went from where it was going to where it eventually was your story didnt name any cops bosch said do you remember who handled it not really it was so long ago it would have been a couple guys from the hollywood homicide table back then they handled fatal accidents now theres a division for that claude eno eno i remember him it mightve been i think i remember that ityes it was now i remember he was on it alone his partner had transferred or retired or something and he was working alone waiting for his next partner to transfer in so they gave him the traffic cases they were usually pretty light as far as any investigation went how do you remember so much of this kim pursed his lips and struggled for an answer i guesslike i said i wish i never did what i did so i guess i think about it a lot i remember it bosch nodded he had no more questions and was already thinking of the implications of how kims information fit with his own eno had worked both cases lowe and fox and later retired leaving behind a maildrop corporation with conklins and mittels name on it that collected a thousand dollars a month for twentyfive years he realized that compared to eno kim had settled for too little he was about to get up when he thought of something you said that mittel never mentioned the deal you made or fox again thats right did conklin ever say anything about either one no he never mentioned a thing either what was your relationship like didnt he treat you as a chiseler no because i wasnt a chiseler kim protested but the indignation in his voice was hollow i did a job for him and i did it well he was always very nice to me he was in your story on fox i dont have it here but in it he said he had never met fox yeah that was a lie i made that up bosch was confused what do you mean you mean you made up the lie in case they went back on the deal i put conklin in the story saying he didnt know the guy because i had evidence he did they knew i had it that way if after the election they reneged on the deal i could dredge up the story again and show conklin said he didnt know fox but he did i could then make the inference that he also knew foxs background when he hired him it wouldnt have done much good because hed have already been elected but it would do some pr damage it was my little insurance policy understand bosch nodded what was the evidence you had that conklin knew fox i had photos what photos they were taken by the society photographer for the times at the hollywood masonic lodges st patricks day dance a couple of years before the election theres two of them conklin and fox are at a table they were scratches but one day i was what do you mean scratches photos never published outtakes but see i used to look at the society stuff in the photo lab so i could learn who the big shots in the city were and who they were out with and so on it was useful information one day i saw these photos of conklin and some guy that i recognized but wasnt sure from where it was because of the social background this wasnt foxs turf so at the time i didnt recognize him then when fox got killed and i was told he worked for conklin i remembered the photos and who the other man was fox i went back to the scratch files and pulled them out they were just sitting there together at this dance in the photos yeah and they were smiling you could tell they knew each other these werent posed shots in fact thats why each was a scratch they werent good photos not for the society page anybody else with them a couple women that was it go get the photos oh i dont have them anymore i tossed them after i didnt need them anymore kim dont bullshit me okay there was never a time you didnt need them those photos are probably why you are alive today now go get them or ill take you downtown for withholding evidence then ill come back with a warrant and tear this place apart all right jesus wait here i have one of them he got up and went up the stairs bosch just stared at the dog it was wearing a sweater that matched kims he heard a closet door being moved on rollers then a heavy thud he guessed a box had been taken off the shelf and dropped to the floor in a few more moments kims heavy steps were coming down the stairs as he passed the couch he handed bosch a blackandwhite eightbyten that was yellowed around the edges bosch stared at it for a long time i have the other in a safe deposit box kim said its a clearer shot of the two of them you can tell its fox bosch didnt say anything he was still looking at the photo it was a flashbulb shot everybodys face was lit up white as snow conklin sat across a table from the man bosch assumed was fox there were a half dozen drink glasses on the table conklin was smiling and heavyliddedthat was probably why the photo was a scratchand fox was turned slightly away from the camera his features indistinguishable bosch guessed you would have had to know him to recognize him neither of them seemed aware of the photographers presence flashbulbs were probably going off all over the place but more so than the men bosch studied the two women in the photo standing next to fox and bending over to whisper in his ear was a woman in a dark onepiece dress that was tight around the middle her hair was swirled on top of her head it was meredith roman and sitting across the table and next to conklin mostly obscured by him was marjorie lowe bosch guessed that if you didnt already know her she wouldnt have been recognizable conklin was smoking and had his hand up to his face his arm blocked off half of boschs mothers face it almost looked as if she was peeking around a corner at the camera bosch turned the photo over and there was a stamp on the back that said times photo by boris lugavere it was dated march seven months before his mothers death did you ever show this to conklin or mittel bosch finally asked yeah when i made my case for head spokesman i gave gordon a copy he saw that it was proof the candidate knew fox mittel must also have seen that it was proof that the candidate knew a murder victim bosch realized kim didnt know what he had but no wonder he got the head spokesmans job youre lucky youre alive he thought but didnt say did mittel know it was only a copy oh yeah i made that clear i wasnt stupid did conklin ever mention it to you not to me but i assume mittel told him about it remember i said he had to get back to me about the job i wanted who would he have to clear it with he was campaign manager so he mustve talked to conklin im going to keep this bosch held up the photo ive got the other have you stayed in touch with arno conklin over the years no i havent spoken to him in i dont know twenty years i want you to call him now and i i dont even know where he is i do i want you to call him and tell him you want to see him tonight tell him it has to be tonight tell him its about johnny fox and marjorie lowe tell him not to tell anyone you are coming i cant do that sure you can wheres your phone ill help you no i mean i cant go see him tonight you cant make youre not going to see him tonight monte im going to be you now wheres your phone chapter thirtynine at park la brea lifecare bosch parked in a visitors space in the front lot and got out of the mustang the place looked dark few windows in the upper stories had lights on behind them he checked his watchit was only ninefiftyand moved toward the glass doors of the lobby he felt a slight pull in his throat as he made the walk deep down he had known as soon as he finished reading the murder book that his sights were set on conklin and that it would come to this he was about to confront the man he believed had killed his mother and then used his position and the people he surrounded himself with to walk away from it to bosch conklin was the symbol of all that he never had in his life power home contentment it didnt matter how many people had told him on the trail that conklin was a good man bosch knew the secret behind the good man his rage grew with each step he took inside the door a uniformed guard sat behind a desk working on a crossword puzzle torn from the times sunday magazine maybe he had been working on it since then he looked up at bosch as if he was expecting him monte kim bosch said one of the residents is expecting me arno conklin yeah he called down the guard consulted a clipboard then turned it around and handed the pen to bosch been a long time since hes had any visitors sign here please hes up in nineohseven bosch signed and dropped the pen on the clipboard its kind of late the guard said visitation is usually over by nine whats that mean you want me to leave fine he held his briefcase up mr conklin can just roll his wheelchair down to my office tomorrow to pick this stuff up im the one making a special trip here buddy for him let me up or not i dont care he cares whoah whoah whoah hold on there partner i was just saying it was late and you didnt let me finish im going to let you go up no problem mr conklin specifically requested it and this aint no prison im just saying all the visitors are gone okay people are sleeping just keep it down is all no reason to blow a gasket nineohseven you said thats right ill call him and tell him youre on your way up thanks bosch moved past the guard toward the elevators without apology he was forgotten as soon as he was out of boschs sight only one thing one person occupied his mind now the elevator moved about as quickly as the buildings inhabitants when he finally got to the ninth floor bosch walked past a nurses station but it was empty the night nurse apparently tending to a residents needs bosch headed the wrong way down the hall then corrected himself and headed back the other way the paint and linoleum in the hallway were fresh but even topdollar places like this couldnt completely eliminate the lingering smell of urine disinfectant and the sense of closed lives behind the closed doors he found the door to nineohseven and knocked once he heard a faint voice telling him to enter it was more like a whimper than a whisper bosch was unprepared for what he saw when he opened the door there was a single light on in the room a small reading lamp to the side of the bed it left most of the room in shadow an old man sat on the bed propped against three pillows a book in his frail hands bifocals on the bridge of his nose what bosch found so eerie about the tableau before him was that the bedcovers were bunched around the old mans waist but were flat on the remainder of the bed the bed was flat there were no legs compounding this shock was the wheelchair to the right of the bed a plaid blanket had been thrown over the seat but two legs in black pants and loafers extended from beneath it and down to the chairs footrests it looked as if half the man was in his bed but he had left his other half in the chair boschs face must have shown his confusion prosthesis said the raspy voice from the bed lost my legsdiabetes almost nothing of me left except an old mans vanity i had the legs made for public appearances bosch stepped closer to the light the mans skin was like the back of peeled wallpaper yellowish pale his eyes were deep in the shadows of his skeletal face his hair just a whisper around his ears his thin hands were ribbed with blue veins the size of earthworms under his spotted skin he was death bosch knew death certainly had a better grip on him than life did conklin put the book on the table near the lamp it seemed to be a labor for him to make the reach bosch saw the title the neon rain a mystery conklin said a small cackle following i indulge myself with mysteries ive learned to appreciate the writing i never did before never took the time come in monte no need to be afraid of me im a harmless old man bosch stepped closer until the light was on his face he saw conklins watery eyes study him and conclude that he was not monte kim it had been a long time but conklin seemed to be able to tell i came in montes place he whispered conklin turned his head slightly and bosch saw his eyes fall on the emergency call button on the bed table he must have figured he had no chance and no strength for another reach he turned back to bosch who are you then im working on a mystery too a detective yes my names harry bosch and i want to ask you about he stopped there was a change in conklins face bosch could not tell if it was fear or maybe recognition but something had changed conklin brought his eyes up to boschs and bosch realized the old man was smiling hieronymus bosch he whispered like the painter bosch nodded slowly he now realized he was as shocked as the old man how do you know that because i know of you how through your mother she told me about you and your special name i loved your mother it was like getting hit in the chest with a sandbag bosch felt the air go out of him and he put a hand down on the bed to hold himself steady sit please sit conklin held out a shaky hand motioning bosch onto the bed he nodded when bosch did as he had been told no bosch said loudly as he rose off the bed almost as soon as he had sat down on it you used her and you killed her then you paid off people to bury it with her thats why im here i came for the truth i want to hear you tell it and i dont want to hear any bullshit about loving her youre a liar conklin had a pleading look in his eyes then he turned them away toward the dark side of the room i dont know the truth he said his voice like dried leaves blown along the sidewalk i take responsibility and therefore yes it could be said i killed her the only truth i know is that i loved her you can call me a liar but that is the truth you could make an old man whole again if you believed that bosch couldnt fathom what was happening what was being said she was with you that night in hancock park yes what happened what did you do i killed herwith my words my actions it took me many years to realize that bosch moved closer until he was hovering over the old man he wanted to grab him and shake some sense out of him but arno conklin was so frail that he might shatter what are you talking about look at me what are you talking about conklin turned his head on a neck no wider than a glass of milk he looked at bosch and nodded solemnly you see we made plans that night marjorie and i i had fallen for her against all better judgment and advice my own and others we were going to get married wed decided we were going to get you out of that youth hall we had many plans that was the night we made them we were both so happy that we cried the next day was saturday i wanted to go to las vegas take the car and drive through the night before we could change our minds or have them changed for us she agreed and went home to pick up her thingsshe never came back thats your story you expect me you see after she had left i made one call but that was enough i called my best friend to tell him the good news and to ask him to stand with me as my best man i wanted him to go with us to las vegas do you know what he said he declined the honor of being my best man he said that if i married thatthat woman id be finished he said he wouldnt let me do that he said he had great plans for me gordon mittel conklin nodded sadly so what are you saying mittel killed her you didnt know i didnt know he looked down at his feeble hands and balled them into tiny fists on the blanket they looked completely powerless bosch only watched i did not realize it for many years it was beyond the pale to consider that he had done it and then of course i must admit i was thinking of myself at the time i was a coward thinking only of my escape bosch was not tracking what he was saying but it didnt seem that conklin was talking to him anyway the old man was really telling himself the story he suddenly looked up from his reverie at bosch you know i knew someday you would come how because i knew you would care maybe no one else but i knew you would you had to care you were her son tell me about what happened that night everything i need you to get me some water for my throat theres a glass there on the bureau a fountain in the hallway dont let it run too long it gets too cold and hurts my teeth bosch looked at the glass on the bureau and then back at conklin he was seized with a fear that if he left the room for even a minute the old man might die and take the story with him bosch would never hear it go ill be fine i certainly cant go anywhere bosch glanced at the call button again conklin knew his thoughts i am closer to hell than heaven for what ive done for my silence i need to tell my story i think youd be a better confessor than any priest could be as bosch stepped into the hallway with the glass he saw a figure of a man turn the corner at the end of the hall and disappear he thought the man was wearing a suit it wasnt the guard he saw the fountain and filled the glass conklin smiled weakly as he took the glass and murmured a thanks before drinking bosch then took the glass back and put it on the night table okay bosch said you said she left that night and never came back how did you find out what happened by the next day i was afraid something had happened i finally called my office and made a routine check to see what had come in on the overnight reports among the things they told me was that there had been a homicide in hollywood they had the victims name it was her it was the most horrible day of my life what happened next conklin rubbed a hand on his forehead and continued i learned that she had been found that morning shei was in shock i couldnt believe this could have happened i had mittel make some inquiries but there was nothing useful coming out then the man who hadintroduced me to marjorie called johnny fox yes he called and he said he had heard the police were looking for him he said he was innocent he threatened me he said if i did not protect him he would reveal to the police that marjorie was with me that last night it would be the end of my career so you protected him i turned it over to gordon he investigated foxs claim and confirmed his alibi i cannot remember it now but it was confirmed he had been in a card game or somewhere where there had been many witnesses since i was confident that fox was not involved i called the detectives assigned to the case and arranged for him to be interviewed in order to protect fox and thereby protect myself gordon and i concocted a story in which we told the detectives that fox was a key witness in a grand jury investigation the plan was successful the detectives turned their attention elsewhere at one point i spoke to one of them and he told me he believed that marjorie was the victim of some sort of a sex killer you see they were quite rare back then the detective said the outlook on the case was not good im afraid that i never suspectedgordon such a horrible thing to do to an innocent person it was right there in front of my face but i didnt see it for so long i was a fool a puppet youre saying that it wasnt you and that it wasnt fox youre saying that mittel killed her to eliminate a threat to your political career but that he didnt tell you it was all his idea and he just went out and did it yes i say that i told him i told him that night when i called i said that she meant more to me than all of the plans he had for me that i had for myself he said it would mean the end of my career and i accepted it i accepted it as long as i started the next part of my life with her i believe those minutes were the most peaceful of my life i was in love and i had made a stand he softly pounded a fist onto the bed an impotent gesture i told mittel i didnt care what he thought the damage to my career would be i told him we were going to move away i didnt know where la jolla san diego i threw a few places out i didnt know where we were going to go but i was defiant i was mad at him for not sharing the joy of our decision and in doing so i provoked him i know now and i hastened your mothers death bosch studied him a long moment his agony seemed sincere conklins eyes looked as haunted as the portholes on a sunken ship there was only blackness behind them did mittel ever admit this to you no but i knew i guess it was a subconscious knowledge but then something he said years later brought it out it confirmed it in my mind and that was the end of our relationship what did he say when many years later it was at the time i was preparing for a run for attorney general do you believe such a charade occurred me the liar the coward the conspirator being groomed for the office of the states top law enforcement officer mittel came to me one day and said that i needed to take a wife before the election year he was that blunt about it he said there were rumors about me that could cost me votes i said that was preposterous and that i wouldnt take a wife just to assuage some rednecks out in palmdale or the desert somewhere then he made a comment just a flippant offhand comment as he was leaving my office he broke off to reach for the glass of water bosch helped him and he slowly drank bosch noticed the medicinal smell about him it was horrible it reminded him of dead people and the morgue bosch took the glass when conklin was done and put it back what was the comment as he was leaving my office he said and i remember it word for word he said sometimes i wish i hadnt saved you from that whore scandal maybe if i hadnt we wouldnt have this problem now people would know you arent queer those were his words bosch just stared at him for a moment it mightve been just a figure of speech he could have just meant that he had saved you from the scandal of knowing her by taking the steps to keep you out of it its not evidence that he killed her or had her killed you were a prosecutor you know thats not enough it wasnt direct evidence of anything didnt you ever directly confront him no never i was too intimidated by him gordon was becoming a powerful man more powerful than i so i said nothing to him i simply dismantled my campaign and folded my tent i left the public life and havent spoken to gordon mittel since that time more than twentyfive years you went into private practice yes i took up pro bono work as my selfimposed penance for what i was responsible for i wish i could say it helped suture the wounds of my soul but it did not im a helpless man hieronymus so tell me did you come here to kill me dont let my story dissuade you from believing i deserve it the question at first startled bosch into silence finally he shook his head and spoke what about johnny fox he had his hooks into you after that night yes he did he was very capable as extortionists go what happened with him i was forced to hire him as a campaign employee paying him five hundred dollars a week for practically nothing you see what a farce my life had become he was killed in a hit and run before picking up his first paycheck mittel i would assume that he was responsible though i must admit hes a rather convenient scapegoat for all the bad deeds ive been involved in you didnt think that it was just a little too coincidental that he got killed things are so much clearer in hindsight he shook his head sadly at the time i remember being thrilled with my luck the one thorn in my side had been removed by serendipity you have to remember at the time i had no inkling that marjories death was in any way connected to me i simply saw fox as being a man on the make when he was removed through the luck of an automobile mishap i was pleased a deal was made with a reporter to keep foxs background on the qt and everything was finebut of course it wasnt it never was gordon genius that he was didnt plan on me not being able to get over marjorie and im still not what about mccage who mccage incorporated your payoffs to the cop claude eno conklin was quiet a moment while he composed an answer of course i knew claude eno i didnt care for him and i never paid him a dime mccage was incorporated in nevada it was enos company you and mittel are both listed as corporate officers it was a payoff scam eno was getting a grand a month from somewhere you and mittel no conklin said as forcefully as he could the word came out as little more than a cough i dont know about mccage gordon could have set it up even signed for me or made me sign unwittingly as district attorney he took care of things for me i signed when he told me to sign he said it while looking directly at bosch and harry believed him conklin had admitted to far worse deeds why would he lie about paying off eno what did mittel do when you folded your tent when you told him you were through by then he was already quite powerful politically his law firm represented the citys upper tier and his political work was branching out growing still i was the centerpiece the plan was to take the attorney generals office and then the governors mansion who knows what after that so gordonhe was unhappy i refused to see him but we talked on the phone when he could not convince me to change my mind he threatened me how he told me that if i ever attempted to assault his reputation he would see to it that i was indicted for marjories death and i had no doubt that he could have done it from best man to greatest enemy howd you ever get hooked up with him i guess he slipped in the door while i wasnt looking i never saw the real face until it was too latei dont think in my life ive come across any one as cunningly focused as gordon he wasisa dangerous man im sorry i ever brought your mother into his path bosch nodded he had no more questions and didnt know what else to say after a few moments during which conklin seemed to be lost in thought the old man spoke up i think young man that you only run into a person that is a perfect fit once in your life when you find the one that you think fits then grab on for dear life and its no matter what shes done in the past none of that matters only the holding on matters bosch nodded again it was all he could think of to do where did you meet her ohi met her at a dance she was introduced and of course she was younger than me so i didnt think there would be any interest from her but i was wrongwe danced we dated and i fell in love you didnt know about her past at the time no but she told me eventually by then i didnt care what about fox yes he was the liaison he introduced us i didnt know who he was either he said he was a business man you see for him it was a business move introduce the girl to the prosecutor sit back and see what happens i never paid her and she never asked me for money all the while we fell in love fox must have been weighing his options bosch wondered if he should take the photo from monte kim out of his case and show it to conklin but he decided not to tempt the old mans memory with the reality of a photo conklin spoke while bosch was still thinking about it im very tired now and you never answered my question what question did you come here to kill me bosch looked at his face and his useless hands and realized he felt the stirring of sympathy i didnt know what i was going to do i just knew i was coming you want to know about her my mother yes bosch thought about the question his own memories of his mother were dim and fading farther all the time and he had few recollections about her that came from others what was she like he said conklin thought for a moment she is hard for me to describe i felt a great attraction to herthat crooked smilei knew she had secrets i suppose all people do but hers ran deep and despite all of that she was full of life and you see i didnt think i was at the time we met thats what she gave to me he drank from the glass of water again emptying it bosch offered to get more but conklin waved off the offer i had been with other women and they wanted to show me off like a trophy he said your mother wasnt like that shed rather stay at home or take a picnic basket to griffith park than go to the clubs on the sunset strip how did you find out aboutwhat she did she told me the night she told me about you she said she needed to tell me the truth because she needed my help i have to admitthe shock wasi initially thought of myself you know protecting myself but i admired her courage in telling me and i was in love by then i couldnt turn away how did mittel know i told him i regret it to this day if sheif she was as you described her why did she do what she did ive neverunderstood i havent either as i told you she had her secrets she didnt tell me them all bosch looked away from him and out the window the view was to the north he could see the lights of the hollywood hills glimmering in the mist from the canyons she used to tell me that you were a tough little egg conklin said from behind him his voice was almost hoarse now it was probably more talking than he had done in months she once told me that she knew it didnt matter what happened to her because you were tough enough to make it through bosch said nothing he just looked through the window was she right the old man asked boschs eyes followed the crestline of the hills directly north somewhere up there the lights glowed from mittels spaceship he was up there somewhere waiting for bosch he looked back at conklin who was still waiting for an answer i think maybe the jurys still out chapter forty bosch leaned against the stainless steel wall of the elevator as it descended he realized how different his feelings were from those that he held while the elevator had been carrying him up he had ridden up with hatred pounding in his chest like a cat in a burlap bag he didnt even know the man he carried it for now he looked upon that man as a pitiful character a half of a man who lay with his frail hands folded on the blanket waiting maybe hoping for death to come and end his private misery bosch believed conklin there was something about his story and his pain that seemed too genuine to be dismissed as an act conklin was far beyond posing he was facing his grave he had called himself a coward and a puppet and bosch could think of nothing much harsher that a man could put on his own tombstone in realizing that conklin spoke the truth bosch knew that he had already met the real enemy face to face gordon mittel the strategist the fixer the killer the man who held the strings to the puppet now they would meet again but this time bosch planned to make it on his terms he pushed the l button again as if that might coax the elevator to descend faster he knew it was a useless gesture but he did it again when the elevator finally opened the lobby seemed empty and sterile the guard was there behind his desk working on his word puzzle there wasnt even the sound of a faroff tv only the silence of old peoples lives he asked the guard if he needed him to sign out and he was waved off look sorry i was an asshole before bosch offered dont worry about it partner the guard replied it gets to the best of us bosch wondered what the it was he was talking about but said nothing he nodded solemnly as if he got most of his life lessons from security guards he pushed through the glass doors and headed down the steps into the parking lot it was getting cool and he turned up the collar of his jacket he saw the sky was clear and the moon as sharp as a sickle as he approached the mustang he noticed the trunk of the car next to it was open and a man was bent over attaching a jack to the rear bumper bosch picked up his pace and hoped he wouldnt be asked to help out it was too cold and he was tired of talking to strangers he passed the crouched man and then not used to the rental car keys he fumbled as he tried to get the proper key into the mustangs door lock just as he got the key in the slot he heard a shoe scuff along the pavement behind him and a voice said excuse me fella bosch turned trying to quickly think of an excuse for why he couldnt help the man but all he saw was the blur of the other mans arm coming down then he saw an explosion of red the color of blood then all he saw was black chapter fortyone bosch followed the coyote again but this time the animal did not take him on the path through the mountain brush the coyote was out of his element he led bosch up a steep incline of pavement bosch looked around and realized he was on a tall bridge over a wide expanse of water that his eyes followed to the horizon bosch became panicked as the coyote got too far ahead of him he chased the animal but it crested the rise of the bridge and disappeared the bridge was now empty except for bosch he struggled to the top and looked around the sky was blood red and seemed to be pulsing with the sound of a heartbeat bosch looked in all directions but the coyote was gone he was alone but suddenly he wasnt alone the hands of someone unseen grabbed him from behind and pushed him toward the railing bosch struggled he swung his elbows wildly and dug his heels in and tried to stop his movement to the edge he tried to speak to yell for help but nothing came from his throat he saw the water shimmering like the scales of a fish below him then as quickly as they had taken hold of him the hands were gone and he was alone he spun around and no one was there from behind he heard a door close sharply he turned again and there was no one and there was no door chapter fortytwo bosch woke up in darkness and pain to the sound of muffled shouting he was lying on a hard surface and at first it was a struggle just to move eventually he slid his hand across the ground and determined it was carpet he knew he was inside somewhere lying on a floor across the expanse of darkness he saw a small line of dim light he stared at it for some time using it as a focal point before realizing that it was the crack of light emitted at the bottom edge of a door he pulled himself up into a sitting position and the movement made his interior world slide and melt like a dalí painting a feeling of nausea came over him and he closed his eyes and waited for several seconds until equilibrium returned he raised his hand to the side of his head where the pain came from and found the hair matted with a stickiness he knew by smell was blood his fingers carefully traced the matted hair to a twoinchlong gash in his scalp he touched it gingerly and determined that the blood had clotted for now the wound was no longer bleeding he didnt think he could stand so he crawled toward the light the dream of the coyote broke into his mind and then disappeared in a flash of red pain he found the door knob was locked that didnt surprise him but the effort exhausted him he leaned back against the wall and closed his eyes inside his instinct to seek a means of escape and his desire to lay up and mend fought for his attention the battle was interrupted only by the start of the voices again bosch could tell they did not come from the room on the other side of the door they were farther away yet near enough to be understood stupid fuck look i tol you you didnt say anything about any briefcase you there had to have been one use your common sense you said bring the man i brang the man you want i go back to the car and look for a briefcase but you dint say nothin about you cant go back you fool the place will be crawling with cops they probably have his car and the briefcase already i didnt see any briefcase maybe he didnt have one and maybe i should have depended on someone else bosch realized that they were talking about him he also recognized the angry voice as belonging to gordon mittel it had the crisp delivery and haughtiness of the man bosch had met at the fundraiser the other voice bosch didnt recognize though he had a good idea who it was though defensive and submissive it was a gruff voice full of the timbre of violence bosch guessed it was the man who had hit him and he imagined that to be the man he had seen mittel with inside the house during the fundraiser it took bosch several minutes to consider the content of what they were arguing about a briefcase his briefcase it wasnt in the car he knew then he realized he must have forgotten it left it in conklins room he had brought it up with him so he could take out the photo monte kim had given him and the bank statements from enos safe deposit box and confront the old man with his lies but the old man hadnt lied he hadnt denied boschs mother and so the photo and statements werent necessary the briefcase lay at the foot of the bed forgotten he thought about the last exchange he had heard mittel told the other man he could not go back that the police would be there this made no sense to him unless someone had witnessed the attack on him maybe the security guard it gave him hope then he dashed it himself when he thought of another possibility mittel was taking care of all the loose ends and conklin had to be one of them bosch slumped against the wall he knew he was now the last loose end he sat there in silence until he heard mittels voice once more go get him bring him outside as quickly as he could not yet formulating a plan bosch crawled back toward the spot where he thought he had been when he woke up he rammed into something heavy put his hands on it and determined it was a pool table he quickly found the corner and reached into the pocket his hand closed on a billiard ball he pulled it out quickly trying to think of a way to conceal it finally he shoved it inside his sport coat so that it rolled down the inside of the left sleeve to the crook in his elbow there was more than enough room bosch liked large jackets because they gave him room to grab his gun that made the sleeves baggy he believed that by cocking his arm he could conceal the heavy ball in the folds of the sleeve as he heard a key hit the doorknob he moved to his right and sprawled on the carpet closed his eyes and waited he hoped he was in or close to the spot on the carpet where he had been dropped by his captors in moments he heard the door open and then light burned through his eyelids there was nothing after that no sound or movement he waited forget it bosch the voice said that only works in movies bosch didnt move look your blood is all over the carpet its on the doorknob here bosch realized he must have left a trail to the door and back his halfhatched plan to surprise his captor and overtake him had no chance now he opened his eyes there was a light on the ceiling directly overhead all right he said what do you want get up lets go bosch slowly got up it was an actual struggle but he added to it ad libbing a bit and when he was all the way up he saw blood on the green felt bumper of the pool table he quickly stumbled and grabbed the spot for support he hoped the man in the room had not seen the blood was already there get away from there goddamnit thats a fivethousanddollar table look at the bloodshit sorry ill pay for it not where youre going lets go bosch recognized him it was the man he guessed it would be mittels man from the party and his face matched his voice gruff strong he had broken a few boards with it he had a ruddy complexion set off by two small brown eyes that never seemed to blink he wore no suit this time at least that bosch could see he was dressed in a bulky blue jumpsuit that looked brandnew it was a splatter suit bosch knew that professional killers often used them it was easier to clean up after a job and you didnt mess up your suit just zip off the splatter suit dump it and youre on your way bosch stood on his own and took a step but immediately bent over and folded his arms across his stomach he thought this was the best way to conceal the weapon he had you really hit me man my balance is shot i think i might get sick or something you get sick and ill make you clean it up with your tongue like a fuckin cat i guess i wont get sick then youre a funny guy lets go the man backed away from the door and into the room he then signaled bosch out for the first time bosch saw that he carried a gun it looked like a beretta twentytwo and was held down low at his side i know what youre thinking he said only a twentytwo you think you could take maybe two three shots and still get to me wrong i got hollow points in here ill put you down with one shot tear a hole the size of a soup bowl outta your back remember that walk ahead ame he was playing it smart bosch noticed not coming closer than five or six feet even though he had the gun once bosch was through the door the man issued directions they walked down a hallway through what looked like a living room and then through another room that bosch thought would also qualify as a living room this one bosch recognized by the french doors and windows it was the room off the party lawn at mittels mansion on mount olympus go out the door hes waiting for you out there what did you hit me with man tire iron hope it put a splinter in your skull but it dont matter if it did or didnt well i think it did anyway congratulations bosch stopped at one of the french doors as if he expected it to be opened for him outside the party tent was gone and out near the edge of the overhang he saw mittel standing with his back turned to the house he was silhouetted by the lights of the city extending out into infinity from below open it sorry i thoughtnever mind yeah never mind just get out there we dont have all night out on the lawn mittel turned around bosch could see he was holding the badge wallet with his id in one hand and the lieutenants badge in the other the gunman stopped bosch with a hand on his shoulder then moved back to his sixfoot distance so then bosch is the real name bosch looked at mittel the former prosecutor turned political backdoor man smiled yes thats the real name well then how do you do mr bosch its detective actually detective actually you know i was wondering about that because thats what this id card says but then this badge says something completely different it says lieutenant and thats curious wasnt that a lieutenant i read about in the papers the one who was found dead and without his badge yes im sure it was and wasnt his name harvey pounds the same name that you used when you were parading around here the other night again i think so but correct me if i am wrong detective bosch its a long story mittel but i am a cop lapd if you want to save yourself a few years in prison youll get this old fuck with the gun away from me and call me an ambulance ive got a concussion at least it might be worse before speaking mittel put the badge in one of the pockets of his jacket and the id wallet in the other no i dont think well be making any calls on your behalf i think things have gone a little too far for humanitarian gestures like that speaking of the human existence its a shame that your play here the other night cost an innocent man his life no its a fucking crime you killed an innocent man well i was thinking more along the lines that it was you who killed him i mean of course you are ultimately responsible just like a lawyer passing the buck shouldve stayed out of politics gordie stuck to the law youd probably have your own tv commercials by now mittel smiled and what given up all of this he spread his arms to take in the house and the magnificent view bosch followed the arc of his arm to look at the house but he was really trying to get a bead on the other man the one with the gun he spotted him standing five feet directly behind him the gun at his side he was still too far away for bosch to risk making a move especially in his condition he moved his arm slightly and felt the billiard ball nesting in the crook of his elbow it was reassuring to him it was all he had the law is for fools detective bosch but i must correct you i dont really consider myself to be in politics i consider myself to be just a fixer a solver of problems of any kind for anyone political problems just happen to be my forte but now you see i have to fix a problem that is neither political nor someone elses this one is my own he raised his eyebrows as though he could hardly believe it himself and thats why i have invited you here why i asked jonathan to bring you along you see i had an idea that if we watched arno conklin our mystery party crasher of the other night would eventually show up and i wasnt disappointed youre a clever man mittel bosch turned his head slightly so that he could see jonathan in his peripheral vision he was still out of reach bosch knew he had to draw him closer hold your ground jonathan mittel said mr bosch is not one to get excited about just a minor inconvenience bosch looked back at mittel just like marjorie lowe right she was just a minor inconvenience just a nobody who didnt count now thats an interesting name to bring up is that what this is about detective bosch bosch stared at him too angry to speak well the only thing i can admit to is that i did use her death to my advantage i saw it as an opportunity you could say i know all about it mittel you used her to get control of conklin but eventually even he saw through your lies its over now it doesnt matter what you do to me here my people will be coming you can count on it the old giveuptheplaceissurroundedploy i dont think so this badge businesssomething tells me that youve exceeded your bounds on this one i think maybe this is what they call an unofficial investigation and the fact that you used a false name before and were carrying a dead mans badge tend to bear me outi dont think anyone is coming are they boschs mind raced but he drew a blank and remained silent i think youre just a smalltime extortionist who stumbled onto something somehow and wants a payoff to go away well were going to give you a payoff detective bosch there are people who know what i know mittel bosch blurted what are you going to do go out and kill them all ill take that suggestion under advisement what about conklin he knows the whole story anything happens to me i guarantee hell go right to the cops as a matter of fact you could say arno conklin is with the police right now but i dont think hes saying much bosch dropped his head and slumped a little he had guessed that conklin was dead but had hoped he was wrong he felt the billiard ball move in his sleeve and he folded his arms again to cover up yes apparently the former district attorney threw himself from his window after your visit mittel stepped aside and pointed out into the lights below far off bosch could see the cluster of lighted buildings that were park la brea and he could see blue and red lights flashing at the base of one of the buildings it was conklins building must have been a truly traumatic moment mittel continued he chose death rather than give in to extortion a principled man to the end he was an old man bosch yelled angrily goddamnit why detective bosch keep your voice down or jonathan will have to lower it for you youre not getting away this time bosch said in a lower tighter controlled voice as far as conklin goes i assume the final declaration will be suicide he was very sick you know right a guy with no legs walks over to the window and decides to throw himself out well if the authorities dont believe that then maybe they will come up with an alternate scenario when they find your fingerprints in the room im sure you obliged us by leaving a few along with my briefcase that hit mittel like a slap across the face thats right i left it there and theres enough in it to bring them up this mountain to see you mittel theyll come for you bosch yelled the last line at him as a test jon mittel barked almost before the word was out of mittels mouth bosch was clubbed from behind the impact came on the right side of the neck and he went down to his knees careful to keep his arm bent and the heavy ball in place he slowly more slowly than was needed got up since the impact had been on the right he assumed that jonathan had hit him with his gun hand by providing me with the location of the briefcase you have answered the most important question i had mittel said the other of course was what was in the briefcase and how it would concern me now the problem i have is that without the briefcase or the ability to get it i have no way of checking the veracity of what you tell me here so i guess youre fucked no detective i think that would more accurately describe your situation however i have one other question before you go off why detective bosch why were you bothering with something so old and so meaningless bosch looked at him for a long time before answering because everybody counts mittel everybody bosch saw mittel nod in the direction of jonathan the meeting was over he had to make his play help bosch yelled it as loudly as he could and he knew the gunman would make his move toward him immediately anticipating the same swing of the gun to the right side of the neck bosch spun to his right as he moved he straightened his left arm and used the centrifugal force of the move to let the billiard ball roll down his sleeve into his hand in continuing the move he swung his arm up and out and as he turned his face he saw jonathan inches behind him swinging his own hand down the fingers laced around the beretta he also saw the surprise on jonathans face as he realized his swing would surely miss and that his momentum prevented him from correcting the course after jonathans arm went by harmlessly and he was vulnerable boschs arm arced downward jonathan made a lastsecond lunge to his left but the billiard ball in boschs fist still caught him with a glancing blow to the right side of his head it made a sound like a lightbulb popping and jonathans body followed the momentum of his falling arm he fell face first on the grass his body on top of the gun almost immediately the man tried to get up and bosch delivered a vicious kick to his ribs jonathan rolled off the gun and bosch came down on his body with his knees swinging his fist into the back of his head and neck two more times before realizing that he still gripped the billiard ball and that he had hurt the man enough breathing as if he had just come up for air bosch glanced around and saw the gun he quickly grabbed it up and looked for mittel but he was gone the slight sound of running on grass caught his attention and he looked to the far northern line of the lawn he caught a glimpse of mittel then just as he disappeared into the darkness at the spot where the flat manicured grass gave way to the rugged brush of the hilltop mittel bosch jumped up and followed at the point where he had last seen mittel he found a path worn into the brush he realized it was an old coyote trail that had been widened over time by human feet he raced down it the yawning dropoff to the city below no more than two feet on his right he saw no sign of mittel and followed the trail along the edge of the dropoff until the house was no longer in sight behind him finally he stopped after coming across nothing that indicated mittel was even near or had taken this path breathing heavily his head pounding where he was wounded bosch came upon a steep bluff rising off the side of the trail and saw that it was ringed with old beer bottles and other debris the bluff was a popular lookout spot he put the gun in his waistband and then used his hands for balance and purchase as he climbed ten feet to its top he did a slow threesixtydegree turn while on top of the bluff but saw nothing he listened but the hiss of the citys traffic precluded any chance of his hearing mittel moving in the brush he decided to give it up to get back to the house and call out an air unit before mittel could get away theyd find him with a spotlight if the chopper could get out here quickly enough as he gingerly slid back down the bluff mittel suddenly came at him from the darkness to the right he had been hiding behind a thick growth of brush and spanish sword plants he dove into boschs midsection knocking him down onto the trail his weight on top of him bosch felt the mans hands going for the gun still in his waistband but bosch was younger and stronger the surprise attack was mittels last card bosch closed his arms around him and rolled to his left suddenly the weight was off and mittel was gone bosch sat up and looked about then pulled himself over to the edge he pulled the gun out of his waistband and then leaned over and looked down there was only darkness when he looked directly down the side of the rugged hill he could see the rectangular roofs of houses about a hundred and fifty yards down he knew they were built along the twisting roads that fed off hollywood boulevard and fairfax avenue he did another complete turn and then looked down again he didnt see mittel anywhere bosch surveyed the scene beneath him in its entirety until his eyes caught the backyard lights flicking on behind one of the houses directly below he watched as a man came out of the house carrying what looked like a rifle the man slowly approached a round backyard spa platform the rifle pointed ahead of him the man stopped at the edge of the spa and reached to what must have been the outdoor electrical box the tub light came on silhouetting the body of a man floating in a circle of blue even from on top of the hill bosch could see the swirls of blood seeping from mittels body then the voice of the man with the rifle came up the hillside intact linda dont come out just call the police tell them we got a body in our hot tub then the man looked up the hillside and bosch moved back away from the edge immediately he wondered why hed had the instinctive reaction to hide he got up and slowly made his way back to mittels house along the path as he walked he looked out across the city at the lights shimmering in the night and thought it was beautiful he thought about conklin and pounds and then pushed the guilt out of his mind with thoughts about mittel about how his death finally closed the circle begun so long ago he thought of the image of his mother in monte kims photo her looking timidly around the edge of conklins arm he waited for the feeling of satisfaction and triumph that he knew was supposed to come with vengeance accomplished but none of it ever came to him he only felt hollow and tired when he got back to the perfect lawn behind the perfect mansion the man called jonathan was gone chapter fortythree assistant chief irvin s irving stood in the open doorway of the examination suite bosch was sitting on the side of the padded table holding an ice pack to his head the doctor had given it to him after putting in the stitches he noticed irving when he adjusted the bag in his hand how do you feel ill live i guess thats what they tell me at least well thats better than you can say for mittel he took the high dive yeah what about the other one nothing on him we got his name though you told the uniforms mittel called him jonathan so that means hes probably jonathan vaughn hes worked for mittel for a long time theyre working on it checking the hospitals sounds like you mightve hurt him enough that hed come in vaughn were trying to do a background on him so far not much hes got no record how long was he with mittel that were not sure of weve talked to mittels people at the law firm not what youd call cooperative but they say vaughn has been around forever he was described by most people as mittels personal valet bosch nodded and put the information away theres also a driver we picked him up but he isnt saying much a little surfer punk he couldnt talk if he wanted to anyway what do you mean his jaw is broken wired shut he wont talk about that either bosch just nodded again and looked at him there didnt seem to be anything hidden in what he had said the doctor said you have a severe concussion but the skull is not fractured minor laceration couldve fooled me my head feels like the goodyear blimp with a hole in it how many stitches i think he said eighteen he said youll probably have headaches and keep the knot up there and the eye hemorrhages for a few days itll look worse than it is well nice to know hes telling somebody whats going on i havent heard anything from him just the nurses hell be in in a minute he was probably waiting for you to come out of it a little more come out of what you were a little dazed when we got up there to you harry you sure you want to talk about this now it can wait youre hurt and need to take it im okay i want to talk you been by the scene at park la brea yes i was there i was there when we got the call from mount olympus ive got your briefcase in the car by the way you left it there didnt you with conklin he started to nod but stopped because it made things swirl good he said theres something there i want to keep the photo you looked through it bosch you must be groggy it was found at the scene of a crime yeah i know sorry he waved off his objection he was tired of fighting so the crew working the scene up on the hill already told me what happened at least the early version based on the physicals what im not clear about is what got you up there you know how all of this figures you want to run it down for me or wait until maybe tomorrow bosch nodded once and waited a moment for his mind to clear he hadnt tried to collect the story into one cohesive thought yet he thought about it some more and finally gave it a shot im ready okay i want to read you your rights first what again its just a procedure so it doesnt look like were cutting any slack to one of our own youve got to remember you were at two places tonight and at both somebody took a big fall it doesnt look good i didnt kill conklin i know that and we have the security guards statement he says you left before conklin took the dive so youre gonna be okay youre clear but i have to follow procedure now you still want to talk i waive my rights irving read them to him from a card anyway and bosch waived them again okay then i dont have a waive form youll have to sign that later you want me to tell the story yes i want you to tell the story okay here we go but then he stopped as he tried to put it into words harry okay here it is in arno conklin met marjorie lowe he was introduced by local scumbucket johnny fox who made his living off making such introductions and arrangements usually for money this initial meeting between arno and marjorie was at the st pats party at the masonic lodge on cahuenga thats the photo in the briefcase right right now at that first meeting according to arno s story which i believe he didnt know that marjorie was a pro and fox was a pimp fox arranged the introduction because he probably saw the opportunity and had one eye on the future see if conklin knew it was a paytoplay sort of thing he would have walked away he was the top county vice commando he would have walked away so he didnt know who fox was either irving asked thats what he said he just said he was innocent if you find that hard to take the alternative is harder that this prosecutor would openly consort with these types of people so im going with arno s story he didnt know okay he didnt know he was being compromised so what was in it for fox andyour mother fox is easy once conklin went with her fox had a nice hook into him and he could reel him in whenever he wanted marjorie is something else and ive been thinking about it but it still isnt clear but you can say this most women in that situation are looking for a way out she could have played along with foxs plan because she had her own plan she was looking for a way out of the life irving nodded and added to the hypothesis she had a boy in the youth hall and wanted to get him out being with arno could only help thats right the thing of it was arno and marjorie did something none of the three of them expected they fell in love or at least conklin did and he believed she did too irving took a chair in the corner crossed his legs and stared thoughtfully at bosch he said nothing nothing about his demeanor indicated he was anything else but totally interested and believing in boschs story boschs arm was getting tired of holding the ice pack up and he wished he could lie down but there was only the table in the examination suite he continued the story so they fall in love and their relationship continues and somewhere along the line she tells him or maybe mittel did some checking and told him it doesnt matter what matters is that at some point conklin knew the score and again he surprises everybody how on october twentyseven nineteen sixtyone he proposes marriage to marj he told you this arno told you this he told me tonight he wanted to marry her she wanted to marry him on that night back then he finally decided to chuck it all to risk losing everything he had to gain the one thing he wanted most bosch reached into his jacket on the table and took out his cigarettes irving spoke up i dont think this is anothing never mind bosch lit a smoke with his lighter it was the bravest act of his life you realize that that took balls to be willing to risk everything like thatbut he made a mistake what he called his friend gordon mittel to ask him to go with them to vegas to be best man mittel refused he knew it would be the end of a promising political career for conklin maybe even his own career and he wanted no part of it but then he went further than just refusing to be best man see he saw conklin as the white horse on which he would be able to ride into the castle he had big plans for himself and conklin and he wasnt going to sit back and let somesome hollywood whore ruin it he knew from conklins call that she had gone home to pack so mittel went there and intercepted her somehow maybe told her that conklin had sent him i dont know he killed her bosch nodded and this time he didnt go dizzy i dont know where maybe in his car he made it look like a sex crime by tying the belt around her neck and tearing up her clothes the semenit was already there because she had been with conklinafter she was dead mittel took the body to the alley near the boulevard and put her in the trash the whole thing stayed a secret for a lot of years after that until you came along bosch didnt answer he was savoring his cigarette and the relief of the end of the case what about fox irving asked like i said fox knew about marjorie and arno and he knew they were together the night before marjorie was found dead in that alley that knowledge gave fox a powerful piece of leverage over an important man even if the man was innocent fox used it in who knows how many ways within a year he was on arno s campaign payroll he was hooked on him like a bloodsucking leech so mittel the fixer finally stepped in fox died in a hit and run while supposedly handing out conklin campaign fliers wouldve been easy to set up make it look like it was an accident and the driver just fled but thats no surprise the same guy who worked the marjorie lowe case worked the hit and run same result nobody ever arrested mckittrick no claude eno hes dead now took his secrets with him but mittel was paying him off for twentyfive years the bank statements yeah in the briefcase you look youll probably find records somewhere linking mittel to the payments conklin said he didnt know about them and i believe himyou know somebody ought to check all the elections mittel worked on over the years theyll probably find out he was a rat fucker that couldve held his own in the nixon white house bosch ground his cigarette out on the side of a trash can next to the table and dropped the butt in he started to feel very cold and put his jacket back on it was smudged with dirt and dried blood you look like a mess in that harry irving said why dont you im cold okay you know he didnt even scream what mittel he didnt even scream when he went down that hill i cant figure that out you dont have to its just one of those and i didnt push him he jumped me in the brush and when we rolled he went over he didnt even scream i understand no one is saying all i did was start to ask questions about her and people started dying bosch was staring at an eye chart on the far wall of the room he could not figure out why they would have such a thing in an emergency room examination suite christpoundsi yes i know what happened irving interrupted bosch looked over at him you do we interviewed everyone in the squad edgar told me that he made a computer run for you on fox my only conclusion is that pounds either overheard or somehow got wind of it i think he was monitoring what your close associates were doing after you went on isl then he mustve taken it a step further and stumbled into mittel and vaughn he ran dmv traces on the parties involved i think it got back to mittel he had the connections that would have warned him bosch was silent he wondered if irving really believed that scenario or if he was signaling to bosch that he knew what had really happened and was letting it go by it didnt matter whether or not irving blamed him or took departmental action against him boschs own conscience would be the hardest thing to live with christ he said again he got killed instead of me his body started shuddering then as if saying the words out loud had started some kind of exorcism he threw the ice pack into the trash can and wrapped his arms around himself but the shuddering wouldnt stop it seemed to him that he would never be warm again that his shaking was not a temporary affliction but a permanent part of him now he had the warm salty taste of tears in his mouth and he realized then that he was crying he turned his face away from irving and tried to tell him to leave but he couldnt say anything his jaw was locked as tight as a fist harry he heard irving say harry you okay bosch managed to nod not understanding how irving could not see his body shaking he moved his hands into the pockets of his jacket and pulled it closed around him he felt something in his left pocket and started absentmindedly pulling it out look irving was saying the doctor said you could get emotional this knock on the headthey do weird things to you dont worharry are you sure youre okay youre turning blue son im gonnaill go get the doctor ill he stopped as bosch managed to remove the object from his jacket he held his palm upright clasped in his shaking hand was a black eight ball much of it was smeared with blood irving took it from him having to practically pry his fingers off it ill go get somebody was all he said then bosch was alone in the room waiting for someone to come and the demon to leave chapter fortyfour because of the concussion boschs pupils were dilated unevenly and purple hemorrhages bulged below them he had a hell of a headache and a onehundreddegree temperature as a precaution the emergency room physician ordered that he be admitted and monitored not allowed to sleep until four in the morning he tried to pass the time by reading the newspaper and watching the talk shows but they only seemed to worsen the pain finally he just stared at the walls until a nurse came in checked on him and told him he could sleep after that nurses kept coming into his room and waking him at twohour intervals they checked his eyes and temperature and asked if he was okay they never gave him anything for the headache they told him to go back to sleep if he dreamed of the coyote during the short sleep cycles or anything else he didnt remember it finally at noon he got up for good he was unsteady on his feet at first but equilibrium quickly came back to him he made his way into the bathroom and studied his image in the mirror he burst out laughing at what he saw though it was not that funny it was just that he seemed to be about to laugh or cry or do both at any given moment he had a small shaved spot on his skull where there was an lshaped seam of stitches it hurt when he touched the wound but he laughed about that too he managed to comb hair over it with his hand fairly well camouflaging the injury the eyes were another matter still dilated unevenly and now cracked with red veins they looked like the bad end of a twoweek bender below them deep purple triangles pointed to the corners of the eyes a double shiner bosch didnt think hed ever had one before stepping back into the room he saw that his briefcase had been left by irving next to the bed table he bent to pick it up and almost lost his balance grabbing on to the table at the last moment he got back into bed with the briefcase and began examining its contents he had no purpose in mind he just wanted to be doing something he leafed through his notebook finding it hard to concentrate on the words he then reread the fiveyearold christmas card from meredith roman now katherine register he realized he needed to call her that he wanted to tell her what happened before she read about it in the paper or heard it on the news he found her number in his notebook and dialed on the rooms phone he got her answering machine and left a message meredith uh katherinethis is harry bosch i need to talk to you today when you get a minute some things have happened and i think youll uh feel better about things when you hear from me so give me a call bosch left a variety of numbers on the tape including his mobile the mark twain and the hospital room and then hung up he opened the accordion pocket in the lid of the briefcase and slipped out the photo monte kim had given him he studied his mothers face for a long time the thought that eventually poked through was a question bosch had no doubt from what conklin had said that he had loved her but he wondered if she really loved conklin back bosch remembered a time when she had visited him at mcclaren she had promised to get him out at the time the legal effort was going slowly and he knew that she had no faith in courts when she made the promise he knew she wasnt thinking about the law only ways to get around it to manipulate it and he believed she would have found a way to do it if her time hadnt been taken away he realized looking at the photo that conklin might simply have been part of the promise part of the manipulation their marriage plan was her way of getting harry out from unwed mother with an arrest record to wife of an important man conklin would be able to get harry out to win back marjorie lowes custody of her son bosch considered that love may have had nothing to do with it on her part that it was only opportunity in all the visits to mcclaren she had never spoken of conklin or any man in particular if she had truly been in love wouldnt she have told him and in considering that question bosch realized that his mothers effort to save him was what might ultimately have led to her death mr bosch are you okay the nurse moved quickly into the room and put the food tray down on the table with a rattle bosch didnt answer her he barely noticed her she took the napkin off the tray and used it to wipe the tears off his cheeks its okay she soothed its okay is it its the injury nothing to be embarrassed about head injuries jumble the emotions one minute youre crying the next youre laughing let me open these curtains maybe that will cheer you up i think i just want to be left alone she ignored him and opened the curtains and bosch had a view of another building twenty yards away it did cheer him up though the view was so bad it made him laugh it also reminded him he was in cedars he recognized the other medical tower the nurse then closed his briefcase so she could roll the table over the bed on the tray was a plate containing salisbury steak carrots and potatoes there was a roll that looked as hard as the eight ball he had found in his pocket the night before and some kind of red dessert wrapped in plastic the tray and its smell made him feel the onset of nausea im not going to eat this is there any frosted flakes you have to eat a full meal i just woke up you people kept me up all night i cant eat this its making me sick she quickly picked up the tray and headed to the door ill see what i can do about the frosted flakes she looked back at him and smiled before heading out the door cheer up yeah thats the prescription bosch didnt know what to do with himself but wait for time to pass he started thinking about his encounter with mittel about what was said and what was meant there was something about it that bothered him he was interrupted by a beeping sound coming from the side panel of the bed he looked down and found it was the phone hello harry yes its jazz are you okay there was a long silence bosch didnt know if he was ready for this yet but now it was unavoidable harry im fine howd you find me the man who called me yesterday irving something he chief irving yes he called and told me you were hurt he gave me the number that annoyed bosch but he tried not to show it well im fine but i cant really talk well what happened its just a long story i dont want to go through it now now she was quiet it was one of those moments when both people try to read the silence pick up each others meanings in what they werent saying you know dont you why didnt you tell me jasmine i more silence do you want me to tell you now i dont know what did he tell you who irving it wasnt from him he doesnt know it was somebody else somebody trying to hurt me it was a long time ago harry i want to tell you what happenedbut not on the phone he closed his eyes and thought for a minute just hearing her voice had renewed his sense of connection to her but he had to question whether he wanted to get into this i dont know jazz ive got to think about look what was i supposed to do wear a sign or something to warn you away from the start you tell me when was a good time for me to tell you was it right after that first lemonade should i have said oh by the way six years ago i killed the man i was living with when he tried to rape me for the second time in the same night would that have been proper jazz dont dont what look the cops didnt believe my story here what should i expect from you he could tell she was crying now not so that he was supposed to hear but he could tell it in her voice full of loneliness and pain you said things to me she said i thought jazz we spent a weekend together youre putting too much dont you dare dont you tell me it didnt mean anything youre right im sorrylook this isnt the right time ive got too much going on i gotta call you back she didnt say anything okay okay harry you call me okay goodbye jazz he hung up and kept his eyes closed for a while he felt the numbness of disappointment that comes from broken hopes and wondered if he would ever talk to her again in analyzing his thoughts he realized how much they seemed to be the same and so his fear was not of what she had done whatever the details were his fear was that he would indeed call her and that he would become entwined with someone with more baggage than himself he opened his eyes and tried to put the thoughts aside but he came back to her he found himself marveling at the randomness of their meeting a newspaper want ad it might as well have said single white killer seeks same he laughed out loud but it wasnt funny he turned the television on as a distraction there was a talk show on and the host was interviewing women who stole their best friends men the best friends were also on and every question devolved into a verbal cat fight bosch turned the sound down and watched for ten minutes in silence studying the contortions of the womens angry faces after a while he turned it off and rang the nurses station on the intercom to inquire about his cereal the nurse he spoke to knew nothing about his request for breakfast at lunch time he tried meredith romans number again but hung up when he got the tape just as bosch was getting hungry enough to be tempted to call for the return of the salisbury steak a nurse finally came back in with another food tray this one contained a banana a small glass of orange juice a plastic bowl with a little box of frosted flakes in it and a pintsize carton of milk he thanked her and began eating the cereal out of the box the other stuff he didnt want he picked up the phone and dialed the main number at parker center and asked for assistant chief irvings office the secretary who eventually answered said irving was in conference with the police chief and could not be disturbed bosch left his number next he dialed keisha russells number at the paper its bosch bosch where have you been you turn your phone off bosch reached into his briefcase and took the phone out he checked the battery sorry its dead great that doesnt help me any does it the two biggest names in that clip i gave you end up dead last night and you dont even call some deal we made hey this is me on the phone right so whatve you got for me whatve you got already what are they saying about it theyre not saying jack ive been waiting on you man but what are they really saying i mean it nothing theyre saying both deaths are being investigated and that there is no clear connection theyre trying to pass it off as a big coincidence what about the other man did they find vaughn whos vaughn bosch couldnt figure out what was happening why there was a coverup he knew he should wait to hear from irving but the anger was growing in his throat bosch you there what other man what are they saying about me you theyre not saying anything the other mans name is jonathan vaughn he was there too up at mittels last night how do you know i was there too bosch you were there bosch closed his eyes but his mind couldnt penetrate the shroud being thrown over the case by the department he didnt get it harry we had a deal tell me the story he noted that it was the only time she had ever used his first name he continued to say nothing while he tried to figure out what was happening and weighed the consequences of talking to her bosch back to normal all right you got your pencil im going to give you enough to get started youll have to go to irving to get the rest ive been calling him he wont even take my calls he will when he knows you have the story hell have to by the time he was done telling her the story he was fatigued and his head was hurting again he was ready to go to sleep if it would have him he wanted to forget everything

investigation now hes doing this one youll have to ask him if i can get him on the line when you call over there tell the adjutant to tell irving youre calling on behalf of marjorie lowe hell call you back when he gets the message i guarantee it okay bosch last thing we didnt talk about this at the start like we should have can i use your name as a source bosch thought about it but only for a few moments yeah you can use it i dont know what my names worth anymore but you can use it thanks ill see you youre a pal yeah im a pal he hung up and closed his eyes he dozed off but wasnt sure for how long he was interrupted by the phone it was irving and he was angry what did you do what do you mean i just got a message from a reporter she says shes calling because of marjorie lowe have you talked to reporters about this i talked to one what did you tell her i told her enough so that you wont be able to let this one blow away bosch he didnt finish there was a long silence and then bosch spoke first you were going to cover it all up werent you shove it in the trash with her you see after everything thats happened she still doesnt count does she you dont know what youre talking about bosch sat up now he was angry immediately he was hit with vertigo he closed his eyes until it passed well then why dont you tell me what i dont know okay chief youre the one who doesnt know what youre talking about i heard what you people put out that there may be no connection between conklin and mittel what kind ofyou think im going to sit here for that and vaughn not even a mention of him a fucking mechanic in a splatter suit he throws conklin out the window and is ready to put me in the dirt hes the one who did pounds and he doesnt even rate a mention by you people so chief why dont you tell me what the fuck i dont know okay bosch listen to me listen to me who did mittel work for i dont know and i dont care he was employed by very powerful people some of the most powerful in this state some of the most powerful in the country and i dont give a shit a majority of the city council so what are you telling me the council and the governor and the senators and all of those people what are they all involved now too you covering their asses too bosch would you calm down and make sense listen to yourself of course im not saying that what i am trying to explain to you is that if you taint mittel with this then you taint many very powerful people who associated with him or who used his services that could come back to haunt this department as well as you and me in immeasurable ways that was it bosch saw irving the pragmatist had made a choice probably along with the police chief to put the department and themselves ahead of the truth the whole deal stunk like rotting garbage bosch felt exhaustion roll over him like a wave he was drowning in it hed had enough of this and by covering it up you are helping them in immeasurable ways right and im sure you and the chief have been on the phone all morning letting each of those powerful people know just that theyll all owe you theyll all owe the department a big one thats great chief thats a great deal i guess it doesnt matter that the truth is nowhere to be found in it bosch i want you to call her back call that reporter and tell her that you took this knock on the head and you no im not calling anybody back its too late i told the story but not the whole story the whole story is just as damaging to you isnt it there it was irving knew he either outright knew or had made a pretty good guess that bosch had used poundss name and was ultimately responsible for his death that knowledge was now his weapon against bosch if i cant contain this irving added i may have to take action against you i dont care bosch said quietly you can do whatever you want to me but the story is coming out chief the truth but is it the truth the whole truth i doubt it and deep in inside i know you doubt it too well never know the whole truth a silence followed bosch waited for him to say more and when there was only more silence he hung up he then disconnected the phone and finally went to sleep chapter fortyfive bosch awoke at six the next morning with dim memories of his sleep having been interrupted by a horrible dinner and the visits of nurses through the night his head felt thick he gently touched the wound and found it not as tender as the day before he got up and walked around the room a bit his balance seemed back to normal in the bathroom mirror his eyes were still a colorful mess but the dilation of the pupils had evened out it was time to go he knew he got dressed and left the room briefcase in hand and carrying his ruined jacket over his arm at the nurses station he pushed the elevator button and waited he noticed one of the nurses behind the counter eyeing him she apparently didnt readily recognize him especially with his street clothes on excuse me can i help you no im fine are you a patient i was im leaving room fournineteen bosch wait a moment sir what are you doing im leaving going home what just send me the bill the elevator doors opened and he stepped in you cant do that the nurse called let me get the doctor bosch raised his hand and waved goodbye wait the doors closed he bought a newspaper in the lobby and caught a cab outside he told the driver to take him to park la brea along the way he read keisha russells story it was on the front page and it was pretty much an abbreviated account of what he had told her the day before everything was qualified with the caveat that it was still under investigation but it was a good read bosch was mentioned throughout by name as a source and main player in the story irving was also a named source bosch figured the assistant chief must have decided in the end to throw in with the truth or a close approximation of it once bosch had already let it out it was the pragmatic thing to do this way it seemed like he had a handle on things he was the voice of conservative reason in the story boschs statements were usually followed by those from irving cautioning that the investigation was still in its infancy and no final conclusions had been made the part bosch liked best about the story were the statements from several statesmen including most of the city council expressing shock both at the deaths of mittel and conklin and at their involvement in andor coverup of murders the story also mentioned that mittels employee jonathan vaughn was being sought by police as a murder suspect the story was most tenuous in regard to pounds it contained no mention that bosch was suspected or known to have used the lieutenants name or that his using it had led to poundss death the story simply quoted irving as saying the connection between pounds and the case was still under investigation but that it appeared that pounds might have stumbled onto the same trail bosch had been following irving had held back when he talked to russell even after threatening bosch harry could only believe it was the assistant chiefs desire not to see the departments dirty laundry in print the truth would hurt bosch but could damage the department as well if irving was going to make a move against him bosch knew it would be inside the department it would remain private boschs rented mustang was still in the la brea lifecare parking lot he had been lucky the keys were in the door lock where he had left them a moment before being attacked by vaughn he paid the driver and went to the mustang bosch decided to take a cruise up mount olympus before going to the mark twain he plugged his phone into the cigarette lighter so it would recharge and headed up laurel canyon boulevard on hercules drive he slowed outside the gate in front of mittels grounded spaceship the gate was closed and there was yellow policeline tape still hanging from it bosch saw no cars in the driveway it was quiet and peaceful and soon he knew that a for sale sign would be erected and the next genius would move in and think he was master of all he surveyed bosch drove on mittels place wasnt what he really wanted to see anyway fifteen minutes later bosch came around the familiar turn on woodrow wilson but immediately found things unfamiliar his house was gone its disappearance as glaring in the landscape as a tooth missing from a smile at the curb in front of his address were two huge construction waste bins filled with splintered wood mangled metal and shattered glass the debris of his home a mobile storage container had also been placed at the curb and bosch assumedhopedit contained the salvageable property removed before the house was razed he parked and walked over to the flagstone path that formerly had led to his front door he looked down and all that was left were the six pylons that poked out of the hillside like tombstones he could rebuild upon these if he wanted movement in the acacia trees near the footings of the pylons caught his eye he saw a flash of brown and then the head of a coyote moving slowly through the brush it never heard bosch or looked up soon it was gone harry lost sight of it in the brush he spent another ten minutes there smoking a cigarette and waiting but he saw nothing else he then said a silent goodbye to the place he had the feeling he wouldnt be back chapter fortysix when bosch got to the mark twain the citys morning was just starting from his room he heard a garbage truck making its way down the alley taking away another weeks debris it made him think of his house again fitted nicely into two dumpsters thankfully the sound of a siren distracted him he could identify it as a squad car as opposed to a fire engine he knew hed get a lot of that with the police station just down the street he moved about his two rooms and felt restless and out of it as if life was passing by while he was stuck here he made coffee with the machine he had brought from home and it only served to make him more jittery he tried the paper again but there was nothing of real interest to him except the story he had already read on the front page he paged through the thin metro section anyway and saw a report that the county commission chambers were being outfitted with bulletproof desk blotters that the commissioners could hold up in front of them in the event a maniac came in spraying bullets he threw the section aside and picked up the front section again bosch reread the story about his investigation and couldnt escape a growing feeling that something was wrong that something was left out or incomplete keisha russells reporting had been fine that wasnt the problem the problem was in seeing the story in words in print it didnt seem as convincing to him as it had been when he recounted it for her or for irving or even for himself he put the newspaper aside leaned back on the bed and closed his eyes he went over the sequence of events once more and in doing so finally realized the problem that gnawed at him was not in the paper but in what mittel had said to him bosch tried to recall the words exchanged between them on the manicured lawn behind the rich mans house what had really been said there what had mittel admitted to bosch knew that at that moment on the lawn mittel was in a position of seeming invulnerability he had bosch captured wounded and doomed before him his attack dog vaughn stood ready with a gun to boschs back in that situation bosch believed there would be no reason for a man of mittels ego to hold back and in fact he had not held back he had boasted of his scheme to control conklin and others he had freely though indirectly admitted that he had caused the deaths of conklin and pounds but despite those admissions he had not done the same when it came to the killing of marjorie lowe through the fragmented images of that night bosch tried to recall the exact words said and couldnt quite get to them his visual recollection was good he had mittel standing in front of the blanket of lights but the words werent there mittels mouth moved but bosch couldnt get the words then finally after working at it for a while it came to him he had it opportunity mittel had called her death an opportunity was that an acknowledgement of culpability was he saying he killed her or had her killed or was he simply admitting that her death presented an opportunity for him to take advantage of bosch didnt know and not knowing felt like a heavy weight in his chest he tried to put it out of his mind and eventually started drifting off toward sleep the sounds of the city outside even the sirens were comforting he was at the threshold of unconsciousness almost there when he suddenly opened his eyes the prints he said out loud thirty minutes later he was shaved showered and in fresh clothes heading downtown he had his sunglasses on and he checked himself in the mirror his battered eyes were hidden he licked his fingers and pressed his curly hair down to better cover the shaved spot and the stitches in his scalp at countyusc medical center he drove through the back lot to the parking slots nearest the rear garage bays of the los angeles county medical examiners office he walked in through one of the open garage doors and waved to the security guard who knew him by sight and nodded back investigators werent supposed to go in the back way but bosch had been doing it for years he wasnt going to stop until someone made a federal case out of it the minimumwage guard was an unlikely candidate to do that he went up to the investigators lounge on the second floor hoping not only that there would be someone there he knew but more important someone bosch hadnt alienated over the years he swung the door open and immediately was hit with the smell of fresh coffee but the room was bad news only larry sakai was in the room sitting at a table with newspapers spread across it he was a coroners investigator bosch had never really liked and the feeling was mutual harry bosch sakai said after looking up from the newspaper he held in his hands speak of the devil im reading about you here says here youre in the hospital nah im here sakai see me wheres hounchell and lynch either of them around hounchell and lynch were two investigators who bosch knew would do him a favor without having to think about it too long they were good people nah theyre out baggin and taggin busy morning guess things are picking up again bosch had heard a rumor through the grapevine that while removing victims from one of the collapsed apartment buildings after the earthquake sakai had gone in with his own camera and taken photos of people dead in their bedsthe ceilings crushed down on top of them he then sold the prints to the tabloid newspapers under a false name that was the kind of guy he was anybody else around no bosch jus me whaddaya want nothing bosch turned back to the door then hesitated he needed to make the print comparison and didnt want to wait he looked back at sakai look sakai i need a favor you want to help me out ill owe you one sakai leaned forward in his chair bosch could see just the point of a toothpick poking out between his lips i dont know bosch having you owe me one is like having the old whore with aids say shell give me a free one if i pay for the first sakai laughed at the comparison he had created okay fine bosch turned and pushed through the door keeping his anger in check he was two steps down the hall when he heard sakai call him back just as he had hoped he took a deep breath and went back into the lounge bosch cmon i didnt say i wouldnt help you out look i read your story here and i feel for what youre going through okay yeah right bosch thought but didnt say okay he said what do you need i need to get a set of prints off one of the customers in the cooler which one mittel sakai nodded toward the paper which he had thrown back onto the table that mittel huh only one i know of sakai was quiet while he considered the request you know we make prints available to investigating officers assigned to homicides cut the crap sakai you know i know that and you know if you read the paper that im not the io but i still need the prints you going to get them for me or am i just wasting my time here sakai stood up bosch knew that sakai knew that if he backed down now after making the overture then bosch would gain a superior position in the netherworld of male interaction and in all their dealings that would follow if sakai followed through and got the prints then the advantage would obviously go to him cool your jets bosch im gonna get the prints why dont you get yourself a cup of coffee and sit down just put a quarter in the box bosch hated the idea of being beholden to sakai for anything but he knew this was worth it the prints were the one way he knew to end the case or tear it open again bosch had a cup of coffee and in fifteen minutes the coroners investigator was back he was still waving the card so the ink would dry he handed it to bosch and went to the counter to get another cup of coffee this is from gordon mittel right right thats what it said on the toe tag and man he got busted up pretty good in that fall glad to hear it you know it sounds to me like that story in the newspaper aint as solid as you lapd guys claim if youre sneaking around here gettin the guys prints its solid sakai dont worry about it and i better not get any calls from any reporters about me picking up prints or ill be back dont give yourself a hernia bosch just take the prints and leave never met anybody who tried so hard to make the person doin him a favor feel bad bosch dumped his coffee cup in a trash can and started out at the door he stopped thanks it burned him to say it the guy was an asshole just remember bosch you owe me bosch looked back at him he was stirring cream into his cup bosch walked back sticking his hand in his pocket when he got to the counter he pulled out a quarter and dropped it into the slotted tin box that was the coffee fund there thats for you bosch said now were even he walked out and in the hallway he heard sakai call him an asshole to bosch that was a sign that all might be right in the world his world at least when bosch got to parker center fifteen minutes later he realized he had a problem irving had not returned his id tag because it was part of the evidence recovered from mittels jacket in the hot tub so bosch loitered around the front of the building until he saw a group of detectives and administrative types walking toward the building from the city hall annex when the group moved inside and around the entry counter bosch stepped up behind them and got by the duty officer without notice bosch found hirsch at his computer in the latent fingerprint unit and asked him if he still had the lifescan from the prints off the belt buckle yeah ive been waiting for you to pick them up well i got a set i want you to check against them first hirsch looked at him but hesitated only a second lets see em bosch got the print card sakai had made out of his briefcase and handed it over hirsch looked at it a moment turning the card so it reflected the overhead light better these are pretty clean you dont need the machine right you just want to compare these to the prints you brought in before thats right okay i can eyeball it right now if you want to wait i want to wait hirsch got the lifescan card out of his desk and took it and the coroners card to the work counter where he looked at them through a magnifying lamp bosch watched his eyes going back and forth between the prints as if he were watching a tennis ball go back and forth across a net bosch realized as he watched hirsch work that more than anything else in the world he wanted the print man to look up at him and say that the prints from the two cards in front of him matched bosch wanted this to be over he wanted to put it away after five minutes of silence the tennis match was over and hirsch looked up at him and gave him the score chapter fortyseven when carmen hinojos opened her waiting room door she seemed pleasantly surprised to see bosch sitting on the couch harry are you all right i didnt expect to see you here today why not its my time isnt it yes but i read in the paper you were at cedars i checked out are you sure you should have done that you look awful i didnt want to say that come in she ushered him in and they took their usual places i actually look better than i feel right now why what is it because it was all for nothing his statement put a confused look on her face what do you mean i read the story today you solved the murders including your mothers i thought youd be quite different than this well dont believe everything you read doctor let me clarify things for you what i did on my socalled mission was cause two men to be murdered and another to die by my own hands i solved lets see i solved one two three murders so thats good but i didnt solve the murder i set out to solve in other words ive been running around in circles causing people to die so how did you expect me to be during our session have you been drinking i had a couple beers with lunch but it was a long lunch and i think that a minimum of two beers is required considering what i just told you but i am not drunk if that is what you want to know and im not working so whats the difference i thought we agreed to cut back on oh fuck that this is the real world here isnt that what you called it the real world between now and the last time we talked ive killed someone doc and you want to talk about cutting back on booze like it means anything anymore bosch took out his cigarettes and lit one he kept the pack and the bic on the arm of the chair carmen hinojos watched him for a long time before speaking again youre right im sorry lets go to what i think is the heart of the problem you said you didnt solve the murder you set out to solve that of course is your mothers death i am only going by what i read but todays times attributes her killing to gordon mittel are you telling me that you now know that to be incontrovertibly wrong yes i now know that to be incontrovertibly wrong how simple fingerprints i went down to the morgue got mittels prints and had them compared to those on the murder weapon the belt no match he didnt do it wasnt there now i dont want you to get the wrong idea im not sitting here with a guilty conscience over mittel he was a man who decided to kill people and then had them killed just like that at least two times im sure of then he was going to have me killed too so i say fuck him he got what he had coming but ill carry pounds and conklin around with me for a long time maybe forever and one way or another ill pay for it its just that it would make that weight easier to carry if there had been a reason any good reason know what i mean but there isnt a reason not anymore i understand i dontim not sure how to proceed with this do you want to talk some about your feelings in regard to pounds and conklin not really ive thought about it enough already neither man was innocent they did things but they didnt have to die like they did especially pounds jesus i cant talk about it i cant even think about it then how will you go on i dont know like i said i have to pay what is the department going to do any idea i dont know i dont care its bigger than the department to decide i have to decide my penance harry what does that mean that concerns me dont worry im not going to the closet im not that type the closet im not going to stick a gun in my mouth through what youve said here today it is already clear you have accepted responsibility for what happened to these two men youre facing it in effect you are denying denial that is a foundation you can build on i am concerned about this talk about penance you have to go on harry no matter what you do to yourself it doesnt bring them back so the best you can do is go on he didnt say anything he suddenly grew tired of all the advice of her intervention in his life he was feeling resentful and frustrated do you mind if we cut the session short today he asked im not feeling so hot i understand its no problem but i want you to promise me something promise me we will talk again before you make any decisions you mean about my penance yes harry okay well talk he stood up and attempted a smile but it came out more like a frown then he remembered something by the way i apologize for not getting back to you the other night when you called i was waiting on a call and couldnt talk and then i just kind of forgot i hope you were just checking on me and it wasnt too important dont worry about it i forgot myself i was just calling to see how you made it through the rest of the afternoon with chief irving i also wanted to see if you wanted to talk about the photos it doesnt matter now you looked at them yes i had a couple of comments but lets hear them bosch sat back down she looked at him weighing his suggestion and decided to go ahead i have them here she bent down to get the envelope out of one of the lower drawers of the desk she almost disappeared from boschs view then she was up and placed the envelope on the desk i guess you should take these back irving took the murder book and the evidence box hes got it all now except for those you sound like youre unhappy about that or that you dont trust him with it thats a change arent you the one who said i dont trust anyone why dont you trust him i dont know i just lost my suspect gordon mittels clear and im starting from ground zero i was just thinking about the percentages and well i dont know the numbers but a significant number of homicides are reported by the actual doer you know the husband who calls up crying saying his wife is missing more often than not hes just a bad actor he killed her and thinks calling the cops helps convince everybody hes clean look at the menendez brothers one of em calls up boohooing about mom and dad being dead turns out he and the brother were the ones who shotgunned them there was a case up in the hills a few years back this little girl was missing it was laurel canyon it made the papers tv so the people up there organized search parties and all of that and a few days later one of the searchers a teenaged boy who was one of the girls neighbors found her body under a log near lookout mountain it turned out he was the killer i got him to confess in fifteen minutes the whole time of the search i was just waiting for the one who would find the body it was percentages he was a suspect before i even knew who it was irving found your mothers body yes and he knew her before that he told me once it seems like a stretch to me yeah most people probably thought that about mittel too right up until they fished him out of the hot tub isnt there an alternative scenario isnt it possible that maybe the original detectives were correct in their assumption back then that there was a sex killer out there and that tracking him was hopeless theres always alternative scenarios but you always seem drawn toward finding someone of power a person of the establishment to blame maybe thats not the case here maybe its a symptom of your larger desire to blame society for what happened to your motherand to you bosch shook his head he didnt want to hear this you know all this psychobabblei dontcan we just talk about the photos im sorry she looked down at the envelope as if she was seeing right through it to the photos inside it well it was very difficult for me to look at them as far as their forensic value goes there wasnt a lot there the photos show what i would call a statement homicide the fact that the ligature the belt was still wrapped around her neck seems to indicate that the killer wanted police to know exactly what he did that he had been deliberate that he had had control over this victim i also think the choice of placement is significant as well the trash bin had no top it was open that suggests that placing the body there may not have been an effort to hide it it was also a he was saying she was trash right again a statement if he was just getting rid of a body he couldve put it anywhere in that alley but he chose the open dumpster subconsciously or not he was making a statement about her so to make a statement such as that about a person he would have to have known her to some degree known about her known she was a prostitute known enough to judge her irving came to boschs mind again but he said nothing well he said instead couldnt it have been a statement about all women could it be some sick fuck whoexcuse mesome nut who hated all women and thought all women were trash that way he wouldnt have to have known her maybe somebody who simply wanted to kill a prostitute any prostitute to make a statement about them yes thats a possibility but like you im going with the percentages the kind of sick fuck you are talking aboutwhich incidentally in psychobabble we call a sociopathis much rarer than the one who keys on specific targets specific women bosch shook his head dismissively and looked out the window what is it its just frustrating thats all there wasnt much in the murder book about them taking a hard look at anybody in her circle any of the neighbors nothing like that to do it now is impossible it makes me feel like its hopeless he thought of meredith roman he could go to her to ask about his mothers acquaintances and customers but he didnt know if he had the right to reawaken that part of her life you have to remember hinojos said in a case like this would probably have seemed impossible to solve they wouldnt even have known how to start it just didnt happen as often as today theyre almost impossible to solve today too they sat in silence for a few moments bosch thought about the possibility that the killer was some hitandrun nut a serial killer who was long gone into the darkness of time if that was the case then his private investigation was over it was a failure do you have anything else on the photos thats really all i hadno wait there was one thing and you may already have this she picked the envelope up and opened it she reached in and began sliding out a photo i dont want to look at that bosch said quickly its not a photo of her actually its her clothing laid out on a table is that okay to look at she paused her hand holding the photo half in and half out of the envelope bosch waved his hand telling her to go ahead ive already seen the clothes then youve probably already considered this she slid the photo to the edge of the desk and bosch leaned forward to study it it was a color photo that had yellowed with age even inside the envelope the same items of clothing he had found in the evidence box were spread out on a table in a formation that outlined a body in the way a woman might put them out on a bed before dressing it reminded bosch of cutouts for paper dolls even the belt with the sea shell buckle was there but it was between the blouse and the black skirt not at the imaginary neck okay she said what i found odd here was the belt the murder weapon yes look it has the large silver shell as the buckle and there are smaller silver shells as ornamentation its rather showy right but the buttons on the blouse are gold also the photos of the body they show she was wearing gold teardrop earrings and a gold neck chain also a bracelet right i know that they were in the evidence box too bosch didnt understand what she was getting at harry this is not a universal rule or anything thats why i hesitate to bring it up but usually peoplewomendont mix and match gold and silver and it appears to me your mother was well dressed on this evening that she had jewelry on that matched the buttons of her blouse she was coordinated and she had style what i am saying is that i dont think she would have worn this belt with those other items it was silver and it was showy bosch said nothing something was poking its way into his mind and its point was sharp and lastly this skirt buttons on the hip its a style that is still around and i even have something similar to it myself whats so functional about it is that because of the wide waistband it can be worn with or without a belt there are no loops bosch stared at the photo no loops right so what youre saying is this might not have been her belt it might have but it was i remember it the sea shell belt i gave it to her for her birthday i identified it for the cops for mckittrick the day he came to tell me wellthen that shoots down everything i was going to say i guess maybe when she came into the apartment the killer was already waiting with it no it didnt happen in her apartment they never found the crime scene listen never mind whether it was her belt or not what were you going to say oh i dont know just a theory about it possibly being the property of another woman who may have been the motivating factor behind the killers action its called aggression transference it doesnt make sense now with this evidence but there are examples of what i was going to suggest a man takes his exgirlfriends stockings and strangles another woman with them in his mind hes strangling the girlfriend something like that i was going to suggest it could have happened in this case with the belt but bosch was no longer listening he turned and looked out the window but wasnt seeing anything either in his mind he was seeing the pieces falling together the silver and gold the belt with two of the punch holes worn two friends as close as sisters one for both and both for one but then one was leaving the life shed found a white knight and one was staying behind harry are you okay he looked over at hinojos you just did it i think did what he reached for his briefcase and from it withdrew the photo taken at the st patricks day dance more than three decades before he knew it was a long shot but he needed to check this time he didnt look at his mother he looked at meredith roman standing behind the sitting johnny fox and for the first time he saw that she wore the belt with the silver sea shell buckle she had borrowed it it dawned on him then she had helped harry pick the belt out for his mother she had coached him and she chose it not because his mother would like it but because she liked it and knew she would get to use it two friends who shared everything bosch shoved the photo back into the briefcase and shut it he stood up i gotta go chapter fortyeight bosch used the same ruse he had earlier to get back into parker center coming out of the elevator on the fourth floor he practically ran into hirsch who was waiting to go down he grabbed hold of the young print techs arm and held him in the hallway as the elevator doors closed you going home i was trying to i need one more favor ill buy you lunch ill buy you dinner ill buy you whatever you want if you do it for me its important and it wont take long hirsch looked at him bosch could see he was beginning to wish hed never gotten involved whats that saying hirsch in for a penny in for a pound whaddaya say ive never heard it well i have im having dinner with my girlfriend tonight and i thats great this wont take that long youll make it to your dinner all right what is it you need hirsch youre my goddamn hero you know that bosch doubted he even had a girlfriend they went back to the lab it was deserted since it was almost five on a slow day bosch put his briefcase on one of the abandoned desks and opened it he found the christmas card and took it out by holding a corner between two fingernails he held it up for hirsch to see this came in the mail five years ago you think you can pull a print off it a print from the sender my prints are going to be on there too im sure hirsch furrowed his brow and studied the card his lower lip jutted outward as he contemplated the challenge all i can do is try prints on paper are usually pretty stable the oils last long and sometimes leave ridge patterns in the paper even when they evaporate has it been in its envelope yeah for five years until last week that helps hirsch carefully took the card from bosch and walked over to the work counter where he opened the card and clipped it to a board im going to try the inside its always better less chance of you having touched it inside and the writer always touches the inside is it all right if this gets kind of ruined do what you have to do hirsch studied the card with a magnifying glass then lightly blew over the surface he reached to a rack of spray bottles over the work table and took down one marked ninhydrin he sprayed a light mist over the surface of the card and in a few minutes it began to turn purple around the edges then light shapes began to bloom like flowers on the card fingerprints ive got to bring this out some hirsch said more to himself than bosch hirsch looked up at the rack and his eyes followed the row of chemical reagents until he found what he was looking for a spray bottle marked zinc chloride he sprayed it on the card this should bring the storm clouds in the prints turned the deep purple shade of heavy rain clouds hirsch then took down a bottle labeled pd which bosch knew meant physical developer after the card was misted with pd the prints turned a grayish black and were more defined hirsch looked them over with his magnifying lamp i think this is good enough we wont need the laser now look at these here detective hirsch pointed to a print that appeared to have been left by a thumb on the left side of meredith romans signature and two smaller finger marks above it these look like marks left by someone trying to hold the card steady while it was being written on any chance that you mightve touched it this way hirsch held his fingers in place an inch over the card in the same position that the hand that left the prints would have been in bosch shook his head all i ever did was open it and read it i think those are the prints we want okay now what bosch went to his briefcase and pulled out the print cards hirsch had returned to him earlier in the day he found the card containing the lifts from the belt with the sea shell buckle here he said compare this to what you got on the christmas card you got it hirsch pulled the magnifying glass with the ringed light attachment in front of him and once again began his tennis match eye movement as he compared the prints bosch tried to envision what had happened marjorie lowe was going to las vegas to get married to arno conklin the very thought of it must have been absurdly wonderful to her she had to go home and pack the plan was to drive through the night if arno was planning to bring along a best man perhaps marjorie was to bring a maid of honor maybe she would have gone upstairs to ask meredith to come or maybe she would have gone to her to borrow back the belt that her son had given her maybe she would have gone to say goodbye but something happened when she got there and on her happiest night meredith killed her bosch thought about the interview reports that had been in the murder book meredith told eno and mckittrick that marjories date on the night she died had been arranged by johnny fox but she didnt go to the party herself because she said fox had beaten her the night before and she was not presentable the detectives noted in the report that she had a bruise on her face and a split lip why didnt they see it then bosch wondered meredith had sustained those injuries while killing marjorie the drop of blood on marjories blouse had come from meredith but bosch knew why they hadnt seen it he knew the investigators dismissed any thought in that direction if they ever even had any because she was a woman and because fox backed her story he admitted he beat her bosch now saw what he believed was the truth meredith killed marjorie and then hours later called fox at his card game to give him the news she asked him to help her get rid of the body and hide her involvement fox must have readily agreed even to the point of his willingness to say he beat her because he saw the larger picture he lost a source of income when marjorie was killed but that would have been tempered by the increased leverage the murder would give him over conklin and mittel keeping it unsolved would make it even better hed always be a threat to them he could walk into the police station at any time to tell what he knew and lay it on conklin what fox didnt realize was that mittel could be as cunning and vicious as he was he learned that a year later on la brea boulevard foxs motivation was clear bosch still wasnt sure about merediths could she have done it for the reasons bosch had set out in his mind would the abandonment of a friend have led to the rage of murder he began to believe there was still something left out he still didnt know it all the last secret was with meredith roman and he would have to go get it an odd thought pushed through these questions to bosch the time of death of marjorie lowe was about midnight fox didnt get his call and leave his card game until roughly four hours later bosch now assumed that the murder scene was merediths apartment now he wondered what did she do in that place for four hours with the body of her best friend lying there detective bosch looked away from his thoughts to hirsch who was sitting at the desk nodding his head you got something bingo bosch just nodded it was confirmation of more than just the match of fingerprints he knew it was a confirmation that all the things he had accepted as the truths of his life could be as false as meredith roman chapter fortynine the sky was the color of a ninhydrin bloom on white paper it was cloudless and growing dark purple with the aging of dusk bosch thought of the sunsets he had told jazz about and realized that even that was a lie everything was a lie he stopped the mustang at the curb in front of katherine registers home there was another lie the woman who lived here was meredith roman changing her name didnt change what she had done didnt change her from guilty to innocent there were no lights on that he could see from the street no sign of life he was prepared to wait but didnt want to deal with the thoughts that would intrude as he sat alone in the car he got out crossed the lawn to the front porch and knocked on the door while he waited he got out a cigarette and was lighting it when he suddenly stopped he realized that what he was doing was his reflex of smoking at death scenes where the bodies were old his instincts had reacted before he had consciously registered the odor from the house outside the door it was barely noticeable but it was there he looked back out to the street and saw no one he looked back at the door and tried the knob it turned as he opened it he felt a rush of cool air and the odor came out to meet him the house was still the only sound the hum of the air conditioner in the window of her bedroom that was where he found her he could tell right away that meredith roman had been dead for several days her body was in the bed the covers pulled up to her head on the pillow only her face what was left of it was visible boschs eyes did not linger on the image the deterioration had been extensive and he guessed that maybe she had been dead since the day he had visited on the table next to the bed were two empty glasses a halfgone fifth of vodka and an empty bottle of prescription pills bosch bent down to read the label and saw the prescription was for katherine register one each night before bed sleeping pills meredith had faced her past and administered her own penance she had taken the blue canoe suicide bosch knew it wasnt for him to decide but it looked that way he turned to the bureau because he remembered the kleenex box and he wanted to use a tissue to cover his tracks but there on the top near the photos in gilded frames was an envelope that had his name on it he picked it up took some tissues and left the room in the living room a bit farther away from the source of the horrible odor but not far enough he turned the envelope over to open it and noticed the flap was torn the envelope had been opened already he guessed maybe meredith had reopened it to read again what she had written maybe shed had second thoughts about what she was doing he dismissed the question and took the note out it was dated a week earlier wednesday she had written it the day after his visit dear harry if you are reading this then my fears that you would learn the truth were well founded if you are reading this then the decision i have made tonight was the correct one and i have no regrets as i make it you see i would rather face the judgment of afterlife than have you look at me while knowing the truth i know what i have taken from you i have known all my life it does no good to say i am sorry or to try to explain but it still amazes me how ones life can change forever in a few moments of uncontrolled rage i was angry at marjorie when she came to me that night so full of hope and happiness she was leaving me for a life with you with him for a life we had only dreamed was possible what is jealousy but a reflection of your own failures i was jealous and angry and i struck at her i then made a feeble effort to cover what i had done i am sorry harry but i took her from you and with that took any chance you ever had ive carried the guilt every day since then and i take it with me now i should have paid for my sin a long time ago but someone convinced me otherwise and helped me get away there is no one left to convince me now i dont ask for your forgiveness harry that would be an insult i guess all i want is for you to know my regrets and to know that sometimes people who get away dont really get away i didnt not then not now goodbye meredith bosch reread the note and then stood there thinking about it for a long time finally he folded it and put it back in its envelope he walked over to the fireplace lit the envelope on fire with his bic and then tossed it onto the grate he watched the paper bend and burn until it bloomed like a black rose and went out he went to the kitchen and lifted the receiver off the phone after wrapping his hand in tissue he put it on the counter and dialed nineoneone as he walked toward the front door he could hear the tiny voice of the santa monica police operator asking who was there and what the problem was he left the door unlocked and wiped the exterior knob with the tissue after stepping out onto the porch he heard a voice from behind him she writes a good letter dont she bosch turned around vaughn was sitting on the rattan love seat on the porch he was holding a new twentytwo in his hand it looked like another beretta he looked none the worse for wear he didnt have the black eyes that bosch had or the stitches vaughn bosch couldnt think of anything else to say he couldnt imagine how he had been found by him could vaughn have been daring enough to hang around parker center and follow bosch from there bosch looked out into the street and wondered how long it would take the police operator to dispatch a car to the address the computer gave her for the call even though bosch had said nothing on the line he knew they would eventually send a car to check it out he had wanted them to find meredith if they took their time about it they would probably find him as well he had to stall vaughn for as long as possible yeah nice note the man with the gun said but she left something out dont you think whats left out vaughn seemed not to have heard him its funny he said i knew your mother had a kid but i never met you never even saw you she kept you away from me i wasnt good enough i guess bosch continued to stare as things began to fall together johnny fox in the flesh i dont understand mittel mittel had me killed no not really i killed myself i guess you could say i read that story you people put in the paper today but you had it wrong most of it at least bosch nodded he knew now meredith killed your mother kid sorry about that i just helped her take care of it after the fact and then you used her death to get to conklin bosch didnt need any confirmation from fox he was just trying to chew up time yeah that was the plan to get to conklin worked pretty good too got me out of the sewer only i found out pretty fast that the real power was mittel i could tell between the two of them mittel could go the distance so i threw in with him you could say he wanted a better hold on the golden boy he wanted an ace up his own sleeve so i helped by killing yourself i dont get it mittel told me that supreme power over someone is the power they dont know you have until you need to use it you see bosch mittel always suspected that conklin was really the one who did your mother bosch nodded he saw where the story was going and you never told mittel that conklin wasnt the killer thats right i never told him about meredith so knowing that look at it from his side mittel figured that if conklin was the doer and he believed i was dead then hed think he was home free see i was the only loose end the one who could tie him in mittel wanted him to think he was clear he wanted it because he wanted conklin at ease he didnt want him to lose his drive his ambition conklin was going places and mittel didnt want him to even hesitate but he also wanted to keep an ace up his sleeve something that he could always pull out if conklin tried to step out of line that was me i was the ace so we arranged that little hit and run me and mittel thing is mittel never had to play the ace with conklin conklin gave mittel a lot of good years after that by the time he backed out on that attorney general thing mittel was well diversified by then he had a congressman a senator a quarter of the local pols on his client list you could say by then he had already climbed on conklins shoulders to the higher ground he didnt need arno anymore bosch nodded again and thought a moment about the scenario all those years conklin believed it had been mittel who killed her and mittel believed it had been conklin it was neither so who was the one you ran over oh just somebody it doesnt matter he was just a volunteer you could say i picked him up on mission street he thought he was handing out conklin fliers i planted my id in the bottom of the satchel i gave him he never knew what hit him or why howd you get away with it bosch asked though he thought he already knew the answer to that as well mittel had eno on the line we set it up so that it happened when he was next up on call he took care of everything and mittel took care of him bosch could see that the setup also gave fox a share of power over mittel and hed ridden along with him ever since a little plastic surgery a nicer set of clothes and he was jonathan vaughn aid to the wunderkind political strategist and rainmaker so howd you know id show up here id kept tabs on her over the years i knew she was here alone after our little runin on the hill the other night i came here to hide to sleep you gave me a headachewhat the hell you hit me with the eight ball i guess i should have thought of that when i put you in there anyway i found her like that in the bed i read the note and knew who you were i figured youd be back especially after you left that message on the phone yesterday youve been here all this time with you get used to it i put the air on high closed the door you get used to it bosch tried to imagine it sometimes he believed that he was used to the smell but he knew he wasnt what did she leave out of the note fox that was the part about her wanting conklin for herself see i tried her with conklin first but it didnt take then i set him up with marjorie and got the fireworks nobody expected that hed want to end up marrying her though least of all meredith there was only room on the horse with the white knight for one rider that was marjorie meredith couldnt handle that mustve been a hell of a cat fight bosch said nothing but the truth stung his face like a sunburn thats what it had all come down to a cat fight between whores lets go to your car now fox said why we need to go to your place now for what fox never answered a santa monica squad car stopped in front of the house just as bosch asked his question two officers started getting out be cool bosch fox said quietly be cool if you want to live a little longer bosch saw fox turn the aim of his gun toward the approaching officers they could not see it because of the thick bougainvillea running along the front of the porch one of them started to speak did someone here call nine bosch took two steps and launched himself over the railing to the lawn as he did it he yelled a warning hes got a gun hes got a gun on the ground bosch heard fox start running on the wood decking of the porch he guessed he was going for the door then came the first shot he was sure it came from behind him from fox then the two cops opened up like the fourth of july bosch couldnt count all the shots he stayed on the grass with his arms spread wide and his hands up just hoping they wouldnt send one his way it was over in no more than eight seconds when the echoes died and silence returned bosch yelled again im unarmed im a police officer i am no threat to you i am an unarmed police officer he felt the end of a hot gun barrel pressed against his neck wheres the id right inside coat pocket then he remembered he still didnt have it the cops hands grasped him by the shoulders im going to roll you over wait a minute i dont have it what is this roll over bosch complied i dont have it with me ive got other id though left inside pocket the cop started going through his jacket bosch was scared im not going to do anything wrong here just be quiet the cop got boschs wallet out and looked at the drivers license that was behind a clear plastic window whaddaya got jimmy the other cop yelled bosch couldnt see him he legit says hes a cop got no badge got a dl here then he hunched back down over bosch and patted the rest of his body in a search for weapons im clean all right turn back over bosch did so and his hands were cuffed behind his back he then heard the man above him call in for backup and an ambulance on his radio all right get up bosch did as he was told for the first time he could see the porch the other cop stood with his handgun pointing down at foxs crumpled body at the front door bosch was led up the steps to the porch he could see fox was still alive his chest was heaving he had wounds in both legs and the stomach and it looked like one slug had gone through both cheeks his jaw hung open but his eyes seemed even wider as he stared at death coming for him i knew youd fire you fuck bosch said to him just die now shut up the one called jimmy ordered right now the other cop pulled him away from the front door out in the street bosch could see neighbors joining together in little knots or watching from their own porches nothing like gunshots in suburbia for getting people together he thought the smell of spent gunpowder in the air does it better than a barbecue any day the young cop got right up in boschs face harry could see that his name plate identified him as d sparks okay what the fucks going on here if youre a cop tell us whats going on you two are a couple of heroes thats whats going on tell the story man i dont have time for bullshit bosch could hear approaching sirens now my names bosch im with lapd this man you shot is the suspect in the killing of arno conklin the former district attorney of this county and lapd lieutenant harvey pounds im sure youve heard about these cases jim you hear that he turned back to bosch wheres your badge stolen i can give you a number to call assistant chief irvin irving hell tell you about me never mind that whats he doing here he pointed to fox he told me he was hiding out earlier today i got a call to come to this address and he was here waiting to ambush me see i could identify him he had to take me out the cop looked down at fox wondering if he should believe such an incredible story you got here right in time bosch said he was going to kill me d sparks nodded he was beginning to like the sound of this story then concern creased his brow who called he asked i did bosch said i came here found the door open and went in i was calling when he got the jump on me i just dropped the phone because i knew you people would come why call if he hadnt grabbed you yet because of whats in the back bedroom what theres a woman in the bed she looks like shes been dead about a week who is she bosch looked at the young cops face i dont know chapter fifty why didnt you reveal that you knew she was your mothers killer why did you lie i dont know i havent figured it out its just that there was something about what she wrote and what she did at the end thati dont know i just felt like that was enough i just wanted to let it go carmen hinojos nodded her head as if she understood but bosch wasnt sure he did himself i think thats a good decision harry you do i dont think anybody else would think it was a good decision im not talking about on a procedural or criminal justice level im just talking about on a human level i think you did the right thing for yourself i guess do you feel good about it not reallyyou were right you know i was about what about what you said about me finding out who did it you warned me said it might do me more harm than good well that was an understatementsome mission i gave myself right im sorry if i was right but as i said in the last session the deaths of those men cant be im not talking about them anymore im talking about something else you see i know now that my mother was trying to save me from that place i was at like she had promised me that day out by the fence that i told you about i think that whether she loved conklin or not she was thinking of me she had to get me out and he was the way to do it so ultimately you see it was because of me that she died oh please dont tell yourself that harry thats ridiculous bosch knew that the anger in her voice was real if you are going to take that form of logic she continued you can come up with any reason why she was killed you can argue that your own birth set circumstances in motion that led to her death you see how silly that is not really its the same argument you made the other day about people not taking responsibility well the inverse of that is people who take too much responsibility and you are becoming one of them let that go harry let it go let someone else take some responsibility for some things even if that someone else is dead being dead does not absolve them of everything he was cowed by the forcefulness of her admonition he just looked at her for a long moment he could tell her outburst would signal a natural break in the session the discussion of his guilt was done she had ended it and he had his instructions im sorry to have raised my voice no problem harry what do you hear from the department nothing im waiting on irving what do you mean he kept myculpability out of the paper now its his move hes either going to come at me with iadif he can make a case against me impersonating poundsor hes going to let it go im betting hes going to let it go why the one thing about the lapd is that it is not into selfflagellation know what i mean this case is very public and if they do something to me they know theres always the danger it will get out and it will be one more black eye for the department irving sees himself as the protector of the departments image hell put that ahead of taking me down besides hell have leverage on me now i mean he thinks he will you seem to know irving and the department well why chief irving called me this morning and asked me to forward a positive rtd evaluation to his office as soon as possible he said that he wants a positive returntoduty report yes those were his words do you think you are ready for that he thought a few moments but didnt answer the question has he done that before told you how to evaluate somebody no its a first time and im very concerned about it it undermines my position here if i simply accede to his wishes its quite a dilemma because i dont want you caught in the middle what if he didnt tell you which way to go what would your evaluation be positive or negative she played with a pencil on the desktop for a few moments while considering the question its very close harry but i think you need more time then dont do it dont give in to him thats quite a change only a week ago all you could talk about was getting back to the job that was a week ago there was a palpable sadness in his voice stop beating yourself to death with it she said the past is like a club and you can only hit yourself in the head with it so many times before there is serious and permanent damage i think youre at your limit for what its worth i think you are a good and clean and ultimately kind man dont do this to yourself dont ruin what you have what you are with this kind of thinking he nodded as if he understood but he had dismissed her words as soon as he heard them ive been doing a lot of thinking the last couple of days about what everything any decisions on anything almost i think im going to pull the pin leave the department she leaned forward and folded her arms on the desk a serious look creased her brow harry what are you talking about this is not like you your job and your life are the same i think its good to have some distance but not total separation i she stopped when she seemed to come upon an idea is this your idea of penance of making up for what happened i dont knowi justfor what i did something has to be paid thats all irving s not going to do anything i will harry you made a mistake a serious mistake yes but for that you are giving up your career the one thing that even you readily admit you do well youre going to throw it all away he nodded did you pull the papers yet not yet dont do it why not i cant do this anymore its like im walking around handcuffed to a chain of ghosts he shook his head they were having the same debate that he had been having in his mind for the last two days since the night at meredith romans house give it some time hinojos said all im saying is think about it youre on paid leave now use it use the time ill tell irving hes not getting an rtd from me yet meantime you just give it some time and think hard on it go away somewhere sit on the beach but think about it before you turn in your papers bosch raised his hands in surrender please harry i want to hear you say it all right ill do some more thinking thank you she let some silence underline his agreement remember what you said about seeing the coyote on the street last week she asked quietly about it being the last coyote i remember i think i know how you felt id hate to think that i was seeing the coyote for the last time too chapter fiftyone from the airport bosch took the freeway to the armenia exit and then south to swann he found that he didnt even need the rentacar map he went east on swann into hyde park and then down south boulevard to her place he could see the bay shimmering in the sun at the end of the street at the top of the stairs the door was open but the screen door was closed bosch knocked come in its open it was her bosch pushed through the screen into the living room she wasnt there but the first thing he noticed was a painting on the wall where before there had been only the nail it was a portrait of a man in shadows he was sitting at a table alone the figures elbow was on the table and the hand was up against his cheek obscuring the face and making the deep set of the eyes the focal point of the painting bosch stared at it a moment until she called again hello im in here he saw the door to her studio was open a half foot he stepped over and pushed it open she was there standing in front of the easel dark earthtone oils on the palette in her hand there was a single errant slash of ocher on her right cheek she immediately smiled harry hello jasmine he moved in closer to her and stepped around the side of the easel the portrait had only just been started but she had begun with the eyes the same eyes in the portrait that hung on the wall in the other room the same eyes he saw in the mirror she hesitantly came closer to him there was not a glimmer of embarrassment or unease in her face i thought that if i painted you you would come back she dropped her brush into an old coffee can bolted to the easel and came even closer she embraced him and they kissed silently at first it was a gentle reunion then he put his hand against her back and pulled her tightly against his chest as if she were a bandage that could stop his bleeding after a while she pulled back brought her arms up and held his face in her hands let me see if i got the eyes right she reached up and took off his sunglasses he smiled he knew the purple below his eyes was almost gone but they were still redrimmed and shot with swollen capillaries jesus you took the redeye its a long story ill tell you later god put these back on she hooked the glasses back on and laughed its not that funny it hurt not that i got paint on your face well then im not alone he traced the slash on her face they embraced again bosch knew they could talk later for now he just held her and smelled her and looked over her shoulder to the brilliant blue of the bay he thought of something the old man in the bed had told him when you find the one that you think fits then grab on for dear life bosch didnt know if she was the one but for the moment he held on with everything he had left michael connelly hieronymus bosch
