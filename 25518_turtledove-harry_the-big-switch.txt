the big switch harry turtledove vaclav jezek slogged up a dirt track in eastern france crusted snow crunched under the czech corporals boots like anyone from central europe thinking of france hed always imagined paris blazing with lights and beaches on the riviera packed with girls in skimpy bathing suits freezing his ass off in the middle of a war had never been in the cards but here he was freezing his ass off this would have been a nasty winter by czech standards from everything he could pick uphe spoke only foul fragments of frenchit was a bloody godawful winter by french standards which didnt do anybody stuck in it one damn bit of good and here he was in the middle of a war and it was his own fault too when the nazis jumped on czechoslovakia in october hed fought till he couldnt fight any more then hed gone over the polish border and let himself be interned and then hed agreed to join the forces of the czech governmentinexile still fighting the germans from its base in paris a good thing too he thought lighting a gitane without breaking stride he didnt breathe out much more fog with the cigarette than he had without it poland and hitler were on the same side these days both fighting the russians if hed stayed in that internment camp hed probably be a german pow now of course he might yet end up a german pow it wasnt as if the nazis had gone out of business they were playing defense in the west for the time being not pushing toward paris with everything they had that was something things looked a lot better now than they had when vaclav got to paris he could still get killed or maimed or captured if his number came up as if to underscore the point german artillery grumbled off to the east shells screamed through the air vaclav cocked his head to one side gauging their flight this lot wouldnt come down anywhere close to him so he kept marching the rest of the czechs in his outfit made the same automatic calculation and did the same thing they wore a motley mixture of czech and french khaki uniforms most of them kept their domed czech helmets in place of the crested french model vaclav didhe was convinced the czech pot was made from thicker steel the german stahlhelm was better yet but wearing one of those wouldnt do not if he wanted to keep on breathing anyway most of the czechs carried french rifles that made sense french quartermasters didnt want to have to worry about somebody elses ammunition jezek by contrast listed to the right as he marched the piece slung on his shoulder was longer and heavier than an ordinary foot sloggers rifle it was made for wrecking tanks and armored cars the mm armorpiercing slugs it fired would punch through twentyfive millimeters of hardened steel it kicked like a jackass too despite padded stock and muzzle brake but everything came with a price it also made one hell of a sniping rifle those big bullets flew fast and flat and when one hit a mere human being it commonly killed vaclav had picked off germans out to a kilometer and a half and hed picked off a german sniper specially sent out to get rid of him a compliment he could have done without those s in the distance rumbled again again jezek cocked his head to one side this time he didnt like what he heard hit the dirt he yelled he wasnt the only one the cry went up in czech and french even in his greatcoat even with wool long johns doing a belly flop into the snow wasnt his idea of fun and the goddamn antitank rifle thumped him when he landed the stupid thing wasnt content with bruising his shoulder every time he fired it oh no it wanted to leave blackandblue marks all over him but snow and bruises werent so bad not when you set them alongside of getting blasted into ground beef half a dozen shells came down not nearly far enough away from the czech detachment fire at the heart of the burst dirt and black smoke rising from it fragments whining and screeching through the air vaclav had been through it more often than he cared to remember it never got any easier nobody was screaming his head off that was good to say nothing of lucky theyd flattened out soon enough and none of the shards of steel and brass decided to skim the ground and bite somebody regardless a couple of czech soldiers started to get to their feet stay down sergeant benjamin halevy shouted from right behind jezek they may not be done with us sure as hell another volley came in half a minute later one czech swore and hissed like a viper but only one bright red blood steamed in the snow under his leg it didnt look like a bad woundbut then any wound you didnt get yourself wasnt so bad as the injured man bandaged around vaclav twisted around trying his best to stay flat while he did it and told the sergeant you may be a jew but at least youre a smart jew fuck you jezek halevy answered evenly if im so smart what am i doing here he was redheaded and frecklefaced he was a french noncom not a czech his folks had brought him from prague to paris when he was little equally fluent in czech and french he served as a liaison between the governmentinexiles troops and his host countrys army before the war started vaclav hadnt had much use for jews but in czechoslovakia and now here hed seen that you could count on them to fight the nazis with everything they had anybody whod do that was all right in his book plenty of slovaks had thrown down their rifles and hugged the first german they saw slovakia was independent these days though the next time father tiso did anything germany didnt like would be the first since halevy was a smart jew vaclav asked him what dyou think can we get up now or will those shitheads try to be really cute and throw some more shit at us what did i do to deserve getting asked to think like a german all the time the sergeant seemed to aim the question more at god than at vaclav jezek that was good god might have an answer and vaclav sure didnt after screwing up his features halevy went on i think maybe its all right maybe yeah me too cmon lets try it vaclav scrambled to his feet snow clung to the front of his greatcoat he didnt try to brush it off if it made him harder for the poor shivering bastards in snowspotted feldgrau to spot so much the better halevy followed his lead so did the rest of the czechs they moved with no great enthusiasm but they moved stretcherbearers carried the wounded man back towards a dressing station some of the other guys eyed them enviously they were out of danger or at least in less of it for a while the german guns growled again jezek tensed but these shells headed somewhere else he nodded to himself the artillerymen had a prescribed firing pattern and by god theyd stick to it of course they would they were germans werent they a stretch of snowcovered open ground several hundred meters wide lay ahead with woods beyond vaclav eyed it sourly he turned to halevy what do you want to bet the nazis have a machinegun nest in amongst the trees i wont touch that the jew answered and therell be two more farther back covering it so when we take it out it wont do us much good he seemed no happier than vaclav and with reason be expensive even getting close enough to take it out vaclav unslung the antitank rifle which made his shoulder smile happily if we send a few guys forward to draw their fire maybe i can do something about it at long range worth a try anyhow suits halevy said at once he told off half a squad of czechs to serve as lures they looked as miserable as jezek would have in their boots the rest of the men looked relieved a wellsited mg could have slaughtered half of them maybe more flopping down into the snow again vaclav steadied the monster on its bipod he aimed where he would have put the gun if he were on the other side even with a telescopic sight he couldnt see anything funny but nothing could hide a machinegun muzzle when it started spitting fire and maybehe hopedhed spot motion when the crew served the gun like sacrificial pawns the handful of czechs started crossing the field they hadnt gone far before the machine gun opened up on them that was german arrogance letting them come farther might have drawn more after them but the nazis were saying thus far and no farther this is our ground they could think so vaclav shifted the rifle a few millimetershed guessed well blam he winced even as he chambered a fresh round muzzle brake or not padded stock or not shooting that mother hurt every goddamn time his right ear would never be the same again either blam this time the scope let him see a german reel away with his head nothing but a red ruin another one stepped up they wouldnt have caused so much trouble if they werent brave blam he killed that one too and then another one a few seconds later forward halevy shouted everybody forward forward the czechs went more germans ran over to keep the machine gun firing vaclav methodically shot them before long his side had a lodgement in the woods the mg fell silent maybe theyd captured it or maybe the guys on the other side had pulled it back either way he could go forward himself now another few hundred meters reclaimed sooner or later the rest of france laterhow much laterczechoslovakia it would take a while oh yes the antitank rifle seemed to weigh a tonne theo hossbach stood in front of the goal of what had to be the worst football pitch hed ever seen the polish field was frozen and lumpy the ball could have used more air but nobody could find a valve that fit its air inlet nobody much cared either the german soldiers were back of the line for a while the ivans werent shooting at them so they were letting off some steam the match was panzer black against infantry feldgrau theo was the radio operator in a panzer ii his black coverall wasnt warm enough his teammates heated themselves up running and falling and bumping into one anotherand into the landsers on the other side a goalkeeper just stood there waiting for something horrible to happen and freezing while he waited theo didnt complain he never did come to that he rarely said anything at all he lived as much of his life as he could inside his own head if he had been moved to complain he would have bitched about the quality of the match in front of him both sides would have been booed off the pitch if theyd had the gall to try to charge admission to an exhibition like this he wasnt the best keeper himself but he liked to watch wellplayed football this was more like a mob of little kids running and yelling and booting the ball any which way one of the guys in black missed a pass he should have been able to field blindfolded a fellow in fieldgray seized control of the ball the mob thundered toward theo he tensed a good defense would have stopped the attack before it got anywhere near him unfortunately a good defense was nowhere to be found not here he also tensed because there was liable to be an argument if one got past him he hated arguments and the makeshift goals were made for them a couple of sticks pounded into the ground marked each ones edges a string ran from the top of one stick to the top of the other at more or less the right height no net to stop the ball did somebody score or not thered already been two or three shouting matches but he didnt have to worry not this time a tall man in black headed the ball away from danger before the incoming infantry could launch it at theo way to go adi one of the other panzer crewmen yelled theo couldnt have put it better himself adalbert stoss took the praise in strideliterally he ran the ball down took it on the side of his foot and expertly steered it up the field theo watched his back with proprietary admiration adi drove the panzer on which he himself ran the radio smooth and precise as an english pro adi sent a pass to the right wing then dashed into position in front of the other sides goal for a wonder the guy to whom he sent the pass didnt let it roll past the touchline for a bigger wonder he sent back a halfway decent centering pass and adi booted it past two defenders and the infantrys keeper goal the panzer men yelled pumping their fists in the air the soldiers in feldgrau couldnt argue not about that one glumly the infantrymen started from the halfway line before theyd done much adi stoss swooped in and commandeered the ball he charged up the pitch with it sliding past landsers as if they were nailed to the dirt only a wild desperate lunge from the enemy keeper kept him from scoring again no fair a panting foot soldierright now a footsore foot soldiercomplained you fuckers snuck a ringer in on us like hell we did the closest panzer man pointed back toward theo hes in the same crew as our goalkeeper scheisse the landser said you ought to take him out anyway hes too damn good i didnt know that wasnt in the rules the panzer man replied well it ought to be the foot soldier said bending over and setting his hands on his knees so he could catch his breath playing against him is like going up against a machine gun with water pistols he looked up christ here he comes again shaking his head he clumped off theo had known adi stoss was uncommonly fast and strong even among the extraordinarily fit men of the wehrmacht hed never seen him play football before he was even more impressed than hed thought he might be if adi wasnt good enough to make his living in short pants theo couldnt imagine anybody who would be thanks largely to his efforts the panzer side beat the infantrymen soldiers in black passed bottles of the distilled lightning the poles brewed from potatoes to soldiers in fieldgray theo was glad to get outside some of the vodka he wasnt normally much of a drinking man but in weather like this he figured he needed antifreeze as much as his panzer did sergeant hermann witt the commander of adi and theos machine had run up and down the rutted field he put an arm around adis shoulder man i didnt know you could play like that he said expansivelyhis other hand clutched a bottle fat lot of good it does me adi sounded surprisingly bitter you just made those ground pounders look like a bunch of jerks witt said nothing wrong with that they think were out of shape because we dont tramp like horses all day long i guess you showed em different i like to play thats all there is to it adi shook himself free of the sergeant witt turned to theo whats eating him beats me theo had an opinion which he kept to himself as far as he was concerned opinions were like assholes necessary but not meant for display the panzer commander frowned lit a cigarette and coughed i didnt mean to piss him offhe was great but the way he acts i could have told him he stinks theo only shrugged the less he said the less hed have to be sorry for later at least witt was interested in keeping adi happy that was more than heinz naumann the previous panzer commander had been there would have been trouble between the two of them if naumann hadnt stopped a bullet theo didnt like trouble which meant he could have picked a better time to be born an infantryman came up to him youre in the same crew as that maniac the fellow asked thats right theo said what about it if he drives like he plays youre screwed the foot soldier said he swiped his sleeve across his forehead despite the cold sweat stained his tunic under the arms hell send you right into the russian panzers and theyll blow you to hell and gone he doesnt know how to go backwards were still here so far theo looked to the touchline his greatcoat lay over there as soon as this mouthy guytheo saw anyone who talked to him as a mouthy guywent away he could find it and put it on dont get me wrong he plays good the infantryman went on after a moment he added you werent bad yourself dammit i thought a couple of the shots you stoppedd go in for sure thanks theo said in surprise he didnt think he was anything out of the ordinary you did your best to keep the ball from getting past you sometimes you did sometimes you couldnt even if you couldnt always you tried not to look like too much of a buffoon out there well more slowly than he might have the man in fieldgray figured out theo wasnt the worlds hottest conversationalist see you try and stay in one piece he said and walked off it was good advice theo hoped he could follow it he was relieved when he found his greatcoat nobody whod lost his own had walked off with it if he found himself missing his he might have done that you didnt screw your buddies when you were in the field people you didnt know could damn well look out for themselves there it was the essence of war you stuck with your friends and gave it to the swine on the other side as hard as you could theo knew who his friends werethe guys who helped him stay alive he had nothing in particular against russians any more than hed had before against frenchmen or englishmen or czechs but if they were trying to kill his pals and him hed do his best to do them in first the greatcoat fought winter not quite to a draw the wehrmacht needed better coldweather gear boots for instance the russians felt ones far outclassed anything germany made well there was more a ground pounders worry than a panzer mans theo snorted it wasnt as if he had no worries of his own out in the north sea again lieutenant julius lemp felt the change in the us motion right away the baltic was pretty calm as soon as you passed out of the kiel canal you got reminded what real seas were like and a uboat would roll in a bathtub a rating up on the conning tower with the skipper said somebody down belows going to give it backyou wait and see not like its never happened before lemp answered resignedly once something got into the bilge water it was part of a uboats atmosphere for good all the cleaning in the world couldnt get rid of a stink overflowing heads spilled honey buckets puke stale food the fug of men who didnt wash often enough diesel fumes going below after the freshest of fresh air was always like a slap in the face from a filthy towel he went back to scanning horizon and sky with his zeiss binoculars looking overhead was purely force of habit clouds scudded by not far above the graygreen sea the raf wasnt likely to put in an appearance but nobody who wanted to live through the war believed in taking dumb chances skipper the rating let it hang there lemps antennae that warned of danger were at least as sensitive as the metal ones on the boat that caught radio waves something was on the sailors mind something he wasnt easy talking about the way things were these days lemp could make a good guess about what it was too all the same the only thing he could do was ask whats eating you ignaz well ignaz paused again then he seemed to find a way to say what he wanted its mighty good to be at sea again isnt it now that you mention it lemp answered dryly yes thus encouraged ignaz went on the only thing weve got to worry about out here is the goddamn enemy thats a good thing nicht wahr oh youd best believe it is lemp said and nothing more somebody on the uboat was probably reporting every word even vaguely political from him to the sicherheitsdienst probably every even vaguely political word from the whole crew that was how things worked right now the u had been in port when some of the generals and admirals tried to overthrow the fuhrer thered been gunfire at the naval base who was shooting at whom was something about which it was better not to enquire too closely the fuhrer remained atop the reich two or three dozen highranking officers no longer remained among the living the show trials were right out of the soviet union many more lowerranking men had been cashiered but that wasnt the worst of it the worst was that everybody in the military had to watch what he said and to whom he said it if you couldnt trust the comrades alongside whom you risked your life then you couldnt that was all and you took the precautions you needed to take out here as ignaz had said it was only the enemy who was dangerous back in port you had to worry about your friends and how were you supposed to fight a war like that carefully lemp thought he had to fight carefully any which way hed had the misfortune to sink an american liner history would not have been kind to the uboat skipper who dragged the usa into its second war against germany neither would that mans superiors fortunately it hadnt happened the reich denied everything at the top of its lungs the americans couldnt prove what they suspected lemps superiors still didnt love him but they hadnt beached him which was the only thing that counted he wasnt likely to find an american liner in the north sea this was a war zone by anybodys standards british and french troops still hung on against the germans in northern norway the only thing that could supply them or get them out of there was the royal navy uboats and luftwaffe aircraft were making the tommies pay that didnt mean theyd given up though they were both brave and professional as lemp had reason to know in weather like this the luftwaffe was no more likely to get planes off the ground than the raf was if anybody was going to keep enemy ships from slipping through it was the uboat force down this far south lemp didnt really expect to spy the foe but he and the ratings on the conning tower braved awful weather and spray that froze in midair and stung cheeks like birdshot to keep binoculars moving up and down and from side to side for one thing the crew needed the routine for another as lemp had thought not long before you never could tell no planes in the sky now though neither english nor german no smoke smudges darkening the horizon not even when waves lifted the u to their crests and let the lookouts see farther than they could otherwise after a twohour stint lemp and the crew went below to be replaced by fresh watchers you didnt dare let concentration flag the moment you werent paying close attention was bound to be the one when you most needed it this early in the patrol the boats stench wasnt so bad as it would get later on lemp wrinkled his nose all the same but the reek inside the iron tube was familiar and comforting no matter how nasty and the dim orange light in there also made him feel at home even if his eyes needed a few seconds to adjust to the gloom alles gut peter he asked the helmsman alles gut skipper peter answered course as you ordered and the diesels are performing wellbut you can hear that for yourself ja lemp agreed it wasnt just hearing either he could feel the engines throb through the soles of his feet as peter said everything sounded and felt the way it should have when it didnt you knew even if you couldnt always tell how you knew you want the conn sir peter made as if to step away from the wheel discipline on uboats was of a different and looser kind from what it was in the kriegsmarine s surface ships most of the spit and polish went into the scuppers no officer who was happy pulling the stiffening wire out of his cap missed it lemp sure didnt the men could fight the boat as long as they could do that who gave a rats ass if they clicked their heels and saluted all the time he shook his head no you can keep it im going to my cubbyhole and log the last two hours ofwell nothing some of the rituals did have to be fulfilled peter chuckled all right sometimes nothing is the best you can hope for isnt it damn sight better than a destroyer dropping ash cans on our head amen lemp said fervently if a depth charge went off too close the sea would crumple a uboat like a trash bin under a panzers tracks it would be over in a hurry if that ever happenedbut probably not soon enough only a curtain separated his bunk and desk and safe from the rest of the boat still that gave him more room and more privacy than anyone else enjoyed he spun the combination lock on the safe when the door swung open he took out the log book a fountain pen sat in the desk drawer long habit meant he never left anything on a flat surface where it couldand wouldroll away and get lost he opened the log and began to write walking in a winter wonderland that was how peggy druce thought of stockholm it wasnt that she didnt know about winter shed grown up in a philadelphia main line family and married into another shed skied in colorado in switzerland and in austria back in the days when there was an austria so it wasnt that she didnt understand what winter was all about but philadelphia put up with winter ski resorts seemed intent on making money off itwhich when you looked at things from their point of view was reasonable enough stockholm enjoyed winter part of that no doubt was enjoying what you couldnt escape scandinavia lay a long way north if not for the gulf stream it would have been as uninhabitable as labrador she remembered a pulp story about what might happen if the gulf stream went away she couldnt recall whod written it only that he was a jew now that shed seen hitlers berlin that took on new weight in her mind but the swedes did it with style and the way they kept houses comfortable and streets clear of snow put philadelphiaand every other place shed visited in winterto shame not only that all the lights stayed on through the long cold nights after her time inside the third reich that seemed something close to a miracle it had in copenhagen too till the germans marched in now the nazis twilight swallowed up denmark too yes stockholm was a wonderful bright civilized place the only problem was she didnt want to be here she had plenty of money she wouldnt have been able to come to marianske lazne in czechoslovakia without it or to maintain herself when the war stranded her on the wrong side of the atlantic but just as all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put humpty dumpty together again all her jack couldnt get her back to the good old us of a or to the husband she hadnt seen for well over a year norway remained a war zone because it did there was no air traffic between sweden and englandno sea traffic either she wished she could go to moscow and head for vladivostok by way of the transsiberian railway though it was the long way back to the states it would have done the job but with the railroad cut and vladivostok under japanese siege that didnt work either and so she stayed where she was stockholm made a far more likable prison than berlin had the food was better and she didnt wonder whether everyone she spoke to would report her to the gestapo all the same she wasnt where she wanted to be shed never been one to suffer in silence if she was unhappy she let people hear about it the american embassy in berlin had got to know her much better than the clerks and secretaries and diplomats ever wanted to and one drunken night shed got to know one of the diplomats much better than she ever expected to she did her damnedest not to remember that now she bent the personnel of the embassy in stockholm to her willor did her best again the trouble was that even when they wanted to do what she wanted and they did if for no more noble reason than to get her out of their hair they couldnt i cant call an airplane out of nowhere mrs druce said the undersecretary in charge of dealing with distressed travelers i havent got a liner or even a freighter up my sleeve either yes i understand that mr beard peggy answered to her secret amusement jerome beard sported a hairline mustache but if you could arrange something with the german and british authorities he ran a hand over the top of his head from front to back once upon a time he might have used the gesture to smooth his hair but where were the snows of yesteryear he was on the far side of fiftya few years older than peggy he had one of the baldest domes shed ever seen though and it made him look older why dont you ask me something easy he said testily walking across the baltic for instance its frozen over for miles out to sea peggy by contrast sounded as bright and helpful as she could beards harried expression said he understood she was being difficult but sugarcoating it pardon my french mrs druce but hell will freeze over before they cooperate last time around both sides were perfectly correct they did everything they could to help displaced persons like you now he shook his head his bare scalp gleamed under the overhead lamp no im very sorry but its not just a war you said that before peggy pointed out she was bound and determined to be difficult regardless of whether she sugarcoated it well what if i did beard ran his hand over his crown again its true you have no idea how much those two regimes despise each other oh yes i do i was in berlin remember peggy said all right then the undersecretary yielded the small point he wasnt about to yield on the larger one in fact he poured more cold water over it and the same holds true for france and germany the french dont merely hate the germans eithertheyre scared to death of them that makes joint efforts even more unlikely what am i supposed to do then peggy demanded how about thanking god youre in one of the few countries on this poor sorry continent where theres plenty of food and no one is trying to kill anyone else beard said you couldnt pick a better spot to wait out the war i thought the same thing about copenhagen then i watched german soldiers get out of their freighters and march on the palace peggy said bitterly no guarantee the same thing wont happen here no guarantee no beard paused to fill a pipe and light it the mixture smelled like burning dirty socks swedish blend he explained a note of apology in his voice all i can get these days but to come back to your point the swedes will fight theyve made that very plain to germany since the germans have plenty of other pots on the fire swedens safe enough for now thats the ambassadors judgment and the military attaches too and maybe theyre right and maybe theyre wrong peggy said all i want to do is go home its for crying out loud i was going to be in europe for a month in fall you picked the wrong month and the wrong part of europe beard said boy did i ever there may still be a way he said you would have to take some chances he shook his head noyou would have to take a lot of chances tell me peggy answered if i dont have to put on a uniform and carry a gun ill do it and id think about putting on a uniform as long as it isnt a nazi one you can still travel to poland from poland you can get to romania from romania you can probably find a ship that will take you to egypt once you get through the suez canal youve left most of the war behind you beard said italy and england were fighting a desultory war over somaliland and abyssinia a campaign neither one of them could get very excited about but that was the least of peggys worries like the kids magazines say whats wrong with this picture she replied if i fly in to warsaw say the red armys liable to be running the airport and if it isnt the luftwaffe will be besides isnt there fighting in the stretch of poland that borders romania there is beard acknowledged but you could skirt it by going from poland to slovakia and to romania from there for all practical purposes going into slovakia was the same as going back to nazi germany there was no guarantee the russians wouldnt invade father tisos almostcountry either come to that there was no guarantee they wouldnt invade romania as the embassy undersecretaryd pointed out there was a war on there were no guarantees anywhere peggyd told him she was willing to take a lot of chances had she meant it well she said brightly can you help me with the arrangements taff sergeant alistair walsh wore a shepherds sheepskin coat on top of his greatcoat his thick wool mittens came from the norwegian countryside too hed cut a slit in the right one so he could fire his rifle hed wrapped a knitted scarf around his face the only flesh he exposed was that from his eyes to the brim of his tin hat he was cold anyhow english french and norwegian soldiers still hung on to namsos on the coast of central norway sooner or later the fritzes were going to throw them out that seemed obvious to walsh his superiors hadnt figured it out yet hed been in the army since he walked with a bit of a limp from a german bullet that had got him more than half a lifetime earlier he wasnt surprised that he had a clearer view of things than the blokes with the shoulder straps and peaked caps smoke rose from the direction of the docks the germans had come bombing again they did it blindly from above the clouds to fly down below them was to risk flying straight into the ground but theyd got lucky damn them all the same sailors and locals and no doubt some dragooned soldiers labored like draft horses to unload whatever ships hadnt been hit without the stuff the royal navy brought in resistance here wouldnt last long even with it walsh had plenty of clips for his submachine gun he wasnt too hungry the artillery though was severely rationed the expeditionary forces handful of tanks still running were low low low on petrol he could hardly remember the last time a hurricane or even a gladiator had got airborne the germans didnt have those worries they held denmark their planes and uboats and even their pissy little excuse for a surface navy dominated the skagerrak the strait between denmark and norway and they occupied the south here whatever they needed they could bring in and bring up to the front with nothing to worry about except occasional ambuscades from norwegian ski troops of course the germans had ski troops too they would walsh thought less angrily than he might have hed fought fritz in two wars now and trained to fight him in the gap between them he had a thorough professional respect for the sons of bitches in fieldgray that didnt keep him from shooting them whenever he found the chance after all they respected his side too but theyd plugged him all the same some french chasseurs alpins had been part of the expeditionary force damned if they didnt ski with berets on their heads nervous allied soldiers had shot a couple of them anyway anything unfamiliar was assumed to be dangerous more often than not it was the rest of the time hard luck for the poor bugger whod made somebody jumpy one of the men in walshs company came up to him and said ere sergeant can i talk to you for a minute quietlike his broad yorkshire contrasted with walshs buzzing welsh accent whats up jock walsh asked theyd been together a long time catching the worried look on the big mans face he added is something wrong with the cat theyd sneaked the little grayandwhite beast onto the troopship that carried them here and somehow theyd kept it with them ever since plenty of hardbitten troopers would have been heartbroken if a shell fragment found pussy but jock shook his head nay its not the beastie he looked this way and that as with sergeant walsh his eyes and forehead were the only skin he showed seeing no one close enough to walshs foxhole to overhear him he dropped his voice to a nearwhisper and said it hurts when i pisshurts powerful bad oh for christs sake walsh exploded who have you been fucking soldiers used the word all the time in every possible form and most of the impossible ones but hearing it used in its basic meaning made jock blushwalsh watched the skin above his eyes redden hesitantly he answered there was this lady in one o the villages we went through a few days back she gave my mates an me bread an boiled porkan she mustve given me summat else to remember her by too coming down venereal was serious business your pay got stopped your family might even get a wire from the war ministrywhich was of course the last thing on gods green earth you wanted even so walsh said youd better take it to the medical officer sergeant jock yelpedpure anguish i mean it walsh said theyve got new pills that can really cure you you take em you keep it in your trousers for a bit and a few days later youre fine thats better than letting the clap stew nah it aint the yorkshireman shook his head again ah dont wahnt nobody tken of it his accent thickened as he got more upset walsh set a hand on his shoulder look things are going to the devil around here nobodys going to worry about paperwork at a time like this the sawbones will jock spoke with dour certainty tell the miserable quack to fix you up and tell him to talk to me before he goes and gets all regulation on you walsh said ill take care of ityou see if i dont all right jock still sounded miserable and well he might he didnt seem so proud now of jumping on that friendly norwegian lady though doubtless he had been at the time an artillery barrage livened things up after jock mooched off sure as hell the germans had plenty of ammunition even if the expeditionary force didnt in weather like this shells didnt tear up the landscape the way they did in a more civilized climate snowdrifts muffled bursts and even a made a crater only a little bigger than a washtub when the ground was frozen hard after the barrage let up the fritzes came forward on foot machine guns and accurate rifle fire soon persuaded them that they hadnt blasted their foes to kingdom come they pulled back leaving a few bloody bodies on the snow between the two sides lines by the same token wounded tommies and poilus and squareheads went back toward namsos for treatment as jock had before them walsh hoped he could deliver on his promise to the yorkshireman doctors were nominally officers they didnt have to listen to a career noncom though the ones with any sense commonly did captain beverly murdoch seemed typical of the breed though overworked and indifferently shaved his accent and the way he looked at walsh declared him a member of the upper classes chaps like him its no wonder a bloke like trotsky gets a hearing walsh thought irreverently i am given to understand you wish this man treated for his social disease in an informal fashion murdochs tone said that ought to be a hanging matter on the off chance it wasnt yes sir walsh kept his response as simple as he could why the word sounded colder than the norwegian winter enfolding them hes a good soldier sir ive known him a long time he took what he could get but plenty of others wouldve done the same i might myself if the lady was pretty so might you walsh hoped the quack wasnt a fairy that would queer his pitch and the way things are right now we need all the men we can find and we need them with the best morale they can get since you have your pills id do better using them on wounded men than on those who diseased themselves murdoch broke in sir hes wounded in war too in a manner of speaking he never would have met that woman if we hadnt been posted to norway walsh said no he would have got his dose from some french twist instead murdoch sent him an unfriendly look and i suppose youll find ways to make my life miserable if i dont play along how can i do that sir im only a staff sergeant walsh might have been innocence personified he might have been but the doctor knew he wasnt people like you have their ways he said sourly half the time i think officers run the army on the sufferance of sergeants walsh thought the same thing but more often than half the time all the same he said im afraid i dont know what you mean sir yes likely tell murdoch made a disgusted gesture all right have your way dammit hell get the bloody sulfanilamide and ill write it up as a skin infection much obliged to you sir walsh knew he might have to pay the sawbones back one day but hed worry about that when the time came he had got his way and jock wasnt in a jam on account of it except for the norwegian winter and the advancing nazis everything was fine hansulrich rudel had thought hed flown his ju under primitive conditions in france and so he had with its heavy fixed undercarriage the stuka was made for taking off and landing on dirt airstrips all the same hed been flying in france and france was a civilized country poland now the pilot came from silesia he knew about poles knew what germans in that part of the reich knew about them anyhow they were lazy shiftless drunken sneaky not to be trusted behind your back nothing he saw in this village east of warsaw made him want to change his mind if anything the poles here were even worse because they hadnt been leavened by germans the way they had in silesia they were well on their way to being russians and how could you say anything worse about a folk with no germans in these parts till the wehrmacht came to pull the poles chestnuts out of the fire the only leavening they got was from jews a jew named fink ran the local pharmacy another one named grinszpan was the village bookkeeper yet another named cohen pulled teeth a pole owned the newspaper in bialystok the nearest real city but his editor was a jew named blum and on and on rudel thought the jews in the reich had got what was coming to them after the fuhrer took over he knew for a fact that poles liked jews even less than germans did but he and his comrades were forbidden from giving jews whatfor here the poles hadnt cleared them out of their own armed forces even if they didnt like them and no matter how the poles felt jews still had legal equality in poland orders are orders said colonel steinbrenner the wing commander all we have to do is follow them theyre crazy orders hansulrich complained the poles are on our side but the way they act they might as well be bolsheviks plenty of jew officers in the red army steinbrenner shook his head he preferred a germanissue tent to a house in the village which would probably be full of vermin hansulrich felt the same way the colonel said no lieutenant the poles are not on our side sir hansulrich repeated in surprise the poles are not on our side steinbrenner repeated if they sent troops to france to fight alongside our men there those troops would be on our side in poland were on their side they asked us in to help against the russians we have to play by their rules here not by ours no matter how stupid those rules are rudel said no matter the wing commander agreed the only reason the poles dont hate us worse than the ivans is the ivans hit them first we cant afford to give them an excuse to turn on us that did make military sense even so hansulrich said they ought to be grateful were giving them a hand without us the russians would be in warsaw by now and how would the poles like that not much theyd probably fall to piecesand then wed have the red army on our border steinbrenner said that would be just what we need wouldnt it with us up to our eyebrows in the west they could give us one straight up the ass theyd do it too in a heartbeat they would rudel didnt argue with him when you were a first lieutenant arguing with a colonel was a losing proposition besides here steinbrenner was pretty plainly right i guess so sir hansulrich said and everybody could see we were going to take a whack at the bolsheviks sooner or later thats what the fuhrer s always wanted to do all right steinbrenner said but hes always wanted to pay the jews back for betraying the vaterland at the end of the last war too one thing at a timewhen you can anyhow colonel steinbrenner said thats only good strategy first we win the war then we take care of anything else that needs doing you can count on the general staff to have the sense to see as much most of the highranking officers whod tried to overthrow hitler at christmastime the year before served on the general staff hansulrich rudel was not the most politic of men but even he could see that pointing out as much to his superior would win him no points besides he knew steinbrenner was loyal the wing commander had replaced another officer in france one suspected of insufficient enthusiasm for the national socialist cause where was the other fellow now dachau belsen a hole in the ground better not to wonder about such things when the weather cleared enough to let him fly rudel felt nothing but relief in the air he didnt have to think about jews or politics or the price of being mistrusted by the government he had to look for red army panzers that was it when he found them he had to dive on them and shoot them up his ju carried a mm cannon under each wing the extra weight and drag made the stuka even more of a lumbering pig in the air than it would have been otherwise if red air force fighters jumped him hed go into some russian pilots trophy case till that evil day came if it ever did he was very bad news everything clear behind us albert he asked through the brass speaking tube if it werent id be screaming my head off sergeant albert dieselhorst was rear gunner and radioman he and rudel sat backtoback separated by an armored bulkhead if anyone had a better understanding than hansulrich of how limited the stuka was in the air dieselhorst was the man the ivans were masters of camouflage whitewash and concealment under trees or white cloth could make it hard to spot a panzer on the ground at a hundred meters let alone from several thousand up in the air but not even the russians could hide the long shadows panzers cast on the snow there they are hansulrich yipped excitedly go get em lieutenant dieselhorst said it was all news to him like epimetheus in the greek myth he could see only where hed already been hansulrich heeled the ju into a dive he hung suspended against his harness for a moment then building acceleration shoved him back into his seat it would be trying to tear the rear gunner from his and throw him out of the plane over his machine gun down on the ground the panzers swelled from specks to toys to real deadly whitewashed machines he dove from behind when he struck he fired a round from each gun at the engine compartment the steel on the decking there was thin and pierced to let heat escape he hauled back on the stick as hard as he could to pull the stuka out of the dive nailed him sergeant dieselhorst yelled through the tube hes on fire good hansulrich climbed as steeply as he could he picked another camouflaged panzer and dove on it two more rounds another burning machine or so the rear gunner assured him some of the crewmen on the other panzers popped out of hatches to blaze away at the ju with pistols and submachine guns but rudel wouldnt lose any sleep over that smallarms fire could bring down an airplane but it didnt happen every day or every month either he blasted three more russian panzers the rest started up and skedaddled for the nearest trees then dieselhorst said im getting reports of planes in the neighborhood all right well go home hansulrich had heard the reports in his earphones too he hadnt wanted to do anything about that sometimes discretion was the better part of valor though he could gas up again and hit the ivans on a stretch of front where they didnt have any air cover a flak shell burst under the stuka staggering it in the sky no the russians didnt want him around anymore he gave the plane more throttle if theyd got set up a little sooner they might have knocked him down not now just another morning at the office sergeant dieselhorst said aber naturlich hansulrich laughed why not just another day at the office sureand theyd lived through it sergeant hideki fujita had thought winter in the siberian forests was about as bad as anything could be it was worse than winter on the border with mongolia which made it pretty appalling but winter in front of vladivostok turned out to be worse yet it was as cold as the rest of siberia with the same wet heavy snowfall but it was out in the opennowhere to hide from the relentlessly probing russian artillery the red army was always assdeep in guns russian artillerymen had harried the japanese on the frontier between manchukuo and mongolia theyd fused their shells to burst as soon as they touched the treetops in the woods showering japanese forces astride the transsiberian railway with deadly fragments and here in front of their far eastern port they tried to murder anything that moved they came much too close to succeeding kilometer upon kilometer of barbed wire and entrenchments ringed vladivostok the soviet union had always known it might have to fight for the place one day if japan was going to take it her soldiers would have to winkle out the red army men one foxhole at a time more than a generation earlier the fight for port arthur had gone the same way some of the men commanding at vladivostok would have been junior officers in the earlier fight fujita hoped theyd learned something in the intervening years by everything he could see it didnt seem likely he mostly huddled in a dugout scraped from the forward wall of a trench digging was anything but easy the ground was frozen hard as stone it wouldnt collapse under shellfire which was something not enough not as far as fujita was concerned japanese and russian cannon dueled with one another machine guns made sticking your head up over the parapet tantamount to committing seppuku runners who brought rice and other food up from the field kitchens risked their life with every trip even when they made it through meals were commonly cold by the time they reached the frontline soldiers rumors flew thick and fast as bullets some people said the russian commander was about to surrender the way the nobleman in charge of port arthur had in fujita didnt believe that one hed spent too long fighting the russians to doubt they were in earnest they might bungle thingsthey werent always skillful soldiers but no matter what theyd been like in no one who fought them now could think theyd quit so easily other rumors claimed the japanese would soon charge the works in front of them again fujita had to hope those werent true too many frozen corpses still sprawled suspended in the wire ahead along with solidifying the ground the cold meant dead bodies didnt stink having said those two things you exhausted its virtues fujita wanted the generals to come up with something brilliant or at least clever if they tried something like that he was less likely to get killed or maimed than if they just pounded away they didnt seem to worry about that as far as generals were concerned soldiers were only munitions of war expendable as machinegun bullets or mm shells far off in the distance vladivostok itself burned black columns of smoke rose into the sky all day long japanese bombers pounded the city night and day when as occasionally happened the wind blew from the south instead of the north the halfspicy halfchoking smell of smoke filled fujitas nostrils russian fighters rarely came up to challenge the japanese planes the reds hadnt had many fighters when fujita got here and they had fewer now fighters were shortrange planes the soviet union couldnt bring in more very easily russian bombers by contrast flew over fairly often for the most part at night fujita had no idea where they came from some landing strip up in siberia the northern soviet half of the island japan called karafuto and the russians sakhalin no doubt it mattered to his superiors who had to decide what to do about the air raids to fujita they were only one more annoyance machinegun bullets and the deadly artillery were worse and worse still was knowing his regiment was only an officers whim from being thrown into the fire of a frontal attack many went forward few came backeven fewer unmaimed shinjiro hayashi a superior private in fujitas section had been a student when conscription nabbed him he still had a calculating turn of mind if we use up a regiment to take a stretch of ground two hundred meters wide and fifty meters deep how many will we use to advance twenty kilometers on a front at least fifty kilometers around he asked when fujita was in school hed hated problems like that he tried to work this one but didnt like the answer he got i dont know if there are that many regiments in japan he said i dont either sergeant san hayashi answered somberly and what was fujita supposed to do with that a sergeant punished defeatism wherever he found it and a sergeant had the rightthe dutyto beat the snot out of his underlings when they didnt live up to his expectations or sometimes whenever he felt like it but the only thing the senior private had done was ask a simple question they went back to mongolia together too instead of belting hayashi then fujita said if you open your big yap any wider youll fall right in hayashi got the message ill be careful sergeant san he promised youd better fujita growled but he didnt sound angry enough to frighten a nineyearold let alone a combat veteran then they got something to be frightened about an order to attack the red army positions in front of them fujita was a combat veteran all right and he was scared green he spent half an hour sharpening his bayonet he didnt think that would keep him alive but it gave him something to do so he wouldnt have to worrytoo muchabout what lay ahead no artillery preparation that the officers said would warn the russians and so it would but it would also kill a lot of them and flatten some of the wire in front of their trenches what could you do liveif theyd let you he couldnt even tell his men the red army soldiers would have loot worth taking in mongolia russian gear and rations seemed luxurious to the japanese not here the russians around vladivostok had been under siege for months even by japanese standards they didnt have much the only covering fire the attackers got came from machine guns ever since the fight at port arthur the japanese had handled those aggressively if the gunners shot a few of their own men in the back well to everyone but the luckless victims that was only a cost of doing business mouth dry fujita ran forward hunched over as low as he could go the russian maxim guns needed only a few seconds to snarl to life bullets coming toward him bullets snapping past him from behind hed been places he liked more less maybe not he tripped over something and fell full length in the snow two bullets one coming and the other going slammed together about where hed just been they fell beside him sending up a small plume of steam he hardly noticed and had no idea how lucky he was he got up again and stumbled on not all the japanese soldiers whod gone down would get up again if you lost a regiment taking a stretch of ground not very wide and even less deep he called down elaborate curses on shinjiro hayashis learned head some soldiers had wire cutters some of them stayed unwounded long enough to get up to the vicious stuff and cut it more japanese soldiers fujita among them pushed through the gaps and rushed the russian trenches a red army man popped up like a marmot he aimed his rifle at the sergeant fujita fired first he missed but he made the russian duck with a cry of banzai fujita leaped into the trench after him the russian shot at him from almost pointblank range he missed anyhow fujita lunged with the bayonet while the russian was working the bolt the point went home the white man screamed and dropped the rifle fujita stuck him again and again till he finally fell over even then he kept thrashing on the cold hard ground until the sergeant shot him in the head people could be awfully hard to kill little by little paying a price the japanese cleared the russians from three or four rows of trenches no not much left in the dead mens pockets though fujita did get some russian cigarettesa little tobacco at the end of a long paper holder he lit one the smoke was harsh as sandpaper but he didnt care senior private hayashi sidled up to him and spoke in a low voice if clearing a space two hundred meters by fifty meters costs most of a regiment oh shut up fujita exclaimed he tried to blow a smoke ring spain was miserably hot in summer and miserably cold in winter coming as he did from new york city chaim weinberg had reckoned himself a connoisseur of both extremes he had to admit though that spain went further in both directions than his home town spain seemed to go allout in everything american politics matched one side of the center against the other and endlessly played the game of compromise solution communists like chaim couldnt get a serious hearing there and so hed come to spain with the abraham lincoln brigade to do what he could for the leftwing republic against marshal sanjurjos fascists who held more than half of it hed sweltered hed frozen the way he was freezing now hed argued in english in yiddish that often did duty for german and in bad spanish the republic ran on argument no less than on gasoline and high explosives hed learned to drink wine from a leather sack and to roll his own smokes hed killed hed been wounded hed got laid if you were an excitable young man who hadnt done most of those things before sweltering freezing and arguing came naturally spain could look a lot like paradise but if this was paradise it needed rebuilding sanjurjos men and the italian and german mercenaries who fought on their side had done their best to knock madrid flat their best was good but not good enough buildings had chunks bitten out of them hardly any windows were glazed craters in streets and sidewalks made getting anywhere in town an adventure chaim didnt care the madrilenos carried on as if the war were a million miles away as well as they could when going hungry or huddling in a cellar while bombs rained down didnt distract them if the wine reminded him of vinegar or piss if the cigarettes tasted of hay or horseshit or other street scrapings well so what you could still get drunk whatever else went into the cigarettes they had enough tobacco so you didnt think youd quit and the people everybody called everyone else tu the formal usted hadnt been banned in the republic but anyone who used it might get sent off for reeducation women acted like men in the shops in the streets and in bed yes chaim had got laid if you couldnt get laid in the spanish republic you werent half trying prisoners from the other side who were brought into madrid had to think theyd landed on mars where the republic jumped on class and sex distinctions with both feet under the fascist regime they got enforced more strongly than ever enforcing the ruling classs dominance was what fascism was all about almost by accident chaim had got the job of reindoctrinating those prisoners his spanish still wasnt the best but it did the joband if he was fluent in any part of the language it was marxistleninist jargon besides spaniards were absurdly respectful of foreigners the fascists even respected italians for crying out loud prisoners assumed an american had to be a political sophisticate chaim knew better but didnt let on that he did the pow camp was in a park near the center of madrid when enemy planes came over at night they dropped their bombs more or less at random they bombed their own people too sometimes they blasted the camps barbedwire perimeter that led to escapes pows on the loose in madrid werent much shabbier than anybody else and looked acted and sounded like any other spaniards it also led to casualties chaim still wasnt sure whether joaquin delgadillo a man hed captured himself was the one or the other delgadillo wasnt in the camp any more chaim knew that but whether the spaniard had got away after a bombing run or been blasted into unrecognizable scraps of meat the guards had no idea they only shrugged one or the other they chorused but which chaim demanded differences are important one or the other the guards said again they didnt get it maybe they needed to listen to his harangues too someone on this side of the wire listened intently to what he told the captured fascists the authorities wanted to make sure he preached only good pure true communist doctrine heaventhe heaven he didnt believe inhelp him if he showed himself out of step with what moscow decreed to be so or worse if he showed hed fallen into the trotskyist heresy there were times when the old inquisition had nothing on the republic though chaim didnt think of it like that he didnt not least because his minder was one of the bestlooking women hed ever set eyes on la martellitaher nom de guerre meant the little hammer filled out overalls in a way their designer never intended midnight hair snapping eyes coral lips a piquant nose he was in love or at least in lust la martellita looked at him as if shed just found half of him in her apple if she didnt like what he said she might be able to have him shot he didnt care if anything the aura of danger that fit her as tightly as those overalls only made him hotter he didnt even know her real name she wouldnt tell him and he hadnt found anybody else who knew one of these days he would and then casually in just the right spot hed call her by it and then what chances were shed tell him to fuck off even rejection coming from her seemed sweet which was a good thing because rejection and criticism were all he got from her he did try to be more careful with the doctrine he preached to the prisoners he didnt want to die at the hands of his own side he didnt want to die at all he aspired to be shot at the age of by an outraged husband hed come to spain to fight the enemies of marxismleninism not its friends when he said as much to la martellita she curled her kissable upper lip then you shouldnt deviate from the party line she said as if she were a bishop complaining about a priests sermon chaim was no priest he didnt have to stay celibate he didnt want to either la martellita was also free unlike a lot of her spanish sisters she wasnt easy though not with him why dont you go play with yourself she said when she couldnt be in any doubt of his interest spanish women could also be very blunt youd be more fun he answered honestly not with you i wouldnt she said youd make any woman wish she were with somebody else she stalked away maybe she didnt realize how her hips swung more likely she was doing it with malice aforethought oh yeah he wanted to shout back like a stupid kid says you every once in a while hed learned keeping his big mouth shut came in handy this looked like one of those times maybe the way to her heart lay in the straight party line but chaim while a good communist was also an american to the tips of his stubby fingers he enjoyed tinkering with ideas the way a lot of his countrymen enjoyed tinkering with motors he tore them down and rebuilt them and did his damnedest to get them working better than ever if they werent always the same afterwards so what they were new and improvedtwo magic words in the states not in spain not in the ussr either something chaim preferred to forget he knew about the gulagsknew they existed anyhow and held dissidents he also preferred to forget that here a parrot did better than a tinkerer chaim had never been a parrot and didnt want to start but he did want to jump on la martellitas elegantly cushioned bones weinberg wants a cracker he screeched in english it wouldnt have made sense to the guards even in their own language he dreaded call didnt always come with a knock on the door in the middle of the night lieutenant anastas mouradian was eating blintzes and drinking his breakfast tea when a hardfaced noncom carrying a submachine gun strode up to him in the officers mess and barked comrade lieutenant colonel borisov requires your presence immediately across the table from mouradian his pilot looked horrified sergei yaroslavsky had warned him again and again that he was too sarcastic too skeptical for his own good maybe sergeid been right all along nothing showed on the armenians swarthy face now never let them know youre worried mouradian thought and a whole fat lot of good that would do him if theyd already built a case with his name on it if the powers that be wanted to give him a plot of earth two meters long a meter wide and two meters deep they damn well would and that was all there was to it he got to his feet i serve the soviet union he said in his throatily accented russian hoping it wasnt for the last time russians from siberia talked about the whisper of stars weather so cold that when you exhaled the moisture in your breath audibly froze they claimed it never got that cold on this side of the urals mouradian couldnt have said one way or the other hed never heard the socalled whisper of stars but maybe the siberians were lying about it even without it the weather seemed plenty cold enough he was glad for his flying suit of leather and fur and for the thick felt valenki that kept his feet from freezing the russians were good at fighting winterand they needed to be he often wondered why so many men from the south where the weather was mostly decent came up here to make their careers when it got this cold he wondered why hed ever wanted to leave armenia himself but the answer was simple armenia and the rest of the caucasus were only a little pond if you wanted to see how good you were in the ocean you came north and measured yourself against the swarms of russians it had worked out pretty well for georgianborn joseph dzugashvili who commonly went by the russian handle of stalin these days of course things that worked out well for stalin had a way of working not so well for other people mouradian glanced over at the sergeant with the machine pistol the son of a bitch looked depressingly alert were a couple of nkvd men waiting for mouradian along with colonel borisov would they ship him off to kolyma or some other garden spot so he could find out about the whisper of stars for himself hed know soon here was the wing commanders tent the sergeant gestured with his weapon telling mouradian to go in sighing out fog but no stars the copilot and bombaimer obeyed no nkvd men only colonel borisov sitting behind a card table that held some papers and a tumbler full of clear liquid despite a brazier next to the table water would have frozen in a hurry but knowing borisovs habits mouradian would have been astonished had the glass held water saluting the armenian said reporting as ordered comrade colonel yes borisov looked and sounded bleary had he started drinking this early in the morning or had he been at it all night so it wasnt early for him he stared at mouradian out of pale eyes narrowed by a tatar fold at the inner corners are you capable of piloting an sb da comrade colonel mouradian answered a copilot needed to be able to fly his plane if anything happened to the pilota mm cannon shell from a messerschmitt saybringing the bomber home would be up to him colonel borisov should have known that chances were he did when he was sober he took a slug from that tumbler and breathed antifreeze fumes into mouradians face good he said very good in fact he reached for a penciland missed not a bit put out he tried again this time he captured it he made a check mark on one of the papers get your things well put you in a panje wagon and haul you off to the nearest railhead i serve the soviet union mouradian said and then comrade colonel where am i going what will i be doing when i get there it still might be kolyma despite the blather about whether he could fly the plane some russians were sheeplike enough to report to the gulag even without guards to make sure they got there if borisov thought mouradian grew that kind of wool he would soon discover that men from the caucasus werent so naive you will report to far eastern aviation theyre screaming for pilots there borisov told him i dont know what youll be doing but fuck your mother if its not likely to be dropping rocks on the little yellow monkeys heads so it would be siberia then but hed go there as a free man a soldier not as a disgraced prisoner mouradian suddenly felt ten degrees warmer even if colonel borisovs tent remained cold as a hailstone i serve the soviet union he said yet again this time gladly ah you have written orders for me without them hed never get aboard the local train let alone the transsiberian railway borisov blinked owlishly oh sure theyre here somewhere he fumbled through papers then thrust one at mouradian here mouradian eyed it sir this is a scheme for winning at dice what give it back to me the wing commander snatched it out of his hand he did some more shuffling this is the one you need the other one no doubt was the one borisov needed himself mouradian carefully examined the new document sure enough it showed that borisov was duly providing the pilot hed been ordered to furnish however will you please put my name on it oh all right by the way borisov sighed anastas was asking for the sun the moon and the stars the colonel scribbled mouradian checked again it would do borisov had remembered who he was he went out to collect his things the submachineguntoting sergeant still accompanied him sergei was in the tent waiting for him what are they doing to you the pilot asked alarm in his voice siberia mouradian answered as he threw this that and the other thing into a duffel bag bozhemoi yaroslavsky said i tried to tell you no not the camps anastas joke had worked almost too well far eastern aviation theyll make me a pilot so the japanese can shoot me down oh yaroslavsky kissed him on both cheeks and gave him a hug well stay as safe as you can you crazy bastard i hope i see you after the war that would be good or maybe we wont have to wait so long who knows who knows anything nowadays mouradian slung the duffel over his shoulder and went out into the cold again the stonefaced noncom drove the panje wagon too with its boatlike body and big wheels the wagon could get through winter snow and spring and autumn mud that stymied fancier transport for a wonder the germans hadnt hit the railway station the young lieutenant whod taken over for the civilian stationmaster gave mouradian a seat in a secondclass compartment mouradian shrugged he could have got a hard bench instead youll go out at twentythree minutes past nine the lieutenant told him he was impressed at the precision the train actually rattled out of the station a little past noon that left mouradian and the other officers in the compartment resigned but hardly surprised only a fool or a german would expect a schedule and reality to have much to do with each other they shared bread and sausages and cigarettes and vodka they told dirty jokes most of them were going on leave they sent mouradian pitying glances when they found out he wasnt siberia one of them said thats a devil of a long way from here from everywhere in fact i serve the soviet union mouradian said one more time here the stock phrase meant im stuck with it dont we all pal dont we all said a red army lieutenant who seemed to have more booze than he knew what to do with so he shared with everyone else in the compartment it was samogan moonshinebut it was good samogan as good as some of the legitimate which is to say taxed firewater mouradian had drunk the army man was genially tipsy too he kept coming out with one funny outrageous crack after another the rest of the passengers laughed like loons pretty soon they were making their own outrageous cracks all of them but stas maybe the red army man was what he seemed to be a fellow with plenty of hooch and a quick tongue then again maybe his proper armofservice color was nkvd blue maybe he was looking to build some cases he wouldnt build one against anastas mouradian despite what sergei said mouradian didnt run his mouth all the time or in the company of people he feared were provocateurs and vodka didnt make him lose his caution some soviet citizens ended up in the gulag for talking too much while they were drunk but the ussr had even more drunks than camp inmates plastered or not most drunks knew how to keep their big mouths shut and if that wasnt a judgment on the soviet system mouradian didnt know what would be back when he was conscripted luc harcourt had never imagined he would be proud of the two brown hash marks on his sleeve that proclaimed him a corporal all hed wanted to do was put in his time and get the hell out he was a normal draftee in other words things looked different when you got into a war the nasty boys in fieldgray were doing their damnedest to overrun your countryand not too incidentally to murder you what seemed a waste of time when he could have been working and chasing girls in the peacetime civilian world was suddenly a rather more important business he was proud of commanding a machine gun too and that his subordinates thought he was doing a good job of it joinville was a small swarthy excitable gascon they called villehardouin tiny in fact he was enormous big and strong and blond and fair he hardly said anything at least in frenchhe was much more at home in breton joinville had learned some of it and luc was starting to pick it up it made a good language to swear in joinville carried the hotchkiss machine gun tiny villehardouin toted the tripod which weighed a couple of kilos more other soldiersjust who could varylugged crates full of the aluminum strips of bullets that fed the hotchkiss gun luc as befitted his exalted rank carried nothing except when they couldnt dragoon any privates into hauling whatever needed hauling then luc took care of it hed been a private not so long before he didnt have much dignity to stand on that was one of the reasons the other men who served the machine gun thought he made a pretty fair leader so did sergeant demange whod given him the slot after the poor fellow who had it became a casualty demanges approval was worth having especially if he was set over you he was a professional noncom hed fought in the last war and been wounded a gitane always hung from one corner of his mouth it didnt keep him from being fluently profane the milk of human kindness ran thin and curdled in him he was the most cynical man luc had ever met you can really handle that motherfucker he told luc after a skirmish in which the hotchkiss helped send the germans off unhappy you see youre not quite the stupid gutless asshole you were when you got sucked into the army thanks a bunch sergeant luc said in lieu of why dont you suck this hed come far enough in his military career that he could sass demange every now and again he had to pick his spots though or hed end up in the hospital and not on account of the boches any time kid demange grinned showing teeth all those smokes had stained a nasty yellowbrownif they werent that shade to begin with he had to know what luc was thinking mere thinking couldnt land you in trouble unless demange felt like putting you there artillery rumbled off to the east whatever the nazis were after it was nothing close by nobody luc knew would get hurt when those shells came down sometimes that seemed to be the only thing that mattered when you were in the middle of it war could get very tribal we should have pushed them back farther luc said discontentedly no shit demange exclaimed the cigarette jerking up and down we shouldve given em the bums rush is what we shouldve done how come we havent luc wondered demange rolled his eyes which were always tracked with red it made him look angry which he wasor if he wasnt he could have taken his act on stage how come ill fucking tell you how come on account of the germans scare half our generals shitless and a big chunk of the other half want to hop into bed with em so we can all fight the cocksucking bolsheviks together thatd screw things up wouldnt it oh just a little demange spat out the butt which was so short the coal almost singed his lips he immediately took out the pack again after he got a fresh one going he grudgingly held out the pack to luc thanks luc took a smoke then bent over and leaned close for a light he was several centimeters taller than demange who intimidated the hell out of him even so and no doubt the veteran noncom knew what he was talking about here every squad in the french army had a communist or two in it no matter what the rightwing generalsalmost a redundancythought the reds wouldnt be thrilled about fighting alongside the nazis and against the fount of marxismleninism luc was no communist he didnt want to fight alongside the germans either theyd come too close to killing him too many times theyd killed friends and wounded others he respected their skill he didnt think you could go up against germans without quickly coming to respect it all the same as far as he was concerned they made better enemies than allies of course a devil of a lot of generals felt that way about russians sergeant demange was righttheyd sooner go after the ussr than germany that to lucs mind was carrying things too far the wind wailed down off the north sea snow swirled in it it had been snowing in a halfhearted way all morning long now anything more than a few meters away vanished behind that thick white cloak luc shivered in his greatcoat the wind didnt seem to know it was there merde alors he shouted over that wailing how are we supposed to fight a war in such filthy weather the boches could bring up an armored division but wed never know it till the tanks started killing us its a cunt of a winter all right sergeant demange shouted back to hell with me if i remember a worse one and i go back a fuck of a lot furthern you do but you know what else what luc asked goddamn nazisre just as screwed up as we are two three five kilometers from here some poor cocksucking boche is sitting there shivering and scared to death our tanks are right outside his trench getting ready to squash him into a blancmange and he hates his generals and his politicians every fucking bit as much as we hate ours oh yeah luc said deeply skeptical why would he his generals halfway know what theyre doing more than you can say about ours why ill tell you why and demange proceeded to because his generals tried to get hitler but screwed it up thats why now nobody on the other side trusts anybody else and when nazis start not trusting each other people end up dead he twisted his skinny ratlike face into an exaggerated look of regret breaks my heart yknow ill bet luc answered which squeezed a wry chuckle out of the sergeant demange lit another gitane he could have been in a hurricane with winds of kilometers an hour and rain coming down like noahs flood and he still would have got his cigarette going cigarettes after all were important ive wasted enough time on you he said now ill go waste it with some other sorry son of a bitch love you too sergeant luc said laughingand of course smokingdemange ambled away if the cold bothered him he gave no sign what was he going on about joinville asked in his nasal accent after the sergeant was gone he distrusted sergeants on general principles as most privates did being a gascon he perhaps distrusted them more than most he also hated the weather more than most before luc could answer the swarthy southerner added whole german armys liable to be waiting out there luc repeated what demange had said about the boches fearing the french army the same way he said that joinville asked luc nodded joinville grunted well hes a prick but i guess hes not such a dumb prick by the way he eyed luc the same applied to him joinville might think luc made a good commander for the machine gun but he didnt like authority of any sort he made funny noises for tiny translating the talk into what passed for breton villehardouin nodded to show he got it they all crouched and waited for whatever happened next luc wished to god winter would finally give it up neither god nor winter seemed to be listening corporal arno baatz had his knickers in a twist awful arno often got his knickers in a twist but for once he wasnt pissing and moaning about willi dernen willi approved of that he could handle the poilus who were trying to punch his ticket for him but as somebody famous must have said at one time or another god deliver him from his socalled friends awful arno pointed southwest toward the closest french foxholes for heavens sake men be careful as long as this damned blizzard lasts he said the frogeaters could sneak a whole army corps past our pickets in weather like this he went on like that every time a blizzard tried to bury the german positions in northeastern france under untold meters of snow in this truly godawful winter he said it and said it and said it some more willi was sick and tired of listening to him of course willi had been sick and tired of listening to awful arno long before this winter rolled around but that was another story a soldier named klaus metzger said hey corporal dont you figure the frenchies are as worried about us as we are about them exactly the same thought had gone through willis mind but he knew enough to keep his mouth shut he didnt feel like drawing baatzs fire todaylife was too short metzger was a new replacement and still naive about the ways of noncoms well hed find out and he did awful arno swelled up like a puff adder about to strike willi didnt think puff adders turned that unhealthy shade of purplish red though dont you tell me what to figure i tell you what to figure baatz yelled have you got that sure sure metzger said with a placating little wave it failed to placate awful arno went plumcolored not a hue a human being was meant to have he screamed the question again right in metzgers face have you got that memories of apoplectic drill sergeants in basic training must have come back to the luckless private he stiffened to a rigor mortislike attention the heels of his boots crashed together jawohl herr unteroffizier he said zu befehl herr unteroffizier baatz went right on screaming at him baatz screamed at people for the fun of it willi didnt think screaming at people was much fun but hed known plenty of noncoms who did awful arno had the disease worse than most and he had the rank that gave him the right to be a pain in the ass after he finally made klaus metzger eat enough crow to keep himself happy he stomped off to inflict himself on soldiers farther down the trench metzger stared after him wow that was fun the new fish said is he always so bad willi shook his head nah sometimes hes worse awful arno whirled willid forgotten he had rabbit ears what was that dernen he shouted nothing corporal willi was ready to lie to save his own skin or just to save himself grief ja ja tell me another one but baatz must have picked up tone rather than words because he left it there willi celebrated by lighting a gitane from a pack hed taken off a captured frenchman can i have one of those metzger asked sure steady your nerves now that hes done fucking you over willi gave him the smoke and a light metzgers cheeks hollowed as he inhaled then he coughed he eyed the gitane with sudden wary respect what the hell do the frenchies put in there tastes like im smoking barbed wire thats real tobacco kiddo is what that is willi answered we mix ours with god knows what to stretch it further you taste the straight goods again youre not used to it any more you forget how strong it can be strong i hope to shit one of these things could win the olympic weightlifting medal if they ever hold the games again metzger said not this year willi said were playing a different game now the other landser nodded isnt that the sad and sorry truth a mortar round came down a few meters in front of the trench willi hated mortars as much as anything in this different game you could hear ordinary artillery coming often soon enough to have a good chance to duck if the shell didnt land right on top of you you were probably fine but only a faint whistle betrayed a mortar bomb before it burst and ducking after it burst was what the tommies called tough shit metzger stared when willi threw himself flat he didnt know what to listen for yet come to that willi wasnt consciously aware of why he hit the dirt he only knew he needed to the bang and the snarl and screech of fragments slicing by overhead filled in the wherefores a moment later klaus metzger stretched out beside him you all right willi asked metzger wasnt screaming but wounds didnt always hurt right away ja the other soldier answered took me by surprise howd you know it was coming willi shrugged horizontally theres a little noise youll get the hang of it pretty quickespecially if they keep this shit up more french mortar bombs were falling on or near the german entrenchments down the trench from the direction in which corporal baatz had gone someone started squalling like a stuck shoat was it awful arno too much to hope for willi supposed be ready when they stop he shouted in between explosions thats when the froggiesll hit us on foot if theyre going to right metzger said with all this goddamn snow theyll be on top of us before we know theyre here more fun when a girl gets on top of you before you know shes there willi agreed klaus made a face at him willi went on why dyou think theyd pick now to try it i just hope like hell our machine gunners arent off playing skat or something youre a funny fellow arent you funny like the cholera i mean metzger said thats me willi said not without pride the mortar bombs quit dropping even before officers whistles shrilled urging the men to their posts willi was up on a firing step a round chambered and a fresh clip in his mauser klaus metzger stood beside him both men peered out into the snowstorm was that motion there or only willis anxious imagination he didnt want to wait around and discover hed made a mistake by getting killed nothing up ahead belonged to his own sidehe was sure of that shoot first and ask questions later then just like a western from america klaus fired a split second after he did did the other landser think he saw something too or was he simply following willis lead one of their bulletsthey never did know whichwas rewarded with a scream of anguish the french soldiers sneaking up under cover of the blizzard opened fire then willi shot back working the mausers bolt as fast as he could other men along the line also banged away the poilus werent close enough to throw grenades into the trenches another minute or two of sneaking and they would have been willi slapped a new magazine onto his rifle then the germans mgs opened up the froggies cried out in despair machine guns put so many rounds in the air they didnt have to be either lucky or good to hit you they just had to keep firing keep traversing so their bullets didnt all follow the same path and sooner or later a man out in the open would stop one usually sooner the french attack petered out willi didnt know how many casualties the men in the crested helmets and khaki took the swirling snow kept him from seeing most of them and let the poilus bring them back in their withdrawal he didnt think this was a cheap little affair though he turned to klaus metzger whod stayed steady as a veteran through it all you did good willi said and clapped him on the back here take a knock of this he offered his canteen which held some highly unofficial applejack whew klaus said after drinking thats got teeth but it sure hits the spot they grinned at each other willi hoped hed just made a friend sergei yaroslavsky wondered what to make of his new copilot and bombaimer vladimir federov looked more like a sergeantor a private first classthan a second lieutenant he was short and squat and powerful with a broad face high cheekbones and grayblue eyes that showed nothing he cropped his sandy hair close to the dome of his skull as an infantryman he obviously would have been firstrate as a flyer sergei wasnt so sure anastas mouradian talked too damn much stas thought too damn much by all appearances that wouldnt be federovs problem but mouradian was outstanding in the cockpit sergei feared that wouldnt be federovs problem either a safe question first whats your fathers name comrade lieutenant mikhail comrade pilot by his accent federov came from somewhere near moscow not from in the city or sergei didnt think so but also not from somewhere in the backwoods all right vladimir mikhailovich im sergei valentinovich maybe vladimir would turn to volodya as anastas had become stas or maybe not yaroslavsky shrugged to himself time would tell and our bombdropper is federov asked ivan kuchkov hes a sergeant a very strong man and nothing scares him sergei answered of course he has his quirks but who doesnt nobody im sure federov agreed politely what are some of his why dont you see for yourself youll meet him soon sergei didnt want to say that the bombaimer made the burly federov svelte by comparison he also didnt want to say sergeant kuchkov was one of the hairiest men hed ever seen not just on his head but all over his body people called kuchkov the chimp but not where he could hear them do it he had a habit of throwing men who used the nickname through windows doors walls and sergei didnt want to say that ivan conversed almost entirely in mat the russian sublanguage of ingenious obscenity sergei didnt even think the bombdropper had been a zek before the draft got him if ever a man was made for mat ivan kuchkov was that man since he didnt want to say any of those things he asked how did you become a flyer oh the usual way federov replied i was in osoaviakhim when i was a kid and i did well enough that they kept me at it after i got called up yaroslavsky nodded his own story wasnt much different nominally osoaviakhim was the national organization that trained civilian pilots the skills a civilian pilot needed of course were the same as the ones flying a fighter or bomber required no one ever said that out loud which made it no less true the germans had used the same dodge to slide around the treaty of versailles ban on military aviation as sergei had unpleasant reason to know luftwaffe pilots and bombardiers were mostly excellent as he also had unpleasant reason to know his own countrys standards were rather lower hows the plane vladimir federov asked thisll be the first time ive been in an sb that news disappointed sergei without surprising him experienced copilots like mouradian were getting planes of their own inexperienced men were getting experience instead and what do i get yaroslavsky wondered he silently answered his own question i get to be a nursemaid thats what aloud he said when we supported the spanish republic people called the sb the fighting bomberit was faster in the air than any of the fighters the fascists were using yes ive heard that federov answered well forget it sergei said bluntly it was true when we were going up against biplanes it sure as hell isnt true any more german messerschmitts are like sharks against mackerel even the polish pzls will outfly us and outshoot us what we do when fighters are around is we run otherwise its dos vidanya rodina so long motherland federov echoed so when do we get bombers that can hold their own against enemy fighters probably never sergei replied which made his new copilot give him a long slow blink he explained bombers bomb fighters shoot bombers down sounds obvious doesnt it but its not just obvious its true bombers carry more weight theyre less maneuverable and they have fewer guns pointing forward we do our best to hold off fighters but we cant play their game we play our own game instead lieutenant federov blinked again the same way it was an odd stagy expression sergei wondered what lay behind it was federov an nkvd man building a case against him because he had the gall to point out a plain truth too late to worry about it now come on sergei said you want to see the plane ill show you the sb sat in a revetment a white sheet hid it from prying eyesand from nazi reconnaissance aircraft in the shadow cast by the sheet a mechanic worked on the starboard engine he sketched a salute for sergei and gave vladimir federov a curious look word that mouradian had been transferred hadnt got to everybody ivan kuchkov was sitting in the pilots seat when sergei led federov into the cockpit the two men who didnt know each other stared who are you federov asked at the same time as kuchkov belligerently demanded who the fuck are you that should be who the fuck are you sir sergei said and made the introductions the chimp looked at federov as if to say red air force standards were lower than hed thought the new copilot looked at kuchkov as if to say he hadnt expected to see one like this outside of a zoo as meetings went it wasnt a success sergei could see that right off the bat federov didnt say anything much kuchkov muttered profanely under his breath but not far enough under it sergei and no doubt the new officer as well learned that he thought federov looked like a jerk and talked like a jerkoff in point of fact the chimp expressed himself more frankly he expressed himself so frankly that sergei leaned close to him come on ivan he said quietly you cant talk about a new crewmate like that why the fuck not ivan returned still not bothering to hold his voice down were supposed to fly with that whistleass peckerhead my dick we are hell screw us over some kind of wayyou wait and see how can you tell sergei asked clinically curious bozhemoi just look at the motherfucker fuck me in the mouth if hes not on the lam for something or other sergei didnt think vladimir federov looked like a robber one jump in front of the law to him the new crewman seemed more like a wouldbe tough guy than the genuine article trying to explain that to ivan would be pointless it would also be hopeless because the chimp was no more inclined to listen than a veritable anthropoid would have been disastrous introduction or not they flew their first mission together three days later theyand their squadron of sbsbombed the train station in bialystok to keep the fascists from moving men and materiel through it federov seemed able to handle the instruments and calculations a bombaimer had to use sergei wasnt sure the planes bombs hit the station but they came as close as anyone elses after the sb came back to the airstrip though ivan kuchkov said see i told you he was a useless cocksucker sergei sighed werent the nazis enough trouble plainly ivan didnt think so arah goldman and her mother and father stood in a long line outside the munster rathaus everybody in the linegraybeards younger adults children babieswas jewish everyone except the babies exempt by the tender mercy of the national socialist german workers party wore on his or her clothes a prominently displayed sixpointed yellow star with jude imprinted on it in big black hebraicstyle letters the nazis had figured out a brandnew way to make life miserable for jewish residents in germany jews were no longer citizens of the third reich they all had to get new identity cards and on each of those cards would be a new first name branding its possessor as a jewas if everything else the reich had done were somehow inadequate from now on her father samuel goldman would legally become moses samuel goldman all jewish men in germany would have moses grafted on in front of whatever their first name happened to be all jewish women would have a new first name affixed in front of their own too for them it was sarah no fair sarah said as the queue slowly advanced they shouldnt need to bother with me my cards already fine i could have stayed home and twiddled my thumbs instead of coming with you and twiddling your thumbs here father finished for her even if youve already got the name the government aims to give you its just as well you came along the new card will probably be different from the old one some other way too the people who run things will be able to see whos god forbid using an old id card and all the people who are will catch it hed spent many years in the classroom and lecture hall passing on his knowledge of ancient greece and especially rome like an actor he could put anything he wanted into his voice a stranger walking by would be sure he approved of all the moves the government made so would an informer sarah knew better so did her mother neither sarah nor hanna goldman said anything though why stir up more trouble didnt jews in germany already have plenty although a bright sun shone down from a blue sky it was still bitterly cold sarah couldnt remember a winter that had dug its claws in deeper or clung to germany to all of europe harder neither could father whod spent three winters in the trenches during the last war that he was a wounded decorated veteran made things a little easier for the goldmans than they were for most german jews not much but a little when you werent in such good shape you took what you could get naturally the jews went into the city hall by a side entrance if that line had snaked up the stairs to the main doorway jews might havegaspinconvenienced aryans in the third reich what could be worse nothing either sarah or nazi officials could think of portraits of hitler goring goebbels and other nazi bonzen hung on the walls of the hallway along which the jews had to go maybe it was sarahs imagination but the photographs seemed to be glowering at the chosen people maybe it was her imagination but she didnt think so when she whispered her thought to father he snorted softly and whispered back chosen people nothing were the singledout people is what we are yes sarah exclaimed the phrase fit much too well god had singled out the jews all those years ago and now the nazis were doing it instead didnt that mean the nazis had assumed the mantle of divinity if you asked them they would tell you yes along with the national socialists icons hung portraits of the local party leaders men nobody outside of munster would recognize they looked just as peevish as the nazi big shots who ordered much of europe around from berlin maybe they were less ambitious maybe only less lucky some of them seemed quite ready to start telling czechs and danes and dutchmen what to do down the hallway swept a strange apparition the bishop of munster in full ecclesiastical regalia a uniform far older and to sarahs eyes far more impressive than the quasimilitary garb that so delighted the nazis he stopped and asked one of the jews what are you poor unhappy people doing here the man explained even speaking politely to a jew could land someone in trouble but clemens august von galen was already in trouble with the authorities for having the nerve to complain about the way they tried to rein in the catholic church in germany if they wanted to toss him into a concentration camp they didnt need to blame him for being friendly to jews he rolled his eyes now at the answer he got this is a disgrace he said not bothering to lower his voice they arent content with harassing you every other way they can think of now they have to rob you of your names too no one was brave enough to reply to him after that nazi functionaries clumped up and down the corridor in their shiny jackboots anything a jew said would be noted and held against him disgraceful the bishop of munster said again robes swirling around him he strode away sarah was far from the only jew who stared admiringly after him you couldnt get in trouble for just looking she didnt think you could anyhow her father leaned close and whispered in her ear if a few hundred important people had spoken up like that when things were starting out none of this schweinerei would have happened none of it could have happened but they didnt sarah answered i know said samuel goldmanformer professor of ancient history and classics now a roadgang laborer no wonder he sounded bleak things were bleak for the jews of munster as they were for jews all over germany typewriters clattered up ahead as clerks made out the new identity cards in due course the goldmans reached the front of the line they duly surrendered their old cards the new blanks sarah saw had jew printed on them in much bigger letters than the old ones had used for all official purposes you are now moses samuel goldman their clerk said as he handed father his new card i understand father answered that was safe enough he didnt have to tell the clerk whether he agreed or approved but he couldnt very well fail to understand mother got hers next for all official purposes you are now sarah hanna goldman the clerk droned she also said i understand then it was sarahs turn the clerk started to type but hesitated he got up from behind the desk and went over to talk with an older man a couple of desks away sarah couldnt hear what they said her clerk shrugged and came back he typed again this time with assurance someone had told him what to do and he was doing it handing sarah her new card he intoned for all official purposes you are now sarah sarah goldman what thats silly she blurted that is what regulations require in your circumstances i have verified it with herr memminger my supervisor the clerk nodded toward the older man he sounded as confident as a catholic whod just consulted with bishop von galen on a subtle theological point its still silly sarah said if you feel strongly enough about the matter you may make a formal complaint to the office for jewish affairs in berlin the clerk said with no irony sarah could hear she gulped never mind she said quickly the last thingthe very last thingshe wanted was to draw the notice of the office for jewish affairs no matter how bad things were they could always get worse very well the clerk said goldmans is everything on your cards now correct at this time there is no fee for adjusting them if you find an error later and return to have it changed the law requires a tenreichsmark charge did the law require the same thing for aryans it might governments were greedy whenever they found the chance sarah checked the card except for being ridiculous it was accurate so were her parents they all got out of there as fast as they could sarah sarah when they were smaller her brother would have turned it into a mocking chant even the office for jewish affairs didnt know what had happened to saul sarah did but she would never ever tell pete mcgill was full of what a philosopher might have called existential despair pete was no philosopher he was a hardfaced raspyvoiced marine corporal one of the relatively small garrison charged with protecting the american consulate in shanghai back in the days when the marines like similar forces from the european powers protected their countrys interests against chinese mobs the arrangement had been reasonable enough the chinese didnt think so but the next time any of the powers worried about what the chinese thought would be the first things were different now though like peking where pete had served before coming closer to the coast to a city where evacuation by sea was possible shanghai lay under japanese occupation the japs had divisions worth of infantry near the two big cities the western powers companies of troops stayed on only because japan didnt feel like cleaning them out existing on japanese sufferance rubbed peteand the rest of the leathernecksthe wrong way but that was only an insult an accident of geopolitics it was plenty to piss pete off existential despair though no way in hell what drove him there was falling head over heels for a white russian taxi dancer named vera she was a blonde she was built she was in his admittedly biased opinion dropdead gorgeous she screwed like there was no tomorrow she was even smart and in spite of that last she gave every appearance of having fallen head over heels for pete it was the kind of romance officers went out of their way to warn you against blah blah blah till they were as blue in the face as a usmc dress uniform a lot of the time of course a guy fell for a girl simply because he was horny or a girl looked at a guy and saw a meal ticket a sugar daddy maybe even somebody who could get her to the states vera wasnt like thatpete was sure of it oh hed bought her presents but so what in china even a marine corporals miserable pay stretched as if rubberized and he had looked into what it would take for her to go back to america with him that was because he loved her and wanted to stay with her forever though not because shed pushed him into it he was as sure of that as he was of his own name by what the marine lieutenant with whom hed spoken told him he had two chances of getting vera across the pacific slim and none and that was what really left him floundering in the slough of despond being sloppy drunk sure didnt help he sat in a bar not far from the consulate one of a long procession of whiskeyandsodas in front of him the dive was called the globe and anchor as its name implied it catered to marines on the barstool next to him sat another leatherneck a bruiser named herman szulc he was a polack with a slavic spelling for his german name which was pronounced schultz pete poured out his tale of woe it wasnt as if szulc hadnt heard it before he had but whiskey and loneliness made pete talkand talk and talk and talk ill never get her back to new york city he mourned that being where he was born and raised and did such sketchy growing up as hed done before the corps got its hands on him never not if you play by the rules anyway sounds like szulc paid no more attention to the rules than he had to if he werent doing time in the marines he probably would be serving it in the state pen pete was much more inclined to stay on the upandup he had been anyhow till vera discombobulated all his warning circuits how do you get somebody from china to new york if you dont play straight he asked before herman could answer he drained his latest whiskeyandsoda and waved to the bartender for yet another refill coming right up chief the barman said in excellent english if he watered his drinks more as his customers got drunker well hey it was a tough old world and he had a family to support he also wanted to hear how to get from shanghai to new york cityor anywhere else in the usawithout losing sleep over all the tiresome formalities of immigration you gotta know who to pay off szulc explained hey this is china man now tell me something i didnt know pete said he supposed every country ran on cash and was lubed by the smooth slipperiness of greased palms chinamen were a lot more blatant about it than americans though if you didnt fork over here you could forget about anything you wanted but if you played ball the chinese way you rapidly discovered all things were possible yeah its china but you wont just be paying off chinks szulc said you gotta find out which immigration people will look the other way when a gal without the right paperwork gets on a ship your girlfriends white anyway if youd fallen for one of those slantyeyed broads youd be shit outa luck nobodyd put himself out on a limb for you then tell me about it mcgill said america wanted a square deal for chinamen in china but god forbid if any chinamenor slantyeyed broads as szulc put itor japs wanted to sully the us of a we sure didnt want any more of them there we didnt like the ones we already had that wasnt a problem with vera though she was white enough to satisfyhell to thrilla crossburner in a sheet so i caught a break for a change pete thought hot damn that makes one do you know who the right guys to pay off are he asked couple of em herman szulc answered smugly an english colonel who drinks too fuckin much and this little old wizenedup portugee who can maybe slide her out through macao you know what they say about that placeyou can sneak anybody and anything through there long as you know who to keep happy how much will it cost me pete said i aint rich or nothing you know like i am szulc said rolling his eyes he named a figure pete flinched the guy behind the bar who was listening avidly too didnt how many silver mex dollars did he have socked away that many and then some pete did more than flinch he said im not gonna rob a bank for you herman how much loot does your ladylove have szulc returned im not gonna take from her neither pete said if vera paid her own way to the states how long would she remember a marine who helped her make connections no matter how head over heels pete was he wasntquiteblind okay okay dont get your tits in a wringer herman said i wait a sec there were other ways in which pete wasnt blind too how much would it be if you didnt glom on to a big cut from the fee the other marine looked affronted look ace i aint in this for my health you dont want to keep me sweet you can goddamn well go find these other guys for yourself an english colonel an old skinny wrinkled portugueseassuming szulc wasnt lying about the details which wasnt what youd call a leadpipe cinch i didnt say dont take anything pete replied backtracking a little but you screw the guys you may have to go to war with will you trust em at your back shrewdly he added i bet im not the only one who wants to know shit like this i already figured a discount into what i told you szulc whined swell now figure another one i can go down to the waterfront too pete said herman szulc snorted you try it youll end up wearing cement overshoes youre a nice guy pete you know what the shanghai waterfront does with nice guys trust me you dont want to find out i can take care of myself pete believed it szulc by contrast giggled so did the bartender though right away he tried to pretend he hadnt his reaction did more to persuade pete he was talking nonsense than szulcs did and herman came downsome they drank and haggled haggled and drank the guy behind the bar soaked in every word theo hossbach gathered with the rest of the panzer crewmen in his company to hear the word come down from on high it came down through captain werner schellenberg the company co he read from a piece of paper that he must have got from regimental hq to ensure continued loyalty amidst the pressures of our ruthless war against bolshevism and international jewry we are going to introduce national socialist leadership officers into the command structure they will give the troops support in creating and maintaining a proper national socialist worldview and will see to it that all orders issued by the regular officer corps are in complete accord with national socialist doctrines and ways of thought this change in the command structure is to be implemented immediately he looked out at the men he led questions several hands shot into the air had theo been a man who asked out loud the questions that formed in his head his would have been one of them since he wasnt he kept his hand down so did adalbert stoss though his expression was eloquent captain schellenberg pointed to one of the men go ahead rudi sir how are these national socialist waddayacallems different from the ivans political commissars that would also have been the first question theo asked by the way the rest of the panzer crewmen nodded it was uppermost in their minds too everyone eyed the company commander what would he say what could he say ill tell you how theyre different boys theyre ours thats how schellenberg answered that was blunt enough and then some but it raised as many questions as it answeredprobably more what do we need em for rudi demanded which was certainly one of those questions are people in berlin saying weve gotta read mein kampf before we plan an ambush soldiering doesnt work that way there was an understatement theo had looked at mein kampf he admired hitler for making germany a respected nation once more looking at the fuhrer s book did nothing to increase his admiration it struck him as rubbishenergetic passionate sometimes clever rubbish but rubbish all the same schellenberg chose his words with obvious care we need men who are loyal to the state and loyal to the government if this is how we get them im for it dont forget we had generals trying to overthrow the government in the middle of a war how can we win when something like that happens maybe the government shouldnt have started the war in the first place theo thought but schellenberg had a point nothing good would happen to the reich if the government were toppled at a time like this the war effort would surely have gone straight down the wc then again nothing good would happen to germany if she lost the war hitler had started either other questions captain schellenberg asked what is it bruno sir are these leadership officersbruno spoke the name with obvious distastegoing to squeal on us if we say anything they dont happen to like you know how soldiers go on if we cant blow off steam every once in a while lifes hardly worth living several other men nodded theo and adi and hermann witt among them bruno had it right soldiers would call their superiors and their civilian leaders a pack of idiots sensible officers paid no attention to most of that kind of talk but what were the odds a national socialist leadership officer would turn out to be sensible long mighty long the clumsy title seemed made to draw fanatics people who know everything there was to know about nazi doctrine but not a goddamn thing about panzers or rations or anything else that really mattered theyre not here to be rats schellenberg said firmly honest to god theyre not the government wants the wehrmacht to follow its lead thats all so when we do have one of these fellows assigned to us give him a chance all right nobody said no not out loud nobody in theos crew complained where he could hear it were he a more outgoing sort he might well have complained himself but keeping his mouth shut was his natural style he wasnt at all sure about sergeant witts politics the panzer commander did his job he did it well he was smart and brave but if he hated hitler and everything the nazis stood for he had the sense not to shout it from the turret on the panzer ii by the same token if he pawed the ground and whinnied every time he heard the horst wessel lied he didnt advertise that either theo thought adi stoss had reason not to want a national socialist leadership officer anywhere within a hundred kilometers of him then again adi also had reason not to discuss his reasons with anybody else unless of course theo was all wet the radioman chuckled very softly to himself me all wet he thought impossible couldnt happen im much too shrewd to make dumb mistakes the leadership officer got to the company after a nasty skirmish with some soviet officer bruno went back to an aid station swathed in bandages scuttlebutt was he might not keep his arm neither of his crewmates was even that lucky the panzer men werent in the mood to welcome lieutenant horst ostrowski with open arms he didnt look like a wildeyed fanatic he wore an iron cross second class and a wound badgehe hadnt been commanding a desk in dresden or something before he got this assignment he talked about the need to beat the russians so central asia didnt grab a foothold in central europe everything he said seemed harmless enough all the same theo wished he were back at that desk in dresden or whatever his previous assignment had been again the radioman didnt think he was anywhere close to the only guy with the same wish back in the trenches in front of madrid chaim weinberg didnt know whether to laugh or to cry he did know he ought to be pissed off and he was he had a good notion of whod screwed him and he hadnt even got kissed that pissed him off too la martellita had a blowjob mouth if ever there was oneto look at anyway hed never got to feel it on john henry not against his lips either for that matter she couldnt stand him so shed put him back where he started only a handful of old sweats from the states were left in the abe lincolns spaniards filled out the ranks as they did in all the international brigades these days the surviving americans thought his return was the funniest thing that had happened lately watsamatter wit you boychik said another new yorker a jew who went by the name of izzy you had it soft in madrid howd you manage to screw it up this time chaim didnt like that this time not even slightly talent he said and tried to let it go at that no such luck izzy was a born agitator he was a new york jew in the abraham lincoln brigadeof course he was a born agitator what did you go and do he asked eyeing chaim shrewdly get somebody important mad at you cant get away with that boychik not even in the classless society you cant oh fuck off chaim answered izzy laughed like a loon chaim almost hauled off and belted him he would have if that hadnt been the same as admitting the other guy was right izzy wasnt the only veteran who thought he was the most comicaland the dumbestthing on two legs he couldnt fight all of them not if he wanted to live to do anything else he didnt know what all he wanted to do later on but one thing seemed glaringly obvious he wanted to get an apology from la martellita if he couldnt get an apology a blowjob would do just as well maybe better first he had to live long enough to collect one or the other even both if he got really lucky he hadnt got sent to the trenches just because la martellita put in a bad word somewhere he hoped like hell he hadnt anyhow the republic was trying to push the nationalists away from the capital whenever the republic tried something that took hard fighting in went the international brigades that had been true ever since the internationals got to spain and though spaniards filled out the brigades ranks these days it remained true even now the americans and englishmen and poles and germans and italians and hungarians and god knew what all else who remained gave the international brigades experience and esprit de corps no purely spanish outfit could match the foreign volunteers had and passed on experience the spaniards couldnt match too germans who hated adolf hitlers guts owned just as much professional expertise as the ones who fought in the legion kondor naturally marshal sanjurjos men understood all that as well as the republicans naturally the nationalists kept their own elite troops opposite the internationals positions naturally any advance against those fascist soldiers was a lot tougher than it would have been against the usual odds and sods who filled out the ranks on both sides you outflanked a bunch of odds and sods they either ran away or surrendered raw troops were as sensitive about their flanks as so many ticklish virgins you outflanked a bunch of men who knew what they were doing and really meant it and they hunkered down dug their foxholes deeper turned their machine gun your way if they had one and defied you to winkle them out doing it wasnt much fun chinga tu madre one of sanjurjos finest shouted back when a man from the abe lincolns yelled that he should give up a sharp burst of fire followed the obscenity this gang of nationalists did have a machine gun some of the bullets snapped by overhead much too close for comfort boy i wish i was takin hot dogs outa boilin water back at coney island izzy said yeah well nobody held a gun to your head and made you get on a boat chaim answered now that i think about it me neither que dices asked one of the spaniards who plumped out the abe lincolns chaim thought he went by paco but wasnt quite sure hed never set eyes on the guy till he came back to the trenches whats he say izzy asked hed been in spain as long as chaim he could cuss some in spanish but that was about it he said what did you say chaim answered he did some more explaining in both english and spanish then he added i wish we had a mortar handy thatd make those fuckers and their machine gun say uncle que dices paco asked again chaim repeated himself in the spaniards language then he had to explain the explanation to izzy paco spoke excitedly but we do have one he hurried away staying lowhe was learning wheres he going izzy said is he running off the little son of a no no chaim broke in he said we do have a mortar since when i dunno izzy shrugged i dont remember if the french communist party sent it to us or we captured it off the nationalists if the communist party of the united states stashed a mortar and some bombs at its headquarters in new york city j edgar hoover and his gmen would land on it in hobnailed boots close it down and send the leading american reds to jail for about a million years things were different in europe political parties of the left and the right took themselves a lot more seriously over here chaim who also took politics seriously if he didnt what was he doing in spain leaned that way himself paco not only knew the abe lincolns had a stovepipe he knew where the critter was hiding maybe ten minutes later mortar rounds started stalking the nationalist diehards the first one landed so far short it was scarier than the enemy machine gun but succeeding bombs walked toward and then came down on the battered foxholes sanjurjos men were holding all the same the machine gun opened up when the abe lincolns moved forward the mortar crew must have been watching perhaps through field glasses more bombs landed on the nationalists now the nasty little piece of field artillery had the range the new shells didnt scare the piss out of the guys they were supposed to help come on chaim scrambled out of his own trench and ran toward the enemy line follow me the rest of the men in the assault party did follow him he would have ended up slightly dead or sad to say more than slightly if they hadnt the mortar hadnt put all the nationalists out of action bombardments never did however much you wished they would a couple of men popped up with rifles shots from the oncoming abe lincolns made them fire wildly though and when one of sanjurjos finest tried to point the machine gun at the charging republicans chaim shot him in the face he fell back with a wild despairing scream it had to be the bestor the luckiestshot from the hip chaim had ever made viva la republica chaim yelled as he jumped after the wouldbe machine gunner chinga la republica a stubborn nationalist shouted back raising a lebela french rifle that had been outdated at the start of the last warto his shoulder chaim shot him too the oldfashioned rifle fell from his hands it went off when it hit the ground but the bullet buried itself in the dirt other abe lincolns were cleaning out the rest of the men whod held them up a couple of nationalists did try to surrender then the abe lincolns disposed of them in a hurry the new spaniards who filled out the force were quicker to shoot than the remaining americans this wasnt about fighting fascism to them this was about getting rid of people whod probably done horrible things to their loved ones chaim didnt know why they called a war inside one country a civil war it was anything but none of the americans said anything about the shootings to their spanish comrades it wasnt as if sanjurjos men didnt do the same thing the machine gun also turned out to be surplus from the last war a watercooled german maxim once in position it was as good as any more modern weapon getting it there however was less than half the fun it was more portable than an anvil but only slightly and the mount from which it fired was massive enough to let somebody preach a sermon on it chaim said as much to izzy and got the groan he deserved when he tried to translate the joke for one of the spaniards he discovered it worked in his language but not in theirs there were other things to worry about going on with the advance for instance he hadnt had any particular rank when this attack started he still didnt come to that but both americans and spaniards seemed to expect him to tell them what to do next hed given an order before it had worked not so surprising then that they expected more of the same he wanted to be a de facto officer the way he wanted a second head his new order consisted of well lets go goddammit they went they drove everything before them the nationalists fled all the way to valladolid eighty miles west of madrid marshal sanjurjo was so dismayed he hopped in a plane and flew back to portugal the fascist cause in spain collapsed in rome mussolini ground his teeth in fury in berlin so did hitler because of chaims brilliant command the progressive powers won the war well no it wasnt like that easier to dream of la martellita going down on him than to look for so much from one grudged order but the abe lincolns did capture that machine gun and go on to gain several hundred more meters of ground somebody must have put in a good word for chaim because a republican major general who wore overalls like a factory workerand like la martellita though he didnt fill them out so well came up to the new front line shook his hand and kissed him on both cheeks the major general had been eating garlic you did some political indoctrination in the city si he asked chaim admitted it why did you leave that post the officer inquired chaim only shrugged taking that for modesty the general said would you like to go back chaim nodded hoping he didnt seem too eager la martellita would be furious awwwasnt that too bad he airport outside stockholm a tall blond swedish foreignministry official stamping her passport i dont believe this peggy druce said dazedly it cant be true if you like madame i will pinch you the official spoke almost perfect english if he had a slight singsong scandinavian accent so did plenty of people from minneapolis but but only a few days before peggy had been thinking about warsaw as a stepping stone to hungary and eventually to romania or greece even though one of their staff members had suggested it everybody at the american embassy was sure she was nuts for wanting to try it that didnt mean the people there werent helping her maybe they didnt care if she got blown up maybe they were glad to send her on her way even if the odds of that were pretty good she didnt endear herself to everyone not if people stood in the way of what she wanted more than a few nazis would have agreed with the embassy personnel about that now though a big beautiful swissair dc sat on the runway outside the terminal it was going to fly from stockholm to london and she had a seat on it the foreignministry officials gaze clouded ever so slightly now that denmark and southern norway are no longer considered a war zone air traffic by neutrals has resumed the man said no expression in his voice or on his face now that the germans have sat on the danes and norwegians and driven the english and french way the hell up into the frozen north that was what he meant how did he feel about it swedes norwegians and danes might as well have been brothers this fellow probably wasnt happy about being the only brother left free and independent then again sweden did a lot of business with germany quite a few swedes admired hitlerone of peggys more alarming discoveries in what otherwise seemed a civilized country so she didnt ask the official what he thought of the foreign situation he could think whatever he damn well pleased she was getting out of here wasnt she he handed back her passport nervously she asked is there anything else no madame may you have a safe and pleasant journey he opened the door that led out from the terminal freezing air rushed in would winter never give up he continued you are still very early but you may board the airplane if you wish yippee peggy said and charged toward the americanbuilt airliner there was an expression the fluent diplomat likely hadnt heard before or did they show cowboy movies here the mere idea was plenty to set peggy giggling speaking of accents she could barely follow the swiss stewards german when he asked for her ticket and passport seeing that he was talking to an american though he switched to pretty good english yes everything seems to be in order you may be seated we will take off in about an hour you bet ill be seated charlie peggy said the steward blinked she didnt care the dc had two seats on one side of the aisle and one on the other peggy discovered hers was on the single side she didnt care more passengers boarded speaking several different languages she recognized english swedish french and the swiss dialect of german and two young oriental men took the pair of seats across from her and jabbered at each other japanese chinese something else altogether there she had no idea when the steward tried german on them they answered readily enough the steward closed the door and dogged it tight the twin engines rumbled to life the dcs cabin was soundproofed but they were noisy even so they got noisier too as the airliner sped down the runway and took off clunking noises from under the fuselage were the landing gear retracting the wheels didnt stay down through the whole flight a dc was modern flying through clouds was bumpy it also made looking out the window a waste of time she had a copy of gone with the wind a secretary at the embassy had given her shed read it back in the states of course but it was fine for a flightnice and thick theyd made a movie of it while she was stuck in europe that she wanted to see would anybody still be running it by the time she got home bump bump bump she was glad she wasnt afraid of flying she was also glad she had a strong stomach if you got seasick you could also get airsick especially when the plane bounced all over the sky like this somebody noisily lost whatever hed eaten before takeoff he must have used the bag because the stink wasnt bad food on the plane proved as good as what peggyd had on dining cars in trains drinks flowed freely if you needed not to think about flying or about the war they would lubricate your brain and then out of nowhere the lean shark shape of a messerschmitt fighter all but filled peggys window mon dieu a french speaker said merde alors another added the could have hacked the airliner out of the sky with the greatest of ease instead the fighter pilot waved waggled his wings and zoomed away this is the captain speaking a voice came out of the dcs intercom first in german then in french and finally in english the plane was confirming that we are who we claim to be we may i am told expect the same reception as we near great britain sure enough a hurricane came out and looked them over it seemed less deadly than the messerschmitt though by all accounts it was a match for the german fighterone of the few planes that were as the s pilot had before the englishman in the cockpit waved when he was satisfied and flew off that snowdappled brown and green aheadthat was england tears filled peggys eyes shed made it well almost she still had to cross the atlantic without getting torpedoed if you were going to worry about every little thing more clunks from below said the wheels were going down again the plane descended toward london peggy looked for bomb craters the nazis had boasted about blasting the british capital back to the stone age one more lie from goebbels because she saw little damage and then she was down the dc came in with hardly a bounce she felt like yelling yippee again but she didnt no point to making all the other people on the plane sure she was a lunatic if she was she could claim she was out of her mind with joy at lastat sweet lastshed got to a place from which she could go straight to the states she didnt care if she booked the fastest liner or some wallowing scow shed still get there barring uboats of course the nazis still claimed england had sunk the athenia to enrage america and drag her into the war maybe they believed that in germany peggy didnt think it was good for anything but making flowers grow but the odds were still with her most ships traveling between england and the usa got where they were going she really did figure hers would too she had every intention of taking the chance stuffing gone with the wind into her purse she stood up and headed back toward the door at the left rear of the cabin down a few steps after that and then her own personal feet touched english soil that too seemed just about good enough for a yippee again though she refrained herb would have admired her restraint herb my god shed have to get used to having a husband around again and she was going to have to keep her big mouth shut forever about a drunken night in berlin shed guessed constantine jenkins was a fairy wrong so wrong after she got her suitcase she had to clear customs the inspector frowned at all the stamps that bore the german eagle and swastika youve had a busy time of it what he said buddy you dont know the half of it peggy exclaimed something in her voice brought a thin smile out on his facethe only kind he had she suspected i daresay i ought to give you to the matrons for a strip search and slit the lining of your bag here he remarked i ought to but i shant he plied his rubber stamp with might and main welcome to the united kingdom mrs druce welcome to freedom freedom peggy echoed dreamily i remember thati think the customs inspector laughed for all the world as if she were joking now that alistair walsh had got to know him dr murdoch turned out to be a good source of information theyre going to extract us he told walsh one freezing nightas if namsos came equipped with any other kind sounds like dentistry eh walshs shiver had nothing to do with the weather he rememberedpainfully rememberedwisdom teeth with which hed parted company army dentists had never heard of the geneva convention turn them loose on the fritzes and theyd likely win the war in a fortnight have you got another fag on you the staff sergeant asked that was the other thing murdoch was good for the man was a tobacco magnet in a place like this where everything was always in short supply that made him someone to reckon with sure enough he handed walsh a packet walsh took onewhat hed asked forand gave it back he didnt want the sawbones to think he was greedy after a long reverent drag he asked extracted how ships murdoch answered get in under cover of darkness be well away by the time the germans realize weve flown the coop thats the plan at any rateso they tell me what they told him was usually the straight goods what happens next walsh wondered out loud he answered his own question the luftwaffe starts looking for our bloody ships thats what i dont suppose weve got air cover laid on he answered himself again too much to hope for too far off for fighters to reach i havent heard anything about air cover beverly murdoch admitted when they find us then were sitting ducks walsh said would you sooner be taken prisoner nooo walsh said slowly id also sooner not drown though if its all the same to you and id sooner not be blown to smithereens what the deuce are you doing in the army then that was another good question no doubt about it walsh gave a rueful shrug i was in in didnt seem to be much work on the civilian side when the last war ended so i stayed in they wont turn loose of me now till i do get blown up or till im too old to soldier any more the more fool you murdoch said and walsh was in a poor position to tell him he was wrong thanks to the doctors warning he had a couple of extra days to ready his men for the planned withdrawal to the harbor everything had to seem as normal as possible so the germans wouldnt pursue with all their strength that would be what the withdrawal needed wouldnt it machine guns and maybe tanks banging away as tommies and poilus and norwegians tried to board ship walsh had been thinking what juicy targets theyd make on the water theyd be even juicier if they got caught like that and a few menvolunteers all and mostly norwegians would stay behind to man allied machine guns and try to create the impression that everybody was still in the lines walsh admired them without wanting to be one of their number he aimed to go on fighting the war till the enemy was licked mooching around behind barbed wire eating slop and hoping for red cross packages held no appeal the norwegians had a chance of getting away and blending in with the scenery he didnt on the appointed night he made his way back toward the docks engineers often put up white tapes to guide men and machines in the darkness without showing a light here theyd used black ones to stand out against the snow it was a nice touch he wondered where theyd got them high above the clouds airplane engines thuttered bombs started raining down far behind the german lines that was another nice touch fighters couldnt make it here from blighty but bombers could and if the raf pounded the fritzes it would make them think the expeditionary force was staying not going walsh hoped like blazes it would anyhow through the shattered wreckage of namsos town a womans voice called out good luck friends bonne chance amis the locals still appreciated what the soldiers from abroad had been doing that counted for something this way step lively this way the authoritative voice could only belong to an mp sure enough the fellow guided traffic with disks on sticks that reminded walsh of the ones tank crews without radios used to communicate he shambled up a gangplank only when he was up on deck did he realize hed boarded another destroyer it could get in and out faster than a merchantman it couldnt carry nearly so many men though or could it if they packed people on like sardines going into a tin maybe it could they didnt even have olive oil to grease the works they did have swearing petty officers keep clear lanes god damn you one of that unpleasant breed shouted if the sailors cant get to the guns whatre your bloody necks worth that was an interesting question but the fellows loading the destroyer and the ones trying to keep the ship battleworthy worked at cross purposes walsh sympathized with both groups everyone was trying to do his own job as well as he could if everyone succeeded they might get away yet stranger things had happened walsh supposed they must have someone whose watch had survived said they left port at half past two theyd have several hours of darkness to get well out to sea nights were still long though beginning to shorten theyd be a small needle in a big haystack it could work it really could walsh kept telling himself as much right up to the point where he fell asleep he was mostly standing up with his head and arms resting against something metallic even through his greatcoat sleeves he could feel the cold he didnt care he thought he could have slept upside down someone trod on his toe someone else planted an elbow in his ribs each indignity half roused him but no more even this was better than life in the trenches and if that wasnt a judgment on the war hed been fighting he snored on he came back to himself with the sky beginning to go gray in the east some good samaritan was shoving his way through the tightpacked soldiers with an enormous pot of tea in each fist walsh still had his mess kit he held out the tin cup and was rewarded with a weak lukewarm brew with no milk and not enough sugar it tasted wonderful as day came on the soldiers looked apprehensively back toward the corrugated coastline from which theyd just fled the destroyer was going flat out kicking up an enormous bow wave but one of the mournful lessons of this war was that ships couldnt outrun airplanes lots of ocean only us here walsh thought the other ships taking the expeditionary force back from namsos had scattered the nazis would have to find them one by one walsh thought that made for good tactics he wished to god he were more certain sailors looked back toward norway too some of them had field glasses one who did shouted out a warning walsh wondered why he bothered the antiaircraft guns were already manned the escaping soldiers couldnt go anywhere because their mates already filled the places where they might have gone walshs mouth went dry when he recognized the sharkish fuselage with the inverted gull wings a stuka we would get a bloody stuka he thought bitterly hed seen what they could do he didnt want them trying to do it to him again only the one bugger dr murdoch said beside him that was something the germans must have scattered their planes across the ocean searching for ships of course the sods up there would have a wireless set the stuka climbed then dove walsh watched in fearful fascinationwhat else could he do all the antiaircraft guns on the destroyer went off at once with a noise like the end of the world the pilot took his plane down through the shell bursts as if they werent there fritz or not he had balls the bomb fell free the divebomber pulled up almost as sharply as it had plunged blam the bomb burstabout fifty yards astern of the destroyer the ship jerked as if shed taken a left to the belly but kept steaming here and there men pepperedor men ripped to shredsby fragments shrieked i didnt see any more bombs under his wings perhaps they sacrificed payload for range murdoch said walsh hadnt noticed the stuka didnt seem to be coming back for another pass it droned east toward norway instead we may live to see blighty again walsh said a moment before he wouldnt have given tuppence for his chances hopeand exhaustionmade for a happier drunk than even champagne he threw back his head and laughed anastas mouradian had got used to the way russians did things in europe got resigned to the way they did things might have put it better you had to get used to it get resigned to it or youd go mad there were far more russians than any other group in the ussr especially when you added in the ukrainians and byelorussians who werent very different from great russians great russians insisted they were only variations on a theme ukrainians and byelorussians disagreed but usually just among themselves used to russian ways or not stas didnt think it was an accident that so many armenians and georgians and jews had risen so high in the soviet hierarchy russians were stubborn they were brave they followed orders even better than germans from all hed seen though few of them would ever set the world on fire with their brains now here he was in eastern siberia it was like finding himself in a satiric movie all the most russian traits that annoyed him in europe were exaggerated here everything was slipshod even in europe aircraft maintenance hadnt been what he wished it would be the russian attitude was oh what the hellitll probably fly most of the time it did but not all the planes that didnt come back ran into german fighters some never should have tried to get off the ground to begin with if it was bad in europe it was worse out here spare parts were in chronically short supplyno surprise not with the factories thousands of kilometers away most of the best mechanics were thousands of kilometers away too facing the germans and poles the ones stuck in siberia did what they could with what they had when they were sober anyhow they werent sober often enough to suit mouradian if you werent a russian you almost always thought russians drank like fish stas had grown up with wine hed learned to handle vodka if you were going to deal with russians that was selfdefense when russian officers to say nothing of russian enlisted men werent up to anything else theyd drink often till they fell over hed seen as much in europe drunkenness was worse here too for one thing drunks were liable to get posted to siberia so they wouldnt cause difficulties anywhere that mattered for another there was even less to do in siberia than in european russia that was doubly true through the long dark cold winters the more you stayed drunk the less you brooded on how boring everything else was and as stas had heard from more russians than he cared to remember alcohol was antifreeze hed heard it so often hed said it himself that didnt keep plenty of russian drunks from freezing to death drunks of course also didnt make the best mechanics the first glimpse mouradian got of the sbs that flew against the japanese besieging vladivostok made him blurt this must be your junkyard captain boris novikov looked pained no no no these are the runners youll get one of them you want to see the junkyard come with me he exhaled fog and vodka fumes he wasnt immune to the russian national voice he didnt wobble as he walked though like a lot of his countrymen he could hold his liquor was that national virtue or vice mouradian had pondered the question for a long time nothing he could do about it now he followed novikov down a path that had probably started as a deer track it wound through snowdraped pines that looked as if they belonged in a christmas sceneonly christmastime was months gone stas was glad he had a good pair of valenki the felt boots would keep his feet from freezing even in weather like this he hoped dont worry novikov said brightly we havent seen a tiger in weeks im so glad mouradian answered he was unarmed novikov had a pistol whether he could draw it if he did see a tiger and whether it would do any good if he could were questions the armenian preferred not to contemplate his response made novikov laugh stas wasnt sure why theyd come more than half a kilometer if a tiger did bound out and charge them no one would hear them shriek the beast could enjoy a leisurely luncheon suddenly the path opened out into a clearing captain novikov waved a mittened hand now this mouradian this is the fucking junkyard and it was too wrecked planes bits and pieces of wrecked planes stas saw sbs monoplane and biplane polikarpov fighters and other aircraft he had trouble naming some of the junk was new some was ancient and rusty some if that wasnt a french fighter left over from the last war mouradian didnt know what it would be when we need parts we just come out here and take them novikov said its a hell of a lot faster than ordering them from some bigger base thatll probably just go and pull them out of its junkyard if it bothers answering us at all but stas tried to put his objections into words quality wont be very high will it its a part novikov said patiently the fucking airplane will fly better with it than without it right thats the idea yes mouradian answered which wasnt exactly agreement if novikov noticed he gave no sign well there you are then yes comrade captain here i am that wasnt exactly agreement either they went back to the main base groundcrew men were bombing up the sbs mouradian had taken for junk he met his new copilot and bombaimer second lieutenant nikolai chernenko was new all righthe couldnt have been more than nineteen they shook hands im sure youll teach me a lot comrade pilot heres to us chernenko pulled out a flask he talked with a ukrainian accent mouradian found hard to follow to us mouradian sipped vodka handing back the flask he said lets not drink too much before we go what else is there to do chernenko asked honest curiosity in his voice stas had no good answer for him the fellow who actually dropped the bombsand who fired the machine gun in the sbs dorsal turretwas a sergeant named innokenty suslov he reminded stas of ivan kuchkov he was foulmouthed and burly he wasnt so ugly and hairy as the chimp but those were just details when the engines started up they sounded better than stas expected maybe novikov ran a tighter ship than mouradian thought or maybe it was fool luck he had his opinion which might or might not be worth anything up into the air the sb went the formation the bombers flew was ragged but most russian formations were keeping right in place for the sake of keeping right in place was a german affectation so the red air force felt anyhow flying over siberias vast forests showed the sweep of russia almost as well as getting here on the transsiberian railway if not for the compass mouradian would have had no idea of his bearing everything down below looked the same in all directions but only one direction included japanese fighter planes the flight leader shouted a warning that dinned in stas earphones then he saw the fighters himself monoplanes with fixed landing gear and wide wings they were almost ridiculously maneuverable but they were supposed to be just as lightly built and for once intelligence knew what it was talking about pursuing another bomber a japanese fighter flew right in front of stas plane he hardly had to aim before firing the forward machine guns pieces flew from the japanese fighter it seemed to break up in midair then plummeted in flames toward the snowcovered trees far far below good shot chernenko whooped and it was mouradian had just killed a man hed worry about it later for now for now he would try to kill as many more men as he could with the sbs bombs that was different he didnt have to watch them or maybe it just felt different the sb felt different after the bombs fell from it lighter friskier eager to get away stas was also eager to get away he gunned the bomber back toward the base hacked from the siberian wilderness it wasnt muchhed already seen that but going back to it beat the devil out of meeting the ground with a terrible final thump like that poor goddamn japanese fighter pilot shopping time for jews in germany was late afternoon after the aryans had got everything worth getting with the war a year and a half old sarah goldman found she minded that less than she had before the shooting started shed felt really deprived then nowadays there was so little for everyone that even leavings werent much worse than top of the line when you had to make do with old turnips and wilted cabbage and potatoes with black spots while other people ate veal and mutton you felt it when everybody stewed up turnips and cabbage and potatoes so what if yours werent quite so fine to start with as those of the germans across the street sarah missed fresh milk but so did the rest of the reich the only people who got any were small children and pregnant women one phrase seemed to be on everyones lips to hell with the russians as soon as the fight in the east started things on the home front got worse it was as if the government had shaken itself and at last realized the war wouldnt be quickly won and if it wouldnt everything had to stretch as far as it would go people the age of sarahs parents didnt just curse the russians they also said it was like this the last time too sarah had heard about the terrible turnip winter of as long as shed been alive now she heard the one finally passing mentioned in the same breath as proof the winter was finally passing rain poured down from a dirtywool sky in place of snow sarahs umbrella leaked she had no rubber overshoes no one did not any more the state had collected them to reuse for the precious war effort if she didnt come home with pneumonia it wouldnt be for lack of effort if she didnt come home with bread pneumonia might not matter she and her parents were liable to starve before disease could carry them off that thought wasnt the only one to make her smile as she walked into the bruck bakery isidor bruck the bakers son was her boyfriend for a professors daughter that kind of boyfriend was a long step downor would have been before things went sour for german jews now no one sneered if you found little bits of happiness wherever you could and having someone in isidors line of work had advantages it wouldnt have before rationing began to bite the first time he gave sarah an unofficial extra loaf she felt guilty about taking it but her stomach and the thought of her parents stomachs had a logic of their own take the bread she did and she never said a word afterwards except thank you too bad isidor couldnt get away with it more often the nazis closely monitored the flour the jewish bakers used when sarah walked in this afternoon she was disappointed not to see isidor behind the counter his father stood there instead david bruck wasnt so plump as he had been before times got hard he didnt look so happy as he had back in what sarah increasingly thought of as the good old days either he did manage a smile of sorts for her how are you today he asked im fine sarah asked the question that could have so many horrible answers but hows isidor david bruck didnt take offense at not being asked how he was himself sarah realized she should have done that the way people usually realize such things just too late the baker waved her words aside when she started to stammer out the polite question isidors fine he answered but theyve got him on a labor gangrepairing bomb damage oh like my father sarah said david bruck nodded she went on i thought they werent supposed to take people who make food supposed to supposed to theyre not bruck said when they come in here with papers and with guns though are we going to tell them no if theyd said i had to go out there too i would have gone he wouldnt have been much use at shifting rubble that wouldnt have stopped the nazis they laughed when they put jews to work at things that were far from their proper trades tell him i was here will you tell him tell him im thinking about him sarah said ill do that isidors father promised he cocked his head to one side and did you come in for bread too or did you walk all that way in the rain just to tell me youre thinking about isidor bread might be nice sarah wasnt about to show him he could embarrass her when you did that with a grownup you lost the game right there and hed spend the next six weeks doing everything he could to make you turn red again the baker raised a bushy eyebrow well all right you have something to carry it in so it wont turn to mush by the time you get home i sure do sarah reached into her handbag and took out a muchfolded permanently creased piece of dusty fieldgray canvas david bruck laughed out loud a shelter half i had one of those in the trenches too so your old man kept his did he yeah thatll do the job all right its waterproofmore or less mother found it at the back of the closet sarah answered she said the same thingand that she wished she could wash it cooties are bound to be dead by now eggs too id think sarah started to squeal in disgust she caught herself in the nick of timethat was just what the baker was waiting for unfolding the oddly shaped piece of materialtwo of them fastened together would make a small tentshe said put the bread in here please ill do that he said and he did it was war bread black as coffee but it wouldnt taste too bad the older generation did agree it was better than what theyd endured in the last war for the time being anyhow this was only the second winter of the fight not the fourth bruck went on now i need your ration book nothings official till it gets put down there oh yes i know sarah handed it to him he did what he had to do when she got it back she saw he hadnt deducted nearly enough points for the amount of bread hed given her wait this isnt she began you hush he told her some things may not be official but they happen anyway his son did things like that for her but his son had motives he didntor sarah hoped he didnt the way things were she wouldnt say no she told him what shed told isidor thank you very much youre welcome and keep your eyes open im not kidding a lot of the time going around the rules does you more good than going through them her brother was in the wehrmacht that broke every rule the reich had sarah still didnt know how saul had managed it had he killed someone for his papers that struck her as most likely he was already on the run for smashing a labor gang bosss head after the bastard beat him sarah said not a word about that it was her secret hers and her mothers and fathers telling anybody else anybody at all put saul in desperate danger come to that it put all the goldmans in that same danger if the gestapo found out what her big brother was doing everyone would pay a price for it the blackshirts would think all the goldmans had known about it ever since he got away and they wouldnt be so far wrong either so many things they didnt need to learn so many things nobody needed to learn sarah hadnt said anything about saul to isidor she didnt say anything about him now or even hint that she knew more about evading the rules than she let on all she did was look as wideeyed and innocent as she could and say ill have to remember that as if it had never occurred to her before see that you do david bruck said you might turn up some galoshes that way or at least shoe leather so your feet dont soak ill be all right sarah said it hadnt stopped raining while she got the bread with the leaky umbrella her feet wouldnt be the only wet parts of her as she left the bakery she raised it anyhow it wasa littlebetter than nothing ost german officers and enlisted men stationed in poland went into the towns there to drink and to get their ashes hauled so far hansulrich rudel had resisted temptation he didnt drink anything they sold in a polish tavern women going to an officers brothel was always a way to let off steam as it had been in the low countries and france up till now hed stayed away here its not bad another pilot from his squadron told him yeah you feel like youre back around but its not bad a lot of poles speak german when you cant find one who does theres always some jew wholl translate for you yiddish sounds awful but the hebes follow regular deutsch too millions of them here hansulrich exclaimed i mean millions how can we put them in their place inside the reich and ally with them here by the way he said it he might have been talking about a sexual perversion fair enough that was how he felt about it his comrade a captain named ernst lau was a couple of years older and far more worldlywise how diplomacy thats how every ivan a polish jew kills is one we dont have to worry about ourselves and every jew a russian shoots well theres a bullet that doesnt hit one of us but its crazy rudel said how can we trust them with so many jews in moscow running things for the russians heres how listen now lau said if somebody invades you hes the enemy doesnt matter if hes got the same religion hes still the enemy cause hes trying to kill your wife and take your house away from you anybody who helps you throw him out is the good guy in the movie thats the way it looks to me anyhow it didnt look that way to hansulrich he would have bet it didnt look that way to the fuhrer either he also would have bet hitler had hardly more use for poles than for jews the way things were these days for captain lau to say anything else could be seen as disloyalty to the reich rudel had no trouble seeing it that waynone at all he was sure the ss and the sd wouldnt either then again lau was a brave flyer hansulrich had seen as much and would have been convinced of it even without the iron cross first class on the other pilots left breast pocket reporting him would cost germany a man who could do the russiansor any other enemy of the reich a lot of harm more than a few men fought bravely for the vaterland while disliking the national socialists who led the country the paradox perplexed hansulrich but hed seen it before which came first the countrys needs or the partys most of the time rudel would have said they were one and the same most of the time but not always not here for instance he wouldnt report ernst lau back in france before this fight with the russians heated up he might have but germany was plainly going to need every man she could get her hands on after the ivans learned their lesson that would be the time for lau to learn his rudel had thought they would fly more as the weather began to warm up at last instead they found themselves stuck on the groundliterally polands unpaved airstrips smoothedover lines in fields basically turned into swamps as the snow that had lain on them for months melted and soaked in the same thing happened in france but it wasnt so bad there and there were more strips with concrete runways to help the combatants get around it hansulrich gathered this was bad even by polish standards which was saying somethingsomething unpleasant panzers stuck in the mud too germany had perfected the art of striking like lightning it overwhelmed czechoslovakia it drove the low countries into quick surrender it almostwhat a painful wordextinguished france it did take the channel ports and partly sever frances lifeline to england a better showing than the kaisers army made a generation earlier and here in poland facing the russians it stopped with a wet squelch when tracked vehicles got stuck when horses and infantrymen went into muck up to their bellies neither side could move fast as often as not neither side could move at all no wonder the pilots and groundcrew men who drank drank a lot then and no wonder the handful who didnt like hansulrich looked for something anything else to do he finally decided to go into bialystok with lau and some of the other officers even looking around seemed appealing he didnt have to carouse he didnt intend to either even if they tried to inveigle him into it odds were they would too it wasnt as if he hadnt seen that before they rode into town in a wagon driven by a polish farmer it had a boatlike body and big wheels and handled the slop better than anything the germans had brought with them we ought to make these ourselves lau remarked if the muds this bad here itll only be worse when we get into russia how could it be worse hansulrich asked i dont know lau answered but ill tell you something else tooi dont want to find out when hansulrich looked at it from that perspective he decided he didnt want to either bialystok was as bad as hed thought it would be or else worse it was a polish provincial town it was a polish provincial town that had been part of the russian empire before poland revived like the mummy in the american movie which meant it had always been cut off from german kultur even the diluted version that seeped into austrian poland and it was a polish provincial town packed full of jews long black coats some trimmed with fox fur broadbrimmed black hats sidelocks bushy beards women in wigs and scarves and dresses that swept the sidewalkswhen there were sidewalks gabble in polish which hansulrich didnt understand and in yiddish which he didnt want to understand he felt as if two hundred years had fallen off the calendar some of the shops had signs in yiddish the strange characters might as well have been chinese for all the sense they made to him the jews eyed the jackbooted germans in luftwaffe grayblue as warily as the germans looked at them it wasnt only past confronting present past confronting future hansulrich thought the jews knew what the national socialist government of germany thought of them even a polish provincial town had its newspaper yes edited by a jew and its radio sets the jews knew all right but stalins greed had put poland and germany on the same side and so no matter what they might be thinking some of the jews in their long coats nodded to the luftwaffe officers along with his comrades hansulrich found himself nodding back a big blond polehe looked like a big blond bearran the tavern the germans picked rudel couldnt tell what the barmaid who came over to their table was she was prettyhe could tell that she understood german well enough too mineral water he told her when she glanced his way she nodded with what just mineral water please she raised an eyebrow he nodded back at her to show he meant it helpfully ernst lau explained he gets his long trousers pretty soon sweetheart but he doesnt have em yet she raised that eyebrow again what color were her eyes not quite brown not quite green hazel wasnt exactly right either but it came closer than any other word hansulrich could find he can drink what he wants she said her voice cool did yiddish flavor her german or only polish once more hansulrich had trouble being sure on thirty seconds acquaintance he got the feeling hed always have trouble being sure about her when she brought back the mineral water she took the top off the bottle where he could watch her do it the barman hadnt spiked it she was saying without words thanks he told her both for the bottle and for the courtesy then he asked whats your name the worst thing she could do was walk away without answering for a second he thought shed do just that but after the momentary hesitation she said sofia sofia what how did you know she said and did walk off what was he supposed to do with that try to find out more he told himself wondering if he could hed found one thing anyhow a fresh good reason to come back to bialystok he wouldnt have bet on that when he climbed into the wagon moscow speaking the radio declared sergei yaroslavsky didnt think he was likely to be listening to any other station for one thing he recognized the announcers voice for another this was a soviet radio set and picked up only the frequencies of which the government approved the samovar in the corner of the red air force officers wardroom bubbled softly to itself more officers drank vodka than tea though sergei hadnt known poland shared the rasputitsa the mud timewith russia but the squadrons sbs werent going anywhere for a while neither was anything else for a few hundred kilometers in any direction you chose happy day somebody said whats gone wrong since this morning in a differentperhaps not such a very differenttone of voice a question like that might have earned the bigmouth who came out with it a trip to the gulag it also might have done that if the pilots and copilots hadnt started drinking you made allowances for somebody who got plastered especially when you were on the way to getting plastered yourself valiant red army forces continue to press attacks against the subhuman fascist german beasts and their polish stooges considerable territory has been gained the newsreader declared if youd never heard of the rasputitsa you might believe that or if the considerable territory was to be considered in meters and not kilometers it might even prove technically true the war in poland had really and truly bogged down but when they gave the fellow on the radio the lying copy what was he supposed to do tell the truth instead assuming he knew what it was theyd shoot him theyd do horrible things to him first and worse things to his loved ones no doubt where he could listen to them scream he went along the same way everybody else did a committee of polish national liberation was announced today in pinsk the man with the smooth voice continued its role will expand as the workers and peasants of the peaceloving soviet union free their polish brethren from the oppression they have suffered at the hands of the smiglyridz cabal smiglyridz was turning out to be hitlers puppet though odds were he would deny that if anyone called him on it and the poles on the committee of national liberation were stalins puppets sergei wondered if he would have seen things so clearly without the vodka sparkling through him yet another japanese attack on the outworks of vladivostok was repelled with loss yesterday the newsreader said red air force bombers punished the aggressors sergei raised his tumbler heres to stas he said the other flyers drank with him in daring strikes soviet bombers also brought the fighting home to tsitsihar and harbin the man continued the japanese lackeys of the socalled state of manchukuo had the gall to protest but general secretary stalin and foreign commissar litvinov rejected their foolish babbling out of hand good for stalin growled colonel borisov the squadron commander the vodka made his nose red as a strawberry it also made him sound even more sure of himself than he would have otherwise heads bobbed up and down all along the table sergeis among them he wasnt currying favorhe thought borisov was right socalled state of manchukuo was right the manchukuans were just as much puppets of the japanese as those poles in pinsk were of stalin what went around came around sure enough in western europe france and england both claim gains against the nazi hyenas the announcer said german radio denies the claims dr goebbels of course is the prince of liars but the degenerate capitalists of western europe are not far behind be it noted that neither france nor england has properly suppressed its native fascist movement significant factions within both countries favor abandoning the fight against the hitlerites and banding together with them for a crusade against the stronghold of the proletariat on the march bring on the french swine bring on the englishmen too we beat them after the last capitalist war and well smash em again see if we dont yes borisov had taken a lot of vodka on board vladimir federov politely called him on it but comrade colonel imagine the nazis with no enemy in their rear if they throw everything they have at us he let his voice trail away well fucking smash em i tell you colonel borisov thundered federov wanted to argue more sergei could see as much his gesture urged his copilot to take it easy if borisov remembered this after he sobered up or if somebody reminded him of it federov would not be happy anastas mouradian would have shown what he thought with a lift of a few millimeters from one black bushy eyebrow everyone but borisov would have noticed and nobody would have been able to prove a thing southerners had that subtlety federov plainly didnt the newsreader talked about overfulfillment of steelproduction norms he praised the stakhanovite shock workers of magnitogorsk and added no german bombing plane will ever be able to reach them and disrupt their labors he was bound to be right about that how many factory towns beyond the urals belched smoke into the sky around the clock as they made all the things the soviet union needed hundreds maybe thousands they would have been villages before the revolution if they were there at all distance kept them safe from nazi bombardiers germany couldnt hide like that soviet aircraft had already delivered stinging blows to east prussia and had even raided berlin a few times the great powers of the west were supposed to be mighty in the air why werent they pounding hitlers manufacturing centers harder didnt it prove how halfhearted they were in their war against the fascists when the announcer started going on about wheat and barley production sergei stopped listening yes the people of the ussr had to eat try as the fellow on the radio would he couldnt make figures detailing the number of hectares to be planted anything but deadly dull collectivization continues to advance he said proudly the very idea of personal property will soon fade away sergei owned nothing his flying suit his rations his billet his bomber all from the state the vodka he wasnt sure where the vodka came from hed downed enough of it so he didnt care either as long as he could get his hands on some whenever he felt the urge nothing else mattered once the newsreader got into the production reports and the economic news you could talk over him without fear of being seen as uninterested in the lifeanddeath struggle on behalf of the workers and peasantsand without everybody frantically shushing you for opening your big trap one of the pilots said well weve got a few weeks till things dry out what happens then it should be the same kind of war it was last year colonel borisov said and the devil take england and france he was the squadron commander because he was sergei said only heres hoping youre right comrade colonel the ussr was a classless society in law in law yes but youd still get the shitty end of the stick if you pissed off the fellow entitled to tell you what to do drunk or sober sergei knew that and if hed spoken his mind he would have pissed borisov off hitler hated the soviet union the way stalin hated germany if the wehrmacht had to stand on the defensive in the west so it could hit harder here he feared it would do exactly that if it did could the ussr withstand the blow he had to hope so everyone who served the soviet union had to hope so if not it would be a rugged spring and a worse summer the ussr was finally over the horrors of the revolution even the purges well they hadnt stopped but theyd slowed down sergei thought they had at any rate did the country really need a big hard foreign war right now need one or not the ussr was liable to get one no doubt history and diplomacy justified stalins demand for that little chunk of northeastern poland last year but the price for it might prove higher than anyone in his right mind would want to pay back in the days before the draft sucked vaclav jezek into the czechoslovak army when hed thought about france hed pictured paris and the rivierathe parts you saw when you went on holiday imagining pretty girls wearing not enough clothes bronzing on the beach under the hot mediterranean sun hell it made you want to pack your bags and buy a train ticket right away reality at the moment was rather different as reality had a way of being the harsh landscape of northeastern france was as much a monument to industrial man as the worst parts of czechoslovakia and that was saying a mouthful it was as cold as it would have been back there too towns were jammed too close together piles of coal and slag heaps towered tall as church steeples and factory smokestacks the dirt looked gray even though the war had shut down most of the factories the air still held a chemical tang that made you want to cough the foulness must have soaked into the soil and to make things more enjoyable yet the germans seemed to plant a machine gun or a mortar on top of every hillock natural or manmade they had spotters in the steeples for all vaclav knew they had them in the smokestacks too they had lots of artillery and the gunners were very alert theyd had time to dig in in other words and they werent planning to go anywhere a mortar crew in feldgrau up on top of a long hillock of rubble must have imagined they were lords of all they surveyed which only proved their imagination was as wild as vaclavs had been when he thought about the riviera hed sneaked through a sad scabbylooking wood till he sprawled no more than a kilometer from the nazis and their pet stovepipe can you hit them benjamin halevy asked quietly with this baby sure vaclav patted the antitank rifle question is is it worth it once the first guy goes down theyll take cover and they can shoot back over the top of that thing i cant hit them once they move when they slide back to the other side they cant see whats going on over here right the jew answered his own question right not without an observer they cant and you can plug an observer so yeah make em move youre the sergeant vaclav steadied his piece of light artillery in the fork between a tree trunk and a stout branch he had a good notion of the range next to no windage he took a deep steadying breath then pressed the trigger as always the report was hellacious so was the kick but one of those distant german figures spun and fell over vaclav had another round chambered in only a few seconds the fritzes were good though they flattened out and dragged the mortar off to where vaclav couldnt see it now we find our foxhole he said and scurried back to suit action to word halevy scooted along with him their first few shots from the first position wont be real accurate but yeah but jezek agreed he put his butt and the rest of him inside the foxhole halevys was only a few meters away when you knew youd get shelled you didnt want to stay above ground not when you didnt have to yes those germans were good the czech and the french jew with czech jewish parents had barely dug in when mortar bombs started whispering down into the woods the flat harsh cracks as they went off and the whining shriek of fragments slashing through the air made vaclav wish czechoslovakia had never heard of conscription wish for the moon while youre at it he thought and tried to fold himself even smaller not all the shrieks in among the trees came from the bombs bursting there some were torn from the throats of the czechs and frenchmen the bombs wounded you all right vaclav called depends on how you look at things halevy answered they havent wounded me but im not drinking champagne and smoking a fat cigar and feeling up the barmaid either jezek snorted barmaids it wasnt as if he hadnt tried slipping his hand under their skirts now and then it wasnt even that he hadnt succeeded and gone on from there a few times but he couldnt think about them when he was getting shelled he wondered why not even when they cussed you out for groping them they were a hell of a lot more fun than what was really going on heads up halevy said urgently you pissed the fritzes off good vaclav came up from his foxhole and discovered what the jew meant a couple of armored cars with german crosses painted on them were edging out from around the back of the slag pile the mortar had topped soldiers in coalscuttle helmets loped along with them his lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage grin his antitank rifle wouldnt always do for tanks but armored cars werent armored against more than smallarms fire he could make some poor damned german draftees thinking about the feel of a barmaids stockinged thigh under their fingers even more unhappy than they were already he could and he did he knew where the driver sat in an armored car after he sent two rounds into the first machine it swung hard left and tried to drive up the manmade hill the other armored car kept coming its toy cannon and machine gun sent death snarling through the woods hunting him ducking back into the foxhole seemed the better part of valor he couldnt stay down there though not unless he wanted the landsers moving with the armored cars to get in among the trees and pull him out with a bayonet like frenchmen spearing escargots from their shells with skinny little forks life wasnt much fun when your choices lay between bad and worse worse was well worse he popped up again glumly certain the assholes in that second armored car were just waiting to see him and they were machinegun rounds cracked past a meter or two above his head but he got off a couple of shots of his own before taking cover once more benjamin halevys whoop told him theyd done some good cautiously he peered out to see for himself the other armored car had gone nosedown in a shell hole if that didnt say hed punched the drivers ticket he didnt know what would he chambered another round going after infantrymen with an antitank rifle was a lot like murder but not enough to stop him but he didnt have to some of the allied soldiers whod come into the woods had a mortar of their own with them the bombs started dropping among the sorry bastards in feldgrau some of the germans dove for the craters that pocked the landscape others beat it back toward the cover of the artificial hillock a couple of fritzes did neither one lay ominously still right out in the open the other writhed like an earthworm after a marching boot came down thin in the distance his screams sounded just like the ones that would come from a wounded czech or frenchmen torment was a universal brotherhood halevys rifle barked once twice the german stopped thrashing and yelling he lay as quiet as his comrade a few meters off vaclav glanced over to halevys foxhole the jew looked faintly embarrassed i didnt want to listen to that racket any more he said sure i know what you mean vaclav answered sometimes the only favor you could do a man was kill him vaclav hoped even a fritz would be kind enough to take care of that for him if he ever caught a nasty one not yet thank god benjamin halevy was eyeing the hill made from industrial rubble how the devil are we supposed to clear the germans off of that vaclav replied without hesitation have to flank em out of it they could slaughter a regiment that tried to go straight over too right they could halevy agreed mournfully but do you know how many positions just like this one there are all over this part of france too fucking many ive already seen too fucking many jezek said now that you mention it so have i halevy said and at every goddamn one of them the foot sloggers stuck in front of it are going have to flank it out but a lot of the time theres no room to go around the flank of one without bumping into another one head on and so vaclav said infantrymen arent dumb they want to go on living just like anybody else uhhuh the jew nodded but the generals want to throw the nazis out of france and you know what that means it means a lot of us end up dead whether we like it or not vaclav said yup im afraid thats just what it means halevy nodded one more time carefully julius lemp brought the u into the harbor at namsos except for a few diehard norwegians up in the stillfrozen far northnot enough men to matternorway lay in german hands uboats could put in and depart from any norwegian port that made it much harder for the royal navy to defend against them it tore the north sea wide open and gave the submarines a running start on getting out into the atlantic well up to a point anyhow namsos wasnt worth much yet not so far as the kriegsmarine was concerned english engineers had done their best to wreck whatever the new occupants might find useful and to boobytrap whatever they couldnt wreck as was usually true in cases like this english engineers best was all too good german engineers and labor gangssome from the reich s organization todt others made up of drafted local menprowled the harbor trying to set things right lemp supposed they would manage sooner or later given the battered state of everything he could see he would have bet on later a man in naval officers uniform waved to him from a halfburned pier you didnt see any mines in the fjord did you the fellow called jesus christ lemp yelled back from the conning tower havent you cleared them yet well we think so the other man answered that did not fill his heart with confidence in fact it made him clap a hand to his forehead heilige scheisse he said why did you let me come in here if you werent sure you made it didnt you the officer on the pier said soothingly the marked channel was all right sureand it was about a meter wider than my boat lemp said what more do you need the other fellow said proving he hadnt done any shiphandling lately lemp wanted to inquire about his mother but didnt think the man on the pier would take it in the proper spirit he didnt care to quarrel with the ignorant fellow anyhow he could get food and water and fuel and ammunition for his guns here pretty soon no doubt the reich would start shipping torpedoes up to the norwegian ports too if the boats didnt have to go back to the vaterland they could stay at sea longer and travel fartherand they could hit the enemy harder if only france had gone bellyup like norway the french coast lay a lot farther west and south than norway did lemp imagined uboats staging out of brest and st nazaire and bordeaux how long would england have lasted had that happened the reich almost starved the british isles into submission in with that kind of advantage working for it making england knuckle under would have been easy this time around would have been yes things hadnt worked out exactly the way the fuhrer had in mind that was why thered been machinegun fire in kiel when the u came in at the end of last year that was why so many highranking army and navy officers only a few from the luftwaffe which had belonged to goring from the start were either dead or in places designed to make them wish they were and it was why even in the notoriously easygoing uboat service people had to watch what they said these days every boat had a man or two aboard who would blab to the authorities ashore even a joke told the wrong way could get a good seaman hauled off between a couple of hatchetfaced sicherheitsdienst officials men who were hauled off like that didnt come back again for now lemp refused to dwell on such things what was the point when he couldnt do anything about them if he complained to his superiors hed find out for himself what the inside of a concentration camp was like you might not care for everything the people running the country did but it was still the vaterland you had to serve it as best you could once the u had tied up at the pier lemp asked one of the men whod made the boat fast do the tommies ever pay you a call not very far from england to herea lot closer than from england to germany yes sir the rating agreed theyve come over a few times but the nights are getting short even faster than they are back homewere a long way north you know weve got good flak and weve got fighter cover one thing thats plain as the nose on my facehe grinned being the owner of a pretty impressive honkeris that the bombers cant fight fighters and cant run either thats not what people thought before the war started lemp said i know the rating lowered his voice a little if it werent so though we wouldve knocked england flat by now eh wouldnt be surprised lemp said also quietly they smiled at each other and went about their business a man could feel he was bucking the system just by speaking a few plain truths a man could also feel good about getting back to terra firma supper was chicken stew with fresh vegetables the crew of the u had been living off sausage and beans and sauerkraut long enough to get sick of them they kept body and soul together which was as far as praise would reach the beer that went with supper was mighty welcome too so were the showers in the barracks saltwater soap didnt get a man clean gerhart beilharz toweled himself off with a blissful grin on his face i dont have to smell myself for a while let alone everybody else the schnorkel expert said in delight harder for you to knock your brains out too lemp replied beilharz was two meters tall not the ideal height for a submariner one of the ratings added now i can go to sleep without heinz sticking his shoe in my earand jens can curl up without my shoe in his now i can sleep without curling up beilharz said as an officer he got more sleeping room than ordinary sailors but not enough for a man his size even lemps cabinonly a curtain shut it off from the rest of the boatwas tiny and cramped everything on a uboat was cramped but none of the men got as much sleep as they all craved because the raf did come over that night airraid sirens started screaming about the same time as the antiaircraft guns began to thunder between them they made music to wake the dead lemp and the rest of the men from the u staggered toward the zigzag trenches as bombs whistling down added one more horrible note to the symphony it was cold out there did namsos ever warm up shivering lemp had trouble believing it next to him stood beilharz also shivering in his white cotton undershirt and long johns lemp pointed at him look he said dramatically a polar bear oh shut up sir beilharz said crump crump crump the bombs went off one after another not really close but not far enough away either night bombing on both sides was more a matter of luck than of skill bad luck for germany and some of those bombs would hit the harbor bad luck for the us crew and some of them would hit right here where were the fighters that dockside rating had bragged about night might not last long at this season up here but it was nighttime now how was a fighter supposed to find a bomber when he couldnt see it till he was on the point of running into it the flak was firing by earsight too no searchlights working yet to pin bombers in their beams after half an hour or so the engine drone overhead eased toward quiet the antiaircraft guns banged away for another ten minutes if falling shrapnel fractured somebodys skullor smashed itwell it was a tough old war for everybody wasnt it i wonder if i can go back to sleep gerhart beilharz said as the sailors trooped into the barracks again the yawn that followed declared he wasnt too worried about it neither was lemp some infantrymen were supposed to be able to sleep through air raids he couldnt do that but he wasnt so far away either he hurried to his cot ife went on in spite of everything weeds began to grow in the japanese trenches outside of vladivostok sergeant hideki fujita admired the little bits of green amidst dun and dirty white and when one of the weeds sprouted little red flowers he was as happy as if hed raised it himself that meant the men in his section admired the flowers with him if they were otherwise inclined the certain knowledge that he would give scoffers a clout in the head kept them from showing it now i hope the russians dont shell the poor thing he said and while he spoke he really was worried about it dont fret sergeant san senior private hayashi said a week from now a million of these things will pop up all over everywhere well get so sick of them well start to hate them i am not going to hate my plant fujita declared hayashi wise in the ways of noncoms nodded and shut his mouth except for the plant with the little red flowers not much seemed to change around the besieged russian city fifty meters here a hundred meters there the japanese lines tightened maybe the red army men defending the place were scrawnier than they had been when fujita got there they still fought as hard as ever though when fujita wasnt talking about his precious plant he would talk about that russians are funny people he said wisely puffing a cigarette as long as a russian has a rifle or a bayonet or an entrenching tool in his hands hes as dangerous as one of us would be maybe more so because hes sneakier hai breathed the soldiers gathered around him after all he was speaking plain truth besides he outranked them they werent going to argue there were less painful ways to commit seppuku if a man was so inclined he warmed to his theme but when a russians had enough he just throws down his rifle and throws up his hands and smiles at you like a dog he expects you to pet him and feed him and take care of his messes from then on out hai the soldiers chorused againtheyd all been in the trenches long enough to see the same thing for themselves disgraceful somebody added the men nodded by japanese standards surrender was disgraceful facing the choice between surrender and death a japanese soldier was trained to choose death every time he had no honor left if he decided to live even worse he smeared his whole family with his shame if he gave up gave in none of his relatives would be able to hold up their heads ever again and because a man base enough to surrender had no honor left you could do whatever you pleased with him after he fell into your hands russians and other westerners were said to treat prisoners of war kindly to fujita and his comrades that was incomprehensible softness even madness to most of them anyhow educated senior private hayashi said my father fought against the russians at port arthur he waited for his own nods and got them not many men in those muddy trenches didnt have older relatives whod gone through the russojapanese war he continued he told me orders then were to go easy on prisoners to treat enemy wounded the same way we treated our own and not even to be too hard on soldiers who gave up when they werent wounded fujita started to tell him he was full of crap before he could though another soldier said yeah i remember hearing the same thing from my old man pretty crazy stuff aint it maybe it really was true then no one other than fujita seemed inclined to contradict hayashi instead of sticking out his own neck he said well we arent dumb enough to keep on with that kind of nonsense nowadays oh no sergeant hayashi said quickly fujita hid a smile behind the rituals of lighting another smoke hayashis education had made him smart enough to know where his next bowl of rice was coming from anyhow fujita might not know so many kanji or be able to read and write chinese but he had the rank a subordinate who annoyed him would pay and pay his power might be petty but for those in its grasp it was real as rain behind the lines japanese guns thundered before long russian artillery answered wherever fujita had faced the red army hed seen that it had cannon falling out of its asshole more guns guns with longer range it was enough more than enough to make the poor sorry bastards who had to face those guns jealous something a few kilometers behind fujitas position blew up with a rending crash all the soldiers shook their heads in sorrow eee fujita said blowing out a stream of smoke theres some ammunition we wont get to use against the roundeyed barbarians he wanted to turn around and stand up in the trench to take a look at the cloud of smoke rising from that blast he wanted to but he didnt that would be asking for a bullet in the back of the head from a russian sniper peering through telescopic sights waiting for a japanese soldier to make a mistake and show himself those round pale eyes would be pitiless despite that hit the russian guns fell silent again sooner than hed expected when he said as much senior private hayashi answered theyve been doing that the past few days havent they he made it a question so he wouldnt seem to contradict fujita and making it a question he made fujita think back on it slowly the sergeant nodded you know maybe they have i wonder what it means maybe theyre running low on shells a soldier said hopefully if they are weve got them another man said not till they run out of machinegun bullets too the first soldier retorted fujita nodded again hed heard stories about the russojapanese war too machine guns were the slatewipers even back then they melted regiments into companies and companies into squads from everything he could see the red army used more of them now than it had in the old days sooner or later well beat them down hayashi said whether its soon enough to do us any good he didnt go on or have to foot soldiers were expendable everybody knew it including them if fujitas regimental commander needed to take a height in front of him hed keep throwing men at it till he did why not he could get reinforcements where would the red army find them the next day the russians raided off to the left of fujitas position they were after ground or prisoners to interrogate they also made off with the japanese units rice rations which were about to be served the japanese troops got more a couple of hours later the russians got full bellies for a change more raids like that followed some of them succeeded in grabbing the booty others only cost the red army casualties the japanese began using field kitchens to bait traps it worked as well with the russians as it would have with any other wild beasts because of such things fujita wasnt astonished when white flags started flying in the russian trenches he got a glimpse of grimfaced soviet officers coming through the japanese lines to confer with his superiors it wasnt peace not yet but it wasnt war you could stand up and show yourself and the russians wouldnt shoot at you some of them came into the japanese lines to beg they werent starving yet but they were skinny a lot of them had very fine boots fujita acquired a butterysoft pair for a couple of mess kits of rice a red army man who spoke a few words of japanese said nobody come help we why go on fight because giving up makes you a thing not a person fujita thought but he wanted the russians belt so he didnt say what was in his mind he went on dickering with the fellow for all the world as if hed personally grown the rice he was offering he got the price he wanted the russian couldnt say no not if he aimed to get any food at all hunger was a terrible thing so was defeat after three days of talks the red army officers surrendered vladivostok and the surrounding territory theyd reached the same conclusion as the soldier with the belt no one was coming to help them fujita wondered how many russians were giving up and what the japanese authorities would do with them all he shrugged it wasnt his worry one of the bright lads in willi dernens company had managed to hook a radio to a car battery and make noise come out of it the noise at the moment was a german newsman radio tokyo announced today that vladivostok has at last passed under japanese control ending the second long siege in twentiethcentury conflicts between the two countries having lost to japan in the east russia will now surely also lose to the reich in the west how do they figure that a soldier said now stalins only got us to worry about he isnt in a big twofront war any more cause hes already lost just about all of what he can lose way the hell over there a considerable silence followed no one seemed sure what to say about the comment the landser had a point which only made matters worse at last willi took a shot at it why dont you open your mouth a little wider anton then i can stick a land mine in there and youll blow your own head off next time you talk if you havent done it already he added but only to himself huh what do you mean maybe anton was gods innocent because he sounded as if he had not a clue willi wasnt about to spell it out for him then again he didnt have to corporal arno baatz took care of things with his usual style he means you sound disloyal thats what and you goddamn well do if they say well whip the lousy russians well whip em and thats flat oh yeah anton wasnt in awful arnos section and had more leeway sassing him than willi would have has anybody told the lousy russians about that the germans huddled in what had been some middleclass frenchmans parlor the power was out otherwise the bright boy wouldnt have needed his magic trick with the battery willi could watch corporal baatz turn red anyhow the fuhrer knows whats what he shouted well tell the russians when we march through moscow moscow have you got any idea how far from poland that is anton said ive got an idea that someone doesnt care a pfennig for germanys leadership awful arno said in a deadly voice and ive got a good idea of what happens to people like that too only if some stoolie rats them out somebody behind baatz said it should have been anton but maybe he really didnt know what happened to those people if he didnt he was one of gods innocents awful arno whirled as if his ass were on ball bearings who said that he yelled he wasnt red now he was purple ill smash your face in no one told him a thing that made him angrier than ever now that hed twisted in a new direction he gave other people the chance to talk behind his back and someone was quick to take advantage of it shut up and let us listen to the music baatz it was good music barnabas von geczy was supposed to be hitlers favorite band leader listening to komm mit nach madeira willi wished he were on a subtropical beach with a girl not stuck in a lousy french village with a bunch of smelly soldiers a bunch of other smelly soldiers he amendedhe was none too clean himself if the almostengineer would rig up some hot water now too much to hope for corporal baatz heaved himself to his feet and stormed out of the battered house hes going to blab to the officers someone predicted gloomily as long as he doesnt blab to the ss willi said he scowled at anton you and your big yap me what did i do i was only looking at the military possibilities the other soldier said thats what you thought willi said dont ask questions man keep your trap shut and do your job after the wars over well straighten out whatevers gone wrong anton eyed him arent you the guy who he paused not sure how to go on the guy who what willi growled though he didnt have to be a bright boy himself to know the guy whose buddy ran off anton said i dont know what happened to wolfgang i wish i did willi wasnt lying hed warned wolfgang storch to run off because the ss was about to grab him and run wolfgang hadtoward the french lines willi hoped he was sitting in a pow camp somewhere in southwestern france he would be if the poilus hadnt plugged him instead no way to know not for willi guys who tried to give up did get plugged sometimes no matter what the geneva convention ordained you clowns should put a cork in it too another landser said or take it outside anyway willi wanted to listen to the music so he shut up anton left in a huff some people didnt even know when they were getting themselves in trouble when the song ended somebody sighed and said thats not bad but it isnt jazz either all the other german soldiers in the battered parlor edged away from the music critic in his own way the fellowwilli thought his name was rolfwas as naive as poor dumb anton the way things worked in the reich these days your taste in records was a political choice national socialist doctrine branded jazz as degenerate music nigger music if you liked it maybe you were a degenerate or a niggerlover yourself the gestapo would be happy to find out as a matter of fact willi was fond of jazz too but he liked his own skin even better he wouldnt tell anybody he didnt trust about anything that might be dangerous if you wanted to get along you had to think about such things or better you had to tend to them so automatically you didnt need to think about them he sat there listening and smoking for another hour after a repeat of the news an opera tenor started blasting out an aria he got up and left then the fuhrer loved wagner it put willi in mind of cats being choked to an overwrought musical accompaniment for the time being the germans had the village pretty much to themselves only a few french families had stayed behind when the wehrmacht rolled through the rest packed up whatever they could and ran now they were stuck somewhere on the wrong side of the line if they hadnt got bombed or machinegunned from the air while they were on the road off to the west french s barked a very distinctive sound the shells didnt come down on the village for which willi thanked the god in whom he had more and more trouble believing it wasnt as if plenty hadnt already landed here one of these days before too long the germans would fall back some more poilus in khaki would take the place of landsers in fieldgray and german s would kill a few french soldiers mutilate a few more and knock down some houses that had stayed lucky so far and then maybe the people whod run for their lives would come back to see what was left of the things around which theyd built their civilian existence and they would cry and wail and swear at the germans and shake their fists and somebody would yank on a boobytrap left behind for the poilus and blow off her hand then the crying and wailing and cursing would start all over again louder than ever war is shit willi muttered sincerely if with no great originality he started to cross the main street the only one in town you couldnt piss across then he stopped the main drag ran east and west straight enough to let somebody out there look a long way down it if the froggies had posted a sniper hed be looking this way through a riflemounted telescope willi had done a little sniping enough to start to get the feel for it he didnt know the french had put a guy with a rifle out there no faroff rifleman had punched antons ticket for him no sniper had got rid of awful arno either too bad willi thought rolf came out too a minute or so behind willi no surprise if you liked jazz dark deeds on the rhine wouldnt be your cup of tea rolf crossed the street without hesitation you might want to watch willi began he couldnt even finish the sentence before rolf fell over shot through the head the distant report arrived after the bullet rolf didnt even twitch he just lay there bleeding he must have died before he hit the ground willi shuddered it could have been him oh so easily it could have been him going with pete mcgill had done wonders for veras english the white russian girl hadnt known much before they hooked up with each other now she was pretty fluent half the time she even remembered not to roll her rs pete was proud of herit showed how smart she was she was a good deal smarter than he was but that hadnt occurred to the marine yet if vera was really smart her being smarter than pete never would occur to him worrying about whether the girl you love loves you back or is calculating the best way to use you to get what she wants is not likely to make an affair last at the moment pete wasnt worrying about anything hed just got what he wanted and his heart was still beating like a drum shanghai had any number of places where a man and a woman could walk in together sign the guest book as mr and mrs and be asked no questions this was one of them the room was small but the mattress was fairly new and the sheets were clean he wouldnt have fussed if they werent but vera might have women are picky he thought he rolled half away from her and turned on the lamp on the nightstand with a little startled squeak she made as if to cover herself dont do that babe he said i love to look at you when he did his manhood stirred again before long theyd start another round in the meantime a different urge seized him he rummaged in the trousers of his civilian slacks till midnight tomorrow he didnt have to look like a leatherneck till he found his luckies as he tapped one against the nightstand he held out the pack to vera want one sure she said the word came out just like thatperfect she might have been born in the states she took a cigarette tapped it down on her nightstand and waited for a light pete had to dig out his matches if hed been thinking he would have grabbed them with the butts if hed been thinking he would have been someone else altogether he lit a match his cheeks hollowed as he applied the flame to the tip of the cigarette smoke filled his mouth then his lungs he dropped the match in the glass ashtray next to the lamp vera leaned close for a light from the hot red coal at the end of his lucky as she too sucked in smoke he cupped her breast with his free hand she made a little noise that might have been a purr or a laugh once she had the cigarette going she said you she didnt say men that would have reminded pete thered been othersand how many othersbefore him she was more than smart enough to steer clear of that kind of tactical error she did say i like your american tobacco the way she said it made pete feel hed grown the weed harvested it and cured it himself yeah its good isnt it he said hed smoked chinese tobacco every now and then it was like inhaling a blowtorch flame any smokes were better than none but still after shed leaned across him to grind out her cigarette the room had only the one ashtray and was lucky to have that and after hed taken more friendly liberties with her person while she did it she asked how much longer will the marines stay in shanghai ive got no idea he said and he might have been proud of having no idea as a matter of fact he was like any welltrained hunting dog he went where he was told and did what he was told he didnt need to worry about that kind of thing for himself and so he didnt the question did provoke a little more response in him though how come because the japanese can run over you any time they please because i do not want anything bad to happen to you vera said pete grunted ever since the japs overran peking hed known that was true more often than not a marines pride kept him from admitting it even to himself they mess with us theyve got a war on their hands a war with the usa they got to know wed kick their behinds around the block so darn fast itd make their heads swim that he censored the automatic marine curses showed she wasnt just a joy girl for himhe really cared they bombed the panay there was no war vera said they apologized afterwards thats why pete answered uneasily sides theyre busy fighting a war with the russians they wouldnt want to tangle with two big countries at once japs are crazy sure but they arent that kind of crazy they have what they want from russia they have vladivostok veras english was a lot better yeah but the way she pronounced the towns named showed what her native language was now russia has a hard time fighting them she spoke with as much assurance as a general pete was good and sure he would never want to suck on a generals bare tits though what can i do about it he said im nothing but a twostriper nobodys gonna pay attention to me talk to your officers let them know your concern let them know my concern vera meant pete vaguely sensed that but only vaguely she went on some of what you tell them will go into what they tell the people over them the people back in america how could she be so sure of that how much experience of the way the military mind worked did she have when the question came to him like that pete shied away from it it was almost as if his corps buddies were razzing him about her hell he didnt need them he was doing it to himself right there inside his own head what was going through his mind must have shown on his face vera suddenly looked impish when you turned on the light i thought it was because you wanted to watch she said here i give you something to watch and she did did she ever she couldnt have been more distracting if shed caught fire she needed experience with men to know how to do what she was doing too but pete didnt care while she was doing it he didnt care about anything after she got done doing it he wanted to roll over and sleep for a week instead he smoked another cigarette then he did something along those lines for her too that went a long way toward proving his love he never would have done anything like it for anyone he didnt really want to please if it also proved vera washed more often and more carefully than other women hed knownwell he didnt consciously notice he did notice she gave every sign of being pleased when he did it one more encouragement for him to do it again how am i supposed to go dance tomorrow she said my legs are all unstringed he thought that was supposed to be unstrung but he wasnt sure enough to tell her so correcting a girl whod just paid you a compliment like that wasnt the smartest thing you could do either pete might not have been the highest card in the deck but he could see that squeezing the breath out of her seemed a better idea it was more fun too he wished she didnt have to go on working as a taxi dancer he gave her what he could but he didnt have enough to put her up the way shed want to be put up if she quit a marine corporal was rich by shanghai standards but not rich enough to support a mistress you needed an officers pay for that besides he didnt want a mistress he wanted a wife that thrilled his superiors too it was one more reason they wouldnt listen to him if he came to them with stories of what the japs were liable to do since he didnt see how he could explain that to vera he didnt try as they were walking back to the dance hall above which she lived she waved at the europeanstyle buildings all around all this pretty soonpoof she snapped her fingers what do you say rented time borrowed pete only shrugged nothing i can do about it babe i dont know if anybody can do anything about it the japs can vera said that is the point she wouldnt let it alone if pete hadnt been head over heels that would have bothered him it bothered him a little anyhow but he overlooked being bothered yes he was in love all right theyd done something unspeakable to sergeant demange luc harcourt laughed and laughed a lieutenant at your age when youve been cussing out officers since before you had to shave what is the world coming to ah fuck off demange said his eternal cigarette quivered in fury i didnt ask em to do it god knows i didnt want em to do it but you cant tell the assholes nothey dont listen to you yes sir lieutenant sir luc said and gave demange the fanciest salute hed torn off since trainingground days it wont change anything demange insisted ive been running this fucking platoon full of cocksuckers anyway hey but now that youre a lieutenant theyll figure you can run a company or maybe a battalion luc answered everybody knows how screwed up our high command is they just went and proved it thats all demange said something about his mother that violated at least eight of the ten commandments then he added the real proof that those shitheads have lost it will be when they make you a sergeant now that you cant do it somebodys got to disgrace the rank luc said reasonably demanges reply took care of the last two commandments luc wasnt eager to become a sergeant if he kept avoiding bullets though he would before too long slots opened up as peoples luck ran out you didnt always need to meet a bullet somebody in another company in the regiment had tripped over a length of barbed wire he hadnt seen and broken an ankle hed be out of action for weeks the lucky salaud woods rose up ahead beyond them lay the village of serzyetprin beyond that a good way beyond it lay reims which was a real city the boches held reims they held serzyetprin too and there were bound to be bastards in coalscuttle helmets in among the trees demange pointed east toward the woods goddamn leaves would have to start sprouting just when they could hide some fritzes his scorn was so seamlessly perfect it covered all of mankind and had room for mother nature as well when luc said as much demange spat that clappedout old whore all shes ever given me are lice like youre the only one just thinking about them made luc want to scratch he nodded toward the trees himself you going to order us in joinville and villehardouin are ready to lug the hotchkiss dont blame it on me demange said when the generals decide its time to go well go till then ill sit on my ass as long as i can he spat out the last gitanes tiny butt and lit up the next how about one for me luc asked demange looked shocked what you think officers waste tobacco on enlisted men fuck off cochon fuck off yourself sir luc said the new lieutenant gave him a cigarette they smoked together eyeing the woods theyd have to clear out sooner or later like demange luc hoped it would be later luc pointed toward the new grass sprouting in the cratered field in front of the trees youve got to know the fritzes have had time to lay mines there as sure as your sisters got crabs demange agreed all part of the overhead oh boy luc took his canteen off his belt it was full of pinard he drank some then passed the rough red wine to demange the veterans adams apple bobbed as he took a good swallow just for the moment with nobody shooting at them and no order to advance life didnt seem so bad the order to advance came the next day luc would have been more upset had he been more surprised well if weve got to catch the shaft there are worse places to do iti suppose joinville said villehardouin came out with something in breton that luc didnt understand at all as luc had told demange they were ready so was the gun he checked it himself by now he could do everything with a hotchkiss gun but build one and so were the germans whether a deserter warned them or they figured it out for themselves they shelled the french positions on and off through the night luc huddled in a shallow foxhole trying to doze he didnt get much sleep but the hole was deeper toward dawn than it had been at sundown come on you sorry silly cons lieutenant demange called when the eastern sky began to go gray time to earn our sous he made more as a lieutenant than he had as a sergeant but you didnt make a career of the army to get rich you heard the man luc told his machinegun crew they stumbled forward there still wasnt enough light to see much youd never spot the mine that waited for you youd never spot wire either though luc looked for some almost hopefully a broken ankle didnt seem half bad then all of a sudden he could see just fine german parachute flares lit up the field brighter than noontime french soldiers cried out in horror down demange screamed get down theyre gonna give it to us give it to them the boches did their artillery opened up one more time now it was deadly accurate thanks no doubt to forward observers watching the poilus scramble and dive for cover for good measure german machine guns at the edge of the woods raked the field traces might have been lines of blood drawn in the air when people started shooting at you you flattened out demange had that right luc did his best to imitate a frog squashed by a tank but he couldnt just lie there and pile dirt in front of himself with his entrenching tool commanding a machine gun meant he had to shoot back if the hotchkiss could knock out the german machine gunners he and his buddies would have a much better chance of seeing the sun go down this afternoon joinville and villehardouin had hit the dirt too they were already putting the machine gun on its tripod luc crawled over to them not getting a centimeter higher off the ground than he had to fuck the fuckers villehardouin said the clearest thing luc had heard from him in days he got down behind the hotchkiss and squeezed the trigger the gun roared through a strip of ammo he probably wouldnt have any hearing left by the time he got out of the army but he didnt care joinville fed fresh strips into the machine gun one of the ammunition carriers was down wounded or dead villehardouin crawled back to recover the crate luc fired first at one mg then at another how many of the monsters did those nazi cochons have the other thing was they all seemed to be shooting at him and with better and better accuracy as sunrise neared what i wouldnt give for a couplethree tanks right now joinville said luc nodded not that that did either one of them any good the brass didnt seem to have laid on any armor for this little dance the fritzes didnt have any in the neighborhood so why should la belle france waste hers why to keep us from getting murdered luc thought but that wasnt the biggest worry in the brasss minds now or ever the old men with all the gold braid and leaves on their kepis measured things out on their maps and went from there casualties just part of the overhead as demange said what demange said now was back get back we cant break in there in a million years machine gun give us covering fire thanks a bunch lieutenant luc said under his breath but it was the right order even if it might make him a casualty he tapped the gun with the heel of his hand again and again traversing it so it sprayed the whole front of the woods with fire and made lots of boches keep their heads down the more germans who ducked the more of his own buddies whod get back to their holes how he and the rest of the hotchkiss crew would get back was an interesting question to his surprise it got an answer the french artillery which should have shelled the woods before the infantry moved out chose that moment to wake up under cover of the badly timed barrage the machine gunners made it back to what passed for safety in these parts luc drained his pinard to celebrate he figured hed earned it ergeant hideki fujita had been talking about prisoners of war not long before now here they were thousands of them maybe tens of thousands crowded into barbedwire corrals with japanese machinegun positions outside the wire to make sure they didnt get any bright ideas about breaking out the russians looked well they would have had to perk up to look miserable theyd been disarmed and hastily plundered after they surrendered but they werent plucked clean yet who could guess what goodies they hid under their duncolored greatcoats those coats and the hairblack brown yellow once in a while startling redsprouting in clumps on their faces robbed them of their human outlines monkeys fujita said as he strolled around the camp thats what they look like a bunch of monkeys he mimed scratching himself under the armpits senior private hayashi smiled and nodded if a sergeant made a joke a senior private thought it was funny have you seen the ones that go in the hot springs in the middle of winter the russians are so hairy thats just what they remind me of he made his own joke and theyre in hot water too hai they sure are fujita said no matter what had happened during the last war between russia and japan he couldnt see his own countrymen wasting much food or care on prisoners of war especially when there were so many of them he was soon proved righteven righter than hed expected the regimental commander colonel watanabe gathered his men together so he could harangue them soldiers of japan we have got to deal with this russian pestilence along with plenty of other men fujita nodded hearing the colonel like this was safe enough usually if his eye fell on you it was because youd screwed up hed make you sorry which was one of the things colonels were for our regiment has been chosen for a high honor watanabe went on fujita had a good idea what that meant it meant that whatever came out of the colonels mouth next they were stuck with it sure enough watanabe went on we have the privilege of removing many of the russians from proximity to vladivostok that way they can no longer endanger the city which has become an integral part of the japanese empire a murmur of hai ran through the men again sergeant fujita joined it though he wasnt quite sure what watanabe was talking about and then suddenly he was they were going to guard the russians while the prisoners went wherever japanese officials had decided they should go colonel watanabe looked out at his men you must be severe these prisoners have no honor left since theyve surrendered how could they some of them will realize this others will not care and will act like the wild beasts they are if they try to get away you will dispose of them the way you would get rid of any other vermin do you understand me hai the japanese soldiers chorused once more this time sergeant fujita spoke firmly he heard no hesitation from any of his comrades either it wasnt as if watanabe had told them anything they didnt already know the colonel nodded to the regiment good he said i knew you would hear me in the spirit of bushido do you have questions he pointed to a captain from another company yes please excuse me colonel san but what arrangements will be made for getting the prisoners food and water on the march they are prisoners watanabe said as if to an idiot they will get what bushido says they deserve is that clear enough oh yes sir the captain said quickly it was clear to fujita too bushido the way of the warriorsaid letting yourself get captured was the ultimate disgrace a prisoner deserved nothing better he should have died as if reading his mind colonel watanabe raised a hand in warning i have been told it is important that some of the captives reach the destination to which we are ordered to take them they must not all fall along the way so there will be food there will be water he shrugged not what everyone would want perhaps but it cant be helped after the colonel dismissed the regiment fujita went to watch the prisoners some more he nodded to himself monkeys that was just what they looked like all right im sorry sergeant san but you must not go too close to the wire the private who spoke to fujita sounded nervous and no wonder fujita outranked him persuading a superior to do what another superior had told you needed doing was liable to get you in trouble not this time though ill be careful the sergeant said ive never seen so many westerners close up thats all oh no neither have i the private showed his teeth in a broad relieved grin i never knew they were so ugly did you no they look like they were taken out of the oven too soon and all that hair they might as well be ainu neh i dont know sergeant san ive never seen an ainuim from shikoku myself the private named the southernmost of the four main islands the ainu lived on hokkaido the most northerly all i know is what people say what people said was also all fujita knew about the ainu he wasnt about to admit that to a noaccount guard he looked at the russians they stared back at him just as some of them had yellow or red hair instead of black some had eyes of blue or green instead of brown were they really human they were humanly miserable they stretched out their hands to him palms up like begging monkeys some of them knew a few japanese words food please rice meat bread sir you have cigarettes you can ignore them the private said just about everybody does just about even the qualification surprised fujita some people are soft the private answered you knowthe kind who feed stray dogs in the street dogs are only animals they do what they do because thats what they do fujita said harshly these russians theyre a different kind of dog they chose to surrender they could have done the honorable thing instead i would have the guard said fujita believed him any japanese would have if you killed yourself everything was over your kin would be sad but they would be proud the enemy couldnt humiliate you or torment you and your spirit would find a refuge at the yasukuni shrine along with all the others whod died well what more could you want they got the prisoners moving three days later before they opened the gates to the enormous enclosure a japanese officer who spoke russian talked to the captives with a microphone and pa system i wonder what hes saying senior private hayashi remarked you dont know russian fujita asked sorry sergeant san chinese and i was starting to learn german but i hadnt taken much before i went into the army well you dont really need to know the language to work out whats what here fujita said its got to be something like behave yourselves and we wont kill youyet what else would you say that should do it all right hayashi agreed after the gates swung wide the russians shambled out they even smelled different from japanese harsher stronger ranker waves of that distinctive stench rose from them as they moved their officers and sergeants shouted at them obedient as so many cattle they formed neat ranks a japanese lieutenant at the head of the parade gestured with his sword following the wordless order the russians trudged off toward the northwest toward what had been the border between the soviet union and manchukuo now all this came under the emperors purview fujita couldnt have been happier no matter how much marching this new duty entailed nobody would be shooting at him he didnt think the red air force would try to bomb him either theyd blow up more of their own countrymen if they did any duty that involved only a small risk of getting killed looked mighty good to him pretty soon the rasputitsa would be over already poland wasnt quite such a muddy place as it had been when things were at their worst hansulrich rudel could see that before long the ground would let panzers move and airplanes take off and land when that happened the front was liable to shift far and fast as long as it headed eastand he confidently expected it wouldhe approved of that why had they ordered him here if not to push the front and yet and yet he wouldnt be happy leaving bialystok behind even sergeant dieselhorst teased him about his reasons ha thats what you get for falling for a jewish barmaid shes only half jewish rudel answered with fussy precision fuhrer wouldnt care dieselhorst said which was as accurate as the pythagorean theorem as a good national socialist hansulrich knew that perfectly well and dieselhorst went right on sassing him besides even if you go mooning after her like a poisoned pup i do not hansulrich broke in hell you dont again sergeant dieselhorst deflated him with the truth like i say even if you go mooning after her she hasnt given you a tumble has she i dont have to put up with thisthis quatsch rudel said with such dignity as he could muster dieselhorsts laughter pursued him like antiaircraft fire he did have it bad when his rear gunner wasnt teasing him he knew that for himself which didnt stop him from going into bialystok to find out if sofia would give herself to him this time around you again she said in mock surprise when he walked into the tavern a couple of germans whod been regulars there longer than he had chuckled he ignored them they were foot soldiers not flyers so their opinions didnt matter to him sofias did he sat down at a table so shed have to come over if hed perched on a stool at the bar the boredlooking man behind it would have taken care of him that was the last thing he wanted two bottles of vodka right she said in yiddish she knewshe couldnt very well not knowhe steered clear of booze tea please hansulrich said tightly ordering milk in a dive like this only made people laugh at you more than they did anyhow besides hed found that milk you bought in poland had at least a fiftyfifty chance of being sour tea sofia rolled her eyes but she didnt laugh not out loud she came back a few minutes later with a glasspoles drank tea russianstyleand a pot that had probably come to bialystok from england when queen victoria still sat on the throne disapproving of things hansulrich who disapproved of a good many things himself felt more than a little sympathy for the late queen but he didnt disapprove of sofia on the contrary as she poured the tea he slipped an arm around her waist she made as if to pour some in his lap he let go the feel of her still warm on his fingers she set the teapot on the table what is it with you anyway she demanded what do you think it is you drive me crazy you must be crazy she followed his german well enough but the word she used meshuggeh was one hed had to figure out from context she pointed to the luftwaffe eagle on his chestthe eagle holding a swastika in its claws youre wearing that and you think id want anything to do with you maybe you dont drink but i bet you smoke an opium pipe im heregermans are hereto defend poland against the reds rudel said is that so bad does it make me so awful thats not so bad sofia said she pointed to the swastikacarrying eagle again that makes you awful would you rather see russian commissars buying drinks here or not buying drinks this time she pointed to the teapot so you can quit hokking me a chynik about that one more yiddish phrase hed picked upliterally banging on a teapot but stretched to mean making a fuss in general the russians wouldnt come down on us because we were jews theyd just come down on us because we were here is that better hansulrich asked only afterwards did he think to add we arent coming down on you were being correct that was the best face he could put on it its better sofia answered in the last war you people came here too and there were jews in the kaisers army where are they now they dont support the fuhrer again that was the best he could do can you blame them sofia said i dont care about such things he said which was a good long stretch from the truth all i care about is you he came closer to veracity there at least for the moment sofia spelled it out in words of one syllable all you want to do is lay me thats not all i want to do i mean hansulrich broke off in confusion what else do i want to find out she said before he could answerand probably dig himself in deepershe stalked off to tend to the ground pounders and locals at some of the other tables but she came back she kept coming back hansulrich thought she had to have some interest in him if she didnt shed take his order take his money and ignore him the rest of the time or she really would pour hot tea on his crotch he knew he was dense about such things but that would get the message across more tea she asked sure all right if you wont get in trouble because you had a mischling bring you your teapot she knew the word the party used to describe half and quarterjews away she went hansulrich felt the question as if a round of flak had burst under his ju even if germans couldnt treat polish jews the way they treated jews back in the reich they werent supposed to go out of their way to be friendly he didnt just want to be friendly either he wanted to but as hed told her that wasnt the only thing he wanted which complicated things further before this latest failed coup against the fuhrer he wouldnt have worried about it so much everything was tighter now though people whod done fine in the field had disappeared because the security organs didnt think they were politically reliable rudel had always approved of that now he discovered the english poets bell tolling for him here you go sofia plunked another teapot steam rising from the spout on the table thanks you asked if id get in trouble for liking you that wasnt exactly what shed asked but it was what shed meant as far as im concerned youre worth taking the chance on maybe youre brave more likely youre just stupid sofia said which was a shrewd guess on both ends whats so stupid about liking you hansulrich said plaintively that plaintiveness finally reached her shed started to turn away but she swung back with a sharp gesture wait a minute she said suspicious and wary as a cat when you say you like me you dont just mean you want to go to bed with me you mean you really like me she might have been accusing him of some horrible perversion for all he knew she was he nodded anyway his heart hadnt thumped like this when he was diving on panzers with his experimental guns to win the ritterkreuz the french might have killed him but they wouldnt have left him alive and embarrassed thats right he said you are stupid she said then she bent down and gave him a kiss that would have melted all the wax in his mustache if only hed worn one the german infantrymen whooped before he could grab her and pull her down onto his lap she skipped back with a dancers grace be careful what you wish for youre liable to get it and wasnt that the truth all through the mud time hed wanted the chance to hit back at the russians now hed got it the front would roll east and when and how would he get back to bialystok to see sofia again there was a joke they told even in the godfighting soviet union it had to do with the atheists funeral there he lay all dressed up with no place to go it wasnt a very good joke but when did that ever stop people anastas mouradian felt like that atheist in his coffin hed crossed the whole vast breadth of the ussr hed flown a couple of missions against the japanese besieging vladivostok and now the city had surrendered the war against japan wasnt over but the little yellow men had what they wanted now it was up to the red army and air force to take it back if they could if japan were the soviet unions only enemy stalin likely would have massed an army and an air fleet up around khabarovsk for a drive down the line of the transsiberian railway toward vladivostok how was he supposed to do that though when the war with the hitlerites was about to heat up ten thousand kilometers to the west theyll send us back when the balloon goes up nikolai chernenko seemed excited at the prospect whether he was or not stas wasnt thatll be halfway around the world for me just to get back where i started his copilot didnt want to listen to himno surprise not when chernenko was as young as he was are the germans better in the air than the japs the kid asked germans intimidated russians in a way the japanese couldnt come close to matching mouradian felt some of that himself theyre very good he said you cant get foolish or sloppy against them or youll end up dead before youve got any notion why what do you mean chernenko might have flown combat missions but he was still a virgin in some important ways that thought told mouradian how to go on remember what it was like the first time you kissed a girl i sure do the enthusiasm heating the younger mans voice said he hadnt made the discovery very long agomaybe the night before he left his parents apartment or his collective farm to report to the soviet military was i ever that young stas wondered in some important ways he doubted it southerners took for granted things that shocked most russians but that was neither here nor there gently the armenian said fine could anybody have explained what kissing a girl was like before you went and did it chernenko emphatically shook his head i dont think so khorosho for what its worth to you i dont think so either well fighting the germans is kind of like that only you cant try to take their bra off afterwards youll find out if thats what the people with the rank want you to do then this will make more sense to you if you happen to remember it the youngster frowned with luck in wisdom his spotty face dead serious he asked why do german fighter pilots wear brassieres does it help them against g forces or something oh kolya kolya kolya mouradian gave up they might both use russian but they didnt speak the same language one of these days raw second lieutenant chernenko might turn into first lieutenant or even captain chernenko hed grow up it happened fast when people were shooting at each other when that day came he and mouradian might be able to talk outside the line of duty and make sense to each other stranger things had happened they must have even if stas couldnt think of any right this minute meanwhile even if vladivostok had fallen the war against japan sputtered on in stalins place mouradian would have patched up a peace with japan so he could square off against hitler undistracted maybe he was working on that maybe foreign commissar litvinov was in tokyo right now making a facesaving deal but if he was radio moscow wasnt saying anything about it radio moscow had said as little as it could about losing vladivostok all it said was that the garrison commander had yielded the city against orders if soldiers and civilians were starving if there was no hope of rescueand mouradian knew all too well there wasntwhat could the general do but give up that was how it looked to him radio moscow saw things differently and you didnt argue with what radio moscow said except perhaps within the privacy of your own mind even then you had to be careful lest your face betray you sbs flying out of the base near khabarovsk bombed towns in northern manchukuo they flew across the tartar strait and bombed karafuto that was what the japanese called the southern half of sakhalin island which theyd taken in the aftermath of the russojapanese war the bombers also flew patrols over the tartar strait and down into the sea of japan orders on those missions were to attack and sink any warships they spotted german stukas were ugly ungainly planes but mouradian had been on the receiving end of their dives and knew how accurately they could place their bombs sbs werent made for work like that stas was willing to try but a long way from optimistic about the results come to that he was a long way from optimistic about finding warships much less hitting them this was the first time hed ever seen the ocean any ocean it was as illimitably vast as the russian steppe hed traveled to get to siberia how were you supposed to find anything as small as a ship in all that wavechopped graygreen sea clouds inconsiderately drifting across it didnt help either damned if they didnt though nikolai chernenko whooped like a savage there he said pointing a dramatic forefinger a fucking battleship stas didnt know if it was a battleship or only a destroyer he was no connoisseur of warships but he knew damn well a warship it was it bristled with guns and turrets and its hull arrogantly knifed through the water in these parts it could only be japanese well go in low he declared the sb was no stuka but maybe it could impersonate one in the cinema chernenko frowned we have no orders to do that comrade pilot he was a russian all right and he was a new soviet man anything without orders was right up there with doubting marxismleninism in the ussrs catalogue of heresies but mouradian answered we have no orders not to do it and it gives us the best chance for a hit he watched his copilot and bombaimer chew if he had to he vowed to make the attack run himself his way but chernenkos face cleared stas had shown himself to be orthodox or at least not unorthodox i serve the soviet union chernenko exclaimed mouradian spoke into the voice tube to the bomb bay so sergeant suslov would know what was going on just tell me when suslov said ill drop em right down the whores cunt he even talked like the chimp shove the stick forward watch the nose drop not too steep or youd never pull out again this wasnt a divebomber when the airframe groaned you needed to listen to it the ship swelled from bathtub toy to fullsized fearsomeness much too fast blueclad japanese sailors ran every which way like angry ants antiaircraft guns started filling the sky around the sb with puffs of black smoke with fire at their heart five degrees to the left comrade pilot i say again five degrees left with business to attend to chernenko was a competent professional mouradian obeyed without question da chernenko said thatll do it stas thought so tootheyd pass over the ship from bow to stern a near miss from a shell shook the sb the copilot ignored it calling through the tube be ready innokenty at my order ready comrade bombaimer lets fuck em suslov answered now chernenko shouted as soon as the bombs fell free mouradian pulled back sharply on the stick climbing away from the antiaircraft fire he heard soggy thumps when the bombs went off when he could see the ship again smoke rose from the stern we did something to it anyhow he said although it was still steaming we should have done more chernenko sounded absurdly disappointed i wanted to sink the son of a bitch well have more chances mouradian was just glad theyd got away in once piece hed never dreamt a ship could throw that many shells it almost tempted him to go after the next one from several thousand meters up almost colonel otto griehl looked out at the men of his blackclad regiment the blackclad panzer crewmen stood waiting theo hossbach absentmindedly scratched an itch next to him adi stoss puffed on a cigarette nobody seemed very excited they alleven theohad a good idea of what was coming next griehl scratched too at a scar on his chin he was lean almost hawkfaced with hollow cheeks and closecropped gray hair like his men he wore pinkpiped black collar patches with a silver totentkopf in each one the skull and crossbones had been the panzer emblem for as long as germanyd had armored fighting vehicles well boys its time griehl said we came into this fight by dribs and drabs and then we had to put up with the worst winter even an old man like me can remember theo wasnt sure the colonels face had room for a grin but it did it made him look years youngerthough still old of course it didnt last long he sobered as he went on but now were here in the east in proper force and now the ground and the weather arent too bad that was as much praise as he would dole out to polish conditions and soits time to show the ivans what we can do a low hum ran through the panzertruppen here and there men nodded adi did and so did sergeant witt theo just stood listening he was ready but he wasnt eager he knew what could happen when things went wrong if he was ever tempted to forget the missing joints on his ring finger reminded him were going to drive them out of poland griehl said matteroffactly once we take care of thatwell well see i dont know what the fuhrer and the high command will want us to do then one thing at a time though lets talk about our immediate objectives and he did detailing the routes the regiment would take as it pushed east and north from the vicinity of bialystok he talked about artillery and air support and about the infantry who would move forward with the panzers most of them are polish units he said remember that for gods sake and dont shoot them by mistake they wear a darker greener khaki than the russians and their helmet is almost like the czech potit doesnt have a brim like the russian model tell us something we didnt know adi muttered theo heard him and maybe witt did too but nobody else theo was patient with these lectures one reason you walked barefoot through the obvious was that people did forget especially when other people were trying to kill them give the poles a hand where you can griehl said theyre good troops theyre brave troops the only thing thats really wrong with them is they dont have as many toys as we do infantry machine gunstheyve got those but theyre light on artillery and panzers and planes thats why they called us in to help against the reds so well do it he grinned again its not like the fuhrer hasnt got his own reasons for going after russia if youve read mein kampf youll know that he got more nods hitlers book was holy writ to the party theo had looked at it found it bombastic and badly written and put it aside but you didnt have to have gone through page by page to know he talked about russia as germanys lebensraum stalin doubtless had a different view of that which didnt bother the fuhrer we go at tomorrow the colonel finished good luck to every one of you believe you me ivan will never know what hit him when the big push in the west started a little before christmas officers promised men the showgirls and bars of paris they didnt quite deliver theo lost the end of that finger in the last failed effort at a breakthrough maybe this time everything would work out the way colonel griehl said theo had his doubts he didnt voice them for one thing what was the point for another he hardly ever voiced anything he was in the panzer before the appointed hour he squeezed meat paste from a tinfoil tube onto a chunk of black bread not the kind of breakfast hed eaten before conscription called but he didnt raise his voice to complain either and that meat paste was one of the best rations the germans had tommies on patrol stole tubes of it from dead landsers where he sat he couldnt see what was going on all he could see were his radio set the machine pistol next to it and the panzer commanders behind and legs he didnt care he had his own little world he heard the order to go forward and relayed it to hermann witt and through the panzer iis armor and through his earphones he heard the thunder of the german artillery as it pounded soviet positions to the east stukas would be screaming out of the sky to take out strongpoints too tough for artillery theo couldnt hear them but he knew how an attack worked no he knew how an attack should work things always went wrong neither side had really known what it was doing when the wehrmacht drove into czechoslovakia a good thing the czechs were as thumbfingered as the germans or that one might have failed on the western front theyd tried to go too far too fast looking back he could see that at the time it seemed easyuntil all of a sudden it didnt any more now the panzer ii squashed barbed wire under its tracks foot soldiers whether in feldgrau or dark polish khaki would be able to follow sergeant witt sprayed short bursts of machinegun fire ahead of the panzer if the russians had to keep their heads down the infantrymen with the german armor would have an easier time disposing of them ratatattat except is wasnt ratatattat or not exactly it was clangetyclangetyclang as if somebody were attacking the panzer with a rivet gun machine gunners couldnt resist panzers they also couldnt hurt them if you didnt count scaring the crew half to death panzer halt witt shouted adalbert stoss obediently hit the brakes the panzer commander fired a threeround burst from the mm main armament all right he said drive on forward they went with a whine of protest from the overstrained engine a moving target was harder to hit and the panzer iis armor especially on the sides wouldnt keep out anything more than smallarms fire theo knew from experience what happened when something got through his crewmates didnt and he hoped like hell they didnt find out hed got away from his murdered first panzer in one piece too many guys werent so lucky if he never smelled that thick reek of burnt pork enemy panzers aheadtwo oclock witt shouted theos balls crawled up into his belly not that that would save them from what hed seen russian panzer gunners werent very good but they only had to be competent or even lucky once to slaughter a crew but then witt shouted again in glad surprise cancel that theyre oursczech machines no one but theo heard his own sigh of relief of course the wehrmacht had commandeered all the surviving czech panzers it could they were better than german panzer is and iis if not up to the standards of the new iiis and ivs but the new german panzers were still in short supply military administrators had got the skoda works up and running again turning out more of the czech models for the reich and if you were looking for the enemy youd see him whether he was there or not theo was happy witt hadnt opened up one of wars dirty little secrets that nobody liked to talk about was that you could kill friends as easily as foes friends could kill you too theyd be sorry afterwards not that that did you a hell of a lot of good there were russian panzers up ahead theo got the word on the radio and relayed it to witt then he heard the fearsome clang of a round from a cannon smashing through hardened steel it wasnt his panzer which was the only good thing he could say about it that crew would never be the same panzer halt the commander ordered halt it did he fired another threeround burst from the mm gun got the fucker he yelled drive on on they went theo tried to figure out what was happening from the endless stream of radio reports he heard they made up for not being able to see out everything seemed to be moving according to plan germans and poles stormed forward russians fell back or died germans and poles were dying too theo knew that but the radio didnt talk about it olonel borisov eyed the flyers in his squadron he coughed a couple of times like a man whod smoked too many cigarettes he probably had but that wasnt tobacco roughening his throat sergei yaroslavsky would have bet gold against pig turds it was embarrassment just a couple of weeks before borisov had been loudly certain this years fight against the nazis in poland would look the same as last years well not even a colonel was right all the time coughing once more borisov said the situation at the front has developed not necessarily to our advantage he sounded like radio moscow as it had when vladivostok fell the radio was doing its damnedest to make things sound better than they really were like the other sb pilots sergei had flown over the front hed done everything he could to slow down the germans the radio would have faced a bigger challenge had it tried to make things out to be worse than they were in certain places the nazis and their polish running dogs have penetrated our lines to some degree borisov went on our assignment is to help whip them back to their kennels so the red army can resumeexcuse me can continueits victorious offensive no one laughed in his face which proved disciplineor fear of the nkvd assuming the two werent one and the sameran deep from the sky you could see that the dark gray german tanks hadnt just penetrated the soviet line theyd torn through and were rampaging loose in the russians rear enemy infantry moved up with them and behind them to finish off the pockets they carved out groundcrew men are fueling and bombing up our planes borisov said we shall strike hard for the rodina we serve the soviet union we serve the soviet union the flyers echoed they left the big tent in which hed harangued them and hurried to their sbs sergei wondered whether hed be able to land at this airstrip when he came back from the bombing run the way the germans were moving it was almost in range of their guns one more thing to worry about does he truly believe what he says vladimir federov asked in a troubled whisper sergei would have whispered a question like that too he does while hes saying it anyhow he answered also quietly you cant contradict the party line off in the distancenot far enough in the distancegerman artillery rumbled it might have been distant thunder unfortunately it wasnt not on this bright sunny day no thunderheads in the sky only a few little white puffs federov jerked his head in the direction of the sound that contradicts the party line sergei didnt feel like arguing with him well well dispose of the contradictions then wont we he climbed into the cockpit sergeant kuchkov was already at his station in the bomb bay the chimp didnt worry about contradictions in the party line hed drop the bombs hed shoot at whatever tried to attack the sb hed get back to the airstrip and hed drink and swear and try to get laid he hadnt come down venereal yet but not from lack of effort nothing looked bad on the preflight checks the engines started up right away the familiar roar and vibration filled sergei groundcrew men pulled out the chocks in front of his wheels he taxied down the dirt runway and took off the heavily laden sb wasnt a hot performer but it flew it flew it hadnt flown far when antiaircraft guns opened up on it are the nazis this far east already federov shouted through the din nothese are our guns dammit sergei shouted back the stupid muzhiks down below see anything in the air they think it has to belong to the germans the germans had come farther east than they had on the last mission the sb had flown the day before fire and smoke did a good job of announcing where their panzers werewhere soviet forces were in trouble in other words and so did antiaircraft fire of a sort entirely different from what the red air force bombers had got a few minutes before when the nazis started shooting the shells burst all around the sbs every one of them seemed much too close one scored a direct hit on a bomber in front of sergei the last third of a wing parted company with the rest of the plane fire raced up the wing root toward the fuselage the sb lurched out of formation and tumbled downward sergei looked for parachutes but didnt see any bozhemoi behind the oxygen mask vladimir federovs face was white as milk theyre murdering us well we need to pay them back then sergei found what he was looking for nazi flags spread out on the ground both sides used their national emblems to keep from getting hit by their own aircraft but the recognition signals could also turn into targets sergei pointed through the cockpit glass there thats what we want all right no matter how shaken federov was he had a job to do and the sooner he does it the sooner we drop our bombs the sooner we can get the devil out of here sergei thought but before the bombaimer could line up the sb on the swastika flags far below a frantic shout dinned in sergeis earphones messerschmitts drop the bombs kuchkov sergei ordered at once right now theyd come down on somebodys head with luck on some germans he wanted the plane as light as he could make it he also didnt want machinegun bullets tearing into all those explosives that was asking to turn into a fireball in the sky bombs away the chimp yelled sending them earthward with some choice obscenities then he asked nazi cocksuckers jumping us da sergei said he still hadnt seen any s but one after another three sbs spun toward the ground two burning the other out of controlmaybe the pilot was already dead with the bombs gone he had no reason to stick around any more he had no desire to either he swung the bomber into as tight a turn as he could manage and gave it full throttle back toward the east a shot across his path he had two forwardfacing machine guns in the cockpit he squeezed off a long burst at the german plane he didnt hit it he hadnt really expected to he did want to warn it he was alert and ready to fight let it go after some sleepier pilot it must have worked kuchkov in the dorsal turret now didnt start shooting at anything and no bullets came ripping up through the bombers now empty belly sergei looked wildly around the sky some of the other sbs had also escaped one of them had a starboard engine that trailed smoke he hoped it would keep flying till it found the airstrip that was very bad federov seemed to be trying his best to stay calm or at least to seem calm sergei respected him for that you had to do it in combat showing how scared you were didnt do any good everybody was scared you had to keep going anyway if you didnt you only made getting yourself killed more likely sergei wondered whether stukas would have cratered the airstrip he didnt want to try to land on a highway or in the middle of a field of newplanted barley he didnt have to to his vast relief he taxied into a revetment groundcrew men covered the sb with camouflage netting in the gloom he reached out and set a hand on federovs shoulder we made it one more time we made it but how often can we keep getting away with it the copilot asked i know the plane used to be able to run away from fighters but not any more the idea is for us to hurt the enemy right not for him to shoot us down how many of our guys didnt come back today too many maybe some landed at other strips but too many any way you look at it sergei answered one of the planes that went down was colonel borisovs federov said the squadron commanders are you sure i didnt see that sergei wasnt sure what to think about it either borisov had too much apparatchik in him to get close to the men he led but he was a good administrator and a brave enough pilot he had been anyhow im positive federov said one more thing then sergei said wearily he unhooked his flying harness well lets go report to whoever we report to broad street station the conductor bawled as the train down from new york city slowed to a stop all out for broad street station philadelphia oh my god peggy druce dabbed at her eyes with a tissue she pulled from a purse she didnt need the fellow in the kepi yelling at her that gothic pile of brick granite and terra cotta couldnt be anything else it meant she was home she wouldnt have believed it but it was true more than a year and a half after she set out on what was going to be a month in europe here she was if i ever ever set one toe outside the borders of the us of a again somebody ought to whack me in the head with a twobyfour she thought shed almost been whacked with plenty of worse things in too many different places in europe people were getting up and heading for the door lucky for them too because she would have stepped on them if they werent moving the way she wanted to go a liner back to new york from london no sign of uboats for which she thanked god not the smoothest passage but not the choppiest either she was a good sailor she didnt lose any victuals almost all the clothes she brought back shed bought on the other side of the atlantic what shed brought with her hadnt been meant for staying away so long that interested the hell out of the american customs inspectors even after she explained what had happened to her backing everything up with the stamps and visas in her passportthey didnt want to listen all they wanted to do was collect duty and collect they did the nazis couldnt have been more inflexible but she wouldnt think about the goddamn nazis now after all shed crossed the atlantic so she wouldnt have to think about the nazis again or deal with their arrogance and so shed dealt with american arrogance at customs instead watch yo step maam a colored porter said as she descended he touched a callused finger to the shiny brim of his cap she nodded back at him she hadnt seen any negroes all the time she was in europe this chubby fellow was just one more reminder she was back where she belonged down three wooden steps and onto the platform husbands and wives boyfriends and girlfriends parents and children were all milling around and falling into one anothers arms they were hugging and squealing and kissing they were herb peggy let out a squeal of her own she might have been a bobbysoxer getting all excited about the latest skinny crooner from hoboken not a respectable woman of middle years running toward a prosperous gent in a gray pinstriped suit and a fedora whose band and brim told the world it wasnt quite the latest style peggy he squeezed the breath out of her he wasnt usually one for public displays but then she didnt usually get stuck in the middle of a world war he smelled of aftershave and american cigarettesgood smells familiar smells shed almost forgotten about in her crowded time overseas and he smelled of himself which was even better and even more familiar oh lord she said when they got done kissing out there in front of everyone like a couple of newlyweds i missed you so much well im not exactly sorry to see you back either sweetheart that sounded more like herb he might not have majored in understatement at villanova but he sure must have minored in it he took a pack of pall malls from a jacket pocket tapped one against the palm of his left hand and stuck it in his mouth as he was lighting it peggy said for gods sake give me one of those will you ive been smoking like a chimneyi mean like a steelmill chimney since i got back to new york what they use for tobacco in europe shouldnt happen to a dog here you go he lit it for her she smoked greedily she hadnt been kidding not even a little bit herb let her take a few puffs then he said come on lets rescue your suitcase and then well go home you have no ideai mean darling you have no ideahow good that sounds peggy charged toward the baggage car like a panzer on the attack thinking of it in that particular way told her she wasnt the same person she had been when shells started falling around marianske lazne herb tipped a redcap to carry the suitcase out to the packard when they got to the station door the man said suh this heres as far as im supposed to go without missing a step herb handed him another fat silver halfdollar i didnt hear a word you said did you hear anything peg who me she said the porters grin showed a mouthful of gold teeth he lugged the bag out to the car and waved when he trotted back toward the station philadelphia traffic took getting used to so did everything else about the city it didnt look shabby people in the street werent nervous or fearful or if they were it was from personal private concerns not because they worried that divebombers would scream down out of the sky and blow them into ground round there was so much in the shops gasoline was so cheap and so many cars used the roads you dont know how lucky we are peggy said a cop at a street corner was directing traffic that was all he was doing peggy pointed his way look he isnt asking people for their papers theyd spit in his eye if he did herb answered and who needs papers anyway unless youre going overseas i mean i was mighty glad to have my american passport oh jesus was i ever peggy said as for the rest of it though her husband had the straight goods if you lived in a free country why did you need anything that proved who you were wasnt your word good enough peggy pointed again almost at random no soldiers no uniforms not one except for the policeman well who needs em herb said she remembered germany where everybody this side of ragpickers put on an outfit that let him show off who he was and what he did and why everybody else should salute him and she wouldnt have been a bit surprised if the reich had mandated rank badges so people could tell a ragpicker first class from a lowly ragpicker second they lived not far from the main line on a street that had been lined with elms till dutch elm disease killed them they had more house than they needed most of the time herb parked the car in front of the place was he grayer than he had been the last time she saw him and was he wondering the same thing about her a year and a half lord you dont know how good it is to have you back he said you dont know how good it is to be back peggy said she leaned over and kissed him on the cheek you have no idea and count yourself lucky you dont maybe i do a little herb answered and left it right there peggy started to tell him he was talking through his hat she didnt do it though maybe making it to middle age meant she thought before opening her big trap sometimes anyhow herb had gone over there in hed seen combat peggy knew that much even after all these years she knew very little more whatever hed seen and done in france hed never talked about it once he came back to the states this was almost the first time hed suggested he might have run into an unpleasantness or three while working for uncle sam and so instead of laughing at him peggy said i could use a drinkand if you want to spell that with a u i dont mind motion seconded and passed by acclamation herb got out of the packard came around and opened the passenger door for her the suitcase stayed on the back seat peggy didnt need anything in it right away and nobody would steal it not in this eminently respectable neighborhood herb opened the front door he took half a step to one side so peggy could walk into the foyer ahead of him when she did she was greeted by shouts of surprise and welcome home and enough cheers for a sunday doubleheader at shibe park everybody shed ever met seemed to be crowding the house she rounded on her husband you did this she saidhalf accusation half delight darn right i did he answered you dont come back from a war every day im going to have that drink or maybe that drunk any which way peggy declared good ill help herb said briskly she did and so did he vaclav jezek put a helmet on a stick and cautiously raised it up above the level of the trench in which he crouched that was probably the oldest snipers trick in the world which didnt mean it didnt work the german lines were most of a kilometer away separated from his position by mines and barbed wire all the same a rifle shot rang out over there the helmet rang too like a bell he jerked it down it was a french model now it had a bullet hole a centimeter or two above the french crest soldered onto the front sergeant benjamin halevy eyed that precisely placed hole well you were right he said fucking nazis have a sniper of their own running around loose happy day vaclav said morosely ive done this before i dont want to do it again goddammit when a sniper annoyed the enemy enough he did his best to get rid of the annoyance vaclav had already won a couple of duels with a german sharpshooter now the landsers were back for another try they must have noticed when you murdered that mortar guy and the armored cars halevy said happy day the czech repeated even more gloomily than before the pile of dirt and ore and whatnot where the mortar crew had set up was behind the line now not in front of it clearing all the germans away from it had cost more lives than it was worth and the boys in fieldgray still had plenty more of those industrial hillocks to use as firing positions maybe a shell from a will blow that son of a bitch right out of his marching boots halevy said and then you wake up vaclav said fumbling in his tunic for a pack of gitanes he was wearing a french one the czech tunic hed had for so long had finally gone the way of all fabric the pockets werent in the right placesthey werent where his fingers automatically went anyhow once he had the cigarette going he added you can afford to be cheerful the bastard isnt trying to put one in your earhole he wouldnt turn me down if i did something stupid halevy said no but youd just be part of his job when two snipers tangle its personal vaclav said that made it worse as far as he was concerned when you shot whoever you saw in the enemys uniform it was war when you tried to kill one guy in particular it was something different something even older and more primitive halevy hit that nail on the head when he said fine once you plug this nazi cut his liver out and cook it itll probably be fat like a forcefed gooses heh vaclav said nervously the way the french got their nice fatty livers for pate made his stomach want to turn over the idea of eating a german liver on the other hand disgusted him less than he thought it should still hes probably some lousy feldwebel left over from the last war and tougher than shoe leather wouldnt be surprised halevy said long pig isnt any more kosher than regular pig either too bad it wouldnt stop you not the way you gobble down all the ham you can find jezek jabbed the jewish underofficer shrugged food is food when you get some you eat it you can be sorry afterwards im always sorry afterwards im usually sorry there wasnt more vaclav snorted before he could give halevy a hard time a young french officer came up to them and started jabbering away in his own language vaclav spread his hands he really didnt speak much french and feigning even more incomprehension kept him from having to do what eager young officers had in mind a couple of times that might have kept him from getting killed halevy could interpret of courseif he felt like admitting he understood french sometimes he did sometimes he didnt sergeants often mistrusted officers schemes and often had good reason but this fellow wouldnt be put off so easily wait he said in nasal german i was told you followed the boches tongue however much jezek wanted to deny it he didnt see how he could not without landing himself in more trouble ja he said resignedly was wollen sie mein herr i will tell you what i want the frenchman said we have found the spot from which the german colonel in charge of the regiment opposite us is in the habit of making reconnaissance he is a capable officer if you eliminate him very likely his replacement will be less so foie gras halevy remarked the french officer gave him a look that mingled annoyance and curiosity the jew did not explain in his boots vaclav wouldnt have explained either i must see the place sir and find a spot from which to shoot he told the officer his own german was rusty but it served aber naturlich the frenchman said come with me he started to straighten vaclav grabbed him before he could be careful for gods sake he said the nazis have their own sniper over there oh really is that so maybe the young officer was being ostentatiously brave then again maybe he was being ostentatiously stupid vaclav took no needless chances he wanted to live to get old and fat and lazy if he settled down here and married a frenchwoman that wouldnt be so bad even if it meant hed finally have to buckle down and learn the lousy language antitank rifle clunking against his back at every step he followed the officer down the trench he made sure he didnt show himself if the german marksman was watching through field glasses or a telescope he could recognize the rifles long thick barrel bettermuch betternot to let him do anything about it here is our lookout position the officer said after most of a kilometer vaclav lowered the rifle and kept walking the frenchman spluttered you are insubordinate he declared a word only an officer would bother learning auf deutsch no sir vaclav said stolidly as the frenchman trailed after him think the fritzes dont know where you look from maybe a sniper cant put one through your loophole there but i dont want to find out the hard way the officer grunted speaking german vaclav sounded as authoritative as he did speaking german anybody could sound authoritative that was one of the few things the language was good for with any luck at all the nazi with the scopesighted mauser would figure hed stopped at the observation post two or three hundred meters farther on he raised his helmet above the level of the parapet when no gunshot came his way he slowly lowered the helmet put it on again and peered across toward the german position now he said tell me where the german colonel looks from dont point or anything just tell me you know your business the officer said coming up beside him to look east he sounded surprised and more respectful than he had before im still breathing vaclav answered which covered everything that needed saying on that score do you see the burntout automobile a little to the right of the broken brick fence the frenchman asked his right arm twitched but he didnt point that is where the cochon does his reconnaissance vaclav did see it it was a long shot from here he wasnt sure of a kill but he had a chance sehr gut he said i will come back before sunup so i can get ready without the germans seeing me do it you will know what you require the french officer said stiffly he gave vaclav a jerky little nod then hopped off the firing step and down into the trench again the czech did know what he required by the time the eastern sky started getting light hed placed his rifle and covered most of the barrel with branches he tore from bushes his helmet was covered with leafy branches too held in place by a rubber strip hed cut from an old inner tube hed seen germans use that trick and he liked it well enough to steal once he was set he had nothing to do but wait wait he did and wait and wait some more he wanted a cigarette but he didnt smoke he didnt know if the enemy was watching this spot and he didnt want to do anything to draw his notice a couple of poilus near the lookout post shot at the german line they drew answering rifle and machinegun fire vaclav smiled if the germans got all hot and bothered by those fellows over there they werent worrying about him halfway through the morning he was bored he needed to take a leak he really wanted a cigarette he waited that was half the battle or more than half for snipers and he got his reward here came a fellow in a feldgrau greatcoat with an officers peaked cap on his head he stationed himself near that dead motorcar and began a leisurely examination of the allied position it seemed to vaclav that the german was looking straight at him when he pulled the trigger did the fellow see the muzzle flash did he just have time to realize what it was before the bullet hit him because it did hit himhe went down like a marionette when the puppeteer drops the strings as soon as vaclav saw that he ducked and scurried away the german sniper on the other side of the line would know hed scored again the bastard would want to meet him in a manner of speaking so many other things could kill or maim him too but he was still alive he might stay that way a while longer another miserable supper sarah goldmans mother was a good cook when you had so little to work with though what could you do pharaoh had ordered the children of israel to make bricks without straw hanna goldman faced the same problem thanks to the orders of germanys latterday pharaoh when root vegetables and turnip greens were all you could make when salt was your only flavoring you were licked after supper father turned on the radio he didnt usually bother any more whats up sarah asked i want to hear the news he answered good godwhy sarah exclaimed same old rubbish probably samuel goldman rolled a cigarette from newspaper and tobacco scrounged from dog ends it wasnt a professorial skill but he had it maybe hed picked it up in the trenches in the last war more likely hed acquired it since exchanging his university post for one in a labor gang jews got no tobacco ration of their own any more after he lit the nasty cigarette he went on i heard something interesting from somebody who said he heard it from someone you can trust i want to see if the regular broadcast covers it sarah had no trouble translating her fathers opaque phrases hed been talking with someone who listened to the bbc or possibly to radio paris that was of course against the law and the germans jammed enemy stations as hard as they could people tuned in to them anyhow the goldmans would have even if it was doubly risky for jews but with saul still on the run from what the nazis called justice it was ten times doubly risky for them if they got caught theyd go straight to a concentration camp and so they abstained treacly music came out of the radio set once it warmed up it was still ten minutes in front of the hour father shrugged and made a wry face i wish it were a classical program he said bach beethoven wagner sarah suggested his mouth twisted even tighter well maybe not mother came out of the kitchen to listen too they endured the music and the advertisements for things they werent allowed to buy most of which aryan germans couldnt really get their hands on these days either and the exhortations to turn in scrap metal and purchase war bonds at last the announcer said and now the news he paused importantly as if certain everyone was hanging on the sound of his voice he might not have been so far wrong either in the east the wehrmacht and the reich s polish allies continue to punish the jewbolshevik red army the asiatic hordes who follow the soviet red star cannot hope to stand against our brave welldisciplined troops hell have us in moscow in a couple of weeks father said dryly nothing much was happening in the west in what was happening there the front line was moving toward the german border not away from it unless you listened with an atlas in hand youd never know it from what the newsreader said by the way he made things sound panzers would roll through paris any minute nowmaybe even ahead of the ones rolling through moscow he claimed enormous numbers of english and french terror bombersthey were always terror bombersshot down the day before no alarms had sounded over munster had the other sides bombers not come here or was the newsreader making things up how could you tell you couldnt he went on to claim even more enormous numbers of russian terror bombers destroyed in the east and he gloated about the dreadful things german bombers were doing to military targetsonly to military targets of coursein london and paris and half a dozen russian cities some of which he had trouble pronouncing wasnt he trying to have things both ways it seemed so to sarah by her fathers ironic eyebrow it seemed so to him too the announcer also bragged about japanese raids in siberia and about the signing of a new germanswedish economic agreement thus we preserve swedens neutrality as we preserved denmarks and norways he declared he sounded perfectly serious about it fathers eyebrow quirked again anyhow then the fellow went on to condemn an economic agreement between france and the united states the enemy sought to drag america into their unjust warat least if you listened to him sarah thought her fathers eyebrow would jump right off his forehead it was only radio so she couldnt see the newsreaders face how could he possibly hold it straight but even if he was grinning he sounded as if he meant what he said i now turn to the occupied regions of bohemia and moravia he went on in portentous tones that was what german authorities were calling the conquered part of czechoslovakia the part that hadnt turned into the puppet state of slovakia despite all warnings jews in these regions have continued in their antigerman activities as a result of their vicious folly the fuhrer and the reichsfuhrer ss see that they have no choice but to implement appropriate countermeasures sarah and her father and mother all stared straight at the radio what did that mean whatever it meant it didnt sound good what had hitler and himmler come up with the newsreader proceeded to spell things out the jewish bacillus in the occupied territories of bohemia and moravia must be quarantined accordingly the fuhrer has ordered all jews in the aforementioned occupied territories to be transferred to the town of teriesenstadt where they may be concentrated observed and guarded against personnel under the command of the reichsfuhrer ss will facilitate the transfer and supervise the just distribution of any property abandoned in the process fathers eyebrow didnt quirk this time both brows came down and together in a frown that might have suited joves awesome visage its a ghetto thats what it is he said heavily a hundred years after we got out of them theyre shoving us back in again western civilization he made the words into a curse he talked about abandoned property mother added what do they give the jews one suitcase apiece or maybe just the clothes on their backs father said how many jews in czechoslovakia sarah asked her mother and father looked at each other she shrugged he spread his hands not as many as there are in polandthats all i can tell you for sure he said the ones there are lucky their government is on the nazis side or theyd get the same or worse some luck sarah said it is father insisted poland has millions of jewsi know that ive never had much use for ostjuden sometimes they seem almost as backward and barbarous to me as they do to hitler theyd sooner pray than think if you know what i mean but when push comes to shove theyre my people the nazis have said so all along and theyve finally convinced me theyre right what can we do to help the czech jews sarah asked her father spread his hands again nothing i can think of not unless you want the ss visiting us again we can hope the germans dont decide to throw us into ghettos too he hesitated when he spoke again he sounded surprised at himself we can pray they dont decide to do that i always thought the ostjuden prayed too much could it be we dont pray enough hearing that from such a secular man as father told sarah more clearly than anything else how much the times had changed s a welshman alistair walsh did not have a high opinion of eastern scotland the terrain was low and flat and full of scots dundee couldnt have been duller if it rehearsed walsh said so in several pubs he couldnt even get into a good fight too many of the other soldiers stranded in those parts agreed with him but all things considered he could have been worse off the germans might have sunk the ship that plucked him out of namsos he might not have got out in which case he would be languishing inside barbed wire in a pow camp yes there were all kinds of interesting and unpleasant possibilities and he was on leave while the great military bureaucracy tried to figure out what to do with him and his fellow survivors he tried to pick up barmaids the scots girls were pretty but they seemed depressingly chaste he hired a bicycle and rode out into the countryside going someplace where no one was trying to kill you or even give you orders had its points the only thing better than traveling in a place like this by himself would have been traveling in the company of a friendly young lady since he wasnt having much luck on that score he went alone soldiers he saw too often anyhow getting away from them was more fun than going out with them would have been hed had almost two decades of peacetime service between the wars a year and a half of the genuine article was enoughno far more than enoughto make all that seem to belong to another and very distant lifetime the hired bicycle creaked and squeaked under him he didnt care all he heard except for the bike were the wind an occasional crows caw and the even more occasional rattle of a passing auto not many motorcars were on the roads not with petrol so savagely rationed his ears drank in the quiet you didnt realize how badly war abused them till you got away from the racket of gunfire and explosions for a while he suspected hed be deaf as a stump when he got older the prospect bothered him less than it might have the way things were going living long enough to grow old and deaf didnt seem half bad a farmer out in the middle of an emerald field of newsprouted barley waved to walsh as he pedaled past cautiouslyhe hadnt been on a bicycle in a while and the road was bumpythe sergeant lifted a hand from the handlebars and waved back he rode on another farmer came up the road perched on a wagon pulled by two mismatched horses did he have a motorcar he couldnt drive because he couldnt get fuel for it walsh wouldnt have been surprised you made do with what you had hed seen as much on the continent he wasnt surprised to see it in britain too this time he waved first the farmer gravely returned the courtesy when walsh first heard the buzz of airplane engines he thought his ears were ringing because they werent used to so much silence all around before long though he decided the sound was real then for a few seconds he believed it was coming from an raf plane but that wasnt right either the engines sounded a different note one that made the short hair at the nape of his neck prickle up bugger me blind if thats not a german he muttered as he pulled to a stop on the grass at the edge of the road he peered up at the sky shielding his eyes against the sun what the bleeding hell is fritz doing here a bombing raid on dundee from norway a daylight bombing raid was fritz that stupid walsh didnt think so and the noise in the sky didnt sound like squadron after squadron of bombers one plane was up there no more walshs ears had been abused but he was sure of that then he spotted it he recognized it right away german planes mostly had sharper angles than their raf counterparts this one was a walsh had no doubt hed been strafed several times by the twoengined fighters roaring along at just above treetop height this bf flew quite a bit higher but its shape was unmistakable he scratched his head he wasnt lousy any morethat was something but why on earth would a lone fly over scotland had some nazi pilot poured down too much schnapps and taken off on a bet or full of drunken bravado that was madness but so was everything else walsh could think of then the madness got even crazier a parachute popped open whoeverd been flying that plane was coming to earth apart from it why in the name of heaven walsh didnt think anything was wrong with the airplane even after the fellow inside bailed out the flew on as if nothing had happened the engine note never changed it hadnt changed before the flyer hit the silk either walsh got a crick in his neck the descending chute was almost overhead walsh started to duck imagining himself getting clopped by the germans boots but the breeze carried the fellow a few hundred yards into the field through which the road ran walsh trotted toward him hed closed about half the gap before he wondered how smart he was german pilots commonly carried pistols while he was unarmed but he was in his own country for christs sake the german would have to be daft to plug him of course the german had to be daft to come here like this in the first place so what did that prove hands up walsh yelled hande hoch he spoke little german but most british soldiers learned that one the flyer had a knife he used it to cut himself free of the parachute shrouds the canopy tumbled off across the field the man slowly got to his feet he favored one ankle a little walsh shouted at him again with a smile he let the knife drop to the ground and raised his hands he was in his midfortiesvery old for a pilotwith bushy black eyebrows and a chin that stuck out he looked oddly familiar do not fear me he said in good english i come in peace in a messerschmitt sure you do mate walsh retorted i am rudolf hess the man said and damned if he wasnt no wonder he looked familiar in how many photographs had walsh seen him at hitlers elbow half the time his hand would be upraised in the stupid nazi salute to save his hide walsh couldnt remember exactly what hess title was he was one of the biggest of the party big shots though so what the bleeding hell was he doing in the middle of a scottish field still wearing a parachute harness walsh asked him in lieu of standing there with his mouth hanging open like a stupid clot i am come to confer with your government hess answered as if it were the most obvious thing in the world maybe he saw that walsh wondered whether he was out of his skull because he added unofficially of course oh of course walsh said confer about what he guessed hess would tell him it was none of his damned business but hess didnt why about ways to end this unfortunate war between germany and england and france naturlich naturlich walsh echoed in a hollow voice you could start by telling your soldiers to quit trying to kill me this i wish to do we waste our time fighting one another hess said seriously better we should all fight the russians together so i feel so feels the fuhrer also all of a sudden walsh stopped wondering if hess was a nutter the staff sergeant had no idea whether neville chamberlains government would make a deal like that or whether france would go along if it did but the government might it might the breeze felt chillieror did the cold come from inside him he had to force words out one by one id better take you back into dundee danke schon this would be good hess said back they went it was several miles they took turns walking and riding slowly on the bicycle hess spewed out a million reasons why england and france should turn on the bolsheviks at last walsh got sick of listening he said look pal im only a bloody sergeant i cant do anything about it one way or the other the german subsided into wounded silence when they got into dundee walsh had a devil of a time convincing his superiors that rudolf hess was rudolf hess they were even more certain than he had been that hess wasnt about to arrive in scotland by jumping out of a bf then they did believe him and that might have been worse because they started having kittens right before his eyes they whisked hess away in a swarm of military policemen you will forget about this a captain barked at walsh it never happened you have no knowledge of it do you understand me yes sir walsh judged that was the only possible answer that would keep him out of a military jail the bloke who said a little knowledge was a dangerous thing knew what he was talking about to show he understood what the captain meant walsh added i wont tell a soul youd better not the captain sent walsh a hard look as if wondering whether to jug him like a hare on general principles walsh tried to exude innocence not easy for a man of his age and experience after a long long pause the captain jerked a thumb toward the door get out walsh had never been so happy to obey an order in his life julius lemp was used to getting strange orders from his superiors and even to attracting them he was still paying for sinking the athenia chances were hed go on paying for the rest of his career unless he did something wonderful enough to cancel out the screwup offhand he couldnt think what that might be finding jesus walking barefoot across the swells of the north sea might do it anything short of that no when you were in the uboat business strange orders were liable to get you killed so were ordinary orders it was that kind of trade but with strange orders your odds were worse if that bothered his superiors in the kriegsmarine they went out of their way not to show it and so the u cruised slowly through the chop off the east coast of scotland not very far off the scottish coast either land was clearly visible to the west one of the ratings on the conning tower with lemp said if theyve got a on the beach they can hit us with it we can hit em back with the on deck too i know lemp replied but even if they do have a there chances are they wont shoot with it theyre bound to think were one of their own uboats not a german machine no german boat would be mad enough to show itself so close to their coast sure skipper the rating said as if humoring a lunatic so what the hell are we doing here we are carrying out our orders lemp said which was literally true we are searching for any signs of wreckage or survivors from a messerschmitt that may or may not have gone into the north sea in these waters sure the rating said again but why martin you never ask that question lemp answered patiently because they told us to thats why martin only sniffed the hell of it was lemp had a hard time blaming him he wondered why they were looking for bits and pieces of a bf too however much he wondered he didnt know the hardfaced captain back in kiel hadnt looked the sort who was much inclined to answer questions in fact hed looked the sort who would bite your head off if you had the nerve to ask any sometimes the best thing you could do was salute go zu befehl and get the hell out of there lemp had judged that to be one of those times had he been wrong if the royal navy or the raf decided the u wasnt an english uboat the enemy owned all the advantages here cruising along in broad daylight was all very well audace audace toujours laudace the french said well yes but when the fellows on the other team trumped all that audacity with depth charges he scanned the graygreen sea this close to the coast all sorts of rubbish floated in it he hadnt seen anything from a german fighter plane though he wondered if some important officers son had been flying the that might account for a search like this he couldnt think of much else that would one of the things floating in the north sea was a basket of the kind and size that might have held a baby martin said sir with all this shit around how are we supposed to recognize stuff from a even if we do come across it weve got to do the best we can lemp answered by which he meant he didnt have the faintest idea martin unfortunately understood him much too well right the rating said and scratched the side of his jaw gingery stubble sprouted there lemp didnt shave when he was at sea either like a lot of uboat men from the lowliest lordsordinary seamento skippers he trimmed his whiskers when he got back into port what do they do when we send them the message that we cant find what theyre looking for another rating asked we dont send it now lemps voice grew sharp were ordered to maintain radio silence throughout this cruise i will make the report orally when we return to kiel have you got that yes skipper sorry the rating said lemp didnt usually come down hard on his men but he had to be sure no one fouled up here somebodys head would roll if the u broke radio silence he knew whose too his like the rest of the men on the uboat he wished he knew what was going on he didnt like getting sent out on wildgoose chases he especially didnt like it when he had to wear a blindfold while hunting his wild geese all of which had nothing to do with anything theyd given him his orders he was following them if he found no wreckageor even if he didhe was to return to kiel after four days of searching it made no sense not to him or to the men he commanded maybe that was because the officers set over them knew more about what was going on than they did or maybe the geese had got uncommonly wild lately the uboat performed the ordered search it found nothing from a bf for that matter it found nothing from any airplane lemp wasnt sorry to order the boat away from the scottish coast he counted himself lucky not to have been spotted the royal navy must not have believed the kriegsmarine would give any of its boats such an idiotic assignment well he wouldnt have believed it himself if he hadnt got stuck with it no english planes happened on the u as it hurried back across the north sea the farther lemp put the british isles behind him the happier he grew he was downright delighted when the boat got back to kiel but his pleasure chilled when armed guards on the pier kept anyone but him from going ashore we have our orders said the chief petty officer in charge of the detachment that was a sentence unchallengeable in any branch of any military service the world around more sailors with mausers escorted lemp to the office where he was to make his report he wasnt astonished to find rear admiral donitz there waiting to hear him whatever was going on it was going on at levels far over his head he came to attention and saluted reporting as ordered sir my news is very simple we saw nothing and found nothing very well donitz said that makes it more likely the reached england then scotland i should say sir did you want it to do that lemp asked the admiral looked through him dont worry about it lieutenant in his mouth lemps rank might as well not have existed a word from him and lemps rank wouldnt exist yes sir lemp said but you cant wonder if im a little curious everyone on my boat is a little curious or more than a little it has to do with high policy you can tell them that much donitz answered and you can tell them not to push it not if they know whats good for them his eyes were grayblue and at the moment frigid as the north sea in february the same goes for you lemp could take a hint i understand sir he said quickly i doubt that the scheme surprised me when i heard about it donitz said if it works everything changes and if it doesnt weve lost very little what was that supposed to mean one more quick look at donitzs face discouraged lemp from asking he saluted again then he asked may my men go ashore for liberty now after you let them know theyd better keep their mouths shut the admiral said anyone who makes a mistake will regret it is that clear yes sir lemp said clear as mud he thought maybe events would answer his questions for him one of these days or he might spend the rest of his life wondering you never could tell chaim weinberg believe his eyes was he really seeing this damned if he wasnt half a dozen french tanks clanked up to the stretch of line the abe lincoln battalion was holding outside of madrid these werent slow ancient renaultsleftovers from the last war they were brandnew somua ss the best medium tanks the french made the spanish republic had got a fewonly a fewin chaim didnt know france had turned any loose since but here they were painted a pale grayish green that put him in mind of olive leaves it was a good color for operating in spain it would be even better once they got dusty and dirty the italians and spaniards painted theirs khaki the german tanks of the legion kondor were mostly dark gray which made them stand out more that mattered only so much if you couldnt stop them so what if you saw them coming he wasnt the only guy who got a charge out of seeing thesenowhere near and he wasnt the only guy who could see what they meant the abe lincoln battalion like the international brigades generally was full of people who found politics a game more exciting than baseball bridge or chess were going to knock sanjurjos cocksuckers into the middle of next week somebody said gleefully the froggies mustve decided hitler aint gonna do em in so they can turn loose of some of their toys about fuckin time aint it chaim said been a year now since the big german push fell short they woulda given us these babies back then we coulda started cleaning out the nationalists that much sooner piss and moan piss and moan the other abe lincoln said weve got em now thatll do it maybe it would each tank had the republics flaghorizontal stripes of red yellow and purplepainted on the side of the turret the crewmen were spaniards they all seemed as enthusiastic as the men from the international brigades they knew what the tanks meant in a word victory so it seemed to chaim anyhow the next interesting question was could victory and manana coexist the abe lincolns were wild to hit the nationalists in front of them as soon as the tanks arrived the attack was orderedbut nobody bothered to tell the artillery which stayed quiet even with tanks you couldnt go forward without artillery support well you could but they didnt things got pushed back a day then one of the tanks broke down and the driver to another caught influenza which spread to the rest of his crew the next day to two other crews the day after that and to the abraham lincolns the day after that germ warfare an international said dolefully in between sneezes the fucking nationalists are trying to make us too sick to fight if they were they made a good job of it chaim lay flat on his back weak as a kitten with aches and fever for five days and felt as if one of the fancy french tanks had run over him for a week after that the tanks meanwhile sat out in the open no one seemed to wonder whether the nationalists were watching at last everything was ready again the attack was scheduled for the artillery barrage was scheduled for it actually started at by spanish standards that was a masterpiece of punctuality at on the dot the tanks rumbled forward the abe lincolns trotted along with them nothing like putting all those tonnes of hardened steel between yourself and the other fellows machine guns chaim loped with his buddies he wasnt a hundred percent yet despite enough aspirins to make his ears ring he wished he were still in bedwith luck with la martellita but even alone would do but hed improved to the point where he could carry a rifle without falling over he went forward plenty of other americansand the foreigners and spaniards who filled out the battalionwere in no better shape one of the fancy french machines stopped so the commander who doubled as the gunner could blast a machinegun nest to ruin which he did but while he was doing it a nationalist soldier popped up out of a foxhole next to the tank and chucked a wine bottle filled with blazing gasoline through the open hatch flames greasy black smoke and screams rose from inside the tank the republicans shot the brave nationalist but the damage was done fuck chaim said eyeing the pyre the tank had become the republicans had invented the infantrymans antitank weapon the nationalists had christened it the molotov cocktail now both sides used it so did foot soldiers everywhere who had to fight tanks without antitank guns another nationalist threw a molotov cocktail at the back of a somua s flaming gasoline dripped down through the louvers over the engine before long the engine started burning too the crew got out but that tank wouldnt go anywhere ever again assholes an american near chaim said dont they know how expensive those goddamn things are i wonder how the republic is paying for them chaim said ious the other abe lincoln said they both laughed the spanish republic might not have thought it was so funny spains gold reserves had gone to the ussr for safekeeping and to pay for soviet aid in the dark days when no one else thought the republic was worth helping would that gold ever return from moscow chaim might be a loyalif talkative even argumentativemarxistleninist but he wasnt holding his breath whang that was a big shell hitting and devastating a tank the machine brewed up at once you could kill tanks with artillery but most antitank guns were of smaller caliber than the monster that fired that round the germans made an mm antiaircraft gun being germans and thorough they also made an armorpiercing shell for it chaim would have bet that was what had put paid to the french tank and another round from the same gun whatever the hell it was blew the turret clean off another s its like the bastard tipped its hat when it got hit by that one chaim said it wasnt a bad joke as long as you didnt happen to be inside the turret when the big shell hit if you did you were too dead to appreciate the wit you were in fact scorched raspberry jam the last two surviving tanks decided they wanted to go on surviving they wheeled around almost in their own length and hightailed it for the rear one tank used the thick black smoke rising from another that had been killed as a smoke screen for its own getaway chaim had trouble blaming the crews though he knew people in positions of authority might have no trouble at all going forward into certain death was a losing proposition and what about going forward into likely death his mind gibed advancing without armor support sure made death more likely his own death for instance not surprisingly the republican attack bogged down chaim wasnt the only abe lincoln who could see that sanjurjos soldiers would slaughter them if they banged their heads against a stone wall without tanks to smash it down theyd gained a few hundred meters before things went south okay fine chaim pulled a fancy entrenching tool off his belt some italian whod taken mussolinis orders would never need it again and started improving the hole in the ground in which he huddled dirt flew from more holes and bits of shattered trench as other members of the battalion imitated him or more likely he was imitating others he doubted he was the first one whod decided the abraham lincolns had gone about as far as they could go you didnt need to belong to the german general staff to figure it out no more tanks equaled no more advance if that wasnt one of euclids axioms it should have been now would the nationalists counterattack not right away anyhow they might have feared the tanks would come back or more would show up chaim knew better but he wasnt about to tell them he kept on digging hed spent a lot of time in foxholes if you worked at it you could make them nearly bearable work he did corporal baatz glowered at willi dernen let me see that paper one more time he said suspiciously sure willi handed it over did awful arno think he could have forged a certificate of leave he might have if hed thought he could get away with it but he hadnt this one was legitimate could baatz make the same proud claim still unhappy the underofficer handed it back if youre even one minute late returning to duty your ass is mine he declared sure corporal willi repeated he would have said anything to get awful arno out of his hair can i go now yeah go on get out baatz wasnt about to do anything so bourgeoisso humanas to wish him a good time that wasnt his style why one of his own men hadnt shot him why havent i shot him willi wondered easy to do in combat i probably wouldntve got caught all he wanted to do now was get away from baatz get away from the war he gave his mauser and grenades to the feldwebel in charge of the companys weaponry the senior noncom told him to have fun on leave they werent all shitheads some of them sure were though out of the line away from awful arno then the chain dogs were on him so landsers called military policemen because of the metal gorgets they hung around their necks once more his papers passed muster the kettenhunde never cracked a smile but they waved him on antiaircraft guns stuck their snouts into the sky around the train station the stationmaster was also a feldwebel and at a guess a veteran of the last war whod been called up to help run the military trains willi showed him the leave papers all right son the gray noncom said where do you want to go breslau thats where im from willi answered homesickness long swallowed welled up inside all the way over on the other side of the reich thought so by the way you talk by his own musical halfscandinavian drawl the feld came from schleswigholstein up near the danish border he puffed on a pipe and nodded to himself well we can do that and he did along with the leave permit which he returned he gave willi a roundtrip ticket to breslau do i have to pay anything willi asked the feldwebel looked affronted dont be silly youre in the service of the reich if we cant take care of our own what are we good for luxurious that care wasnt willis seat was hard and the car packed with soldiers getting away from action for a while the stink of so many bodies that hadnt washed lately would have bothered willi had he noticed it he fell asleep almost as soon as the train started rolling the hard seat and crowding bothered him no more than the thick fug hed slept in plenty of worse places nor was his the only snore rising to the low ceilingfar from it when he woke he was back inside germany the train was rolling through countryside that hadnt been bombed or shelled it looked abnormal to willi hed been at or near the front too goddamn long he wanted to say something to somebody about it but he had no friends sitting close by half a dozen soldiers in the car were still sawing wood too he kept his mouth shut it wasnt as if he didnt have practice when awful arno ordered you around biting your tongue became a matter of selfpreservation a few of the towns through which the train rolled showed bomb damage the locals probably thought theyd survived disaster they didnt know how lucky they were if they stayed lucky they wouldnt find out more chain dogs came through the cars at a stop checking peoples papers willi showed his without hesitation why not they were good farther back in his car the military policemen caught somebody whose papers werent good or who didnt have any they dragged the poor bastard away i can explain he kept saying if he couldnt hed landed in more trouble than he knew what to do with willi had zwieback and a tube of butter in his pockets hoping the dining car would give him something better he made his way to it the stew was cabbage potatoes and tripe rubbery enough to use as a tire retread the coffee was german ersatz not spoils taken from french houses it tasted bad and had next to no kick all things considered butter smeared on crackers might have been better because the train traveled slowly and made many stops he took almost a day to cross the country and get to breslau people got on and off some of them were civilians some of the civilians were women hearing women talking in a language he could understand was a treat hed forgotten breslau was a city of bridges set right in the middle of the silesian plain it was also a city of many smokes there was coal nearby and iron so factories worked round the clock and it was a city of many jews willi had known that before but he hadnt thought about it one way or the other riding the streetcar out to his folks block of flats he got his nose rubbed in it the yellow stars on the clothes of people on the street leaped out at him no yellow stars on the streetcar passengers though public transport was for aryans only no one sat near him people stood up instead as far away as they could he realized he really could use a bath he was a little embarrassed but only a little if they couldnt figure out he was just back from the front too bad even if he was ripe his mother squealed and almost squeezed the breath out of him when he knocked on the door why didnt you wire that you were coming she demanded i thought id surprise you he said think you didnt think but klara dernen didnt sound angry now where am i going to get my hands on a nice fat hen she winked there are ways that dont cost ration points magda owes me if shes got one or knows where to get one sure mutti willi said you could always find a way around rules you didnt like whatever they happened to be hed seen that a hot bath when was the last time hed had one he couldnt remember it had been a while though he put on civilian clothes when he got out of the tub the pants were too big through the waist but all his shirts felt tight at the shoulders he was in better shape than he had been before the wehrmacht got him his younger sister eva and his kid brother markus both squealed when they got home from school they told him about russian air raids and running for the cellar thats just like fighting huh markus said pretty much willi left if there markus was only thirteen the war would be overthe war had better be overby the time he got old enough to fight sure enough mother got her fat hen shed make a better chicken stew than the thumbfingered soldiers who cooked in the field it filled the flat with a savory smell father came home not long before the stew was ready herbert dernen worked in a factory that had made clocks before the war and was turning out gauges and dials for panzers and planes these days hed fought in france in the last war after a long measuring look at willi he slowly nodded at whatever he saw well son now you know was all he said and it seemed more than enough now i know willi agreed no they needed not another word on that score father understood so did other men of his generation and other soldiers on leave willi couldnt find anyone else in breslau who did he felt like a stranger or maybe even a martian in his home town that didnt stop him from seeingand kissing and doing his best to feel upthe girls hed been friendly with before conscription called but they were either like his brother and thought they knew all about war because some bombs had fallen here or they wanted him to explain what the fighting in france was like and he couldnt if you hadnt done it youd never get it in that it was more like screwing than anything else he said so once he thought it would get his face slapped instead it got him laid even afterwards though he couldnt tell sweet susanna what shooting and being shot at and getting shelled and bombed were like they werent like anything he couldnt tell her about the camaraderie either not in any way that would make sense to her but when his leave was up a big part of him was glad or at least relieved to head west once more he was a real forsure frontschwein all right god help me he thought but it was true uc harcourt had just found a good place to crap when the sniper got him it really was perfect the bushes screened him from sightor hed thought so anyhow and the leaves were young and soft and green this side of a gooses neck you couldnt get a better substitute for paper he dug a little hole with his entrenching tool he undid his belt dropped his pants and squatted the shot rang out aiii he howled and sprang straight up if the olympics had a record for a high jump from a squatting position he broke it by thirty centimeters at the same time he clapped a hand to the wounded part it came away bloody sure as hell hed got shot in the ass trousers still at half mast he rolled behind a big thick elm bullets could penetrate an amazing amount of wood but he didnt worry about that all he wanted was to keep the lousy boche from seeing him any more besides that last bullet had penetrated him he pulled up the khaki trousers he didnt bother with the belt holding the pants up with one hand he hobbled back to the encampment hed never tried walking with a wounded gluteus maximus before it wasnt one of the experiences you sought out for the sake of having it lieutenant demange greeted him with the sympathy hed come to expect the hells the matter with you you look like you just tried to hump a donkey only the donkey didnt like it wordlessly luc turned around to display the bloody seat of his pants demange didnt care if youre on the rag couldnt you find a pad fuck you luc snarled enough was too much thats fuck you sir demange said easily all right go on back and have somebody patch you up welcome to the club if its worth anything to you a german had shot him in not a goddamn thing luc made his slow way back to the aid station a male nurse who smelled of garlic and cologne gave him a shot of novocaine and a tetanus shot then sutured the wound and bandaged him its only a crease not throughandthrough the fellow said you can go back to your unit theyd skin me alive if i wasted a cot on you thanks one hell of a lot said luc whod hoped for some leave what do i do when the numbing wears off itll hurt even worse then on account of the stitches plainly the male nurse was about to say it wasnt his problem whatever he saw on lucs face made him think twice instead he handed over a vial of white pills codeine he said it wont make things stop hurting you understand but it can take the edge off and it constipates you you wont need to go into the bushes so often for a while oh hurrah luc said in distinctly hollow tones then he asked you have any pants around here that arent all bloody if he waited for the quartermasters to issue him a new pair hed keep wearing these for god knew how long but if he could manage things informally sure as hell the nurse said some poor con stopped one with his face i dont know why they bothered bringing him back he wasnt breathing by the time he got herei know that the dead man had bled a little on his trousers but nowhere near so much as luc had on his the pants were loose and too long but a belt and some sewing would fix that the people at the aid station or maybe the stretcherbearers had already emptied the poor guys pockets no surprise there theyd missed an aluminumbronze franc luc added the inheritance to his small store of cash when he got back lieutenant demange said fucking took you long enough i thought they were cutting off your cheek like the old lady in that story luc had run across candide he was surprised demange had the veteran seemed unlikely to read anything that didnt have photos of naked girls in it you never could tell so youll sleep on your stomach for a while eh demange went on i guess luc answered got any other good news for me or are you through well i was gonna have you lead a raid on the boches tonight demange raised an eyebrow to see how that went over luc looked back at him without expression he didnt jump up and down and yell and scream the way demange obviously wanted him to the older man made a disgusted noise ah fuck off youre no goddamn fun poke somebody youve never nailed before if you want to watch him pitch a fit in the meantime let me bum a butt off you what you get your own shot off then you want a replacement but demange pulled the everpresent pack of gitanes out of his tunic pocket and handed luc one in due course the novocaine wore off when it did the wound started hurting worse than it had when luc first got it the spot where he got the tetanus shot was sore too and it made him feel feverish he took two codeine pills then two more instead of leaving him sleepy and dopey they made him feel as if hed just had four cups of strong coffee he wanted to do something even if he couldnt figure out what the germans solved that they pulled a trench raid of their own a couple of hundred meters off to the left of lucs position he ran to the hotchkiss gun and fired off strip after strip of ammo at the boches as they fought and as they retreated joinville couldnt feed the machine gun fast enough to suit him the pieces cooling fins glowed a dull red but it was a reliable piece of machinery no matter how hot it got it kept working luc stayed awake all through the night when the sun came up the next morning he saw five dead germans not far in front of the french lines the regimental commander was a lieutenant colonel named jacques soupault he had a mean skinny face a hairline mustache and greasy black hair combed straight back his eyes were black and cold as a corpses all that notwithstanding he folded luc into an embrace brushed cheeks with him and made him a sergeant on the spot without your promptness the enemy attack might well have succeeded he said prisoners we took couldnt talk about anything but that damned machine gun at least three men called it the same thing by then luc was desperately tired hed already taken more codeine to try to keep himself going and to ease the pain in his backside thank you sir he muttered hoping soupault would dry up and blow away the drug wasnt hitting him so hard this time at last the officer left lieutenant demange grinned at luc see you should get shot more often youre trying to make me lose my temper again luc said take another crack at it after i grab some sleep yeah you were bouncing off the walls all right demange said i dunno what kind of dope the doc gave you but whatever it was i want some too wasnt even a doc only a nurse luc replied she have big jugs at least he needed a shave boy you had all the luck yesterday didnt you except for the dope i mean yeah except for the dope luc yawned i am going to sleep why not im a sergeant nowsoupault said so what else do sergeants do now youre trying to get a rise out of me demange said accurately id make you sorry but you did a good job last night even if you had some help from the pills when was the last time demange had said something like that to him when was the last time demange had said something like that to anybody the veteran was far quicker to show scorn than praise since you are a sergeant you may have to give up your precious gun demange said you can tell more people what to do now dont want to luc yawned again wider i have a slot i like im good at it too so why would they take it away because youre lucky thats why thats how you get promoted do something cute while the officers are watching go on curl up somewhere they wont yank you off the piece till you wake up the way i feel right now thatll give me another month at least luc headed off to find somewhere he could rest lieutenant demanges laughter followed him a sergeant he wouldnt just have to shorten his new trousers eventually hed get a yellow hash mark to replace the two brown ones he wore now more work with needle and thread after i sleep he told himself ive earned it somethings cooking herman szulc declared pete mcgill warily eyed his fellow marine he had to get along with szulc the number of americansand of leathernecks in particularin shanghai was too low to let what you thought about somebody show too much but pete hadnt liked him or trusted him since he tried to say vera was out for what she could get and that she hadnt really fallen in love the way mcgill had you bet somethings cooking max weinstein said the proletariat is rising up against its imperialist oppressors how you could be a pinko and a marine at the same time was beyond pete but max managed pete didnt know how good a pinko he was but he made a damn good marine even if he drove other people nuts sometimes thank you josef stalin szulc said weinstein flipped him the bird ignoring it szulc went on nah what i heard was that the chinamen were gonna make things hot for the japs here in shanghai thats what i told you max pointed out whoever said polacks were dumb knew what he was talking about same guy who said sheenies were cheap i bet szulc said which shut max up with a snap into the sudden silence szulc continued what people are sweating about is the chinksre gonna give white people the most grief see if they can get us or england or france mad enough to jump on japan you think thats true pete asked interested in spite of himself all i know is what i read in the newspapers herman szulc was about as far removed from will rogers as a human being could be and none of this was in the shanghai papers whether in chinese english french german russian or japanese japan censored everything editors crossed the military government at their peril for public consumption everything in shanghai was just fine max tried again i believe it were the ones who cause trouble around here so were the ones the oppressed proletariats gonna go for only stands to reason were the ones white men are the ones szulc said incredulously how about all the slantyeyed shitheads who bow down to hirohito theyre only imitating what the europeans and americans taught em weinstein answered we cause trouble how about vaccination how about newspapers pete said i think the first one was discovered here i know goddamn well printing got invented here max returned pete couldnt have said whether that was true or not max would bluff when he talked the same way youd bluff playing poker do it every so often and it helped your game do it too much and you looked like an asshole but pete had more cards to play chinks didnt invent steamboats or railroads or cars or movies or phones or planes or the stuff that goes with em they didnt invent your commie bullshit either whatshisnamegroucho marxdid karl for chrissake that crack genuinely pained max where the rest rolled off his back his ears turned pink thinking about marx pete found that funny the jewish marine went on the chinese proletariat has the sense to see what a good thing marxismleninism iswhich is more than i can say for a couple of dumbfuck leathernecks more than a couple youre about the only red marine god ever made pete said what are you doing in the corps anyway boring from within is that what they call it hes boring all right herman szulc said they looked at each other in surprisethey werent used to agreeing two days later the chinese bombed a movie theater full of japanese soldiers maybe the chinese had invented gunpowder but a swede came up with dynamitepete did happen to know that as for who first found the idea of taking swarms of hostages and slaughtering them well it had to be as old as the hills the japs were good at it though the flat cracks from firing squads rifles went on day and night soldiers didnt just kill with rifles either they used swords and shovels and picks and iron bars and whatever else they could get their hands on people who knew about the rape of nanking a few years earlier said this wasnt so bad as that but it sure wasnt good wailing and moaning and shrieking from the chinese who made up the vast majority of the people in shanghai filled the air everything at the american consulate went straight to the devil it didnt pass go it didnt collect two hundred dollars mex all the cooks and maids and laundry men and sweepers stayed home you couldnt blame them not when they were liable to get murdered if they were dumb enough to show their faces on the street you didnt have to be chinese to buy a plot either a japanese soldier bashed in two french businessmens brains with a spade and broke three ribs on another frenchman before his friends could drag him off the way pete heard the story the friends didnt try very hard to stop him he believed it that sounded like the japs he thought he knew and didnt love so now whatll happen pooch puccinelli wondered out loud the japanese government gonna pay france an indemnity like they did with us after they blew up the fuckin panay thatll make the dead guys happy all right fuckin a it will pete said he didnt give a rats ass about a couple of frenchmen he was worried about vera he hadnt been able to get word to her since the japanese clamped down and he hadnt heard from her he hadnt heard that anything bad had happened to her dance hall but he didnt know that he would for the time being the marines were confined to barracks hed never been so tempted to go awol max weinstein also didnt sympathize with the dead frenchmen but he had different reasons youre a capitalist the only reason you come to china is to exploit the local workers and peasants you do that you deserve whatever happens to you far as im concerned youre a sweet old boy maxyeah a real sob pooch said wasnt the chinks who did for em remember it was the japs they got it on account of they came out here if theyd stayed home where they belonged they wouldnt have max said stubbornly no the nazis wouldve blown em up instead pete put in if you want to see everything thats wrong with capitalism and i mean everything all you gotta do is look at hitlers germany and the mooses italy weinstein said there it is naked you start talking about naked i dont want to talk about nazis szulc said i want to talk about broads thats cause youre a dickhead max told him you think with your dick and now youre talking with it too had anybody said that to pete he would have tried to murder the guy herman szulc puffed out his chest and looked proud of himself id sooner talk with my dick than with my red asshole like you any day he said max surged to his feet you stupid fuckin polack yeah yid there they went again other marines got between them everybody was as jumpy as a cat in a bar full of dobermans the marines were only a symbolic presence in shanghai as they had been in peking the real action in these parts was between the japs and the chinese when they started going at each other hammer and tongs it reminded the americans of their futility nobody liked having his uselessness exposed pete wasnt even sure he could protect his woman if anything in the world felt worse than that he didnt know what it would be other marines had had to keep him from going after herman szulc too herman had a big mouth and liked to hear himself talk one of these days but not yet not yet dammit pete thought not without regret alistair walsh had his own opinions about politics he was the staunchest of tories a winston churchill supporter who put up with neville chamberlain only because he might be marginally better than whatever labour put up to oppose him of course walsh was also a soldier he was actively discouraged from doing anything about his views the last thing britain wanted was bonapartism and soldiers doing anything about their political opinions seemed to the powers that be a long step in the wrong direction and so but for mouthing off in barracks and barrooms and foxholes walsh had stayed as politically innocent as his superiors could have wanted staying politically innocent after rudolf hess almost literally fell into his lap wasnt easy though you couldnt keep a thing like that secret the army and the government did their best and failed too many people saw and recognized the german big shot when walsh brought him back into dundee and hess bf crashed into a barn farther inland killing several cows and a horse and just missing the farmer himself whod tended the animals in there a few minutes earlier they took hess down to london presumably to tell the government about what hed already told walsh they brought walsh along presumably because they didnt know what else to do with him after all he already had the vision of landsers and tommies and poilus marching into russia shoulder to shoulder implanted in his brain if they didnt get him out of sight he might start telling people about it before they decided what the people ought to think he knew what he thought not that anyone asked a staff sergeants opinion walsh would have been shocked had the tightlipped young officers from the ministry of war and their even tighterlipped colleagues from the foreign ministry done any such thing the way they kept eyeing him made him wonder if he would suffer an unfortunate accident before he made it to the capital he didnt but he worried when they put him up in a posh hotel instead of with his mates you may do as you please so long as you dont leave your room one of the tightlipped captains said meals walsh asked theyll be sent in order what you please from room service the officer replied an extravagance walsh had never enjoyed before but he didnt really enjoy it now either it came at too high a price four armed guards outside the room made sure he wouldnt amble down the corridor it was six floors up he couldnt very well leave by the window either gets a bit dull here all by my lonesome walsh hinted the captain only shrugged as if to say that wasnt his worry walsh decided to be more direct if youre spending all that filthy lucre on room service can you lay out a bit more and get me a girl ill have better things to talk about with her than rudolf bloody hess by godi promise you that the officers lips got tighter and paler than ever i shall have to take that under advisement he said and got out of there as fast as he could no girl knocked on the door walsh hadnt really expected one would but asking didnt hurt the food was pretty good and room service would send up beer and whiskey when he asked for them things could have been worse he kept reminding himself of that they could have stuck him in a cell somewhere and lost the key but he couldnt talk to anybody that was why they kept him here they didnt want reporters asking him questions they didnt want other soldiers asking him anything either they knew how news flashed through the military soldiers and sailors were worse than women when it came to gossip he could step out into the hall the guards would only shake their heads if he spoke to them though and while he could go into the hall those guards wouldnt let him take more than a couple of strides along it they had oldfashioned bayonetsthe long onesfixed to their rifles by all appearances they were ready to use them if he looked like getting out of line he didnt he owned a wellhoned sense of survival like any prisoner he suspected changes in routine what were they going to do to him now find that cell and drop him into it or bump him off as if hed never existed to begin with they could do that if they decided to they could do anything they damn well pleased whod stop them what would happen if the nazis sent bombers over london would the guards escort him to the cellars perhaps with a gag on his mouth so he couldnt blab to anyone or would they leave him up here staying themselves to share his fate he didnt want to find out and was glad the luftwaffe seemed to be staying away even if the alarms outside didnt go off the ones inside his head did when somebody knocked on the door one night at half past eleven his heart pounded as he walked over to it was this the moment had they decided to imitate the fascists and the reds and dispose of him at midnight if they had he could do damn all about it defiantly he threw the door wide there in the hall stood a short portly man in his midsixties with a round red facea wrinkled irascible baby face it was although he smoked a large and decidedly unbabyish cigar walsh recognized him right away few britons wouldnt have of course winston he blurted at your service winston churchill replied his voice familiar from the wireless but more resonant now that he was here in the flesh may i come in how can i say no walsh stepped back to let the politician enter then closed the door behind him he pointed to a whiskey bottle on the sideboard i could use a drink sir would you care for one how can i say no churchill repeated blue eyes twinkling moving as if in a dream walsh poured for them both he gestured toward the siphonequipped soda bottle beside the whiskey a silent question churchill shook his head walsh was just as well pleased he wanted something potent himself churchill raised his glass the king he said walsh echoed the toast they both drank churchill smacked his lips not bad they are treating you satisfactorily the sixsyllable word sounded natural in his mouth though more often than not he was the most plainspoken of politicos yes sir walsh finished his whiskey at a gulphe needed it did you come here to ask me that i did not churchill rasped i came to ask you this how would you and your comrades in arms like to march with the germans and against russia that was as plainspoken as a man could get walsh poured himself a refill churchill held out his glass and walsh filled it as well i dont care to speak for anyone but myself sir then by all means do that your reluctance does you credit shrugging walsh said i dont know anything about that what i know is im damned if i want some nazi general giving me orders and thats what it comes down to isnt it wed be helping hitler do what he already wants tohell what hes already started doing he couldnt lick us so now he wants us to join him ive fought against fritz twice now i dont want to be on his side he makes a fine enemy but i doubt hed prove such a good friend if hes after the russians now theres more to stalin than i looked for the words poured out of him fueled more by nerves than by whiskey once he ran dry he wondered whether hed just doomed himself if the government had already decided to throw in with adolf but the wrinkles smoothed out of churchills face as he smiled god bless you son i thought youd say thati hoped you wouldbut i was far from sure even if youre too modest to say so i feel sure you spoke for most british fighting men and most eloquently you spoke for me as well good lord walsh did not expect ever to win the vc aside from that he couldnt imagine a finer honor he dared a question of his own is it decided what well do i mean decided churchill snorted and shook his head not likely neville chamberlain couldnt decide to change his drawers if he shat in them that made walsh blink then he remembered churchill had fought in the boer war and commanded a battalion on the western front in the last big goround some of it must have stuckhe knew how soldiers talked all right he went on no sergeant its not decided but i daresay youve helped put a spike in herr hess wheel that you have this time he poured the whiskey he raised his glass down with hitler down with hitler alistair walsh had never heard a toast he was gladder to join rumors always rumors vaclav jezek didnt like the ones he was hearing lately thats what theyre saying benjamin halevy told him theres supposed to be talk in paris about throwing in with the germans they cant do that vaclav exclaimed in dismay verging on horror tell me about it the jewish sergeant said but the trouble is they damn well can and the poilus think theyre going to most of the time vaclav found speaking next to no french an asset if he didnt understand an idiot officer he didnt have to follow idiotic ordersunless the fellow knew german as some of the bastards did now though he wished he could pick up the trench rumors at first hand instead of relying on halevy to pass them along some of the poilus want to fight some of them dont though vaclav put that as politely as he could he didnt want to offend the sergeant who was at least as much frenchman as czech and to jezek more jew than either he neednt have worried because halevy was more jew than anything else or jew first and everything else later he was all for giving the nazis one in the nuts too right they dont howd you like to take on the russians instead oh so it works like that does it vaclav said halevy nodded vaclav didnt need to think it over no thanks not me russia tried to help czechoslovakia when hitler jumped us and thats more than anybody else can sayfrance included once more the challenge turned out not to be one yes i know benjamin halevy answered we did as little as we could to technically honor our treaty arent there a lot of reds in the french army vaclav said whatll they think about fighting for hitler and against stalin that made halevy pause at any rate interesting question he said at last im not sure well just have to find out if thats what the big wheels decide to do most of them would sooner throw in with the nazisyou can bank on that oh sure vaclav agreed france really would have done something when germany invaded us if your government didnt halfway wish you were in bed with hitler he wondered if that would make halevy angry but the redheaded noncom took it in stride his only response was im glad you said halfway what are we supposed to do while the boys in the cutaways and the striped pants figure out which way to jump jezek asked ha that i can tell you same as wed do any other time we keep on killing the assholes in feldgrau and do our goddamnedest to keep them from killing us sounds like a plan vaclav allowed the germans wanted to kill him in particular they knew too much about him too they knew he was a czech not a frenchman their imported sharpshooter or maybe he was homegrownvaclav didnt know for sure started singling out men who wore the domed czech helmet rather than the crested adrian style that made poilus look as if they were still fighting the last war this was a better adrian helmet than the old model it was stamped from a single piece of manganese steel instead of being built up from two pieces of lowerquality ironmongery but it still looked oldfashioned and it still was made of thinner metal than the czech pot not without regret vaclav switched to a french helmet hed done that before doing it again didnt bother him too much he wanted to hang on to the czech helmet he was abandoning but he didnt the antitank rifle meant he lugged around extra weight as things were he didnt need another kilo or kilo and a half somewhere over there off to the east that german sniper lurked in the trenches or maybe he wasnt in the trenches any more maybe he sprawled in a shell hole between the lines or inside the carcass of a dead automobile or under a smashedup rubbish bin you could sneak out under cover of darkness one shot would be all you needed odds were nobody would see where it came from when night came back youd go in the meantime you could amuse yourself by carving another notch into your rifles stock you could if you were a nice thorough german anyhow vaclav wouldnt have cared to be captured carrying a rifle that bragged that way if you were your chances of seeing the inside of a pow camp ranged from slim down toward none he chuckled sourly when that crossed his mind the weapon he carried was a hell of a lot more conspicuous than any ordinary rifle notched or not he began looking with a new eye at possible hiding places out in nomansland the way he went about it made him laugh once more on as dry a note as hed used earlier was this how ducks scouted for hunters blinds in the marshes at rivers edge as they flew down to land and feed there was a difference though unlike the ducks he could shoot back he suddenly laughed again this time in real amusement he imagined flocks of mallards or pochards or smews with machine guns under their wings and cannon in their beaks by god youd think twicethree times if you had any sensebefore you went after one of those all right whats so funny benjamin halevy asked vaclav explained his conceit the jew gave him a peculiar look and found another question are you sure youre a czech damn straight jezek answered proudly how come youre asking such a stupid thing on account of czechs arent usually crazy like that even frenchmen arent usually crazy like that you sure youre not a yid in disguise damn straight vaclav repeated still proudly had someone not a jew asked him that he would have decked the son of a bitch as things were he added nobodys gonna get near my dick with the gardeners clippers thats not how its done halevy said or i dont think it is i was only eight days old when it happened to me so i wasnt taking notes no huh doesnt it bother you not having a foreskin why would it does having one bother you nope vaclav said what bothers me is that nazi shithead hes out there somewhere and he wants to punch my ticket for me do unto others before they do unto you halevy said it may not be just what jesus said but that doesnt mean its bad advice it was in fact damn good advice vaclav had already been following it even if he hadnt phrased it so well he decided hed better head out into nomansland himself if he didnt nail the sniper hed have a better shot at other german soldiers maybe theyd pick the same nook wouldnt that make for a cheery meeting in the dark he spent the rest of the day scouting places to hide some of the ones that looked best lay several hundred meters in front of the line czech and french troops shared the very best one or so it seemed was behind or perhaps under a rustedout french armored car that had probably been sitting there since the big german advance a year and a half before the fritzes would have taken whatever parts and weapons and tires they could use and left the shell to gather dust and now snipers when he told halevy of his plan the jew said well you can do that if you want but i sure wouldnt how come jezek yelped indignantly you already answered your own question its been sitting there the past year and a half you think the germans havent noticed it you think they havent boobytrapped it six ways from sunday vaclav paused to find out what he did think after a few seconds he said aw shit after a few more he added thanks nothing came harder than admitting the other guy was right but halevy was sure as hell the sergeant nodded back vaclav started looking for a different place to hide eggy druce had been through things none of her friends and acquaintances in philadelphia could match the more she talked about them the plainer that got shed changed and they hadnt she was convinced that shed changed for the better and that they needed to move in the same direction as fast as they could they seemed disappointingly dubious herb always listened to her a good thing too or she would have gone round the bend in a hurry even as things were more than a few of those friends and acquaintances would have said shed already done it for crying out loud she told her husband after finding that even more people didnt want to pay any attention to her its like im the only one who knows what love is and everybody else thinks im lying when i talk about it what am i supposed to do besides haul off and belt somebody in the chops i mean he clicked his tongue between his teeth doing his best to keep a judicious tonepeggy recognized the tone and the efforthe answered well it might help some if you didnt sound so much like a missionary out to convert the heathen chinee the nineteenthcentury phrase made her smile for a moment but only for a moment then she got madnot at him but at everybody deaf to her blandishments that meant basically at almost everyone she knew on this side of the atlantic if herb had also thought she was a crank she didnt know what she would have done thank god he didnt for crying out loud she said again the way a lot of people sound theyre halfway to being nazis more than halfway its terrible the way they go on they want england and france to line up behind hitler and knock russia flat stalins no bargain herb said once more judiciously yes dear peggys own oversweet tone was redolent of iexpectedbetterfromyouofallpeople next to hitler though hes george washington and abe lincoln rolled into one im sure he would agree with you herb remarked so what peggy said next to hitler attila the hun is a bargain i ought to know ive talked to the man to attila her husband asked not innocently enough peggy sent him a severe look hitler as you know perfectly well she bit off the words one by one as if from a salami okay okay herb said did you ever talk to hess too or meet him i saw him a couple of times i never really met him peggy answered do you think he parachuted out over london or paris or wherever it was the way people are saying stranger things have happened oh yeah name two mm there were the braves in thats one peggy said her husband said nothing for some little while then he spread his hands as he might have done after turning over a bad dummy at the bridge table maybe i cant think of anything else that peculiar but its been a pretty crazy war any way you look at it hasnt it think so do you ill tell you something peggy took a deep breath then proceeded to do exactly that americas even stranger than all the crazy places i saw in europe the ostrich with his head in the sand is wearing an uncle sam top hat honey i dont want to see us in the war herb said i went over there i saw the elephant thats what my granddad would have called it anyway what he did call it after he came home from the army of the potomac the only reason ive ever been glad we couldnt have kids is that a son of mine would be draft age right about now some of the things i did some of the things i saw i wouldnt wish them on my son herb peggy didnt know how to go on they hardly ever brought up the subject of children it was too raw and painful in the early days of their marriage shed miscarried three times in the space of two years after that her doctor warned her that any more tries probably wouldnt succeed and would put her life in danger so she and herb had relied on french letters and on techniques some people called perverted and remained fond of each others company to this day if something was necessarily missing well what could you do something was missing from everybodys life peggy had more leisureand more moneywith which to travel most of the time she and herb could look on the bright side of things she hadnt worried about any of that when she ended up letting constantine jenkins into her bed in berlin shed been so sloshed she hadnt worried or thought about one goddamn thing then shed guessed the embassy undersecretary was queer shed been pretty sure in fact if he was he sure could switchhit every now and then only luck he didnt put a bun in her oven and wouldnt that have fouled up her life she took a deep breath somebodys got to stop hitler if that means us it means us no matter what it costs maybe he said unlike her he held back a lot of what went through his mind most of the time she thought that made him easier to live with most of the time but not always after a moment he added but if chamberlain and daladier are pushing him forward whos going to ask us to hold him back the question was painfully good the only reason the usa had gone into the last war was to pull england and frances chestnuts out of the fire still peggy found a possible answer stalin her husband snorted he may ask but wholl listen to him not enough russian votesor red votes come to thatto get fdrs bowels in an uproar especially with this thirdterm boom most people dont want a war they can finally see the end of the depression or they think they can and they just want to stay under their own vine and fig tree peggys strict parents had sent her to sunday school every week till she got big enough to put her foot down and quit going bits and pieces of it stuck to this day she could come out with chapter and verse from micah in the king james version of course her folks seemed to think that was what god had used to talk to the hebrews but they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree and none shall make them afraid she sighed wistfully boy thatd be swell herb smiled whether at the quotation or at the oldfashioned slang she couldnt tell it would wouldnt it the way it looks to most people weve got the atlantic and the pacific instead of the vine and the fig tree with all that water between us and trouble why worry as usual he sounded calm and reasonable and peggy usually liked him to sound that way which only proved the old saw about opposites attracting england thought it was safe behind the channel too till hitler started bombing london she snapped kaiser wilhelm did the same thing the last time around herb answered the more it changes the more it stays the same its not peggy insisted whats the difference hitler hits harder listening to herself peggy thought she might have come up with a campaign slogan for the fuhrer but hitler didnt need to worry about campaign slogans any more that was one of the advantages of being a dictator now everybody else had to do the worrying im not the person you need to tell roosevelt is herb said well ill do that then peggy declared shed met the president before his new york background was not so very different from hers here in philadelphia she couldnt hop on a train to washington and walk into the white house with the confident expectation that he would see her right away if she wrote him a report on what shed seen and what she thought about it though she did think it would reach him what hed do afterwards and whether hed do anything that shed just have to find out her parents had also made sure she could type thered been other crashes before this latest one somebody with a salable skill always had an edge she sat down at the family royal and began getting the past year and a half down on paper a russian prisoner staggered stumbled slumped to his knees and then with a small groan rolled over on his side the japanese guard tramping along fifty meters or so in front of hideki fujita walked over to the skinny filthy man on the ground he shouted at the luckless fellow the russian only lay there the japanese soldier kicked him once twice three times the prisoner groaned again louder he tried to stand but could not he looked up at the guard his hands spread in a hopeless last appeal hopeless indeed not even wasting a bullet the guard bayoneted him in the throat the russian thrashed his life away it didnt take long he had little life left to lose sergeant fujita trudged past the still feebly writhing body he didnt spare it so much as a sideways glance it wasnt as if he hadnt seen plenty of others just like it and it wasnt as if plenty of the red army men whod surrendered outside of vladivostok but still managed to shamble along through manchukuo wouldnt keel over themselves pretty soon one of the prisonersa man shaggy as a bear because he hadnt shaved or trimmed his hair since the surrendercaught fujitas eye and stretched out an imploring hand palm up food please soldiersama the russian said in bad japanese lord soldier the fellow knew which side his bread was buttered on it didnt help him not here theyll feed you soon fujita said roughly the prisoners blank stare said he didnt understand fujita simplified things even more no food now food later keep marching keep marching that was the essential command fujita was glad he had the pair of fine russian boots hed taken from a dead soldier in the siberian woods they were much easier on his feet than the clodhoppers the japanese army issued what the russians didnt know about leather wasnt worth knowing few prisoners had any boots at all theyd been plundered after they gave up well of course they had as soon as a man surrendered he stopped being a man he was just a beast a thing to be used as his captors found convenient or amusing fujita had put a few fallen prisoners out of their misery couldnt have them slowing up the column after all but hed never fired into a mass of russians just to watch them go down when he had to kill he killed quickly and cleanly as the guard in front of him had done he saw no sport in gutshooting men or bayoneting them so they died a centimeter at a time but he said not a word to the japanese soldiers who enjoyed doing things like that it wasnt as if standing orders forbade mistreating prisoners of war during the last fight against the russians such orders had been in place japan wanted to show the european powers and america shed built the same kind of civilization they already had now by all the signs the people who ran the country didnt care what the european powers and america thought surrender had long been a disgrace in japan if the captors of soldiers who gave up felt like mistreating them or even killing them no socalled laws of war stood in the way and japan had never ratified the geneva convention the europeans silly rules werent going to hold back the empire either nothing was not any more peasants in the fieldsmaybe native manchus maybe chinese settlersstared at the column of white men in ragged khaki none stared from close range however not only was the column unfamiliar and therefore alarming it was guarded by japanese soldiers and so doubly alarming yes manchukuo was japans allyjapans puppet if you wanted to be unkind about it but the local peasants didnt see japanese soldiers as allies they saw them as plunderers as locusts fujita had served in manchukuo for some time now he knew the peasants had their reasons for seeing his comrades that way on the other hand they were peasants no doubt they would have kept their distance from chinese soldiers or for that matter from brazilian soldiers too lieutenant hanafusa strode by a oneman parade being an officer he wasnt burdened with a rifle and a heavy pack he could afford to waste energy showing off and he too wore a pair of supple russian boots so his feet would be happy sir may i ask you a question sergeant fujita called to him what is it hanafusa returned fujita got the idea that if the lieutenant didnt care for the question someone would be unhappy immediately thereafter he also had a good notion of who that someone would be well too late to back off now have you heard yet sir just where were supposed to be going with all these miserable prisoners to his vast relief hanafusa nodded as a matter of fact i have theres a campor some kind of facility anyhowat a place called pingfan where would that be sir fujita knew he was pressing his luck he bowed to the officer please excuse me but ive never heard of it well i hadnt either when somebody told me about it lieutenant hanafusa said with more generosity than he usually showed its about twentyfive kilometers south of harbin ah so desu fujita exclaimed he knew where harbin was all right any japanese whod spent some time here would have not only was it one of the biggest cities in manchukuo it also looked more like a western town than most places here that sprang from the strong local russian influence which persisted even now and it was a major rail center you went through harbin if you needed to get anywhere in manchukuo fujita had done it several times he tried one more question what will they do with them there beats me thats for the damned russians to worry about hanafusa replied all i know is were taking them to something called unit the people who run it want prisoners now that weve taken so many our job is to deliver the sorry bastards to them what are they going to use them for or will they use them up beats me hanafusa repeated cheerfully thats for the russians to worry about too maybe after we make the delivery ill go back up to harbin and screw a blond russian whoreone more reminder that we beat them yes sir that sounds good sir fujita grinned hanafusa started to strut off then caught himself oh that reminds me sergeant you were vaccinated for smallpox when you went into the army werent you i sure was fujita winced at the memory it took i was sick for a couple of days my arm swelled up like it was poisoned and i got a big old blister full of pus i had the same thing happen to me not much fun was it but lieutenant hanafusa nodded as if satisfied thats all right then whats all right sir why do you need to know a silly thing like that it ties in with what people say about unit the lieutenant said the answer might have made sense to him but it didnt to fujita the sergeant was going to ask him to explain but hanafusa did hurry away this time fujita had already pushed him as far as a noncom could reasonably push an officer and maybe a little further besides hell come back its still a long way to harbin if hes in a good mood i can find out later on fujita thought he rubbed his arm it felt fine now but he still wore a nasty scar from the vaccination and he remembered how little sympathy the doctors had shown one of them told him youd be a lot sicker than this if you really came down with smallpox fujita knew that was true one of his grandfathers had a pocked face and mourned a younger brother who hadnt survived the disease food please sir another russian prisoner whined in bad japanese no food now food later fujita answered idly he wondered whether the white man had ever been vaccinated theyd removed the cannon from hansulrich rudels stuka for this mission he wasnt shooting up russian panzers today his plane and half a dozen others would try to take out a railroad bridge over the dnieper near borisov colonel steinbrenner nodded to the pilots hed chosen i picked you boys for a reason he told them youre the best ive got that bridge has got to go the reds are hauling all kinds of crap over it dont let me down dont let the reich down either the flyers nodded hansulrich noticed that the wing commander didnt say anything about not letting the fuhrer down he didnt make a fuss about it but he noticed how could you help noticing such things when everybodyd got so maniacal about security and loyalty these days yes the powers that be thought steinbrenner was all right he wouldnt have replaced colonel greim if they hadnt but you never could tell whether theyd change their minds questions steinbrenner asked after he finished the briefing one of the other pilots stuck up his hand the colonel nodded what is it franz borisov is in russia nicht wahr franz fischbach said in byelorussia actually but yes inside the soviet union if thats what you meant steinbrenner answered the gloves are off ill say that again to make sure you get it the gloves are off the reds have been bombing us whenever they found the nerve now we get to show them what they bought dont you like it if you dont ill find somebody else to go instead oh no sir dont worry about me fischbach said quickly any other reply and he could have kissed his flying career goodbye i just wanted to make sure the brass bothered to check the map that got a chuckle from the wing commander yeah you never can tell with the fellows with the fancy shoulder straps other questions he looked surprised when he got one whats on your mind peter are we knocking the reds around to help persuade england and france to throw in with us peter tannenwald inquired thats what you hear everywhere ive heard it too i dont know if its true or not colonel steinbrenner said hansulrich had also heard it he hoped it was true it would make life easier steinbrenner went on youd do better asking somebody from the foreign ministry not me oh sure sir tannenwald grinned at him only youre right here and those clowns are back in berlin thats true but they know the answer and i just wish i did all i know is youve got to go get that bridge steinbrenner said good luck to you all i hope to see every one of you back here before very long hansulrich hoped that would happen too the germans and poles had just about cleared the red army out of poland theyd pushed into the northern ukraine from southeastern poland the pripet marshes which lay on the polishbyelorussian border slowed their advance in that part of the front no german panzers were anywhere near borisov not so far as hansulrich knew franz fischbach summed up what that meant we dont want to get shot down behind the russian lines youre saying not unless youve got a big insurance policy and you need your next of kin to cash it in right now steinbrenner agreed dryly by all the signs the russians cared little for the geneva convention they hadnt signed it that meant the germans didnt need to follow its rules when dealing with red prisoners but it also meant the russians did as they pleased with germans they captured you heard stories about foot soldiers ingeniously mutilated maybe after they were dead but maybe not too some pilots made sure they always kept a round in their pistol to keep the russians from having fun with them if their luck soured hansulrich hadnt worried about such things before flying against borisov id better see to it he thought after the meeting broke up sergeant dieselhorst asked him about what was going on hansulrich explained the mission dieselhorst nodded impatiently ja ja he said but what about the western powers are they going to come to their senses or will they go on fighting us instead peter asked colonel steinbrenner the same thing and and the colonel said he should talk to the fellows in striped trousers cause they might know and he didnt dieselhorst snorted those fairies dont know their ass from their elbow sure would be a lot easier if we didnt have to worry about the western front youre right it would but the colonel cant do anything about that and neither can we all we can do is bomb the snot out of the ivans so we will sounds good by me the sergeant sent him a crooked grin and then you can try and get back to bialystok and see your halfjewish girlfriend rudels ears heated sofias not my girlfriend that was true although not from lack of effort on his part i dont know what kind of mischling she is that was also true she was maddeningly vague about herself she might have been almost a fullblooded jew or she might just have been an uncommonly swarthy pole in these parts half the time nobody was sure what anybody else was flying the mission seemed easier than facing sofia anyhow the russians could only kill him in the air or torture him and then kill him if they caught him on the ground they couldnt humiliate him make him feel he was twelve years old again and at the same time make him feel more electrically alive more sparky and sparkly than hed ever felt before as soon as his stuka crossed over into territory the reds still held they started shooting at him they opened up with everything they had not only antiaircraft guns but also machine guns and rifles that smallarms fire would fall far short of the plane all they were doing with it was putting themselves in danger a bullet falling from a couple of thousand meters could kill you if it landed on your unprotected head the germans wasted much less ammo like that not none but much less he droned along behind and to the left of peter tannenbaums plane the flight leader if peter didnt know the way to borisov they were all shafted hansulrich kept an eye peeled for soviet fighters messerschmitt pilots scorned the biplanes and flatnosed monoplanes the red air force threw against them but a fighter all but helpless against a could hack a stuka out of the sky with the greatest of ease see anything albert rudel asked through the speaking tube only the rest of our boys dieselhorst answered i wish theyd given me two heavy machine guns back here instead of one ordinary piece then id really stand a chance against whatever came after us roughened by static tannenbaums voice came through hansulrichs earphones i see the target ahead at one oclock everybody have it that ribbon of water through the flat landscape had to be the dnieper and those steel curves marked the bridge it looked as graceful as most in germany given russian slovenliness that surprised rudel it was so all the same got it he said his confirmation intermingled with the others one by one the stukas flipped a wing in the air and dove on the target the ivans knew how important the bridge was their flak sent up puffs of black smoke all around the bombers most of the shells burst behind them gunners often underestimated how fast a diving stuka could go but franz fischbach shouted in pain and despair and fear his ju plunged faster than any of the others and didnt pull up an enormous explosion and a pillar of black smoke marked where it slammed into the ground hansulrich released his bombs and hauled back on the stick for all he was worth the climb was the real danger point not the dive the stuka wasnt very high and it moved slower and slower as it shed the momentum it had somebody got the bridge the backwardsfacing sergeant dieselhorst reported good rudel answered i hate it when our men go down another flyer would have talked of friends going down hansulrich had precious few friends in the luftwaffe the other pilots had come to respect his skill and courage like him that seemed to be asking too much but he had more urgent things to worry about starting with staying alive and with the bridge down maybe he could ask colonel steinbrenner for a short furlough in bialystok he wasnt sure sofia liked him either whether she did or not felt at least as important as whether he kept on breathing why not if sofia liked him hed have something to go on breathing for german and french lines ran close together in front of luc harcourts position when a fritz came out in front of his sides trenches luc could have potted him easy as you please but the soldier in fieldgray carried a couple of items that made him think twice one was a large white flag of truce the other even more curious was a megaphone luc wondered where the hell hed found it did the germans issue them say one to a battalion that took thoroughness to what struck him as an insane degree but you never could tell with the boches or had this fellow liberated it from the little french town whose ruins lay right behind the line wherever hed got it he raised it to his lips and bellowed through it in gutturally accented french we would like a ceasefire we wont shoot if you dont we should all fight the russian jew bolsheviks instead after repeating himself several times he waved to the poilus on the far side of the barbed wire gravely lowered the megaphone and withdrew back to some place where things were apt to be safer give em a burst harcourt lieutenant demange rasped they came out with that same horseshit while they were squashing czechoslovakia remember then it was our turn so they kicked us in the nuts instead luc did remember the eerie almost unnatural quiet on the western front till the german onslaught a couple of weeks before christmas with some surprise he realized he and demange were two of the very few left in this company who could recall that quiet at firsthand so many new fish in so many veterans dead or wounded or down with one frontline sickness or another he squeezed the triggers on the hotchkiss gun yes for the moment it was still his baby even if he wore a gold sergeants stripe half a strips worth of ammo roared toward the germans line demange hadnt told him to try to kill anybody so he fired high in wars rough language he was saying no without being rude even if he was polite he expected the boches to shoot back but they didnt the silence from their side of the line might have been a pointed comment about his burst be damned joinville muttered maybe they mean it this time fuck em fuck their mothers fuck their grannies villehardouin spoke only a little french almost all of it filthy he went on in breton luc understood breton no more than he understood bulgarian but it sounded vile joinville had picked up scraps of tinys native tongue he whistled and clapped his hands whatever villehardouin said it must have been juicy after sundown german planes rumbled overhead searchlights and antiaircraft guns hunted for them without much luck but no bombs whistled down from the planes they dropped leaflets instead the leaflets carried the same message the landser had shouted out they also showed a cartoon a wolf with a jewish face and a soviet officers redstarred cap attacking a pretty blonde labeled civilization a knight called western europe was coming to her rescue with a sword the paper was cheap brownish pulp all the same not the worst asswipe ive found lately luc said and its a better present than most of the ones the boches try to give us boy youve got that right demange agreed i wonder if hitler bit off more than he could chew over there on the other front could be luc said germans never tried to make that kind of deal in the last war did they i hope to shit they didnt the middleaged veteran answered they knew we wouldve told em to stuff it youve got to figure the fucking nazis arent serious this time around either how come they sure are putting a lot of effort into it i bet theyve got guys yelling and planes dropping leaflets up and down the whole front oh sure but so what demange said the way it looks they just want us to throw in with them on account of theyre so fucking cute yknow they arent saying theyll pull out of france or the low countries they arent saying theyll turn loose of denmark and norway they want to rape us and they want us to come while theyre doing it shitheads should live so long luc grunted demange had a way with wordsnot always a pleasant way but a way being nasty didnt make him wrong luc hadnt heard anything that made him think the nazis were willing to pull back from what theyd grabbed thoughtfully he said i wonder if any of thats occurred to our diplomats or to the english dont hold your breath demange advised our boys are a bunch of hyenas in top hats and cutaways and as for the english merde alors the english fucking boil bacon anybody who does that cant be long on brains luc hadnt thought of it like that which again didnt mean the foulmouth reluctant lieutenant didnt have a point any which way ill be happy as long as this ceasefire holds well so will i demange answered lighting a fresh gitane from the stub of his old one luc looked wistful so demange muttering handed him a cigarette too then he continued wed better not go to sleep like we did after old czecho got it boches re liable to be piling up tanks behind their line ready to give us another clop in the teeth as soon as we squat over the slit trench with our pants at half mast youd think our recon would notice something like that luc said demange laughed raucously yeah you would wouldnt you and youd think those cons mightve noticed something the last time too did they not fucking likely so how far can you trust em now ive learned not to trust the boches eitherexcept to trust them to be sure to cause trouble luc replied with dignity good job maybe youre not as dumb as you look maybe demanges seamless scorn for all mankind had plenty of room to include luc come the next morning the germans still didnt fire they did show themselves as if confident the poilus wouldnt shoot at them without provocation as luc had seen many times before german discipline was a formidable thing he wondered if any of the landsers walking around within easy rifle shot had given their officers a nasty look when they were ordered to come out from their nice safe trenches he knew damn well he would have he waited for lieutenant demange to tell him to open up on the boches if demange gave the order he would obey he didnt want to face french military justice a contradiction in terms if ever there was one but he also didnt want to start the fighting up again without orders and the orders did not come neither hardbitten demange nor any of his superiors seemed eager to provoke the enemy their attitude looked to be that they could fight if they had to but that they werent going to start anything luc felt the same way the fellow with the megaphone came out again we will trade beer for wine or tubes of meat paste for good tobacco nobody answer demange commanded informal commerce did happen now and again the germans knew their enemies liked that meat paste and everybody knew the fritzes made better beer but worse wine than people on this side of the rhine lieutenant demange wasnt about to let such bargaining come out into the open though beer tastes like stale piss anyway opined joinville like most men from the south of france a confirmed winebibber how do you know what stale piss tastes like luc asked joinville gave him a dirty look luc grinned back even in a ceasefire you had to make your own fun very time the morning news came on the radio sergei yaroslavsky tensed he wasnt the only flyer who didfar from it the germans and the poles were giving the red army and air force all the trouble they needed and more besides if the rest of the decadent capitalist powers lined up behind the hitlerites the homeland of the glorious october revolution would be in deadly danger once more moscow speaking came out of the radio at the appointed hour the pilots and bombaimers gathered in the officers quarters all leaned toward the set what new disasters would it announce which ones would it try to sugarcoat the only thing sergei was sure of was that there would be some first a report on the fighting in poland the newsreader said unfortunately several of the towns he mentioned werent in poland but in byelorussia or the ukraine the average soviet citizenespecially the average citizen who didnt live near the ussrs western borderprobably wouldnt know that such was bound to be the official hope as always radio moscow made things sound as good as they possibly could or else a little better than that again only someone expert at reading between the linesor someone in the middle of the soviet retreatwas likely to notice how many people did that include it was hard to gauge not least because admitting you noticed anything out of kilter about the broadcasts would win you a quick oneway trip to the gulag lately though the fighting hadnt been the only thing sergei was worrying about even if it was going worse than moscow cared to admit he waited till the announcer got done listing the polish and sadly soviet towns that had changed hands lately after that after that the man switched to a report on the desultory fighting that went on in the far east vladivostok was lost the ussr wouldnt get it back any time soon what else needed saying something evidently through reliable sources the soviet union has learned that the japanese are barbarously mistreating our prisoners of war the newsreader announced the peaceloving and humane government of the ussr has warned the japanese empire through neutral channels to cease and desist from this practice at once all regimes are liable to punishment for violating the laws of war that sounded good the only trouble with it was japan hadnt signed the geneva convention she wasnt obligated to treat pows according to its rules and for that matter neither had the ussr sergei wouldnt have wanted to be a german or pole who had to surrender to the red army he wouldnt have wanted to yield to a german or pole either since the ussr hadnt signed the convention her enemies in the west didnt have to follow it with soviet prisoners either but all that was swept away when the newsreader got to what yaroslavsky and the rest of the red air force officers were really waiting to hear the mans voice deepened and saddened as he said the ominous lull on fascist germanys western front continues the reactionary capitalist states will regret throwing their troops against the peasants and workers of the soviet union alongside and under the orders of the hitlerite hyenas if they make that fatal mistake general secretary stalin has stated we shall resist any and all aggression with the courage and iron determination suited to the workers revolutionary vanguard we shall resist and we shall triumph stormy applause greeted his remarks to the supreme soviet nobody in the officers lounge seemed to want to meet anyone elses eye the ussr was having all it could do to hold off germany and poland poland was not much however reactionary england and france might be they were great powers if they came after the soviet union with the nazis what would happen next nothing good not so far as sergei could see the newsreader went on in somewhat brighter tones in england winston churchill continues to speak out strongly against the proposed misalliance with the nazis while a reactionary himselfhe tried to strangle the glorious red revolution in its cradlechurchill is not blind to the dangers of hitlerism the lamb may lie down with the lion he said but only the lion will get up againfull that sounded good even after being translated into russian most foreign gibes lost their flavor once they left their native tongue churchill must have seemed uncommonly witty in english although churchill is a member of prime minister chamberlains conservative party chamberlain has gone out of his way to assure the english parliament that churchill does not speak for him or his government the newsreader said portentously chamberlain is playing with his dick again one of the pilots said in disgust the chimp couldnt have put it any more plainlyand probably would have put it about the same way the news didnt sound good if chamberlain was criticizing churchill and churchill was criticizing cutting a deal with the nazis what was the likely result trouble for the rodina that was what more trouble for the rodina sergei mentally corrected the soviet union already had as much country as any selfrespecting country needed after music replaced the news major konstantin ponamarenkocolonel borisovs replacement as squadron leadersaid you men will knownot everything that happens comes on the radio right away heads bobbed up and down yaroslavskys among them the main purpose of radio moscow news was to hold up morale on the home front sergei had thought as much himself not long before he hadnt looked for the new squadron commander to acknowledge it so openly ponamarenko went on you will also know that the situation in the field is developing in a way that might possibly be better he waited for more nods he got them sergei admired him the pilot had rarely heard a more graceful way of admitting the ussr was getting the snot knocked out of it dont waste time worrying about those french and english whores ponamarenko said earnestly they cant get at us yet and we cant get at them either worry about the german cocksuckers and about their polish lap dogs yapping along behind them we can hit back at them and we damn well will sergei nodded one more time you had to show you agreed somebody was always watching you no somebody always might be watching you you always needed to stay on your guard it was all right to remember that stalin had started the fight with poland the winter before looking to pick up wilno on the cheap if the general secretary hadnt the soviet union would still be at war with germany but only in a formal sense since neither side could have struck at the other without violating some buffer states neutrality well now the ussr had done just that and this was what the soviet workers and peasants got for it yes it was all right to remember stalin might well have outsmarted himself but it wasnt all right to show you remembered such things you never could tell who might notice and report you never could tell when you might disappear what im saying is we are going to be flying missions inside what was soviet territory before the war ponamarenko continued we will try to drop our bombs only on the heads of the fascist jackals of course of course he bore down on the repeated phrase but accidents happen in war i dont have many virgins here you know that and i need to tell every one of youdont worry about them some of our explosives may do a little harm to soviet citizens if the rest of our loads help drive the invaders out of the motherland though thats a price worth paying do you hear what im telling you comrades by the way the flyers heads moved they might have been on springs this also was nothing that hadnt occurred to sergei before he didnt want to hurt his own people hed never dreamt such a dreadful thing might be possible when he first put on the uniform he wore however dreadful the possibility might be it was here and ponamarenko had it right if the bombers hurt the invaders worse than the locals their strikes were bound to be worthwhile in the long run a surgeon cut you up to make you healthier in the long run but you still had a scar after the operation and it still hurt while you recovered from it sergei wished he hadnt thought of any of that every once in a while war seemed easy even to someone like theo hossbach who knew better most of the time when the german panzers smashed through the low countries and into northern france it was obvious the wehrmacht was playing a faster deeper game than the dutch and belgians the english and french who tried to slow it down unfortunately the enemy caught on just before germany managed to slam the sword all the way home now again the panzers rolled forward as if nothing in the world could slow them down the experienced german troops outclassed the ivans as effortlessly as adi stoss had outclassed the infantrymen he played against on that snowy polish football pitch maybeprobably evenan individual ground pounder was in better shape than adi russian panzers were often better than german machines but when stoss got the ball he knew what to do with it and even when he didnt have it he knew where to go so he might get it or so he might keep the guys on the other side from causing trouble the germans were like that as they pushed from poland into byelorussia and into the northern ukraine too but theo knew about that only by rumor and by brags on radio berlin the panzers struck then sped on leaving it for the german and polish infantry slogging along in their wake to clean up the ivans theyd shattered and the ivans couldnt figure out what to do about it it was as if their manager had to shout in directions from the touchline to get them to move left to themselves they would defend in place till they got smashed up but they maneuvered only slowly and awkwardly they might have those formidable panzers but they didnt know how to use them the germans did they took advantage as quickly and eagerly as a guy trying to screw his girl and they were screwing the russians all right people talked about smolensk and vyazma when people got excited they talked about moscow and leningrad theo talked very little when he sat in the bowels of the panzer ii he relayed orders from the platoon co the company co regimental hq division hq whatever came in through his earphones he faithfully passed on to hermann witt and he sent back the panzer commanders responses witt had to needle him only every once in a while to make sure he exercised his voice enough to do that dont keep it all to yourself theo my dear he would say they put that set in there for a reason you know and theo would nod and hed do better for a while but only for a while he was too much a creature of the deep silences inside his own head ever to grow comfortable with the racket of the outside world while they drove while they fought he didnt have much to do with adalbert stoss how could he when they had their places at opposite ends of the panzer iis fighting compartment adi talked to theowho didntbut he wasnt a guy who yakked all the time for the sake of yakking and his job needed him to pay attention every single second which theos didnt when they rolled into bivouac at the end of one of the midsummer days where the sun never wanted to set theo sometimes felt adis eye on him the driver rarely went beyond commonplaces when they talked but theo figured there was more to him than he let on what would he say if he spoke up something like you dont have to pull in your head like a turtle to hide perhaps or perhaps not theo knew his own imagination and guesses sometimes ran away with him he didnt know what he could do about it adi seemed happy thundering up and down the pitch with everybody else goalkeeper suited theo better most of the time the action was far away so he could daydream there were the stark moments when he had to make the save or botch it but they were mercifully few and far between even if he did botch one he could get by as long as he didnt screw up too much more than anyone else would have sometimes you just couldnt do anything about a shot unfortunately that also held true on the battlefield burntout carcasses of panzer is and iis and iiis testified to the truth there the ivans didnt play the game very well but they played goddamn hard they played so hard in fact that infantrymen and panzer soldiers on the pitch were as nothing beside it germans with a football played rough but it was only a game the russians were playing for keeps when you played like that all the rules flew out the window back in the west when something went wrong you had a chance of surrendering when you did surrender you had a chance of living till you got to a pow campnot a guarantee but a chance often a decent one the russians usually got rid of prisoners instead of bothering to send them back the panzers clattered forward again the next morning there inside his armored cave theo listened to what was going on every so often witt would order adi to stop the panzer he would fire a few rounds from the mm or a burst from the machine gun and they would go on now and then a rifle round or a few bullets from a russian machine gun would make everyone inside the panzer jump but that was all anything more than smallarms fire no theo didnt want to remind himself of that we will slow down for the village ahead well go around it and shell it from the outside not the voice of god but the company commanders close enough it was the first theo had heard that a village lay anywhere close by he relayed the order to witt who was standing up in the turret as usual the sergeant said ja makes sense and passed instructions on to adi the panzer ii slowed and swung to the left presumably to go around the village theo also thought skirting builtup areas made sense you didnt want to give some russian the chance to pop out of nowhere and chuck a bottle full of burning gasoline through your hatch molotov cocktails the germans called them a name the legion kondor had brought back from spain but slowing down carried risks of its own a rifle cracked outside the panzer much closer than usual witt dovefell reallyback into the fighting compartment blood streaming down his face jesus christ he yelled dogging the hatch behind him theres a motherfucking ivan on the panzer what happened theo asked the words jerked from him he shouldve blown my head off witt answered im just creasedi think he raised his voice adi shake him off if you can stoss didnt answer but the panzer sped up and jerked wildly first to one side then to the other it didnt worktheo could hear the russian scrabbling around on the machines armored carapace wounded or not witt had the presence of mind to slam the observation ports in the turret shut the bastard out there wouldnt be able to drop a grenade inside theo hoped he grabbed the schmeisser that hung on a couple of iron brackets hed never needed it before not inside the panzer he wished to god he didnt need it now the russian stood up on the engine decking and worried at something on the turret it wasnt the radiomans escape hatch maybe the ivan didnt even realize that was there if he didnt he was about to find out theo yanked it open and fired off the whole magazine the instant he caught a glimpse of khaki there was a wild scream and a thump as of a heavy weight falling back onto the engine louvers a moment later the panzer shifted again as if that same heavy weight had fallen off theo sucked in a deep breath which reminded him he hadnt been breathing before he took a wound dressing out of its belt pouch and turned back to witt ill bandage you up witt had already started trying that with his own wound dressing he was making a hash of it since he couldnt see what he was doing theo wrapped cotton gauze around his headhe had a tencentimeter gash in his scalp but it seemed to be only a crease as the panzer commander had said thanks witt said when theo was done way to get the son of a bitch too you want to take my seat for a bit sorry but i cant see straight right now and it hurts a little bit if he admitted it hurt a little it doubtless hurt a lot theo didnt want to command the panzer even for a little while he saw hed have to though he made himself nod all right the first thing he did after thateven before he scrambled into the turret to trade places with wittwas to stick a fresh thirtytworound box on his machine pistol leave in madrid chaim weinberg couldnt have been happier sure hed left new york city come to spain and joined the abe lincolns to fight fascism when he first got off the boat hed been raring to shoot the enemies of the working class every hour of every day of every week but that was three years ago now one of the big differences between a rookie and a veteran was that the vet developed a sense of proportion chaim still wanted to kill fascists every hour of every day well no for one thing that increased the chances that the fascists would kill him instead and for another there was more to life than killing people no matter how much they deserved it a hot bath delousing clean clothes a shave with hot lather from a barber hell with any lather in the field chaim just scraped his face with a straight razor when he bothered to shave at all and then madrid wineusually not good wine but he wasnt fussy the lousy spanish beer would also do womenusually not good women either but who needed an excessively good woman when you were just back from the front songeither in a cantina or coming out of the speakers at a movie house sitting in a comfortable chair in the dark for a couple of hours watching beautiful people do things that had nothing to do with war was not the least of pleasures at least if the airraid sirens didnt start to scream right when the flick was getting to the good part the food was better in madrid too it also cost more this particular leave chaim wasnt inclined to complain hed come away from the trenches with money in his pocket a dice game with an optimist had redistributed some wealth from him according to his abilities to me according to my needs chaim thought happily so clean and smoothcheeked and even fragrant to the extent of a splash of bay rum his belly full enough vino in him to help him ignore what a jackass he was being he sat in some lateafternoon shade outside communist party headquarters and waited for the revolutionary vanguard to knock off for the day if hed drunk a little more he might have sauntered right on in and the reds in there likely would have thrown him out on his ass sometimes waiting was better he didnt want to do anything strenuous not in the ferocious summer heat even the pigeons that begged for crumbs begged in slow motion they retreated in a hurry though if he moved in a way that looked dangerous during harder times madrilenos had eaten a lot of their cousins the survivors were the wary ones darwin had known which end was up all right because of the afternoon siesta spanish offices let out late chaim didnt mind he was used to the rhythm of life here and liked it better than the way things worked in the states except for pissing off the pigeons because he had no crumbs he was happy enough to wait people started to come out about when the blastfurnace heat began easing off spaniards either worked or dozed while it was hot outside once it got nicer they did what they wanted to do instead a damned civilized arrangement when you got right down to it there she was the adrenaline stab chaim felt reminded him too much of a near miss from a machinegun bullet you can still chicken out he reminded himself but himself was already getting up and walking toward her had he ever stormed into a nationalist trench so happily he didnt think so then again he hadnt had such incentives storming trenches holaque tal he said his accent grated in his own ears no doubt it sounded even harsher to la martellita she was so pretty chaim didnt care that hair that mouth it made him imagine things thoroughly illegal back in good old new yorkwhich didnt mean people there didnt do them and enjoy doing them as much as they did anywhere else she was tiny but that didnt bother chaim either he wasnt very tall himself her shape was everything it should have been and a little more besides her eyes looked at him as if hed come out of the wrong end of one of those wary pigeons oh you she said her nom de guerre meant the little hammer the way molotovs meant son of a hammer and if shed had a sickle to go with it she would have cut chaim down at the ankles what do you want i have some leave i was hopingchaim heard himself butcher the participleyou would teach me more about proper party doctrine he couldnt just say i want to tear your clothes off and jump on you well he could but he knew shed kill him for real if he tried dinner and a movie were long odds too if she had any kind of weakness where he was concerned ideology was it she thought his ideology was weak wasnt it her duty to instruct the ignorant and backward he sure hoped it was her gullwing eyebrows rose you were then those eyebrows came down and together as if she were aiming a rifle at his kishkes i thought you were proud of your errors not me chaim denied everything when peter denied knowing jesus christ he probably did it with an eye toward laying some broad in jerusalem who thought old jc was nothing but a windbag a stiff dick had no conscience why should i do it la martellita demanded doesnt the abraham lincoln battalion have a party cadre she knew damn well the lincolns did humbly chaim answered you were the one who showed me my mistakes you must be the one who knows them best no no conscience at all she looked at himlooked through him is that all you want me to do no entiendo chaim lied he understood her much too well and she understood him much too well too was it possible to sound too innocent evidently she stuck her elegantly arched nose in the air you can find someone else im sure she said and walked away any football ref in america would have given that walk a backfield in motion penalty doesnt it matter that im fighting for the republic chaim called after her she paused and turned back to him it matters to the republic it matters to spain to me she didnt even bother finishing that she just turned again and went on walking away wait chaim cringed at the desperation in his voice to his surprise she did stop once more if you need to find a whorehouse so badly i can tell you where they are she might have torched his ears with a molotov cocktail never mind he muttered bueno her shrug of victory was magnificent im sure you can get to one with no help from me hasta la vista away she strode like a long home run off the bat of jimmy foxx or hank greenberg going going gone chaim stared after her till she rounded a corner and disappeared then he kicked at the battered sidewalk a tiny pebble skittered away from his boot a pigeon pecked at it discovered it wasnt food and sent him a stare full of birdbrained reproach he hardly noticed ahh shit he said in english and then with nothing better to do he did go find a brothel it was the lousiest good time hed ever had in his life yeah he had his ashes hauled but he left the place gloomier than hed gone in you couldnt get too much of what you didnt really want to begin with he got drunk finding a bar in madrid was even easier than finding a brothel he got into a brawl an equally drunk spaniard pulled a knife on him he kicked it out of the guys handwhich he probably couldnt have done sober or wouldnt have been stupid enough to tryand pounded the crap out of him that satisfied chaim no better than the whore had still plastered he wandered madrids blackedout nighttime streets no moon tonightonly a lot of stars they were beautiful but they shed next to no light on things they might as well have been la martellita or had she shed altogether too much light that seemed much too likely lurching through the warm darkness chaim burst into tears a woman he couldnt see said pobrecito poor little one but he wasnt even one of those he was only a drunk on leave and somewhere down inside he knew it julius lemp wore a clean uniformhed even had it pressed after the u came into wilhelmshaven hed shaved off his atsea beard he stood at ramrodstiff attention before the engineering board and barked out reporting as ordered sir to its head he might almost have served in the kriegsmarine s surface fleet almost he hadnt replaced the stiffening wire in his whitecrowned officers cap a limp cap marked a uboat skipper every time at ease lieutenant the boss naval engineer said lemp sagged out of his brace but not very far the senior engineer was a rear admiral neither his goldencrusted sleeves nor his craggy weathered face encouraged subordinates to relax he checked some papers on the table in front of him after a moment he nodded to himself it seems your boat has been using the schnorkel longer than any other yes sir lemp answered woodenly as if the head of the board hadnt known that without looking at his precious papers and as if he and his almost equally distinguished colleagues didnt know why you were the fuckup who got stuck with the experimental gadget but the rear admiral didnt say anything like that he just stared at lemp over the tops of his reading glasses and what is your opinion of it he raised a hand before lemp spoke be frank please no one is taking written notes or rating you on your response we really want to know what you think sir ive been frank in my reports lemp said the thing is usefulno doubt about that im faster underwater with it than without i can get closer to my targets without being spotted and i can charge my batteries without surfacing those are all good cards to have in my hand drawbacks one of the other men on the board inquired itll suck all the air out of the inside of the boat and feed it to the diesels if the antiflooding valve closes lemp answered dryly that leaves the crew trying to breathe exhaust fumes and you recognize this when it starts smelling better inside the uboat eh the rear admiral asked his voice bland lemp opened his mouth then closed it again for all his forbidding appearance the senior man owned a sense of humor after all lemp tried to make himself seem as naive as he could sir i dont know what you mean all five men on the board chuckled though a couple of the noises sounded more like coughs the devil you dont the rear admiral said wrinkling his beak he glanced at the papers again and hows this beilharz the puppy who came along with the snort hes about two meters worth of puppy sir lemp said that should be fun on a uboat the senior man observed how often does he hit his head has he got any brains left at all he wears a helmetbut he is pretty good about ducking lemp replied hes pretty good all the way around i wanted a second engineering officer the way i wanted another head when he came aboardmeaning no offense to you gentlemen none at all but were crowded enough as is and you wanted the schnorkel the way you wanted another head too the rear admiral said he did understand why lemps boat had it then well anybody with three working brain cells would that too sir lemp agreed but hes worked out well he keeps the snort goingand when it isnt going he keeps the regular engineering officer posted so we dont end up asphyxiating ourselves all right thats good to hear i said we wouldnt take notes but do you mind if i write that down so it goes in his promotion jacket of course not sir lemp said ill put it in writing myself if you like never mind the rear admiral scribbled if he gets promoted away from you will you still be able to use the schnorkel oh absolutely sir hes trained a couple of my petty officers they dont quite have his feel for ithe acts like he grew up with itbut they can take care of it well enough and then some good the rear admiral didnt say i was hoping youd tell me something like that hed assumed an officer smart enough to command a uboat was smart enough to see that an important piece of equipment shouldnt depend on one mans mastery of it and hed been right lemp shuddered to think what would have happened to him had he confessed to the board that only beilharz could make the snort behave one thing he didnt have to worry about anyhow but there were others that he did a captain who hadnt spoken before said this isnt an engineering question but it is important to the performance of your boat and crew sir lemp did his best to project attentive interest are your men thoroughly loyal national socialists ready to follow the fuhrer s lead with iron determination that was the last question lemp had expected but even clausewitz had defined war as the extension of politics by other means and politics more and more got extended into this war if the rumored deal with england and france came off worry about that later lemp told himself he answered the question as simply as he could with a crisp yes sir but the captain didnt seem satisfied how do we know they are he pressed because they didnt mutiny and take the boat to england lemp swallowed the flip comeback these people and the people set over them would only hold it against him he said sir we were ashore here when the traitors tried to strike against the fuhrer not a man went over to them not a man said a word anyone could imagine disloyal we have reports that there is grumbling during cruises the captain declared lemp cast his eyes up to the heavens whatever this fellow might have done hed never made a wartime cruise in a submarine sir theyre uboat men lemp said hoping the other officers on the board had some idea of what he was talking about in case they didnt he spelled it out theyre crammed into the pressure hull the food is bad no one has a bunk or any privacy at all nobody washes much the heads dont work all the time oh and the ladsre liable to get killed id worry about them if they didnt piss and moan about the fuhrer the captain sounded disbelieving about anything and everything lemp answered as firmly as he could this cannot be permitted i dont know how you can stop it summary punishments might do the job maybe sir but i think theyd help the enemy more than us and id be surprised if you found any other uboat skippers who told you different the board members looked at one another maybe they had heard the same thing from other uboat commanders if they hadnt lemps comrades in arms had missed the chance of a lifetime to speak truth to the powers that be at last the captain who acted like the national socialist loyalty officer spoke in a grudging voice we have received no complaints about your dedication to the reich lieutenant lemp im glad to hear it sir in half a dozen words lemp spoke his own truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth if the higherups suspected him they wouldnt just beach him not the way things were since the failed coup against the fuhrer theyd fling him into a camp and things would roll downhill from there maybe something of that abject alarmtinged relief got through to the rear admiral who headed the board a smile stretched his face into angles that looked unnatural this is secondary lieutenant the data on the schnorkel are what we needed most after your refit and liberty well give you something new to try sir lemp said a oneword question he wondered if the senior man would deign to explain rather to his surprise the rear admiral did things are heating up in the baltic the ivans need their ears pinned back he spoke with unveiled contempt lemp only nodded the baltics shallow narrow waters would be different all right but any place where he didnt need to worry about the royal navy sounded goddamn good to him ummer in munster a lot of the time it seemed a contradiction in terms it could be cool or rainy or foggy in july as easily as not it could be but it wasnt always not today for instance the sun shone down from a blue blue sky it was about twentyfive degrees warm but not hot you couldnt ask for more a blackbird hopping through the longunmown park grass fluttered away from sarah goldman as she and isidor bruck came toward it he carried a picnic basket even when times were hard for everybody and harder for jews a bakers son could come up with enough rolls and such for a sundayafternoon lunch other picnicking couples and families dotted the grass it was so tall you could hardly see some of them if we dont sit too close to anybody they wont notice our stars sarah said how about over there isidor pointed its by the trees so we can go into the shade if we start to toast do you have to talk about your work all the time sarah teased they both laughed she hurried toward the spot hed suggested it was a good one so good she was surprised nobody else had taken it she spread out a couple of towels and sat down on one the grass rustled it got mowed less often than it had before the war because most of the gardeners wore feldgrau these days something small and green and manylegged jumped onto her knee she yipped and brushed it away isidor sat down beside her he opened the basket and took out rolls and ripe plumswhere had he come up with thoseand a real treasure a tin of sardines sarahs eyes widened her stomach rumbled she couldnt remember the last time shed seen any let alone tasted them a couple of bottles of beer to wash things down and ill explode she said did you rob a bank two of them isidor answered she giggled every moment where you could forget the big things and enjoy the little ones was a moment won a hundred meters away a little blond boy ran beside a yapping dog he didnt even know about the big things yet the little ones were all he had sarah envied him even now the big things intruded the plane buzzing overhead was a bf sarah didnt need to think to recognize the shape and the engine note by the way isidor raised one dark eyebrow he knew what it was right away too who in germany wouldnt these days sarah took another swig and emptied her bottle she didnt have to think about it or about anything else that wasnt right here is there any more of that beer she asked there sure is better than a stage wizard pulling a rabbit out of a hat isidor pulled another bottle out of the basket for her she drank eagerly beer helped blur the big things isidor produced a fresh bottle for himself too by the way he drained it he didnt care to see them clearly either they both tensed when a policeman wandered through the park sarah didnt look especially jewish but isidor did but the man in the black uniform with the swastika armband didnt even notice them he ambled away along with the afternoon heat seeing him prodded them to move over under the shade of the trees theyd be less noticeable in the shadowsand the grass was even longer there most of the picnickers went on basking in the sunshine they knew it might not last if their hides were red and tender tomorrow well so what isidor put his arm around her she snuggled against him the two of them against the world not quitebut although the big things blurred they didnt go away when he kissed her she responded with a fervor that probably astonished both of them if the beer couldnt do it maybe this would let her forget everything that wasnt right here at least for a little while they lay back on the blankets and the world did seem to disappearin green anyone could come up and see them anyone could but no one did isidor reached under her skirt hed tried that before but shed always slapped his hand away now now she discovered she didnt want to before long he got where he was going and gently began to rub and amazingly soon sarah got where she was going too he was still kissing her when she did which muffled the noises she made as she came back to herself she stared at the boughs swaying in the breeze above her head it was like what she sometimes did in the darklike but altogether different youre crazy she whispered crazy for you isidor answered also in a low voice this crazy he took her hand the bulge he set it on was like nothing in her nighttime aloneness what do you want me to she asked he undid his fly there it was in the open between them if anybody came by now they wouldnt get in trouble just for being jewsalthough whoever came by would know he was take it and he said awkwardly she did he gasped but after a minute or two he told her it helps if you spit in your hand so she did she didnt know if it helped her but it sure seemed to help him he gasped again on a different note and grunted none of the mess he made got on her clothes for which she was duly grateful she wiped her hand as clean as she could on the grass she didnt want to use even an old towel for that isidor quickly set himself to rights she sat up and looked around no one was rushing toward themor running off to bring the policeman back theyd got away with it all the same she said i think wed better go home whatever you want isidor said if shed told him he was on fire he would have agreed as readily he beamed at her youre wonderfuldo you know that he thought so because shed made him happy she still had a little sticky stuff on her fingers to prove it well hed made her happy the same way she hadnt known ahead of time she would let him do that but it was way too late to worry about those little details now wasnt it i think youre pretty wonderful yourself she replied and while she said it it was true as they were walking out of the park she saw a bench with a sign no jews here isidor saw it too who needs a dumb old bench anyway he said sarah squeaked could everybody see her ears were on fire but she laughed at the same time because it wasnt just scandalous it was scandalously funny the park was closer to the bakery and the flat over it than to her house but he walked her all the way back anyhow the picnic basket was lighter now which helped he kissed her decorously on the cheek outside her front door did his feet touch the ground at all as he went out to the sidewalk have a good time father asked when she came in samuel goldman was reading a volume of dio cassius in the original greek she didnt think anything a roman historian had written almost two thousand years ago accounted for the grim look on his face had isidor been so obvious that father guessed what had happened it was very nice sarah said but whats wrong if it was going to come out better to have it come out now than let it fester fathers mind was a million kilometers from what had gone on in the park and from dio cassius as well winston churchill is dead he said heavily i heard it on the radio less than an hour ago he was crossing a street in london and a bentley ran him down the driver is supposed to have been intoxicated by the way he said it he didnt believe that for a minute sarah had to shift mental gears thats bad isnt it she managed its about as much worse than bad as you can get father said churchill was the main fellow fighting the alliance against russia and to die like that he shook his head thats how hitler or mussolinior stalingets rid of people they dont play politics like that in england or they didnt till now he stared down at the open pages of dio cassius except for the bentley septimius severus might have handled it the same way maybe it really was an accident sarah said oh yes maybe it was but samuel goldman laughed harshly and maybe herr van der lubbe set the reichstag fire all by himself too that heated sarahs ears again and not in such a nice way as isidor had no one with a pfennig of sense believed the halfwitted dutch red had torched the german parliament without plenty of help from the nazis but he was the one whod lost his head for it and the fire gave the nazis whatever excuse they needed to go after the communists inside the reich for all they were worth what do you think will happen in england now she asked in a small voice im going to pretend i didnt hear you because what i think and what i hope are so different father answered after that there didnt seem to be much point to saying anything more besides she still needed to wash her hands waffenstillstand the french officer shouted across the lines willi dernen supposed that was what he was shouting anyhow he had a horrendous accent but the word for truce wasnt easy to mistake for any other and the poilus around here seemed to think the war was over the germans had been shouting at them not to shoot and they mostly hadnt till now though theyd kept out of sight so the germans couldnt shoot at them willi understood that he hadnt shown himself either trust a frenchman not likely but it looked as if france and england really were going to join the german crusade against russia willi was just glad hed stayed on this front instead of getting sent east army rumor said the reds might not be very skillful but they were goddamn mean friends the french officer yelled he did a little better with freunde pointing east he added to hell with the communists dip me in shit corporal baatz said reverently the fuhrer s gone and done it again willi would have been happy to do just what awful arno suggested he wasnt so sure about the other part of what baatz had to say i wonder what kind of deal we cut to make the enemy go for it he remarked know what i hear the corporal said no but youre gonna tell me arent you if willi sounded resigned it was only because he was the corporal nodded not noticing the resignation awful arno failed to notice all kinds of things doing his best to sound important he said i heard rudolf hess flew to england all by himself to set up the deal like everybodys heard that willi rolled his eyes in disgust its been on the news for crying out loud ja ja awful arno nodded again but i also heard he put the englishmen up to finally giving churchill what he deserved all right thats new i guess willi hated to admit it but didnt see that he had much choice and now hell come back a hero and the fuhrer will pin the fanciest medal in the world on him the knights cross with oak leaves swords and diamonds baatz sighed can you imagine it what could be better im not sure he was doing us a favor you know willi said huh what dyou mean no awful arno didnt get it willi wasnt much surprised baatz had a great headfor a cabbage the tommies and the froggies arent shooting at us any more right willi said trying to see how long the corporal would need to work it out you can see they arent baatz answered theyre going to join with us against the goddamn ivans instead willi made small soundless clapping motions very good very good you cant talk to me that way you pigdog awful arno turned dull red he was already pretty dull all right as far as willi was concerned well then take a hint willi said theyre going to help us fight the ivansyou just told me so yourself that means weve got to go fight the fucking ivans ourselves is that what you really want to do oh baatz said his mouth a black circle of dismay he tried to rally they cant be worse than what weve been facing oh no since when willi retorted you get in trouble here maybe the frenchies wont plug you when you give up what about the russians you want them to get their mitts on your carcass theyd eat you up i bet awful arno was chunkier than most german soldiers he was sensitive about the extra kilos he carried too his complexion went from dull red to fiery they dont do things like that he said but his voice lacked all conviction they dont fight fair theyre russians theyre bolsheviks i dont want em capturing me by god willi said instead of arguing any more baatz changed the subject that should have meant willi had won he supposed it did but he still wasnt happy about it because awful arno said if were on the same side now england and francell have to give back the german prisoners they took if your asshole buddy storch did run over there after all he can tell the gestapo all about it now he sounded sure all right and full of gloating anticipation oh give it a rest i think that french bombardment blew him right off the map willi said as a matter of fact he knew damn well storch had gone to surrender to the french the blackshirts would have grabbed him if he hadnt so would they get a second crack at him now that seemed horribly unfair fair and unfair though had precious little to do with the price of beer another poilu came up out of the french trenches who wants to buy tobacco who wants to buy booze he shouted wherever hed learned his german he didnt speak badly at all and he knew what the landsers wanted all right before long fieldgray and khaki mingled between the lines because of the favorable rate of exchange the occupation set many germans had more francs in their pockets than french soldiers did everybody went away from the deals happy everybody that is except people like arno baatz its fraternizing with the enemy he fumed there are regulations against things like that theres a truce willi said if theyre going to fight the russians with us they arent really the enemy any more are they dont play barracks lawyer with me dernen awful arno snapped ill have that chickenshit pip off your sleeve so fast you wont know which way to look for it zu befehl willi said thats more like it baatz growled fortunately for willi he completely missed the irony in that at your orders after a few days the ceasefire began to seem more natural soldiers from both sides met and tried to talk with one another they shared smokes and drinks as best they could in each others languages they swore at the officers whod set them shooting at one another willi had never particularly hated or even disliked france and england his father came home from the last war with high respect for the poilus hed fought even now france seemed more in the way than anything else and the tommies were as tough as anybody be funny us fighting on same side said a french soldier who could muddle along in german take orders from your generals funny ja and he stumped around as he imagined a german general would walk to willi he looked like a selfimportant rooster that wasnt willis take on his own generals but it was funny his french was much worse so he stuck to german well all clean out the russians together well a long pause from the poilu maybe he said at last whats the matter willi asked what else are we going to do why did you guys join up with us if that isnt what youve got in mind the poilu looked at him you dont know me you never find out who i am ja he seemed to be talking more to himself than to willi sure buddy willi nodded anyway you germans you do for your communists the french soldier slashed a hand across his throat to show what he meant willi nodded again the fellow in grimy khaki went on us we still have em not want to go fight against russia he eyed willi from under shaggy eyebrows not want to fight for hitler neither fuck hitler they say had he been talking to awful arno baatz would have tried to deck him and maybe started the war up again willi only shrugged what can you do about it he asked wondering if hed hear something his officers needed to know about but the poilu shrugged too a gesture more expressive less impassive than willis we all find out ja he said cross the soviet union to fight japan cross the country again going the other way this time to fight poland and germany and england and france and for all anastas mouradian knew uruguay as well hed predicted that it would happen being right didnt make him especially happy on the contraryit told him the people running the country had no more idea of what they ought to be doing than he did the fate of the ussr didnt pivot on his ideas on theirs that was a different story as far as he could tell the soviet governments main business these days was bellowing defiance against the world whenever the transsiberian railway train the almost transsiberian railway train one wag put it stopped to let passengers get out and stretch their legs loudspeakers blared out promises of death and destruction to the fascists and their reactionary capitalist running dogs posters strident in red and black showed angry clenched fists and determined workers in cloth caps carrying rifles it would have been impressive had people paid more attention to the patriotic foofaraw but the soviet authorities had been yelling at the workers and peasants at the top of their lungs for the past generation who got excited about one more propaganda campaign the authorities seemed uneasily aware that they might have a problem mouradians train had almost reached the urals when he saw new posters on walls and telegraph poles report counterrevolutionary activity and beware wreckers stalin and his henchmen suddenly seemed to realize some people might see the invaders from the west as liberators not conquerors there was another armenian on the train a pilot named hagop balian the two of them had enjoyed speaking their own language with each other mouradian was fluent in russian but that didnt mean he liked using it russian for him was like a car that wouldnt engage its top gear he could get around with it but something was missing balian felt the same way no matter how they felt they both went back to russian as soon as they saw those security posters stas didnt want ethnic russians staring at him while he used a language they couldnt understand they might decide he was plotting against the soviet union or even that he was speaking german that would be good for a trip to the gulag archipelago all right and some ethnic russians were more ignorantand prouder of being ignorantthan anyone had any business being the propaganda campaign only got louder and more strident as the train neared moscow some of the men on the platform at every stop belonged to the nkvd they so obviously belonged to the security apparatus they would have been funny if they couldnt have ruined a mans life with a single gesture the arrogant stare the aggressive forwardthrusting posture they should have come out of a bad movie but here they were in real life your papers one of them barked at mouradian when he got out to buy food here you are comrade he showed the man his military id card and the orders that sent him to moscow the chekist looked them over then grudgingly handed them back well be on your way he said his voice gruff thank you comrade mouradian said as he stashed away the precious documents a soft answer turned away wrath except of course when it didnt he bought a fatty sausage in a roll and got back on the train all right balian askedagain in russian well sure mouradian replied in the same tongue they didnt need to look at each other there was a certain tone to which russians seemed deaf people from the caucasus and jews and other semitrusted associates of the largest clan in the ussr could use it to say what they wanted right under their masters noses of course the nkvd was full of people from the caucasus and jews the masters needed to have men who could hear that note around them even if no especially since they couldnt do it themselves when they got to moscow they reported to a red air force office in the shadow of the kremlin a bored lieutenant shuffled through papers till he found mouradians dossier you served in the sb in czechoslovakia in poland and against the japanese he said stas nodded thats right and you were a pilot when you served in the far east yes i was what do you think of the sb there was a question mouradian hadnt expected cautiously he answered with the exact truth its getting old for frontline action against modern fighters but it can still do the job the lieutenant grunted which might have meant anything or nothing he made a check mark on a form mouradian couldnt read it upside down so he worried had he come all this way to get purged because of an honest response the man on the other side of the table looked up at him with eyes so pale the irises were hardly darker than the whitesrussian eyes eyes he never would have seen among his own people dangerous eyes so the other fellow said you would prefer an aircraft with higher performance if he said yes was it off to the gulag for insulting what the soviet union already had dammit he did want a plane like that though still picking his words as carefully as he could he said if such an aircraft is available yes there were rumors that new bombers were in the works but so far as he knew rumors didnt yet translate into airframes or did they the other lieutenant checked a different box on that maddeningly upsidedown form very well he said you are assigned to pilot training on the new pe medium bomber go out the door you came in turn right go past two doors and into the third room on the left theyll take care of you there i serve the soviet union stas said dazedly he went out he walked down the hall he went into the room to which the paleeyed lieutenant had sent him several other red air force officers sat in there most of them were smoking papirosi a couple sipped from glasses of tea stas went over to the samovar in the corner and got one for himself it gave him something to do another man walked in a couple of minutes later the pe the new arrival said as if he had trouble believing it only when the officers already in there nodded did heand mouradianstart to relax hagop balian came in too he looked as anxious as anastas must have before its all right stas said and hoped he meant it even now the nkvd could be lulling a room full of suspects then a short squat lieutenant colonel strode into the room you are men who have been chosen to fly the new petlyakov bomber he declared be proud for you serve the soviet union in a new way this machine makes the sb look like it just got its dick knocked off he was a russian mat came naturally to him most of the pilots in the room were russians too the sudden crudity only made them grin stas followed mat but hardly ever used it himself you had to be a russian to do it right well what are you waiting for the lieutenant colonel said come along with me and youll see whats what they went trucks waited behind the building again stas wondered if they would head to a camp instead of an airstrip he got into one anyhow the only other choice was running and he couldnt do that could he the trucks rattled out of town his rear end knew when dirt replaced paving he couldnt see out except through the back most of what he saw was the snout of another truck right behind his after an hour and a half or so the truck stopped the senior officer had ridden up front with the driver on a more comfortable seat he jumped down and yelled everybody out out stas came he smiled happilyit was an airstrip the nkvd hadnt nabbed him yet only after that thought was out of the way did he notice the planes there they had to be pesthey sure werent anything hed ever seen before and they made the sb look like it just got its dick knocked off they were lean and longnosed they looked more like german bfs than any other plane stas could think of off the top of his head and they werent much bigger theyd be fast the way the sb had seemed fast when it was new and theyd pack a punch too all of a sudden stas wished he could do that paleeyed lieutenant a favor because the fellow had sure done one for him even though shanghai lay under japanese occupation hollywood movies still reached the theaters not right away of course the wizard of oz must have been out in the states for a year before it crossed the pacific and the sea of japan but here it was at last by himself or with his buddies from the corps pete mcgill would have chosen a western or a gangster movie or maybe a french flick with a bunch of chorus girls highkicking in their scanties holding hands with vera like a lovestruck teenager the scarecrow and the tin woodman and the cowardly lion seemed a better bet he knew the story hed read the oz books and had them read to him when he was a kid most americans had vera hadnt so she didnt and she gasped when kansas blackandwhite turned to the technicolor land of oz well pete almost gasped too that and the trick photography and the songanddance numbers were pretty amazing even if it wasnt a movie he would have chosen for himself this wizard in the emerald city he will help them vera whispered in petes ear shed got into the spirit of it all right he cared more about the feel of her warm moist breath than about all the wizards in the world put together smiling he whispered youll find out back at her down the yellow brick road capered dorothy with toto and their unlikely companions from oz in the distance lay the emerald city its palaces gleamed against the painted sky if you couldnt find what you were looking for in a place like that you probably couldnt find it anywhere and they were on their way the bomb in the theater went off just before they got there one second pete was listening to swelling cheerful music and watching colors brighter than any hed see in real life the next there was a roar and a crash the theater went dark in the same split second as two walls and part of the ceiling fell in as soon as pete heard the explosion he tried to throw himself flat and to sweep vera down with him he reacted at a level far below conscious thoughthe was a trained marine he was halfway to the grimy threadbare carpet when something clipped him behind the ear and darkness deeper than the one inside the movie house engulfed him some while laterhe never knew how longhe came back to himself without fully realizing hed been knocked for a loop he kept trying to yank vera down to the deck only then did he notice she wasnt in the circle of his left arm any more and only after that did he notice that every square inch of himself with the possible exception of the soles of his feet hurt like hell he couldnt account for why not at first had a bunch of japs decided to stomp him this felt even worse than he thought that should have then memory as opposed to reflex came back hed been watching the movie thered been warnings the chinese underground was getting frisky one of the things they shouted at you over and over while you were a boot was anything that can happen can happen to you be ready for it he hadnt been ready enough or had he he was still here anyhow wherever here was vera he saidor tried to say only a croak emerged his mouth was full of blood and what he guessed was plaster dust when he spat a chunk of tooth came out with all the glop that at the moment was the least of his worries vera he said again this time he could more or less understand himself a face appeared above him one second it wasnt there the next it was so it seemed to him anyhow he was still drifting in and out of consciousness the face wasnt veras it belonged to a skinny middleaged chinese man next thing pete knew the fellows hand was in his pocket grabbing for his wallet he tried to knock it away but his right arm didnt want to do what he told it to the chinese man disappeared so did petes cash then another chinese looked him over this guy spoke to him in bad french dont get it pete managed ah the chinese man said and tried again in english you hurt where hurt fucking everywhere pete said he tried to use his right arm to point the pain almost drove him under arm especially he gasped to his surprise the chinese man produced a syringe from a small leather case and gave him a shot he felt better right away if that wasnt morphine he didnt know what it would be as he drifted toward sleep on a warm cloud of contentment the chinese man started bandaging him a doc was petes last clear thought how about that when he really came back to himself he was inside the american consulate the shot was wearing off every nerve screamed the navy doc who took care of the marines didnt want to give him more dope you aim to end up a junkie the white man asked right now buddy i dont give a fuck pete said fervently muttering the navy doctor stuck him this time pete didnt go away as the pain receded wheres vera hows she doing he asked as soon as he could think of anything outside his own torment the woman you were with unfortunately did not survive the explosion the doctor answered his voice disapproving i was told she must have died very quickly and did not suffer pete wailed even drugged even with his own hurts still tormenting him he yipped like a puppy taken from its mother tears poured down his face he wanted to kill the doctor for telling him something like that he wanted to call the man a liar too he wanted that more than anything but he knew he couldnt have it she cant be dead he said i loved her im sorry son the navy doctor didnt sound one bit sorry you ask me the chinese arent doing themselves any good with these terror bombs the western powers will just decide japan can do whatever she wants to put down maniacs like that i bet the chinks are a bunch of reds trying to give stalin a helping hand pete hardly heard him hed just betrayed his own hopes i loved her morphine didnt keep him from noting the dreadful finality of that past tense he believed vera was gone how could he live without her he had no idea he didnt much want to try he wailed again that made the doctor give him another shot this one wasnt morphine it knocked him for a loop whatever it was when he woke up it was the following afternoon he didnt want to believe that but the strips of sunlight coming in through windows he knew faced west gave him no choice he looked around the sick bay he was the only guy in it if any other marines had been watching the wizard of oz theyd either got off scotfree or theyd bought the whole farm the doctor walked over to him when he saw him awake how are you doing the man asked awful pete said honestly i believe it fractures abrasions contusions youre lucky to be here some luck pete wanted to wail again not for himself but for his lost love i am going to recommend that we evacuate you to manila the doctor said as he stuck pete once more now he wasnt going on about addicting him hed had a better chance to see how badly hurt pete was and maybe he hoped the morphine would help dull the pain in petes soul along with the one filling his battered carcass that was a forlorn hope whats wrong with the hospitals here pete asked i want to be near he couldnt go on he choked up instead you cant do anything for her here the doc said youve got to know that it isnt like you two were married or anything and besides any excuse that lets us get our personnel out of here we take hospitals here are still here and we cant protect you if youre in one of them protect him from whom more chinese bombers the japs himself no they couldnt protect him from any of those and he couldnt protect himself either ll right it wasnt all right not even slightly but luc harcourt wasnt about to admit it till he found out what the hell was going on here since he didnt know he asked what the hell is going on here one of the poilus in front of him had a fat lip the other had a mouse under one eye they glared at each other as if they would sooner have tangled with machine guns than with fists fat lip jerked a thumb at mouse sergeant this con is a filthy communist he says he doesnt want to fight the russians no matter what kind of orders we get merde luc said wearily hed been waiting for this kind of crap to break out the only thing that surprised him was how long it had taken did you really say that boileau were you really that dumb you bet i did sergeant the man with the shiner sounded proud of his own stupidity he gave his accuser a withering glance and paul here isnt just a squealer the fairy wants to suck hitlers cock listen to me luc said listen hard because this is your first last and only chance you cant make a mutiny you cant disobey orders or tell other people to disobey orders if you do theyll shoot you have you got that through your thick wooden head well have you i hear you boileau answered i know you have to come out with that kind of garbage but youre a proletarian too right wheres your class consciousness i bet one man in three wont follow orders to attack the heartland of the glorious socialist revolution your precious government cant shoot all of us to the barricades he thrust a clenched fist in the air quit trying to sound like victor hugo luc said which earned him a wounded look you ought to have the military gendarmerie take him away sergeant paul said hes talking sedition boileau thrust his arm in the air again this time in a nazi salute paul jumped on him they fell to the ground slugging and swearing cut it out luc yelled cut it out goddammit when they didnt he kicked them both with savage impartiality for a bad moment he wondered if that would make them gang up on him fortunately it didnt they separated now boileau had two black eyes while paul whose last name luc couldntand didnt want toremember was bleeding from the nose save it for the enemy will you luc snapped they might have been doing a vaudeville turn out in the provinces their timing impeccable they pointed at each other and chorused hes the enemy no nom dun nom no luc said were all frenchmen together we do what the government tells us or were all screwed together we do what the government tells us and were all screwed together boileau said the communist soldier walked away rubbing at sore ribs are you going to let him get away with that the rightist soldier demanded indignantly paul yes sergeant why dont you fuck off luc made it a friendly suggestion under it though lay the warning that he would whale the kapok out of paul if the private didnt fuck off paul eyed him considering the sergeants hash mark didnt change pauls mind lucs look of anticipation was a different story muttering paul departednot in the same direction boileau had chosen that was good anyhow it was the only good thing luc could see about the situation he did what he did when he didnt know what else to do he hunted up lieutenant demange if anybody was above or maybe below politics demange was the man he hated the whole human race white black yellow brown and red luc poured out his tale of woe finishing how many sergeants are trying to deal with this shit right now all over france what can i do about it what can anybody do about it were liable to have a civil war on our hands yeah i know demange said the perpetual gitane in the corner of his mouth twitching as he spoke you arent the first guy whos come to me up in arms about it either what can i do luc asked again sounds like you did what you couldand i hope you booted both those assholes good and hard demange said as long as they remember theyre soldiers and do what you tell em were all right if they dont his ferret face screwed up in a nasty grimace if they dont its gonna be worse than ai luc winced any frenchman would have things in had got mighty bad after one more failed offensive against the boches whole divisions of the french army had mutinied a combination of executions and granted privileges kept things below the point of full explosion but barely the army was useless for the rest of the year the germans could have walked over it in the spring or summer if theyd ever learned about the mutinies somehow they didnt germans could be blind in the most peculiar ways demange glanced east german soldiers wandered around out in the open confident the ceasefire would hold part of the deal was that they would evacuate france once the french and english went into action with them against russia but they were still here now want to find out what they think about it demange asked with a sour sneer i already know theyre laughing their nuts off luc said bitterly you dont want to fight alongside em either do you demange said no more than you do luc answered i dont mind shooting russians plenty of russians nobodyd miss for a minute i bet but son of a bitch lieutenant marching with the fucking nazis its like you said to your privatesif they tell us do it weve got to do it demange said will i jump up and down about it not a goddamn prayer i will but maybe itll turn out for the besti dunno fat chance sir luc said sorry kid i dont know what else to tell you the older man said this is what theyve cooked for us and weve got to eat it even if it tastes like shit even then demange sounded disgusted but he nodded no matter how crappy it tastes mutinyd taste worse theyd beat on you for causing trouble and then theyd make you do what you mutinied to try and get out of that struck luc as much too likely all the same he said not if the mutineers won demange laughed in his face good fucking luck it happened in luc said stubbornly demange laughed some more and what did they end up with the revolution and the terror and napoleon and napoleon he was the hitler of his day by god he marched em all over everywhere and they got their balls shot off while they were yelling vive lempereur pretty fucking lucky right thank you lieutenant luc said demange raised a questioningor more likely a challengingeyebrow luc explained whenever i feel lousy you can always find a reason i should feel worse demanges brief grin showed irregular smokeyellowed teeth he took off his helmet and bowed with a flourish as if he were a nineteenthcentury musketeer doffing a plumed beribboned broadbrimmed hat at your service mon petit ami luc made gagging noises the lieutenant chuckled coughed and chuckled again youre stuck with it you may as well enjoy it as much as you can thats what you told her right this time demange laughed out loud luc was proud of himself he could count on the fingers of one hand the times hed really amused the veteran that thought swung him in a new direction he was a veteran himself and had been for a while now and what had it got him more worriesthat was all he could see the division tramped east back toward the german border the men went proudlyit wasnt as if they were defeated troops out in front of each regiment bandsmen with swallows nests on their shoulders played marching tunes with tubas and trumpets and drums some of the men sang as they marched willi dernen remembered his father talking about the endless singing as the kaisers army headed for the last war those poor bastards hadnt known what they were getting into though they found out pretty damn quick willi had already been through the mill he didnt feel like making noise besides awful arno made enough racket for the whole squad maybe for the whole platoon baatz couldnt carry a tune in a wheelbarrow but he loudly insisted on trying he was trying all righttrying to everybody who had to listen to his godawful noise short of taping baatzs mouth or his own ears shut willi didnt know what to do about that they marched and sang their way through a french village no one came out to bid them farewell willi didnt care he was as glad to see the last of the place as the villagers were to see him gone as long as nobody opened up on the departing germans with a longhidden varmint rifle he was happy under the singing he remarked on that to the fellow marching beside him the other landser nodded but sure as hell arno baatz owned a pair of rabbit ears despite everyones singingincluding his own raucous effortsawful arno heard the lowvoiced remark he stopped caterwauling the tune to speak in pompous tones dont be silly dernen security forces confiscated all the french firearms lists of registered weapons at the police stations made it easy without waiting for an answer he started abusing the music again willi wouldnt have answered him anyway except perhaps with a snort of derision the gestapo might have got most of the registered weapons but what about the ones that werent there were bound to be some and probably lots werent the froggies people like everybody else thered be guns they wanted to keep quiet about either because they didnt feel like dealing with the police or because they used those guns in ways the flics wouldnt fancy and so he wasnt very surprised when a couple of francstireurs took potshots at the regiment in front of his from the woods off to one side of the road the officers in charge of that outfit didnt seem surprised either even if awful arno was they sent a whole company into the woods to dig out the obstreperous frenchmen when the germans came back emptyhanded willi also wasnt very surprised the frenchies would have had a line of retreat worked out or else a hiding place good enough for them to trust their lives to it you didnt open up on a regiment unless you figured you could get away with it optimistic amateurs opened up on the soldiers twice more before they got to the border the second time the germans did hunt down one of them two landsers dragged his body out of the woods by the feet they tied it upside down to a stout tree branch as a warning to others if the french were on the germans side now they needed to act like it willi didnt breathe easy till his unit crossed back into germany it wasnt far from where he and wolfgang storch had scouted out the hesitant french invaders going on two years ago now he looked around for someone to tell that to the only other man close by whod been there then was arno baatz willi kept his mouth shut when they marched through a village in the reich schoolchildren waving swastika flags cheered from the sidewalk willi would rather have looked at older girls but what could you do they took the landsers to a barracks hall gott im himmel willi said everythings so clean and so neat another soldier added fresh white paint gleamed on the walls it was a new coat willi could still smell it the cots and footlockers were laid out as if they were part of a study in geometry and perspective the cots iron frames had got a fresh coat of black paint not a single light fixture held a burntout bulb it almost seemed wrong to have real live soldiersdirty smelly men in grimy uniforms all torn and patched foulmouthed lazy smokers and snuff dippers and spittersprofane a place as sterile as an operating theater that didnt keep them from claiming cots and plopping packs on the dark wool blankets they stripped off their uniforms and headed for the communal showers willi wrinkled his nose at the soldier next to him are those your feet konrad or did somebody die in your boots its your aunties twat is what it is konrad answered laughing they went off to clean up the landsers splashed one another and flicked towels at behinds like the boys theyd been not long before but few boys came with the many and various scars the soldiers wore few boys came with the lines on their faces either or the eyes that seemed to look everywhere at once what are they going to feed us somebody asked and that was the next good question dead russian somebody else said the laughs that followed were nervous it sounded like a joke but not enough like one what they did end up getting was the usual army swill potatoes and sauerkraut and smelly cheese and sardines there was plenty of it willi patted his belly after he finished but field kitchens scrounging off the french countryside turned out better chow so did soldiers heating up rations and leftovers and whatever the hell for themselves to the cooks it was just another job they cared about getting it over with not about making it good as a gefreiter willi didnt have to worry about getting tapped for washing dishes or any of the other enjoyable duties doled out to lowly privates he flopped down onto the cot and made the world go away simply by closing his eyes one of the lights blazed right above his head other soldiers were playing cards and talking and generally making nuisances of themselves he didnt care he was sound asleep less than two minutes after his head hit the pillow the regiment had four days furlough in the little village willi got drunk at the bierstube the lager was weak but that only meant you needed to drink more and piss more he tried to pick up a blond barmaid she laughed at him awful arno was more direct he grabbed her ass she hauled off and slapped him hard enough to spin his head around the soldiers packing the place clapped and cheered everybody loved the corporal willi was nursing a headache when they marched away one of the other soldiers said i wonder if the froggiesll be using that hall now that were clearing out theyre welcome to it as long as they come shoot ivans with us willi said i just wish i could hang around and watch one of em try to feel up that gal at the tavern silence in the ranks dernen awful arno shouted furiously he hadnt cared about anyone else talking in the ranks and even the routine order didnt satisfy himhe scowled at willi and added shut the fuck up yes corporal willi said sometimes the smartest thing you could do was exactly what they told you along with everybody else he climbed aboard a train as far as he knew this was the same route hed taken when he went home on leave sure as hell the train rolled through breslau most of the men came from these parts some of them waved out the windows not that it was likely anyone whod recognized them would see this time the train didnt stop at his old stomping grounds it kept going up to the polish border and beyond at the border one polish soldier came aboard each car as if to say this is our country poles were proud touchy people willid seen that in breslau a lot of them lived there it might be their country but more and more it was germanys fight what would come of that a bunch of dead germans willi thought and hoped like hell he wouldnt end up one of them winston churchill got a heros funeral that didnt make alistair walsh any happier about the politicians demise if anything it only threw petrol on his suspicions assorted conservative party dignitaries walked behind the hearse and a riderless black horse with polished black boots reversed in the stirrups at the politicians head strode neville chamberlain the prime minister reminded walsh of nothing so much as a gray heron with a black bowler and an umbrella the day was sunny but the umbrella seemed at least as much a part of him as say his small intestine walsh shook his head everybody knew the pm always had his umbrella whether he had guts wasnt nearly so obvious why were the tories laying on a memorial like this for a man most of them couldnt stand come to that how and why had churchill walked in front of a speeding bentley important people didnt do such things did they not very oftenwalsh was bloody sure of that guilty consciences he thought unhappily as the slow funeral procession passed him thats what it smells like to me he wondered if there wasnt also a touch of guilt in the way the authorities hemmed and hawed about returning him to duty he wouldnt have stayed in london to watch the funeral procession if theyd been sure what to do with him why the devil did i have to be the one who saw rudolf hess come down somebody had to but why me quite a few men in army khaki royal navy deep blue and raf bluegray lined the route of the procession like walsh many of them doffed their caps in silent tribute when the hearse rolled by they werent so silent when chamberlain followed several hisses floated through the warm damp summer air so did calls of shame chamberlain might have been oblivious his small head set atop a long neck and tall thin angular frame only made him seem the more birdlike had he suddenly thrust forward and straightened up again with a wriggling fish clenched in his jaws walsh wouldnt have been surprised but no the prime minister passed close enough to let walsh see a small muscle under his left eye twitch walsh wouldnt have believed chamberlain had been issued a conscience at birth but he might have been wrong behind the pm walked lord halifax if chamberlain looked like a heron halifax resembled a walking thermometer he was talleven taller than the prime ministerand lean with a big bald head that looked like a rugby ball standing on end he smiled at something the man next to him said assuming hed ever come equipped with a conscience it wasnt troubling him now not all the spectators were military mennot even close there were many ordinary civilians housewives and greengrocers and shopgirls and chemists and secretaries and clerks almost all of them wore somber black to pay their respects to the dead man some of the women dabbed at tears behind dark veils churchill had always been more popular among the people than the gray men who held the reins of power unlike them he was a recognizable human being having met him walsh knew how very human he was and because he was a recognizable human being he roused dislike as well as admiration a furlong or so down the street from walsh stood a knot of silver shirts supporters of oswald mosleys british union of fascists they were in uniform something walsh hadnt seen since war was declared he thought there was a law against it but he wasnt sure if there was the authorities were looking the other way the silver shirts bawled organized abuse as churchills body rolled past them the man standing to walshs right nodded thats telling the daft old bugger he declared think so do you walsh asked in conversational tones well yes as a matter of fact i do the man was younger and larger than walsh what about it sport walsh slugged him in the jaw he was a veteran of the front and of years of bar fights nothing in his expression or the direction in which he looked warned that he was about to do anything at all the chap who liked the silver shirts better than churchill never knew what hit him he toppled as if all his bones had turned to gravy a bobby rushed up ere what did you go and do that for staff sergeant he was about walshs age no doubt hed done a tour in the trenches the last time around to recognize the noncoms rank emblem so readily he spoke ill of the dead walsh answered quietly thats righthe did a woman behind walsh said like that was it spoke ill of winnie did e with im on is way to the grave the bobby clicked his tongue between his teeth ill let you off with a caution then but take yourself somewhere else before e comes to like obliged officer take himself elsewhere walsh duly did he steered clear of the band of silver shirts he would only have got into another fight and against so many he wouldnt have come off well another man of about his own age this one wearing the uniform of a chief petty officer came after him will you let me buy you a pint friend the royal navy man said or a shot or whatever your pleasure may be if you hadnt coldcocked that bastard idve landed on him with you he looked like a good man to have on your side in a fight he was strong and stocky and plainly knew his way around walsh gave his name and stuck out his hand the cpo took it he had a grip like a vise douglas green at your service the cheek of those mosley maniacs to heckle churchill when hes not even in the ground id like to break all their heads i would save a few for me by god walsh answered if we are where i think we are there ought to be a pub around this corner and half a block down they were there was the two veterans went in together walsh ordered a pint of bitter green a whiskey they raised their glasses together to winston they chorused and they both drank amen the bartender said he was a right good one he was not like the cabbageheads running things nowadays he had to be over sixty his bushy mustache was white as fine flour you blokes mind if i turn up the wireless a bit theyve got the ceremony on and i dont hear so good when other folks are talking at the same time as what im listening to go ahead walsh said i know what you mean age hadnt dulled his hearing not yet countless bullets going off near his ear had though in hushed tones a bbc broadcaster said the cortege now approaches st pauls inside after the customary prayers and a sermon from the archbishop of canterbury the prime minister will say a few words oh winstond love that he would the barman said if he wasnt already dead itd kill him walsh agreed bore him to death douglas green put in the man behind the bar liked that so much he gave them the next round on the house walsh drank up though none too happily the last funeral the bbc had broadcast was george vs four and a half years earlier like the rest of the obsequies this worried walsh instead of comforting him churchill hadnt been in power why were the present rulers making such a show of these rites if not to make the public look away from them see how sorry we are hes dead they might have been saying they might have been but walsh didnt think they were prayers and sermon were almost invincibly conventional william cosmo gordon lang senior prelate of the church of england couldnt have been duller if he were neville chamberlain or so walsh thought till chamberlain took the microphone england has lost a patriot the pm said and we shall go on to accomplish his desires that almost made walsh choke on his beer how was chamberlain going to justify such an enormous lie he did his best early on winston churchill recognized the dangers and evils of bolshevism after the last war britain attempted to nip the canker in the bud sadly we failed then despite churchills best efforts this time with gods help we shall succeed his claque in st pauls applauded gods help what about hitlers green said churchill knew germany was dangerous before anybody ever heard of bolsheviks walsh added will chamberlain say anything about that neville chamberlain said not a word hey you sergeant yes you whatever your name is fujita sir hideki fujita sprang to attention and saluted at your service sir he hoped he wasnt in trouble evidently not the captain had been at japans research center at pingfan longer than fujita hadhow much longer the sergeant had no idea but the man who seemed to be a doctor or scientist as well as an officer wasnt especially harsh now that he had fujitas attention he said only fetch me two maruta right away two logs yes sir fujita saluted again then he asked do you need a particular kind of log sir or will any of them do good question the captain actually smiled at a noncom which had to prove he didnt come out of the regular army let me have a couple from the ones you just brought here right away sir with one more salute fujita hurried off the size the scale of the pingfan complex astonished him it was six kilometers square before he got here people were calling it a village there had been a chinese village named pingfan here japanese authorities had driven off the natives except for the ones whom theyd put to work building what they needed this wasnt a village any more it was a city with its own railroad spur it had a swimming pool and even a geisha house not for the likes of him for the officers and it had the tightest security hed ever seen anywhere the outer fence was electrified with killing voltage so were the compounds that housed the maruta each compoundand the outer perimeteralso boasted plenty of barbed wire and machine guns atop towers that could sweep wide areas with fire the relatively weak gatesby the nature of things they couldnt be electrifiedhad large guard contingents at all times and all that was just the outer reaches of pingfan the citadel where the scholarly captain worked had a solid wall five meters high so no one on the outside could see what went on within more barbed wire and electrified wire topped the wall nobody inside could come out without permission from those in authority it also worked the other way around fujita didnt know what went on inside that citadel asking questions was strongly discouragedwhich understated things as fujita had seen elsewhere there were things about which it was better not to get too curious he approached the lieutenant in charge of one of the gate garrisons saluting he said sir captaini think his name is sugiyama please excuse me but im new herewell anyway he needs two russian logs right away captain sugiyama the lieutenant slowly nodded yes i know him all right sergeant wait here ill get them for you thank you very much sir after a brief colloquy with the lieutenant one of the men from the garrison shouted into the pow compound in russian a couple of the prisoners fujita had helped escort from vladivostok shambled up to the gateway they were scrawny filthy and shaggyhardly human beings at all to the sergeants eyes no wonder the japanese called the prisoners here logs at that the pows whod made it to pingfan were the lucky ones ravens and vultures and foxes and flies feasted on the flesh of the thousands of russians whod died along the way the japanese had marched them hard and fed them little why take pains for men whod surrendered two squads of soldiers aimed their rifles into the compound as the pair of volunteers came forth no one who wasnt authorized would come out and the prisoners wouldnt try a mass escape as soon as the two maruta emerged the japanese soldiers closed the gate again and snapped all the locks shut the posts to which the locks were affixed were steel and were mounted in concrete nobody without a bulldozer or more likely a tank could knock them down one of the russians gave fujita a doglike grin pointing to the inner citadel he spoke in broken japanese good food in hai hai good food fujita agreed for all he knew it was true plenty of supplies went in there maybe the maruta got their fair share of them who could say for sure no one on the outside and the hope helped keep the russians docile he gestured with his rifle you go now go they did the one who knew some japanese translated for his companion even if he hadnt the gesture should have been unmistakable neither of the large smelly men gave fujita any trouble that was all he cared about an armored door to the citadel opened the russians went inside the door closed in fujitas face he couldnt even see anything interesting beyond the wall khaki canvas screened whatever was in there away from prying eyes not all the prisoners in the outer area were russians there were also pens full of chinese maruta some of them were soldiers whod been taken in battle the war between japan and china dragged on and on no end in sight but others were prisoners from jails in manchukuo and japaneseoccupied china and there were pens full of women and children where they came from fujita didnt know he did know the men in the citadel sometimes called for female logs and he knew how the chinese arrived in big black vans without any windows every so often one or more of them would pass through the outer perimeter and disgorge the people it carried some of the chinese were in bad shape when they came out that didnt bother fujita as far as he was concerned the chinese deserved everything they got one day a fancy black mercedes convertiblenot at all the kind of car anyone would expect to see on manchukuos wretched roadspulled into pingfan out jumped a tall japanese in colonels uniform he wore an upswept mustache as if he came from the meiji era everyone fussed over him and all but kowtowed before him so this is colonel ishii fujita thought impressed in spite of himself unit at pingfan was colonel shiro ishiis creation he was a bacteriologist a waterpurification expert and a regular army officer this was the first time fujita had seen him he was just back from a trip to japan lets see how things are going he shouted and took off on a whirlwind inspection tour junior officers hurried along in his wake this was a doctor most of the physicians fujita had seenand pingfan was crawling with themwere shy selfeffacing quiet fellows not ishii he had a big booming voice and an abrupt aggressive manner he went here there everywhere always barking out questions when he liked the answers he got he grinned and patted a subordinate on the back when he didnt he glowered and shouted and shook his fist in peoples faces he acted a lot like a sergeant dealing with privates in other words fujita wouldnt have been surprised had he actually belted somebody but he didnt or not where the real sergeant could see him no real sergeant would have hurled around the technical terms colonel ishii used he talked about infection rates and vectors and plague and cholera and typhoid and paratyphoid he talked about rodent breeding and insect breeding he talked about anthrax and glanders and horses and cattle and spores much of it flew straight over fujitas head except that he recognized it as scientific ishii talked too much as far as fujita was concerned but how could a sergeant say something like that to a senior officer simplehe couldnt i may be going off again before too long either back to japan for another lecture or off to south china to see what happens when we put some of what weve learned into action ishii told his men even when im gone though i know youll carry on with the work isnt that right hai they chorused we are protecting japan we are serving the emperor isnt that right ishii shouted hai the men repeated louder this time good very good the colonel who was also a bacteriologist nodded apparently satisfied any country foolish enough to make japan angry will regret it for ten thousand years and isnt that right too hai everyone yelled again he next time chaim weinberg ran into la martellita it wasnt because he was looking for her it was because he got a pass to go back into madrid and happened to walk into the bar where she was already drinking madrid had a lota devil of a lotof bars it was just dumb luck after the way shed sliced him to pieces outside party headquarters he was damned if he thought it was good luck his wounds were still fresh enough to hurt he didnt go over to her or try to pick her up he just ordered a beer and some olives and crackers and sat down at a little table where he could look at her without making a pest of himself doing it she was already drunk and getting drunker no doubt hoping to take advantage of her the guy beside her set a confident spanish hand on her knee chaim wanted to do things like that so confidently he wanted to flap his arms and fly too confident or not the spaniard misread the signs la martellita picked up his beer mug threw the beer in his face and broke the mug over his head madre de dios he shrieked beer and blood running down his cheeks and dripping from his nose and chin what did you do that for to teach you to keep your hands to yourself you shitheaded motherfucking noballs faggot she answered and went on from there spanish was a good language to swear in and chaim realized he was listening to a modern master like the beer and his own blood it all rolled off the spaniard with immense dignity he accepted a towel from the bartender and patted himself dry when he saw how much blood splotched the towel he mournfully shook his head he got to his feet which impressed chaim after a clop like that the guy might have had a fractured skull he actually bowed to la martellita you dont need to worry about that any more not with me he said you may be a whore but you are a frigid whore he turned and walked out he was taking a chanceshe might have knifed him in the back or chased after him and beaten him to peanut butter all she did though was give him more details on where to go and how to get there then to chaims alarm she picked up her glass of whiskey or brandy or whatever the hell it was and carried it over to his table unlike the hardheaded spaniard she wobbled when she walked she plopped herself down across from him with a warning glare dont you start anything she snapped breathing highproof fumes in his face what you think im loco he said i like my head its the only one ive got i dont want you to break it for me youd better not she said fiercely then she took another big swig from her glass how many times had she already emptied it quite a few if chaim was any judge she slammed the glass down slopping a little booze over the edge and then she started to cry weeping belligerent shikker women care and management of was a manual chaim hadnt read hell he didnt even know where they issued it whats the matter he asked you still mad at that guy she stared at him as if she thought he was even more cretinous than usual claudio oh no hes just an asshole she answered but the revolution in spain is rururuined she had to try three times before she could get the word out it made her cry harder than ever eyeliner and mascara dribbled down her face she dabbed at her eyes with a dirty handkerchief chaim wanted to cuddle her and comfort her and tell her everything would be fine he would sooner have tried it with a rattlesnake all he said was were doing fine the nationalists havent beaten us yet and they wont the look she gave him then made him think hed have to study to be a cretin where will our munitions come from she said england and france have jumped into bed with the nazis do you think theyll keep sending arms to the progressive elements here it will be even worse than it was before the big war started if she was right the spanish republic was to use a technical term screwed but chaim only shrugged they werent sending us much before he said they were using the stuff themselves they kept the sanjurjo junta from getting any though la martellita said she hiccuped whether drunkenly or because shed been crying chaim couldnt tell now they wont he shrugged again if germany is fighting the russians right next door she wont have much to spare for the halfassed fascists way the hell over here this time she eyed him like a floating spar in the middle of the ocean do you really think so she asked he wondered if he could get plastered on her breath what a way to go he thought dizzily sure he said with yet another upanddown of the shoulders you wait well whip the bastards yet instead of answering she upended the glass and waved peremptorily for a refill chaim recognized the brandy bottle the barman brought to the table that shit was a distilled artillery barrage shed regret it come morning jesus would she ever but she poured down some more with muzzy suspicion she said maybe youre trying to soften me up so you can go to bed with me no he said and the regret in his voice was plangent i dont want you to kill me and i dont want sanjurjos pendejos to kill me either thats what you say but even la martellita couldnt make herself sound too angry at him he nodded yes that is what i say what can you do after you get killed she considered his foolishness with drunken gravity then she thrust out an accusing forefinger at him you were very silly there outside the party offices you looked like a boy who couldnt get the candy he wanted asi es la vida chaim used that one a lot when you spoke a language badly cliches came in handy and so it goes was better than bursting into tears the way she had he thought it was anyhow la martellita wagged the finger his way you still want the candy well so what he hadnt drunk a lot of beer but he could feel his temper fraying shed drive a saint to armed robbery not without bitterness he added who wouldnt youre smart youre beautiful youre he stopped dammit he didnt know how to say sexy in spanish what the hell he said it in english instead she understood it he saw that right away he wondered if hed get a faceful of brandy with a glass chaser the way shed baptized luckless claudio with beer but you dont try groping me she said and drank some of the vicious stuff instead of flinging it yet another shrug not american style not my style just coming to see you took all the nerve i had la martellita got to her feet chaim was amazed she could i am going home she announced as if challenging him to doubt her he scrambled out of his chair ill help you get there i dont need nobodysanybodys help she swayed caught herself and giggled well maybe i do out into the blackedout night there was a moon which helped some he hoped like hell she remembered where she lived he also hoped it wasnt far she lurched like a schooner in contrary winds once all that brandy kicked in she was going to keel over he didnt grope her except incidentally but by the time they got to her block of flats he was pretty much holding her upright he didnt quite carry her up the stairs to the third floor but close then along the hallway this one she said he hoped she was right otherwise whoever lived in there would think he was getting burgled the key worked they went in nobody screamed or opened fire la martellita swiped at a wall switch by some miracle she hit it a blackout curtain kept the light inside the flat was tiny a bed a chair a chest a small bookshelf with a radio on top a sink a hot plate the toilet and bathtub had to be down the hall chaim had lived in places like that she made it to the bed fell onto it and smiled at him or maybe at the low ceiling she was gassed lord was she ever a gentleman would have left and hated himself ever afterwards as chaim had told more than one spaniard he was no gentleman and no matter how drunk she was she wouldnt have brought him here if she didnt think he would try something would she only one way to find out he turned off the light and advanced on the bed she might hate him in the morning in the morning though shed hate the whole goddamn world whatever happened in the morning hed worry about it then along with the rest of the forces of the czech governmentinexile vaclav jezek stood at attention a couple of kilometers behind the nowquiet line a french major was going to address them it wasnt as if the son of a bitch spoke czech that would have been too much to hope for sergeant benjamin halevy stood at his elbow to translate the major had the grace to look faintly embarrassed he coughed into his hand a couple of times before beginning gentlemen the republic of france owes you a debt of gratitude when times were hard you came to our aid and now youre going to sell us down the river you piece of shit a man not far behind vaclav shouted sergeant halevy translated that for the major though probably not all of it the frenchman coughed again well you see gentlemen the situation has changed recently he said more jeers from the czechs youre fucking hitler nowhes not fucking you the russians really helped us thats more than you ever did and a rising chorus that drowned out all the individual insults shame vaclav joined in baying the word at the top of his lungs we do not abandon men who have helped us the french major said stiffly under no circumstances will we allow the germans to take control of you we understand that your authorities are still at war with them even if that ah no longer obtains for us halevy was a good translator he even put in the officers hems and haws and imitated his tone very well but so what the bottom line was even if the nazis didnt get hold of this battered detachment france would screw the czechs for them the major proceeded to explain just how france would screw them if you wish to remain in france as civilians you may do that if you wish to be interned in switzerland which remains neutral you may also do that he didnt say france would do anything for the czechs stay here vaclav didnt know the language and didnt much want to learn more likely than not hed starve before he could switzerland hed already been interned in poland the swiss would probably be friendlier about itlike most czechs he didnt think poles were nice peoplebut even so or there is another possibility the french major went on this would have to be done unofficially you understand despite altered circumstances we still maintain diplomatic relations with the spanish republic you would need to enter on tourist visas issued by your governmentinexile and we would have no formal knowledge of your doing so but if once you were there you continued to uphold your cause we would be able to say with a clear conscience that it was none of our doing now that they were licking the germans boots they didnt want to piss off the people wearing said boots that was what it came down to even a corporal like vaclav jezek didnt need field glasses to see it suppose we go after you traitors instead another czech yelled vaclav wondered if sergeant halevy would translate that he evidently did because the major performed a classic gallic shrug he spoke briefly halevy put it into czech also briefly that would be unfortunatefor you vaclav found himself nodding he didnt want to but he also didnt see that he had much choice the czechs had numbered about a regiments worth of men when they went into action in france theyd taken more casualties than replacements since they had no tanks or even armored cars they could annoy the french if they rebelled but that was about all spain he spat in disgust it would be another losing war the republic was fucked the same way the czechs were politics had got ahead of it and now it was going under in the backwash what were the nazis doing to prague what were they doing to the rest of bohemia and moravia next to no news came out of czechoslovakia these days but the answer had to be nothing good god will punish you for selling out freedom another czech shouted shaking his fist at the major it had nothing to do with god vaclav understood that very well france had decided that getting out of the war with germany would work to her advantage england had reached the same conclusion and so theyd gone ahead and done it the czechs were just a minor problem to be cleaned up by their standards the french were being generous they could have put their nowuseless allies behind barbed wire or they could have handed them to their new friends the nazis that would have been sweet wouldnt it calmly the french major answered i am prepared to take my chances any man who claims he knows what god will do only proves he has no idea what he is talking about sergeant halevy went back and forth with the major in french the officer shrugged once more but nodded halevy turned back to the gloomy french soldiers standing before him for whatever its worth to you bastards im coming with you the french army has let me resign and the czech governmentinexile has let me enlist it needs peopleeven jewsand the french authorities can see i wont make a good little cog in the machine now that hitlers at the controls what would the major have said had he understood halevys claim that hitler was running the french war machine something interesting and memorable without a doubt but czech was only noise to him being a small nation czechs realized they needed to learn other peoples languages being a large and proud one the french expected other people to learn theirs vaclav didnt know about the other czechs but he was glad to have halevy along he didnt know that the jew spoke spanish but he also didnt know halevy didnt he did know he wouldnt have been surprised and he knew halevy made a damn good soldier he wouldnt have figured that when they first met everybody knew jews werent fighters here as so often what everybody knew proved nothing but bullshit the officer brayed out some more french again halevy did the honors he says were supposed to march to the nearest train station theyll take us over the pyrenees so they dont have to think about us any more that isnt what he saysits me but its what he means march vaclav did he hadnt done a route march in quite a while picking them up and laying them down was no more fun than it had been the last time if anything it was worse because his antitank rifle weighed at least twice as much as an ordinary piece he wondered what the spanish republicans would make of a sniper with an elephant gun from what hed heard neither side down there had much in the way of armor well thered be plenty ofwhat did they call the assholes on the other side nationalists that was itplenty of nationalists who needed killing thered probably be plenty of republicans who needed killing too he hoped not too many of them tried giving him orders the enemy you could deal with the enemy you knew what he was and you knew where he was but you were stuck with your socalled friends benjamin halevy fell in beside him i wish this turned out better the jew said fuck it what can you do vaclav said spainll be another ballsup wont it well i dont know for sure halevy answered but whenever the brass are willing to send you somewhere youve got to guess they arent doing you a favor if they want to do me a favor they can all drop dead there you go they marched on away from one stalemated war that had suddenly flipped upside down and towards another as far as theo hossbach could see byelorussia looked a hell of a lot like poland maybe it was a little shabbier or maybe that was his imagination he understood little bits and pieces of polish as a lot of germans from breslau did byelorussian sounded different but not all that different and a lot of villages had jews in them they could manage with german and he could do the same with yiddish the biggest change was in the signs polish and german used the same alphabet sometimes he could guess written words he didnt know but the soviet unions cyrillic script was almost as incomprehensible as chinese would have been adalbert stoss said very much the same thing when he did hermann witt gave him a wry grin and answered we didnt come here to read adi ah stuff it adi said they both laughed so did theo if heinz naumann had said something like that to stoss the driver probably would have come back with the same response but heinz wouldnt have been grinning and adi would have meant what he said that the other panzer commander and stoss hadnt got along was an understatement naumann was dead now though and the feud buried with him in a badly marked grave back in poland witt attacked the engine with screwdriver and wrench after liberating the carburetor he held it up in triumph of sorts he delivered his verdict like a judge pronouncing sentence this thing sucks you know now that you mention it yes adi said we clean out the valves itll do all right for a whiletill it decides not to anyway thats about the size of it witt agreed i wonder if the carb on the panzer iiis any better id sure like to find out stoss said theo nodded no matter what the carburetor was like everything that counted was better on a panzer iii thicker armor a cannon that could fire both highexplosive and armorpiercing rounds a machine gun in the turret and another one in the hull what was there not to like he could think of two things the turret cannon and machine gun took a loader and gunner which meant there would be a couple of new people to get used tonever his favorite pastime and more to the point the reich still didnt have enough panzer iiis to go around so he was worrying about getting used to a pair of imaginary soldiers back when naumann commanded the panzer ii the carb also misbehaved he and adi had quarreled about it witt didnt seem to want to quarrel with anybody except the ivans theo approved of that the next morning the promotion fairy sprinkled magic dust on the panzers crew adi became a gefreiter and theo himself an obergefreiter witt slapped him on the back and said theyll pull you out and turn you into a real noncom pretty soon doesnt matter to me theo answered the wehrmacht had one more grade below unteroffizier or corporal after that you had to go to training classes to get rid of the emblem on your sleeve and acquire an unteroffiziers shoulderstrap pip theo had had enough of training classes in basic to last him the rest of his life and twenty minutes longer witt laughed might do you good itd make you come out of your shell a little bit maybe maybe theo didnt believe it for a minute he could no more come out of his shell than a turtle could escape from its it was part of him if anything he wished he came equipped with a panzer iiis armor not a panzer iis heinz naumann would have gone on giving him grief about it witt didnt all he said was you keep living through fights theyll make you an unteroffizier whether you like it or not oh boy theo said the panzer commander laughed again had theo been the kind to come out with what he was thinking he might have added that hed never run into a better reason to get killed he hated the idea of giving other people orders he didnt like getting told what to do himself either he was perhaps not ideally suited to the wehrmacht that of course bothered the wehrmacht not a bit round peg square hole drive the damn thing in anyway hit it hard enough and itll stay in place then we can hang some more stuff from it and get on with the war adi stoss was thinking of other things you know what he said winter in russias liable to make winter in poland look like a riviera holiday try not to sound so cheerful about it all right witt said besides well have the poles and the french and the tommies shivering right beside us ohand the ivans too of course aber naturlich adi agreed with more sardonic good cheer but the ivans do this every year theyre used to it poor devils the rest of us arent except maybe the poles youre jampacked with happy thoughts today arent you witt said why dont you gather up some firewood i thought gefreiters didnt have to do shit like that stoss said isnt the whole point of getting promoted not needing to do shit like that any more like i told theo getting promoted means you didnt get blown up the panzer commander answered if you figure out how to pack a servant into the panzer he can gather firewood for us till then somebodys got to do it and right now thats you come the revolution you wont be able to abuse the proletariat like this adi went off to collect sticks and boards witt looked after him shaking his head he sails close to the wind doesnt he he murmured perhaps more to himself than to theo if somebody who takes the political lectures seriously heard him hed go on the rocks faster than a guy with the shits runs for the latrine theo shrugged to show hed heard he did his share of fatigues even though he was now an exalted obergefreiter for that matter so did the sergeant adi knew as much too he was just making trouble for the fun of it a panzer wasnt like an infantry platoon with plenty of ordinary privates to do the dirty work for everyone else they rolled forward again the next morningbut not very far forward the russians had laid an ambush with panzers hidden in a village and antipanzer cannon hiding among the fruit trees off to one side the germans pulled back after a couple of panzer iis brewed up and another lost a track maybe the ivans thought theyd halted their enemies if they did they soon learned better stukas plastered the orchard with high explosive one of them with cannon under the wings in place of bombs dove on the village again and again the columns of greasy black smoke rising into the sky spoke of hits adi and hermann witt watched him swoop in the distance they whooped and cheered and carried on theo watched the dials on the panzers radio set he could see the machine pistol on its brackets near the set and if he turned his head the back of the chair in which the panzer commander sat since witt wasnt sitting now theo could also see his legs it wasnt an exciting view theo didnt care he wanted excitement the way he wanted a second head and while the stukas kept the russians whod set the trap hopping more german panzers raced around their flank the ivans skedaddled they were always nervous about their flanks theos panzer company or the survivors thereof rolled past the village where theyd been held up they didnt roll through it a plan theo liked nobody knew for sure whether all the red army men had abandoned the place they might be waiting in there with molotov cocktails and antipanzer rifles and whatever other unpleasantnesses they could come up with german and polish infantry tramped along behind the panzers before too long the ground pounders would come through here and clear out whatever russians remained behind in the meantime the panzers would motor ahead and bite out another chunk of territory for the infantry to clear this was how things worked when blitzkrieg ran according to plan when things went wrong you outran your infantry support and the enemy concentrated against you where you couldnt outflank him that had happened in france there was a lot more space to play with in the soviet union maybe it wouldnt happen here theo hoped not he wanted to win more than anything else though he wanted to go home anastas mouradian would have liked more training on the pe than he got no matter what he would have liked he and his classmates went into action as soon as they figured out the controls and took off and landed a few times he did have a better plane than hed flown before the sb had been a fine bomber in its day but its day was done in a couple of years no doubt something newer and snazzier would also replace the pe till then mouradian was happy to fly one against the soviet unions enemies was sergei yaroslavsky still hauling his old sb around the sky for his sake his former bombaimer hoped not the pe was close to a kilometers an hour faster it could fly higher and carry more bombs all that meant it had a better chance of coming back from its missions three of his classmates at the airstrip outside of moscow never got the chance to fly the new bomber against the nazis one of them botched a takeoff and crashedor maybe an engine failed either way he was dead so were the two who flew their planes into the ground instead of landing them flying was an unforgiving business if the germans didnt get you a moments carelessness and youd do yourself in his bombaimer and copilot was a karelian named ivan kulkaanen he was as blond as anastas was dark and spoke russian with an odd accent dont worryi think you sound funny too he told mouradian when i talk russian i know i sound funny stas answered but you should hear me in armenian whereupon kulkaanen gabbled out a couple of sentences in what mouradian presumed to be his native tongue whatever it was it meant nothing to him finnish the blond man explained if you say so mouradian couldnt contradict him back in the bomb bay was a russian sergeant called fyodor mechnikov like the other bombardiers stas had known he was brawny and foulmouthed they took me off a farm he said his grin displaying several stainlesssteel teeth ive got the muscle i dont scare easy for the shit i do who needs brains can you read can you write stas asked mechnikov shook his bullet head not a fucking word sir he answered not without pride ill teach you if you want nah mechnikov shook his head again ive gone this long without it i wouldnt know what to do if i could all of a sudden and i remember real good i start writing shit down i bet i start forgetting like a son of a bitch he might well have been right stas had dealt with more than a few illiterate enlisted men in his time russia was full of them in western europe they said almost everybody could read and write it wasnt like that here and illiterates did tend to have better memories than people who could read and write they needed them the newsreaders on the radio tried their best to give the impression that everything at the front was fine their best might have convinced civilians who hadnt seen german soldiers or had german bombs fall on them yet but if everything was as wonderful as the radio wanted people to believe why was the red air force rushing halftrained pe pilots to the front as fast as it could stas didnt think anything was as wonderful as the radio wanted people to believe he never had soviet propaganda was primarily aimed at russians and russians as seen through the jaundiced eye of a man from the caucasus lacked a certain subtlety so did soviet propaganda at least to mouradian stalin was a man from the caucasus too chances were he chuckled cynically at the stuff he had his propagandists put out which didnt mean the stuff didnt work and the new bombers worked tooat least if you didnt crash them trying to get them to work the pilots flew their planes and aircrews west toward the border between russian and byelorussia that they landed at airstrips still inside the russia federation gave the lie to the swill that poured out of radio speakers no things werent going nearly so well as the soviet government wanted people to think english and french reinforcements for the nazis hadnt got here yet either what would happen when they joined the germans and poles nothing good not if you were a soviet citizen lieutenant colonel tomashevsky seemed to know his business he wasnt a drunken blowhard like colonel borisov or a hopeless loser like the fellow whod briefly given mouradian orders in the far east the nazis are still coming forward he told the newly assembled men of his newly assembled squadron he didnt bother mentioning the poles in his place stas wouldnt have either tomashevsky went on we cant stop them all by ourselves but we can hurt them that will give the red army a better chance to do its job was he saying the red army wasnt doing its job would some political officer rake him over the coals for telling the truth such things happened all the time that was a shame but they did one more thing he added the best way to become a hero of the soviet union isnt to try and dogfight the s the pe may have started out as a heavy fighter but its a bomber now its a good bomber but its still a bomber dammit the best way to become a hero of the soviet union is to finish your mission come back and fly your next one and the one after that thats what heroes do what needs doing go take care of it thus encouraged they hurried to their planes antiaircraft guns snouts stuck up around the airstrip stas hadnt seen any bomb craters though the germans hadnt found this place then not yet groundcrew men bombed up the squadrons pes fyodor mechnikov was ready lets blow the living shit out of these nazi cunts he said i couldnt have put it better myself stas replied up they went after the more sedate sb takeoff in the new machine was like a kick in the pants i could get used to this ivan kulkaanen remarked lets hope so stas answered kulkaanen gave him a sidelong look stas didnt know about karelians in generalhe hadnt met manybut his bombaimer had an ear for the little things if they were little if the aircrew didnt get used to these takeoffs theyd probably be too dead to care they droned west orders were to hit the germans outside of mogilev on the dnieper when they got there they discovered the enemy was already ten or fifteen kilometers over the river they bombed the biggest concentration of germans they could find antiaircraft fire came up at them from the ground but it wasnt too bad mouradian had flown through plenty worse no messerschmitts seemed to be in the neighborhood nobody could anger lieutenant colonel tomashevsky by pretending the pe still was the fighter it had originally been intended to be once the bomb bay was empty they sped back to russiamother russia to mechnikov if not to mouradian or kulkaanen although it was to tomashevsky by his name he was a russian stas taxied into a revetment and killed the engines as soon as the props stopped spinning groundcrew men spread camouflage netting over the plane the germans wouldnt have an easy time finding this airstrip unless of course they followed the red air force planes and watched where they landed maybe that was what happened any which way the antiaircraft guns around the airstrip suddenly all seemed to go off at once mouradian kulkaanen and mechnikov scrambled out of the pe and sprinted for the nearest slit trench one after another stukas dove on the field the first one flattened what had been a kolkhoz supervisors office and was now lieutenant colonel tomashevskys headquarters stas hoped tomashevsky hadnt got back in it yet two other divebombers planted kilo bombs right in the middle of the runway nobody would fly in or out till those holes got filled and a fourth german bomber blew up a pe in spite of the netting that covered it the flak didnt get any stukas as they roared off to the west mouradian only wished he were more surprised laustrophobia was foolish julius lemp kept telling himself so it helped some the baltic was a couple of hundred kilometers across but he was used to the greater elbow room of the north sea and the vast freedom of the north atlantic here in these enclosed waters he felt as if he had land at his elbow every way he looked oh good skipper im not the only one then gerhart beilharz said when lemp complained out loud youd best believe youre not lemp agreed if anyone on the u was entitled to feel cooped up all the time it was beilharz with his size it wasnt as if he were wrong not a whole lot of traffic out there either the engineering officer said i hope were not just wasting our time me too lemp said well at least its a war his voice sounded hollow if he could hear it no doubt beilharz could too and he had his reasons for keeping enthusiasm on a tight lead you could foul up all too easily in the baltic and foul up your career such as it was while you were at it in the north atlantic or the north sea he could assume any surface ship he saw was bound for england or france here suppose he sank a swedish freighter bound for the reich with a load of iron ore that would torpedo any hopes he might still have for moving up the chain of command would it ever hed survived sending one ship to the bottom by mistake nobody could get away with being wrong like that twice even if he spotted a gunboat it might not belong to the ivans it might be swedish or finnish or polish or latvian or lithuanian or estonian hed wondered if stalin would gobble up the baltic republics the way hitler had seized the low countries no sign of it yet like drowning men with life preservers the little nations in these parts clung to neutrality for dear life as soon as one side invaded them the other would too whichever big power won the war latvia lithuania and estonia would lose so he had to be careful airplanes might belong to one of the neutrals too he couldnt shoot it out on the surface with one unless it fired at him first since that would be just exactly too late he dove as soon as anybody spotted anything flying once what turned out to be a russian flying boat dropped depth charges on himfortunately with bad aim they rattled his teeth and made the sailors use some amazing profanity but did no damage are we going into the gulf of finland beilharz asked one afternoon on the conning tower in much the same tones a patient might use when asking his doctor if a biopsy had come back malignant thats where leningrad is thats where the russians go in and out lemp answered beilharz only sighed well lemp felt like sighing himself the baltic was narrow the gulf of finland wasnt more than a good piss wide if something went wrong while the uboat was there the technical term for that was screwed but lemp went on when somebody asked that american gangster why he robbed banks he said because thats where the money is hey even if we got a boatload of rubles we couldnt spend em in germany anyhow beilharz said lemp was a pretty fair submarine driver he hadnt been blessed with the sharpest or quickest sense of humor though he was about to snap at beilharz for missing his point when he realized in the nick of time that the schnorkelmeister was joking heh he managednot the merriest or most sincere laugh that ever rang out on the u but a laugh all the same estonia owned the lower jaw to the gulf of finland its namesake country the upper soviet territory lurked back deep in the throat minefields shielded that territory from visitors like lemps uboat he respected those minefields without fearing them he had good charts of where they lay he didnt know for sure but he would have bet the finns had contributed a lot to those charts they didnt love the enormous neighbor whod ruled them till the russian revolution and they needed to worry about the minefields too if their fishing boats and freighters were to stay safe but the russians also sowed mines through the gulf at random theyd sneak out under cover of darkness in fast attack craft dump a few in the water and run away again they denied everything of course when one of those floaters blew a finnish steamship skyhigh the russians insisted the germans must have placed it there were german mines in the gulf of finland to make things difficult for the soviet unions baltic fleet lemp also had charts showing their positions sometimes of course a mine would slip its mooring cable and go drifting with wind and wave you might not think any bobbed close by but you had to keep your eyes open at least one soviet battleship the marat lurked inside the minefields if she came out she could cause all kinds of trouble for a while anyway how long shed last against uboats and bombers was anybodys guess not very long was lemps the marat was a dreadnought built before the last war a dinosaur in other words new and more deadly predators prowled these days no monster from wars gone by put the u in trouble another damned flying boat did it came out of the sun so nobody on the bridge saw it till it was almost on top of the submarine the first clue lemp had that it was there was tracers snarling past his face jesus christ he yelled then he heard the growl of the beriev mbrs engine the flying boat zoomed overhead no more than thirty meters above the sea bombs fell from under the wings they didnt hit the u but went off close enough to her hull to knock lemp down on the conning tower and almost drown him with two enormous gouts of seawater coughing and spluttering and trying not to puke he pulled himself to his feet one of the ratings whod been on the tower with him was down and moaning his hands clutched his belly blood poured out between his fingersa fragment must have got him the moans turned to shrieks a moment later curses and shouts of surprise came from inside the boat how much water had suddenly flooded down the hatch much too much by the noises from down there but that at the moment was the least of lemps worries the mbr was turning for another pass they couldnt get down fast enough to escape it the only thing they could do was bang away at it with the mm antiaircraft gun take off the tompion lemp shouted both the antiaircraft gun and the mm deck cannon had bronze plugs protecting the inside of the barrel from seawater if you tried to fire one without removing that protector youd be very unhappybut not for long off went the tompion it dangled from the barrel by a chain so it wouldnt roll into the ocean the gun roared the flying boat fired back with its machine gun lemp had hoped the gunfire would scare it off but no such luck then he cheered when smoke and fire spurted from the russian planes engine the mbr came down in the baltic lemp hoped it would cartwheel and break to pieces again no such luck there it sat on the water and it went on shooting at the uboat bullets clanged off the conning tower some bit through it those holes would have to be patched before the boat could dive again man the deck gun lemp yelled down the hatch he had to jump back as sailors sped up the steel ladder inside the antiaircraft gun was still trading fire with the flying boats machine gun chunks flew from the planes metal wing and wooden hull but the ivans inside kept up their fire no one could say they had any quit in them then the deck gun roared it wasnt identical to the mm antiaircraft piece that was also a fearsome antipanzer weapon but it came close enough no plane could take that kind of pounding a couple of rounds into the cockpit and the enemy machine guns went quiet two more sailors were down one at the flak gun the other at the mm the latter had taken one through the head theyd bury him at sea along with the poor devil with the belly wound although that unlucky fellow might be a long time dying the other wounded man had a neat hole through his leg hed probably live good lord lemp said deeply shaken i hope we never have to do that again everybody up on deck with him nodded several ratings crossed themselves lemp was no catholic but he felt like doing the same thing peggy druce had already voted for fdr twice she had every intention of voting for him again if ever anyone deserved a third term franklin d roosevelt was the man it looked that way to her anyhow most of her main line friends and acquaintances were rockribbed republicans rockheaded republicans as far as she was concerned they seemed convinced the world ended right where good old american beaches gave way to the ocean the sole exceptions they recognized were shopping trips to london and paris and gambling junkets to havana the only thing peggy wished was that roosevelt werent so coy about the chances the usa would get into the war on which side one of her friends asked altogether seriously whichever side isnt hitlers peggy answered without the least hesitation but the other woman stared at her in horror undisguised that would mean fighting for stalin and the bolsheviks so what peggy answered winston churchill said that if hitler invaded hell hed try to give the devil a good notice in the house of commons hes dead her friend reminded her hes dead and england doesnt want to fight for stalin you ask me chamberlains no dope peggy didnt blow up shed already had this argument more than once by now she was resigned to it people who hadnt been to europe and seen what nazi germany was like for themselves didntcouldntbelieve it russia was the devil they knew the radical state that wanted to bury capitalism forever to most headinthesand americans anything that wanted to smash the reds seemed swell her friend went on i only wish willkie didnt sound so much like that man in the white house he ought to give the new deal a good swift kick is what he ought to do if you say so blanche peggy said i just did blanche replied and i tell you were getting some very different people donating to bundles for britain these days not everyone quit after the big switch the way you did she raised her nose in the aironly a little but it got through it also let peggy see the sagging flesh under blanches chin since her own jawline was still pretty good she soaked up some schadenfreude on that score ill bet you are she said feeling the need for a saucer of cream the ones who stand up and whinny when the band plays deutschland uber alles i suppose its not like that blanches voice went shrill but it is a different crowd hardly any of those people come in any more why dont you just call them jews the fuhrer does the jews are our misfortune she did her best to thunder like hitler on the radio it wasnt very good that had to be just as well she didnt want people jumping to their feet and screaming sieg heil every time she opened her mouth i suppose they have to live somewhere but i wish they were better at knowing their place blanche said they do in germany one of them made a mistakehe sold me something when he shouldnt have then some brownshirts went into his shop and beat him up he wont do anything that rude and pushy any time soon peggy said oh come on i dont mean that you know what i mean blanche said i know what hitler means too peggy answered outside the cafe where they were not enjoying time together welldressed wellfed people hurried by shop windows promised the moonand theyd deliver if you put down enough cash carsso many carswhizzed up and down the street dealers were gearing up to start selling models you could buy as much gas as you wanted and for next to nothing rationing nobody on this side of the atlantic had ever heard of rationing blanche did have the grace to turn pink if not red i dont want to go as far as the germans do im sure those people would be so glad to hear it peggy said the scary thing was that in spite of being sarcastic she was also right jews these days were pathetically grateful for any crumbs you threw them considering what they got in the reich in place of crumbs they had reason to be peggy smiled sweetly no yellow stars or anything this time blanche really did redden i dont know what to make of you any more youve changed since you came back from europe i havent the rest of our crowd hasnt fools never do it sat on the tip of peggys tongue along with the last bite of a really good blt you couldnt get anything like that in berlin but she swallowed the bite and she swallowed the mean comeback too that might have been mature wisdom or it might just have meant she was too tired to argue all the time she hadnt given up she was getting better at picking her spots she looked at her watch and stood up ive got to run so good to see you blanche said with transparent relief peggy tossed two dollars on the tableyou paid for atmosphere at this placeand got out as fast as she could with any manners or perhaps a little faster than that out on the sidewalk she waved for a cab she got one in nothing flat and another taxi driver drove off with a scowl because hed missed the fare the guy behind the wheel was about twentyfive where to lady he asked she gave him her address he put the plymouth in gear and pulled back into traffic in almost any country in europe he would have been in the army his cab wouldnt have been on the road any more either people in berlin had stared at the one that took her from her hotel to the train station shop windows billboards and neon signs all shouted at her as the taxi went along buy they screamed buy buy buy and people listened to them there was a boy eating an icecream cone there was a woman with her arms full of packages there was a man in a sharp suit walking past shiny new cars at a packard dealership while a salesman in a loud plaid jacket followed a hungry smile on his face so much stuff peggy murmured anyone on the other side of the atlantic whod been making do with what he had since the war started would drop dead if he could see this and the politicians over there whod made people live like that would count themselves lucky if they didnt get hanged from the closest lamppost wadja say lady the cabbie asked peggy was embarrassed she hadnt meant him to overhear but she repeated herself louder this time adding i got back from europe a little while ago seeing everything all lit up people buying and selling like nobodys business still seems strange boy i bet the guy said makes you glad youre an american huh sure peggy said but she wondered how much she meant it maybe shed stayed over there too long no for sure shed stayed over there too long but she wasnt thinking of the usual reasons now a couple of years in europe made the good old usas displays of greed and abundance feel vulgar she could at least laugh at herself for her sudden attack of puritanism there was no inherent virtue in an empty belly in a suit coat out at the elbows in streets empty of cars because your country was using all the gas and steel and rubber it had to murder its neighbors she saw that but she also saw all this and the excess turned her stomach the taxi pulled up in front of her house even the old familiar place seemed ridiculously large why did she and herb need all this space it wasnt so much that they did need it but they could afford it and so they had it eightyfive cents lady the driver said she gave him a dollar he started to make change she waved for him not to bother he nodded thanks she got out he drove off she walked up to the front door she was home as she fumbled in her purse for the key she wondered if shed ever feel at home anywhere again manila it wasnt as if pete mcgill had never been here before any leatherneck whod been in the corps for a while had come through the capital of the philippines it was like a halfway house between what youd grown up with and the real noshit orient the wide streets and stately spanish buildings reminded you of an americanor more likely a europeancity after more than a generation of us rule a lot of the natives understood english you could buy burgers and cokes but those natives were little and brown and had narrow eyes most of the time they gabbled away in a language that sounded like barking dogs to pete away from the wide thoroughfares they lived in tiny tumbledown huts what they ate when they werent cooking for you or shining your shoes had nothing to do with hamburgersno sirree and it was hot and it was muggy all the timespring summer fall winter there was a rainy season and a less rainy season and that was about as far as seasons went but jesus god it was so green if you turned your back on a bamboo plant it would be six inches taller when you turned around again and gave it a second look armies of little brown gardeners kept the stately spanish buildings from being swallowed by jungle yeah when you got to manila you realized you werent in kansas any more or in the bronx which pete had called home till the recruiting sergeant convinced him hed get a better deal if he signed on the dotted line he hadnt needed much convincing anything that would get him the hell out of high school and pay him a little bit besides looked mighty goddamn good so now he was back in manila in the military hospital under a lazy ceiling fan that did exactly nothing to fight the heat and humidity hed got himself wrecked on account of a terrorist bomb hed got the woman he loved killed and all he could do was lie here and stew he wanted to murder the chinamen whod planted the bomb in the movie house and he wanted to murder the japs who ground down the chinese till they started doing things like planting bombs in movie houses give him a machine gun and enough ammo and there wouldnt be a jap or a chinaman left alive he even glared at the filipino nurses who helped the americans take care of him they hadnt had anything to do with the bomb of course the rational part of his mind understood that but they were little and brown and had narrow eyes they didnt exactly look chinese or japanese but he wasnt inclined to be picky not right then they gave him crutches and encouraged him to hobble down the hospital hallways hobble he did he was looking for anything to do besides lie there like a sack of dried peas staying on his pinsand on the additional wooden pins with which he was fitted outtook everything he had in him while he was upright he was too busy concentrating on staying that way to have time to brood about vera one of the american nurses looked a little like his lost love that of course only rubbed salt in his wounds what made it even worse was that mary anne wouldnt shut up about her fiance an army captain named harold whether that was first name or last pete wasnt sure he didnt bother asking he hoped harold ran into a wall facefirst he hoped the army man caught the pox in a filipino whorehouse and gave it to mary anne he hoped war started and the japanese captured harold and treated him the way theyd treated the swarms of russians theyd captured in manchukuo marched to death beaten shot on the road the horror stories got more and more horrible as time went by all that because the nurse already had a fellow and was happy with him anybody who heard about petes thoughts would have opined that he was a few turns around the bend but nobody heard about them when the doctors asked him how he was feeling all they wanted to know was how badly his knitting bones still hurt that he told them the other torture wouldnt have dragged it out of him the only thing more unmanly than talking about his emotions would have been putting on a dress and high heels as he had in peking and shanghai he listened to ball games from the states on shortwave radio the indians and tigers and yankees were taking turns knocking one another out of first place the yanks had won four pennants in a row pete wanted the fifth one you could take the kid out of the bronx but you couldnt take the bronxor the bronx bombersout of the kid the radio didnt talk about china much the japanese were supposed to be making gains south and west of peking but some kind of hideous disease had broken out in those parts so western reporters were even less eager to see for themselves than they would have been otherwise was it typhoid or typhus or plague or cholera nobody seemed to know for sure or to care very much why worry it was only killing chinamen and maybe japs pete wouldnt have been sorry to hear that the whole japanese army had come down with the plague he wanted to get news from shanghai but he never heard any hell he hadnt even been able to arrange a proper burial for vera hed been too torn up to do anything at all which was why theyd sent him here he hoped somebodyd taken care of it maybe the owner of the golden lotus the club where shed danced he was a jew pete knew that shed spoken of him with amused respecthe was ugly but he was smart was he a good enough guy to reach into his pocket for what needed doing pete couldnt begin to guess most of the men on the ward with him were army and navy files from the philippines like him they figured a war with japan was coming unlike him they expected it to be easy piece of cake said a pilot whod fractured this that and the other thing crashlanding a boeing p peashooter the fighter was obsolete which didnt mean the army air force here wasnt still flying it despite that frank houlihan didnt lack for confidence they make their shit out of tin cans and baby buggies they try us on well wipe the floor with em theyve been pounding the crap out of china theyve taken vladiwatchacallit away from the russians theyre tougher than you think pete said houlihan didnt want to hear it slanteyed little monkeys with stupid round glasses and buck teeth dont make me laugh manit hurts when i do yeah yeah i heard all that crap too you ever see em in action pete said im telling you those guys dont know how to back up hot damn houlihan said if they dont well teach em the less the other guys on the ward had actually seen of the japanese the more certain they were that the united states would clean the clocks of hirohitos finest pete didnt like japs which was putting it mildly but anybody who didnt think they were tough well as far as pete could see that fellow was getting too many pain shots you had to know your enemy the men on his ward didnt and didnt want to maybe that meant nothing pete couldnt say for sure he was only a lousy twostriper himself but what if american admirals and generals had the same attitude as the men they led that wouldnt be so good he did know for a fact that the japs were interested in everything america did people said they only imitated okayfine say their equipment wasnt quite as good as the stuff uncle sam handed his boys if the men using the gear were better didnt that wipe out the difference pete was a marine the marines were based on the idea that you could kick the other guys ass if you were meaner and faster than he was theyd done it against the germans in the last big wingding and in half a dozen banana republics since it wasnt always pretty but it worked for them so why wouldnt it work for the japs too no reason at all not that he could see but he couldnt explain it to the army and navy men whod hurt themselves or come down sick they believed in firepower the way mormons believed in joseph smith to them the quality of the men holding on to the guns was just a detail okay fine he said to houlihan at last throwing his good hand in the air have it your way i hope to god youre right to tell you the truth but ive got news for youif youre wrong were in deep shit houlihan and the other guys laughed at him he wished he thought it was funny too nobody was bombing munster any more sarah goldman liked that fine rationing went on of course the war was still going if you took the newspapers seriously it was going hotter than ever of course if you took the newspapers seriously you needed to have your head examined troop trains rattled through town all of them going from west to east the papers said some of them held french and english soldiers on the way to russia to help the wehrmacht against the bolsheviks and the jews who ran the soviet union i wonder how many soldiers on those trains are jews samuel goldman said at breakfast one morning i wonder what they think of the orders they have maybe some of them will sarah didnt finish the sentence they didnt talk about saul and what he was doing none of them really believed the house was bugged not any more but none of them believed in taking chances either yes maybe they will father agreed now understanding what she was saying even if she hadnt said it that would be interesting wouldnt it very interesting indeed it would she said the idea that saul might run into anyone with whom he didnt have to hide what he really was drew her on like a willothewisp how long could you live a lie if your other choice was dying as long as you had to but living the lie here also involved the risk of dying and not a small one papers printed blackbordered casualty lists every day father set a checked cloth cap on his head away i go he said as he stood up from the table what i do wont be very interesting but it will remind the powers that be of my wonderful virtues and my strong back he stumped toward the door his limp was worse than it had been unlike saul he didnt have a body made for hard physical labor every day he should have stood in front of a classroom chalking names and dates and latin and greek phrases on the blackboard no matter what he should have done this was what he did it was what the nazis made him do and all they let him do now what would happen when the labor gangs ran out of work now that the bombs had stopped falling wouldnt the workers get ahead of the rubble sarah shook her head she was being silly the bosses could always keep their laborers busy even if they had to invent work for them they had labor gangs full of jewish women too the only reason sarah and her mother hadnt got dragooned into them was samuel goldmans war wound that was the kind of privilege it won nothing to make anyone celebrate in sane times but better than nothing when madness called the shots or was it madness the fuhrer had an amazing knack for getting exactly what he wanted if england and france helped him finish off stalin he would bestride europe as no man had since napoleon and then wouldnt he turn on them the first chance he got how did they think theyd stop him when he did the day dragged along in the late afternoon sarah went shopping the big switch hadnt made things any better there soldiers from the western democracies might cross the german frontier but food didnt seem to hadnt england lifted the blockade maybe so but food still meant war bread and cabbage and potatoes and turnips she got what she could at the grocers and precious little it was a sign in his front window claimed he had plums but they were all gone by the time sarah and the other jewish shoppers were allowed to buy she would have been angrier had she been more surprised some of the cabbages and beets he was selling looked better than usual maybe the aryan women had got so excited about the plums they hadnt picked over the ordinary vegetables so carefully her stringbag fuller than shed expected it to be she crossed the street to the bakery brucks it said over the door on the window was taped a faded swastikabedecked sign german people dont buy from jews sarah smiled mirthlessly she wasnt a german person the jew stamped on her identity card proved as much as shed hoped isidor stood behind the counter instead of his father his face lit up when he saw her hello there were other people in the bakery he couldnt say everything he might have by the way an older womans eyebrow quirked hed said plenty with one word hi sarah answered what do you need today isidor did his best to sound businesslike and matteroffact but his best wasnt very good two kilogram loaves sarah answered also as plainly as she could coming up isidor took them off the shelf with as much ceremony as if they were fit for a king they were plain solid black war bread a king would have to get mighty hungry before he cut slices from them the other shoppers paid for what theyd bought and parted with ration coupons after they left isidor reached under the counter he pulled out half a dozen lovely purple plums displaying them in the palms of his hands where did you find those sarah exclaimed across the street isidor answered old bohm at the grocery isnt such a bad guy hell trade this for that if were careful we can get away with it he gave her the fruit anyway these are for you for me she squeaked no isidor thats too much half a dozen plums and she was carrying on as if hed given her a kilo of gold it was sillyor would have been if she werent what she was where she was hush isidor said firmly i cant get you the kinds of things i want to theyd shoot me if i tried besides nobody in germany can get that kind of stuff nowadays except guys like goring so i do what i can today its plums next week who knows maybe even lamb shanks or something he sounded a hundred percent serious he was most of the time sarah had more whimsy in her she wagged a finger at him dont you know the way to a mans heart is through his stomach even as she said it she realized there were probably jewish girls in munster who would sell their body for half a dozen plums the difference between bad and worse was far bigger than the difference between good and better i know how you got to my heart he answered and her cheeks heated hed got to hers the same way there hidden by the tall grass at the park he glanced up toward the flat over the bakery if my folks werent home right now she nodded getting together when no one else was around wasnt easy which was putting it mildly maybe that should have relieved her if she were what people called a good girl she supposed it would have she must not have been because it didnt she wanted him to touch her again the way he had then shed touch him too even if that got messy and if he wanted to do even more you lost your reputation when you did things like that it would have been funny if it werent so sad as if a jew in the third reich had any reputation worth losing maybe father and mother will go out one night before too long sarah said curfews not as tight as it has been neither is blackout if they do let me know he broke in i will she had to hide a smile shed expected him to be eager she hadnt exactly expected him to be that eager everybody said men were like that when they thought they were going to get what they wanted a lot of the time what everybody said was a bunch of dreck not here evidently then she thought of something else something different can you give me some newspaper to cover up the plums if people see them in my stringbag theyll wonder how i got them sure he handed her the front page from the days paper nice to think its doing something useful anyhow i know id say it was only good for wrapping fish but whens the last time you had fish to wrap sarah said been a while isidor said sadly i know sarah nodded well id better go thanks again she felt his eyes on her as she left it didnt bother her one bit ere you go rudel colonel steinbrenner signed hansulrichs furlough papers with a flourish and handed them to him do you know what youll do well sir i wasnt thinking of going anywhere very far hansulrich answered five days thats not much time and i dont want to spend most of it sitting on a train i thought maybe oh bialystok its a city and it hasnt got smashed to the devil like the white russian towns have a good time the squadron commander said youve got a girl back there dont you and here hansulrich thought hed been so casual he coughed a couple of times uh not exactly sir colonel steinbrenner seemed to riffle through a mental card file oh thats right he said when he came to the card he wanted youre the one who was chasing that little jew or halfjew or whatever she is at the tavern go on then have fun i hope you catch her thank you sir hansulrich got out of there as fast as he could he hoped he caught sofia too marrying a jew or even a halfjew would shoot down your career faster than flak from the ivans laying one though if there were any regulations against that he hadnt heard about them and he would have because he kept his ear to the ground the nearest railhead was in a town northeast of minsk hansulrich took the squadrons kubelwagen to get there one of the groundcrew men rode along so he could drive it back as hansulrich hopped out the noncom said enjoy yourself lieutenant fuck that bitch till she begs for mercy um rudel said and was spared the need for anything more because the groundcrew man put the kubelwagen in gear and drove away did everyone in the whole wide world know he was interested in sofia everybody in the squadron did anyhow a feldgendarmerie sergeant with a shiny gorget checked his papers and his id before letting him board the train go ahead sir the fellow said when he was satisfied youre you all right i hope so hansulrich said im not likely to be anybody else am i youd be surprised the military policeman answered matter of fact youd be fucking amazed some of the guys who try to go west on bad papers or no papers at all makes you wonder whose side theyre on by god with such encouragement ringing in his ears hansulrich climbed onto the train it was already crowded but he wedged his way into a compartment he promptly fell asleep several hours later shouts of bialystok all out for bialystok roused him and sent him staggering down onto the platform at the train station yawning he tried to figure out where sofias place of employment lay east of the stationhe thought he started that way if he couldnt find it hed ask somebody most jews and some poles here understood german quite a few men in feldgrau prowled the streetsfewer in his luftwaffe grayblue bialystok wasnt paris or even warsaw but it wasnt the front either it had enough bars and brothels and cinemas to keep the germans amused while they unwound after weeks nosetonose with ivan he found the place without too much trouble since the signs in bialystok were in two languages he couldnt readone with an alphabet as meaningless to him as hindustanihe took that for a good omen the next interesting question was whether sofia would be working when he walked into the tavern had he come all this way just to sit around and drink mineral water or coffee but there she was small and dark and slim and maddening oh its you she said as if he hadnt been away blowing up russian panzers for weeks well come on over here and sit down she led him to a little table off in a corner what i dont deserve a better seat than this he said more or less joking sofia plainly wasnt joking at all she shook her head why should you you dont spend enough cash to make it worthwhile to put you anywhere else coffee fizzy water she rolled her eyes at what they did to profit margins the expression and the logic behind it certainly made him think of her as a jew they didnt make her any less attractive though even if they should have doing his best to sound reasonable he answered i dont get drunk and tear the place up and break things either we can collect on thatsometimes anyhow i suppose youll want coffee now without waiting to find out whether she supposed accurately or not she bustled away hansulrich admired her trim ankles hed never particularly cared about ankles beforethings got more interesting as you moved northbut he made an exception here hers were turned on a superior lathe she came back with the coffee set it down on the table and stood there waiting he gave her money that made her turn to go again before she could disappear he spoke quickly what time do you get off today past your bedtime sofia said glancing at the steaming cup shed brought she added past your bedtime no matter how much coffee you drink but i came all the way back here to see you hansulrich said theres sure nothing else in bialystok that would have brought me back why is this supposed to be my problem sure as the devil sofia specialized in being impossible because hansulrich hesitated because i love you would make her laugh in his face because i want to go to bed with you was more honest but too likely to get him slapped hoping the hesitation wasnt too noticeable he tried again because youre the most interesting girl ive met since i dont know when a black eyebrow leaped toward her hairline you talk prettier than most of them but you mean the same thing somebody with an empty beer stein banged it on the table and shouted for her ive got to go she said and she did hansulrich sipped the coffee it was better than what a field kitchen made but he thought not so good as it had been the last time he was here the war was rough on everybody at the front or not he watched sofia he bought more coffee and more coffee and more coffee still if she kept working till after his bedtime now shed be doing a twentyfourhour shift and then some he got rid of the used coffee in a crowded odorous pissoir made more cramped still by the infantry sergeant passed out next to the urinal a panzer crew and some foot soldiers started punching one another hansulrich helped break up the brawl and throw them out then he went back to his table after a while sofia came over with a fresh cup of coffee she had his rhythm down all right pausing she said why should i want anything to do with you youre a german that makes you trouble with a capital t he shook his head nah germans in poland are only trouble with a small t thats what your government decided russians are trouble with a capital t i dont care what the government decided the government is stupid sofia answered which could have sent her to a camp had she been overheard in germany germans are always trouble this isnt about germans and poles or germans and jews or germans and portuguese if you happen to be portuguese hansulrich said its about you and me thats all easier for the one who drops the bombs to talk like that than for the poor soandso they land on how did she know he dropped bombs he supposed she could find out or she might have been using a figure of speech before he could find any sort of comeback a shouted call for a refill sent her scurrying away he sipped his coffee his eyes were wide wide open not quite benzedrine but not so far away the tavern stayed crowded no matter how late it got sofia accidentally on purpose spilled a mug of beer on a german who tried reaching up under her skirt the guys friends laughed at him so he couldnt get mad he was drunk and hopeful not really determined lucky for him too because hansulrich would have murdered him if hed tried to take it out on the barmaid and then sofia came to his table without a cup of coffee in her hand all right herr hotshot im off work she said her sharp chin lifted in defiance now what hansulrich sprang to his feet he was so surprised and happy he wondered why he didnt bounce off the ceiling he offered her his arm the way she took it was more challenge than anything else he didnt care all he cared about was that she took it lets both find out he said night bombing lieutenant colonel ponamarenko spoke the words as if they tasted bad this is what we are reduced to until we can reequip with pes or some other new bombers we serve the soviet union of course plainly he wished the squadron could serve the country some other way sergei yaroslavsky understood his superiors pride he had trouble sharing it though enough was enough enough in fact was too much against the luftwaffe s fighters the sb had had its day it was as simple as that too many of the faces listening to ponamarenko were fresh and new too many veterans whod served as long as sergei were dead shot down by fighter planes they couldnt escape yes night bombing was secondline duty but it was something the sb could still manage finding enemy aircraft at night was largely a matter of luck bombing by night was also a matter of luck with navigation and aim so uncertain but what about it the explosives were bound to come down on somebodys head and the somebody would more likely than not be a nazi kerosene lanterns and men with electric torches marked the edges of the runway should be fun finding this place again in the dark shouldnt it lieutenant federov remarked sergei had been thinking the same thing to keep from dwelling on it he told his bombaimer well if they lit it up like peacetime the germans would find it before we got back from moscow all the way to germanys western border no one showed a light at night you didnt want to give the other side a free shot at you any more than you wanted to hand the other team a penalty kick in a football match but the lights were on again in england and france they didnt worry about german bombers any more they didnt need to the capitalists had made common cause with the fascists to destroy the building workers and peasants paradise here it wont happen sergei told himself we wont let it happen the red army kept yielding ground but falling back before the enemy worried him much less than it would have worried say a frenchman in france you could fall back only so far till you ran out of real estate that wasnt a problem in russia trading space for time had been a russian specialty ever since invaders started coming out of the westpretty much forever in other words napoleon made it to moscow but much joy he had from his homecoming sergei didnt think the germans would get that far even with help from the other degenerate western powers and if they should he didnt think they wanted to fight through a russian winter once they were airborne an order came over the radio switch off navigation lights sergei flipped the switch the command came sooner than hed expected he hoped the sbs wouldnt collide with each other in the darkness he saw no bursts of flame or midair explosions so he supposed they didnt he would have waited longer than lieutenant colonel ponamarenko had all the same the bombers droned west a fat gibbous moon spilled milky light over the rodina far below there was the front it couldnt be anything else those sullen fires down on the ground the plumes of smoke climbing into the air any target we hit from now on it belongs to the nazis federov said any military target sergei agreed absently he was studying the compass out of the corner of his eye he watched the copilot and bombaimer blink if federov was nkvd as hed wondered should he have said that too late to worry about it now and how many byelorussians had the german hordes overrun millions surely and some great russians and ukrainians as well russians called germans nemtsi the tonguetied ones to ancient russian ears the german language was sensefree senseless babble in german slav and slave both came from the same word even in the days when they were forming their speech the germans had thought their eastern neighbors fit only for doing what they told them to do all that went back more than a thousand yearshow much more sergei didnt know he did know not much had changed since the navigation lights were out but he found he could still spot the flames in the exhaust from the other sbs engines no doubt they could see his plane the same way that was goodhe supposed if he saw other ghostly shapes other exhaust fires coming out of the west he shook his head refusing to borrow trouble compass and airspeed indicator were his only navigation tools calling that crude gave it too much credit were about where we ought to be he said at last hoping he was right lets give them our present and head back to the airstrip sounds good to me federov said sergei shouted into the speaking tube bombs away ivan right the chimp answered the bombs fell free the sb got livelier bombs fucking away kuchkov reported then im getting out of here sergei hadnt seen any german night fighters and he didnt want to either he hauled the bomber around in the sky and headed back toward the airstrip even more than he had on taking off he hoped hed be able to find it a moment later he started hoping hed get back to russia to find it german flak woke up all at once the nazis had no searchlights the way they would while defending their own cities they were firing by ear and by guess gauging height and position from the sound of the bombers engines fire flashed on the ground as the antiaircraft guns went off red and yellow streaks were tracer rounds rising through the air and the bursts reminded sergei of the booms when skyrockets turned nights into magic here he was in the middle of one of the fanciest fireworks shows hed ever imagined a fragment clanged into the fuselage the germans might be guessing where his plane was but they made goddamn good guessers the longer the flak went on the scarier it got you all right back there sergei called to sergeant kuchkov bet your cock i am pussy missed me by twenty motherfucking centimeters easy those bitches cant shoot any better than they can fart kuchkov swore as naturally as he breathed and a lot more artistically well good sergei said making the bomber jink to help confusehe hopedthe gunners aim any damage to the plane nothing the groundcrew assholes cant fix pretty easy the chimp replied and sergei had to be content with that after crossing the front sergei picked up a little antiaircraft fire from his own side but only a little hed been thinking about football before now he did again come on fellows you dont want an own goal here what ivan kuchkov called the russians manning those guns should have unmanned them from several thousand meters sergei peered down toward the ground looking for the rectangle of lights hed leftor for any other rectangle of lights he happened to see they wouldnt mark a football pitch but an airstrip he almost yipped in surprise when he saw one was he that good a navigator or just that lucky tonight as he descended he grew more and more convinced this really was the runway from which hed set out the lights were arranged the same way anyhow and he didnt think the authorities would have standardized that he lowered the landing gear and put down as gently as if the dirt strip were paved with eggs night landings were not for the faint of heart he was proud of this one and prouder when federov said weve come in rougher than that plenty of times in broad daylight we have sergei agreed he tried to sound as if that were routine but couldnt even convince himself that he managed it if those bombs had actually hurt the nazis this would be a perfect run hansulrich rudel was happy in the way only a man whos wanted a woman for a long time and finally got her into bed can be happy he was pretty much an idiot in other words but a sated and smiling idiot this was the best furlough of his life he was sure it was the best furlough of anybodys life yes he was pretty much an idiot for the time being sofia he discovered after asking eight or ten times definitely an idiot was halfjewish a mischling first class as the reich classified racial categories she thought of herself as a jew though my fathers a miserable drunk she said why should i want to be like him sounds like a pole hansulrich thought as if thered never been a german drunk in the history of the world although an idiot he wasnt quite an imbecile he didnt say what he was thinking out loud he did ask what does your mother do she went to palestine sofia answered with the war i havent heard much from her the past year or so after she broke up with my father she got the zionist itch i think she was making up for marrying a goy but try and tell her that she rolled her eyes try and tell my mother anything good luck and here you are with me hansulrich said running a hand along the smooth warm length of her she had a tiny flat a couple of blocks from the tavern where she worked maybe youre not so different from her after all should i watch it if i try to tell you something not quite an imbecile but absolutely an idiot what woman wants to hear shes like her mother youd better not start sofia replied with a bayonetsharp edge to her voice and i havent talked about marrying you have i gevalt well no rudel admitted he hadnt talked about marrying her either you could screw just about anybody and your superiors wouldnt care as long as you didnt come down venereal he tried to imagine a luftwaffe officer marrying a mischling first class in wartime his superiors would care about that oh yes just a little what better way to shoot your military career right between the eyes youd never see another promotion again theyd probably take the ritterkreuz away too all right then dont be dumber than you can help sofia said which at that moment might have been asking for more than hansulrich could give how about this then he said and rolled on top of her she squeaked with surprise but not with dismay he was amazed he could go this often he was a young healthy animal in fine physical condition he had very few limits when it came to horizontal athletics some little while later after both their hearts stopped thudding so hard sofia asked him and what do you do when youre standing up its been too long i dont remember he answered deadpan braggart she poked him in the ribs youman you an exquisitely timed pause but i repeat myself he did have the mother wit to realize he ought to ask her something personal and he wasnt ready for another round he didnt think he was anyhow what do you want to do with yourself he said live through the war she said at once if i cant do that nothing else matters does it no he said wishing hed come out with the question in a different way his odds of living through the war were well not good stuka pilots went where things were already hot and made them hotter that was a good way to win yourself a knights cross it wasnt such a good way to persuade your insurance man to write a fat policy on you most of the time hansulrich avoided thinking about that what combat soldier didnt if you started feeling the gooses footfalls every time it walked over your grave how were you supposed to do your duty you couldntit was as simple as that and so you figured that everything had gone all right the last time and that meant it would this time too youre going to forget me sofia said when you remember me youre going to be embarrassed you had anything to do with me most women would have started weeping and wailing after they came out with a line like that sofia sounded no more excited than she would have if she asked him whether he wanted more coffee all the same rudel tried to deny everything ill remember you forever oh cut the crap sofia said youre going to remember me after youve got four kids and a blond aryan wife dont make me laugh youll do your best to pretend nothing in bialystok ever happened how do you know im not married now he asked youre the kind whod wear a ring and even if you didnt youre the kind whod get upset about cheating on his sweetie back home sofia answered it wouldnt stop youdoes it ever stop anybodybut youd get upset about it anyway he twisted in the narrow bed so he could face her the mattress creaked under him it had been doing a lot more creaking than that lately the sun was going down shadows shrouded sofias features you dont much like people do you he said she shrugged the same excellent firm that did her ankles had also sculpted her collarbones i am one what else have i got to like im not one of those jerks who get a dog or a cat and pretend its their baby all right he said he tended to get sloppy over dogs but not the way she meant if sofia were to get a pet he had the feeling shed choose a cat instead or maybe a viper she leaned up on one elbow her breasts were small with broad dark nipples almost as if shed already had a child maybe she had there was a lot he didnt know about her when he reached out to touch one she knocked his hand away so she said whats it like for a nazi to fuck a jew he had no idea how to answer that so he tried a counterquestion whats it like for a jew to lay a nazi my people already dont like me because of who my father is sofia replied you though youre different what would your mother say if she found out who i was his mother disapproved of everything that had anything to do with sex shed warned him about women before he had any idea what she was talking about he was sometimes amazed hed ever been born his father must have been very persuasive one nightor just too horny to take no for an answer im a big boy now he said i dont have to worry about that any more fine sofia found a new place to stick in the needle what would your commanding officer say then he teased me about having a girlfriend before i set out for bialystok rudel answered i just hoped he was right she gave him a crooked smile what you werent sure you could sweep me off my feet i dont think anybodys ever sure of anything with you he answered truthfully i hope not sofia took that as a matter of courseand as a matter of pride when people are sure about you things get boring hansulrich could imagine the two of them parting a lot of different ways heading the list was onewhich hardly matteredclanging the other in the ear with a frying pan other filmworthy melodramas also stood high up there getting bored with each other lay way down below something like being separated in an attack by flying orangutans he could imagine her finding a german protector useful poles didnt love the jews who made up a tenth of their countrys population perhaps because they had so many jews no laws restricting them were on the books here the reich had such laws of course maybe sofia feared they would come to poland too and hoped a german could help her escape their bite and maybe she was right in both fear and hope that might account for her taking a german into her bed but what accounted for her taking a particular german one hansulrich rudel he didnt ask her he had a fear of his own that she might tell him the exact and literal truth whatever her reasons were he was glad she had them glad and more than glad again she said as he began to rise to the occasion im going to have to put some new minerals in your mineral water i swear i am but she didnt push him away or tell him no her arms closed around him her lips met his and he wished his furlough could last forever like most of the men in his division willi dernen came from the breslau wehrkreis near the polish border he knew a handful of polish words most of them foul till this campaign though hed never crossed the frontier he hadnt even fought in czechoslovakia his outfit had guarded the reich s western border against a french attack that never really materialized a good thing too if the froggies had hit hard they would have cracked the undermanned german defenses like a man breaking the shell on his breakfast softboiled egg and now frenchmen and tommies would help the wehrmacht smash stalins socalled workers paradise lifeand who was diddling whom at any given momentcould get very strange sometimes minsk now wasnt in poland up until recently it had been the capital of the byelorussian soviet socialist republic now it was where the germans reorganized before sending units new to the east up to the fighting front a lot of jews and red officials had fled the place before the germans and poles broke in the russians and white russians who remained seemed resigned to the towns sudden change of overlords the poles in the population seemed delighted they flew polish flags white over red at any excuse or none willi watched german engineers cart away larger than lifesized bronze statues of lenin and stalin that wasnt just to show the locals that minsk was under new management there had to be at least a tonne of bronze in each statue germany was chronically short of raw materials pretty soon vladimir and josef would get shot back at the ivans even corporal baatz laughed when willi remarked on that awful arno hadnt been as awful as usual at least not to willi he had to inflict his schrechlichkeit on the replacements who filled out the company and that took up most of his time and bad temper the bulk of the replacements also came from wehrkreis viii the wehrmacht tried to keep men from the same part of the country in the same outfit it helped units hold together and anything that did that looked good to the men who gave orders if youd gone to school with one of the new guys or maybe with a cousin of his youd try harder to keep him in one piece and hed do the same for you that was the idea anyway unfortunately the high foreheads whod come up with the idea had never heard of arno baatz he was doing his best to make sure that all the replacements regardless of which wehrkreis they came from hated his guts and his best as willi had too much reason to know was pretty goddamn good his latest target was a new gefreiter named adam pfaff the fellow was new to the company that is a wound badge and a slightly gimpy left leg showed hed been around the block before he seemed a good soldier normally even awful arno would have had trouble finding something for which he could pick on him normally but for reasons of his own pfaff had painted his rifle dark gray the job couldnt have been neater but arno baatz had never before seen anybody who carried a dark gray rifle like any other monkey he made fun of the unfamiliar without even thinking about whether he ought to he gaped and pointed and growled what the hell are you doing with that stupid thing you aim to paint polka dots on it next no corporal the calm way pfaff answered made willi guess hed got grief from noncoms before he patted the feldgrau sleeve of his uniform tunic they make our clothes this color on account of its hard to see i figured id fix my mauser up to match it doesnt do any harm it looks stupid awful arno said by which he meant it had better not still be gray the next time i see it it doesnt do any harm pfaff repeated by which he meant fuck you there were plenty of things arno baatz didnt understand but he got that all right his plump cheeks turned the color of iron in a blacksmiths forge oh yeah he ground out well lets just see what major schmitz has to say about that he deployed the heavy artillery major heinrich schmitz commanded not just the company but the whole battalion but the barrage failed to obliterate pfaff fine with me he answered easily hes already seen it he told me he thought it was a pretty good idea whaaat baatz stretched the word out to unnatural length you expect me to believe that shit im gonna go talk to him right this minute and if i find out youre lyingno when i find out youre lyingyour sorry ass is mine off he stormed gloating anticipation splashed all over his face pfaff lit a cigarette boy that was fun he said to no one in particular then catching willis eye he asked is that arselick always that bad nah willi shook his head thats good the other gefreiter said must be on the rag or something huh willi shook his head again he hadnt finished yet now he did a lot of the time awful arnos worse about the third time ive heard people call him that pfaff said with a thin chuckle everybody must love him to death to death is right willi answered rolling his eyes hes not yellow or anything like that i will say when the shooting starts hes all right to have at your elbow any other time its like you said hes the biggest asshole left unwiped he wanted to ask pfaff whether hed been bullshitting when he told baatz major schmitz had given his imprimatur to the gray rifle but he held his peace as far as he was concerned it was everybody in the world against awful arno you didnt want to let on that you had doubts about someone on your own side not only that but hed also find out for himself one way or the other pretty damn soon when baatz came back about twenty minutes later he might have had a thunderstorm hanging from his wobbly jowls he didnt come up to adam pfaff and admit that the new gefreiter told the truth that would have been the gentlemanly thing to do which meant it was as far beyond baatzs ken as the mountains on the back side of the moon since the corporal couldnt take it out on the man whod made him embarrass himself he took it out on everybody else he screamed at willi whod heard him call pfaff a liar when the replacement wasnt because willi had heard all that he endured the sturm und drang with a smile on his face that only pissed awful arno off worse he couldnt stick willi with extra fatigues the privilege the pip on willis left sleeve gave him and so baatz screamed some more anybody who could draw extra duty did willis smile got wider you have that fat clowns number by god pfaff said nothing but admiration in his voice when awful arno finally went away how long have you been stuck under him since before the shooting started willi answered mournfully oh you poor miserable son of a bitch pfaff said willi nodded he thought of himself the same way the other gefreiter went on i bet he doesnt like your rifle either willi carried an ancient beatup mauser it shot pretty well but it was ugly as siamesetwin hippos hed had the fine snipers rifle buti was going to get out from under him swear to jesus i was then the sharpshooter who was training me got his head blown off and i went back to ordinary duty arno made sure of that and that i didnt get to keep my nice piece he said it would shoot too slow with the downturned bolt yknow thank you very much corporal baatz im glad you said he was good in the field otherwise pfaff stopped right there one more word could have landed him in trouble willid had those thoughts about baatz himself hed never quite done anything about themawful arno wouldnt be here for pfaff to discover and admire if he had but hed had them oh yes he would have bet a years pay against a sack of sheepshit there wasnt one single guy in the whole goddamn company who hadnt einberg hey weinberg the call was urgent even imperative yeah nu whats upque paso chaim answered wondering who the hell needed him and for what he thought he knew the voice of every yank and spaniard in the abe lincoln battalion whoever was taking his name in vain hed never met the guy before and he found out because the fellow a spaniard said youre wanted in madrid pronto chaim might know all the abe lincolns but he damn well didnt know every one of the couple of million people left in madrid wanted by who the cops put in one of the guys he did know funny hank funny like a dose of the clap hardeharhar see im laughing my ass off chaim switched from english to spanish to ask his question again who wants me why the party of course the messenger seemed amazed he would need to ask about anything that obvious patiently he tried again the whole party or somebody in particular maybe he screwed up the grammar worse than usual so the messenger didnt get it or maybe he owned more patience than the madrileno because the man just repeated pronto all right already im coming chaim said with no great enthusiasm he wanted to stay with his buddies the communist party cared no more for what he wanted than for any other individuals desires but he wasnt exactly brokenhearted about going back to the capital with a little luck hed be able to see la martellita after the apparatchik whod pulled his card out of a box got done with him his blunt pudgy features softened magdalena he whispered under his breath that was her real name magdalena flores shed been desperately hung over the next morning she barely remembered making love with him while she was drunk but he tended to her so wellaspirins strong coffee the hair of the dog a very little mild but greasy foodthat he convinced her he cared about her along with wanting her sweetly curved body it wasnt quite that the road to her heart ran through her stomach but it also wasnt very far removed from that shed let him back into her bed when she was sober what more could any man not a fairy want and so he followed the messenger south through the zigzagging communications trenches by the time they came out into the open they were too far behind the line to need to worry about snipers the messenger took charge of his own bicycle and another one reserved for chaim they pedaled into madrid no manana here pronto meant what it said to call chaims bike a piece of junk would have given it too much credit if this were a horse id shoot it he said you can walk if you want to still a few kilometers to go though the messenger answered chaim shut up people on foot people on other bikes people on donkeys and horses people on animaldrawn wagons and carriages even a few people in cars afternoon traffic in madrid everyone who had a horn blew it everyone who didnt shouted or whistled instead it made new york city seem not just sedate but sedated foul language and obscene gestures were all part of the show chaim wasnt much surprised when the messenger led him to the building where la martellita worked he was summoned on party business and this was party headquarters but when the fellow said report to room he blinked that was her office why had she pulled him out of the line was she going to put him back on propaganda duty with nationalist prisoners he thoughtin fact he was sureshe didnt believe his ideology was pure enough to let him do that maybe one of her bosses had overruled her and she was going to read him the riot act before she let him tell the pows what a gang of fat exploiting slobs their former bosses were that made more sense than anything else he could come up with which didnt mean it was right of course one way or another hed find out in a couple of minutes he climbed the stairs to the third floor which would have been reckoned the fourth floor in the usa the building had an elevator and it worked no one used it it required an operator and the party had decided positions like that demeaned the proletarians who had to fill them la martellita looked up from her paperwork when he walked into her cramped little room emotions chased one another across her face too fast to let him sort them out all she said was close the door por favor close it he did had she summoned him so she could fool around right here and on company time the mere idea was enough to heat his blood what is it my pretty one my sweet one my little dove he asked as he stepped toward her compliments sounded so much more well complimentary in spanish then he stopped in his tracks as he would have when he saw a sign with skull and crossbones that warned of a minefield ahead he recognized her expression now all right raw red rage you goddamn stinking son of a bitch im going to have a baby she screeched so much for the closed door oof he said as if someone had punched him in the pit of the stomach whatever hed been expecting that wasnt it he wondered why not the next time they used a safe would be the first condoms were hard to get here despite the republics progressive social policies spain remained a catholic country what are you going to do about it la martellita demanded seems to me i already did what i do chaim said if looks could kill they would have dragged him out of the little office by his feet after the one she gave him helplessly he spread his hands babies are a chance you take you know he made pregnancy sound like a social disease well wasnt it the ultimate social disease without it there wouldnt be any society la martellitas glare did not abate you arent helping she said pointedly what am i supposed to say he asked in what he thought of as reasonable tones odds were la martellita thought he was hectoring her hectoring or not he went on if you want me to marry you i will did that just come out of my mouth he wondered dizzily damned if it didnt he knew damn well it was dumb luck hed ever got to sleep with her in the first place shed drunk herself sadhell shed drunk herself tragicand he happened to be in the right place at the right time thered never been a dull moment in the sack with her whether she was drunk or sober all the same hed always figured himself for the cat that fell into the cream pitcher before long it would have to scramble out and lick its fur dry and then it would have a memory to last forever but if he could keep right on bedding down with her if he could see if he might make a go of it with this fierce beautiful eminently kissable creature that would be joy beyond his wildest dreamsat least till she decided shed rather murder him than live with him any more well she said nodding slowly you are a gentleman after all yes lets do that it will give the child a nameand i can divorce you as soon as its born she sounded as if she eagerly looked forward to it too she probably did divorce was easy in the spanish republic easier than in the states even in nevada where marshal sanjurjo ruled it was impossible he and his followers took their religion seriously or at least legislated as if they did chaim took the bull by the horns lets go find a judge he said if he was going to be married he hoped to enjoy the privileges of matrimony for as long as he could la martellita kept right on glaring she didnt have to be einstein or freud to know what was in his beady little mind you only want to keep screwing me not only my sweet chaim answered with such dignity as he could muster but a man has to be a maricon not to want to screw you even if he is a maricon hell think about it you never could tell what shed like and what would piss her off that she seemed to like she even laughed a little youre crazy she said not without admiration el narigon loco thats me he agreed not without pride the crazy kike a nickname hed acquired by brawling in bars like a man who didnt care if he lived or died well if marrying la martellita wasnt a good reason to go on living he couldnt imagine what would be and if she was going to have a baby so was he he hadnt left a wife and kids behind to come fight in spain the way some abe lincolns and a lot of other internationals had this would be his first time as a father he liked that idea toomaybe not so much as jumping on la martellitas elegant bones whenever he felt like it but he did moscow speaking along with the other officers in his squadron anastas mouradian listened to the hourly news when you were fighting a war you only know how your own little piece of it was going often enough you werent even sure about that if you were going to see the bigger picture youd see it through the radio and the newspapers there is fierce fighting against the fascist invaders near the border between the byelorussian ssr and the russian federated ssr the newsreader went on stas heard him rustle the papers from which he was reading and heavy fighting continues in the northwestern ukrainian ssr fierce fighting meant fierce fighting heavy fighting meant the red army was taking it on the chin nobody in the soviet union ever came right out and admitted things were going badly you had to decode the news and read between the lines if you were even going to see through a glass darkly lieutenant general andrei andreyevich vlasov continues to distinguish himself in combat against the hitlerites the announcer said an entire german panzer division has been hurled back in confusion by his troops that was interesting except for stalin and marshal zhukov the news rarely mentioned generals by name maybe that was a hangover from a few years before when so many of them got purged any which way this andrei vlasov seemed to have evaded the restriction there is also an important announcement in the field of foreign relations the newsreader said mouradian tensedand he wasnt the only flyer listening to the news who did what had gone wrong now had finland declared war on the ussr had the united states the one would be a misfortune the other a catastrophe but for once it wasnt that kind of announcement the familiar voice continued foreign minister litvinov will travel to tokyo to confer with officials from the empire of japan about terms for ending the war in the far east which japan will find acceptable mouradian and several other officers sighed on the identical note peace against japan hadnt come cheap in the early years of the century and it would be even more expensive now vladivostok would go and with it the soviet unions main pacific port the transsiberian railway wouldnt go all the way across siberia any more the last war had cost russia the southern half of sakhalin island north of japan this one would probably cost the ussr the rest of the place and who could guess what else japan would want to squeeze out of litvinov on the other hand the ussr desperately needed peace on the distant frontier because it had a much bigger much more urgent war much closer to home when it came the country could pay full attention to the nazis and everybody else coming out of the west stas only hoped that would prove good enough to save the soviet union frighten all your neighbors and make them hate you and this was the kind of mess you wound up in president franklin roosevelt of the united states has offered to help mediate the dispute between the soviet union and japan the announcer said his cousin theodore roosevelt was president of the usa during the russojapanese war and helped work out the terms of the treaty of portsmouth which ended it general secretary stalin immediately accepted the american proposal the japanese however refused it declaring that they doubted america was truly committed to peace this being so japan and the peaceloving soviet union will pursue their talks bilaterally some of mouradians colleagues scratched their heads trying to work out what was going on there he sighed inside his own mind some people really shouldnt have been allowed to run around loose japan thought the usa would sabotage the peace talks not help them along that was obvious to stas if not to his comrades as long as japan was busy fighting the soviet union she wouldnt also take on the united statesnot if her leaders were in their right mind she wouldnt but she was clearing the decks for the big fight the important fight no less than stalin was knock america back on her heels and japan was master of the pacific no one else could challenge her there england and france were busy far closer to home holland mistress of the resourcerich dutch east indies lay under nazi occupation if japan didnt have to worry about the usa the newsreader spoke of the anticipated harvest and by how much it would exceed the norms established by the agricultural planners only the planners had any real idea of how much grain came in across the country if they cooked the books to make things sound better who would stop them who else would even know as long as people didnt start starving nobody and if people did start starving it might be for reasons political rather than agricultural anyone who didnt believe that could ask the surviving ukrainians stakhanovite shock brigades continue to increase steel coal and aluminum production the newsreader said proudly output rises even as factories are knocked down and transported east out of range of the hitlerite savages and their terrorbombing campaign good thats good murmured the pilot sitting next to mouradian it would indeed be good if it was true that it could be true struck stas as most unlikely the less you said sometimes the better he said not a word here the newsreader blathered on and on he seemed to speak very candidly everything was for the best in this best of all possible worlds mouradian smiled a little when that occurred to him too bad it was a joke he would have to keep to himself somehow he didnt think the nkvd would find it funny when music finally came out of the speaker instead of the newsreaders perpetual optimism lieutenant colonel tomashevsky addressed the squadron well boys you heard it yourselves were going to make nice with the little slantyeyed shitheads for a while one thing at a time i always say once we give the nazis what they deserve well go back to the east and pay what we owe there oh yes youd best believe we will speaking of perpetual optimism did the squadron commander really believe what he was saying if he did stas wanted some of whatever hed been drinking or maybe not whatever it was it was probably too full of sugar to be palatable for an ordinary man then again perhaps you needed that kind of spiritand that kind of spiritsif you were going to keep serving the soviet union they werent flying from the airstrip theyd used when they first took their pes into action against the germans and poles german bombers had worked that one over as far as mouradian could see the new russian plane was better than any bomber the luftwaffe used it had at least as large a bomb load and it was faster and more maneuverable than the german bombers but that mattered only so much back in the day the sb really had been able to outrun the biplane fighters it met in spain against the bf it turned into a death trap if the germans had chased the pe across the sky with heinkel and dornier bombers everything would have been lovely sadly the messerschmitt fighter remained more than a match for the petlyakov machine as well but the ussr was a big placebigger maybe than the nazis fully understood they had only so many s nowhere near enough to cover all of soviet airspace all the time the pes stood a much better chance of getting through and coming back than did the older slower sbs not for the first time mouradian hoped sergei yaroslavsky and ivan the chimp remained among those present plenty of train lines in southern france went down toward spain only two actually crossed the border one near the atlantic which led into territory loyal to marshal sanjurjo and this one hard by the mediterranean which took the czech soldiers who had fought for france against germany into the republic to fight fascism now that france wasnt interested any more vaclav jezek made a sour face when benjamin halevy told him that so those french assholes could be shipping shit to sanjurjo at the same time as theyre giving us to the republic he said thats about the size of it halevy agreed he was heading into exile too because he was vaclav saw fit to add nothing personal dont worry about it the jew replied i think theyre assholes too he wore a new uniform from the army of the republic of czechoslovakia with a czech sergeants three dots on his shoulder straps replacing the french hash mark on his sleeve running a finger between his collar and his neck he grumbled im still not used to the way this damn thing fits if youre a czech you never fit in the way youre supposed to vaclav said youd better get used to it halevy raised a gingery ironic eyebrow i think i can just about manage that you know yeah i guess vaclav felt foolish the only way jews would ever feel at home anywhere was to get their own country fat chance of that and even if they did theyd probably kick christians and moslems around just because they could they were human beings werent they till vaclav got to know halevy he wouldnt have bet a single czech koruna that jews were human beings hed scorned them distrusted them despised them for no better reason than that they had their own funny religionand as often as not they were too goddamn smart for their own good halevy was no dummy he wouldnt put einstein out of business any time soon though and he made a good noncom even if hed had his cock clipped he took war seriously he wouldnt be wearing a czech uniform he wouldnt be carrying czech papers in his pocket if he didnt even the french werent dumb enough to try to make jews fight on the same side as nazi germany he could have sat out the war in safety he could have but he didnt want to on second thought who said he was no dummy over the border vaclav saw the last of the french tricolor he was glad to see the last of it even if the colors were the same as those of his conquered homeland they stood for liberty equality and fraternity and what did any of those have to do with fighting side by side with adolf hitler damn all as far as he was concerned on the other side of the frontier flew the spanish republics flaganother tricolor this one of red yellow and purple it was certainly gaudier than frances standard or czechoslovakias but the republic hadnt turned its back on whatever those colors stood for it wouldnt still be fighting if it had marshal sanjurjos side had another flag yet well to hell with him this was the one vaclav had chosen it might not be his first or even his second choice but it seemed better than anything else out there right now the train wheezed to a stop at first he thought it had broken down again the french had given the czechs going off to fight in spain the worst rolling stock they had their good passenger cars and new locomotives were hauling french troops east to fight the russians that being so breakdowns were almost a badge of honor but no this was some kind of customs inspection normally countries frowned on large bands of uniformed men importing weapons these werent normal times though vaclav doubted he would live to see normal times again he stared when a republican officer came into the car he supposed this was an officer anyhowwhat else would the fellow be but the man was bareheaded and wore denim coveralls over a collarless workers shirt he looked more likely to repair a clogged drain than to give orders revolutionary chic benjamin halevy whispered to vaclav after that the fellows outfit made more sense he spoke a sentence in a language that wasnt french but sounded something like it vaclav couldnt even swear in spanish he was surprised but not very surprised when halevy answered in what sounded like the same tongue after a bit of back and forth the republic officer grinned and nodded and went on to the next car i didnt know you spoke spanish vaclav told the jew in admiring tones not spanishcatalan kind of halfway between spanish and french halevy answered and i dont speak it but i can fake it some ah jezek nodded he could make a stab at slavic languages not his own it didnt always workhed been reduced to speaking german with the polish soldier who interned him but it was usually worth a try he hadnt thought that the romance languages might work the same way he found a more relevant question so what did the guy want to make sure weve come to fight for the republic and against the nationalist shitheadsi think thats what he called them sounds right to me jezek said what did you tell him that we were really here for a picnic and to meet all the pretty spanish gals halevy replied without changing expression ahh your mother she was a pretty gal but not spanish halevy seemed willing to tell bad jokes all day vaclav planted an elbow in his ribs not hard enough to hurt but to suggest he should quit acting like a jerk it was a forlorn hope and vaclav knew it still you had to make the effort vaclav also knew all about making the effort despite forlorn hope if he hadnt would he have come to spain another officer strode into the car this one wore khaki and he had on a cap with a flat crown if his pink skin broad face and pale eyes hadnt told which army he belonged to the uniform would have he greeted the czechs not in spanish but in russian which he confidently expected them to understand vaclav caught the gist anyhow most of his countrymen probably did the ussr had helped czechoslovakia when nobody else would now the czechs were helping spain the soviet unions ally when hardly anyone else would he thanked them for that had he left it there everything would have been fine but he went on to say something to the effect that now the czechs would have to follow stalins orders like everybody else that was what vaclav thought he said anyhow the russian took no questions he went on to inflict his greetings on the next car farther back did he say what i thought he said vaclav asked halevy i dont know the jew answered but what i thought he said i didnt like it for beans neither did i vaclav said that probably means we both think he said the same stupid thing what can you do halevy said with a sigh hes a russian without the russians the republic would have lost the war a long time ago then france would have had to ship us to paraguay or something when she switched sides is there a war in paraguay i hadnt heard about a new one and i thought the old one was over vaclav said for all i know it is the jew replied the french government would ship us over there any which way theyre my people too and i know how they work if nobodys fighting there now theyd count on us to start something that had an appalling feel of probability to it vaclav said me i was thinking theyd send us to china if they didnt have spain everybody hates the japs pretty mucheven the russians youre right they do benjamin halevy agreed the japs may play even less by the rules than hitler and stalin do he threw his hands in the air in mocking triumph and they said it couldnt be done the train chose that moment to jerk into motion again on they went deeper into spain and a brandnew war pete mcgill was getting to the point where he could move pretty well on crutches he could even hobble fifty feet or so with just a cane and hed made it from his bed to a chair nearby with no artificial aids whatever for all the world as if he were a normal human being one of these days the cast on his arm would come off and then he could truly start working on getting his strength back he couldnt wait he wasnt the only injured serviceman in manila who wanted to get back into action as fast as he could or else a little faster when he listened to the radio or read a paper he could add two and two and get four he might have had trouble in school but he sure didnt in the real world russia had patched up a ceasefire with japan she was trying to fight hitler with everything she had okay fine but that also meant the japs wouldnt have any distractions any more oh they were stuck in china but they could lick the chinks whenever they set their minds to it chiang kaisheks troops wouldnt parade through tokyo any time in the next hundred years and neither would mao tsetungs no matter how much stalin wished they would well if japan had gone and started clearing her decks for action where would the action be to corporal pete mcgill right about here looked like the best answer to that question it wasnt as if the prospect of a war between japan and the united states was a firstclass military secret the exact plans for fighting it were bound to be secret of course but almost every navy file and leatherneck could give the short version of those plans pete wasnt nearly sure army guys could do the same thing a firm marine corps belief was that men who joined the army were a few ice cubes short of a whole tray when you got down to it the thing looked simple the us navy would steam west from pearl harbor the japanese navy would steam east from tokyo bay wherever they bumped into each other theyd start slugging away the last fleet standing would go on and thump hell out of the other side till they got sick of it and gave up not subtle not pretty but plans didnt have to be they just had to work and being simple sure didnt hurt things like aircraft carriers did complicate the game pete assumed his side knew how many the japs had so they could make more that wasnt necessarily the wisest assumption but pete had never tried to persuade american taxpayers to fork over for national defense what he didnt know could hurt him but he didnt know that either he figured the fight would look like jutland from the last war only bigger somebodyd described the english admiral at jutland as the only man who could lose the war in an afternoon both the american and jap commanders in the next fight would wear the same mantle whether they liked it or notand chances were they wouldnt the logical place for the big smashup was somewhere in philippine waters japan would want to clear the usa out of this colony so close to the home islands do that and youd also deprive the us navy of bases within striking distance of japan and the americans wouldnt be able to interfere with whatever japan decided to do in china and french indochina and the dutch east indies which was why pete wanted to get back to active duty as soon as he could every navy ship had a marine detachment on battlewagons and cruisers marines served the secondary armament not the great big guns in the turrets but the next size down marines kept order on smaller warships and did whatever else people told them to do if the navy was going to fight the big fight against the japs pete wanted to be there and join in a physical therapist gave him exercises to help him heal faster he performed them with a dedication that amazed and alarmed the man if you tear a tendon working out you wont do yourself any good the fellow said severely right pete answered take this guy seriously forget it for one thing he wondered if the therapist was a faggot for another he subscribed to the informal marine corps creed anything worth doing was worth overdoing the therapist didnt need long to realize that pete was hard of listening why are you pushing yourself like that he demanded it wont change things by more than a few days one way or the other could be a big few days pete said stubbornly could be the difference between getting a ship and staying beached that the therapist couldnt very well misunderstand even if you do get beached corporal therell still be plenty for you to do he said or dont you think the japs will try to land troops in the philippines when the balloon goes up huh pete said a thoughtful grunt hed worried so much about the big headon collision between navies that he hadnt wasted time with what might happen on land maybe he should have or maybe not doesnt matter whether they do he said thatll just be a watchacallita secondary engagement like i aim to be where the real action is i owe those yellow sonsabitches plentybetter believe i do the more i can give em back in person the better ill like it well you wont like a torn achilles tendon so take it easy okay the physical therapist said ill try pete couldnt have sounded more grudging if the man had recommended that he quit screwing for the next five years hed had to quit screwing while he was laid up he hadnt been interested either not while he was mourning vera it would have seemed disloyal to her memory come to that it still did which didnt keep him from noticing whenever he spotted anything female and under the age of fifty people told dirty stories about military nurses and about how theyd blow you or jack you off if you needed it and you didnt have anyone of your own to take care of things for you pete had hoped those stories were the straight goods they werent just dirty they were what was the word therapeutic came pretty close the next sign of their truth he found would be the first oh the gals were one hundred percent nonchalant when they handled your john henry in the line of duty but none of them here showed the least bit of interest in doing anything with petes but shoving it in a bedpan too bad he thought and so it seemed time hung heavy everything in the philippines seemed to move as lazily as the ceiling fans that stirred the air without cooling it there was talk of airconditioning the hospital but there seemed to be neither will nor money to get on with the job the talk was as desultory as everything else best guess was that the system would be installed by or the day before philippine independence whichever came last people grumbled about the mere idea of philippine independence there was already a small philippine army under the command of douglas macarthur he served the philippines with the exalted rank of field marshal to which he couldnt aspire in the us army if he stayed in till he was goddamn filipinos can fucking well keep him said a us army sergeant in petes ward when he ran the bonus army out of washington my old man and my uncle were two of the guys he rousted that was chickenshit all right another army guy agreed so how come you joined up if you already knew theyd screw you the same as they screwed your father and your uncle a resigned shrug from the sergeant whod got hurt in a car crash shit man it was nineteenfuckingthirtyfour there wasnt no work nowhere i knew theyd feed me long as i stayed in afterwards i didnt give a rats ass about afterwards crap i still dont afterwardsll just have to take care of itself boy i figured the same thing when i signed on the dotted line for the corps pete said i was broke i couldnt land a job world had me by the short hairs has it let go since the sergeant asked not hardly pete answered in a high squeaky voice everybody laughed as if hed been joking listair walsh approached the personnel office with more trepidation than hed felt crossing some minefields all the same he opened the door took his place in the queue inside and worked his way forward most of the men in front of him were ordinary privates with ordinary problems he envied them in due course he presented himself at a window behind which sat a noncom with almost as much mileage as he had himself yes staff sergeant the fellow said what can i do for you this morning i should like to make the arrangements necessary for leaving the army walsh shook his head that wasnt right and he wouldnt pretend it was no i dont like it ive never liked anything lessexcept the notion of staying in and fighting on hitlers side he waited for the personnel sergeant to call him an unpatriotic clot or some other similar endearment the man did nothing of the kind nor did he seem surprised how many other soldiers had come before him with the same request more than a few if walsh was any judge are you sure of this the personnel sergeant asked the army needs men like youmen who know whats what yes im sure im not happy but im bloody sure walsh answered and the army may need me but i dont need the army any more if its going to do this its not what i took the kings shilling for all these years ago you understand of course that only a small minority of military personnel feel as you do no i dont understand that at all walsh shook his head blokes ive talked with most of em are disgusted to have anything to do with the nazis except over open sights only difference is they arent disgusted enough to want to leave its not the same thing you know possibly not but the personnel sergeant wasnt finished you also understand that of the men who wish to resign we permit only a small proportion to do so urrh walsh saidas unhappy a noise as hed ever made this side of a wound hed been afraid of that he stuck out his chin ill take my chances i cant stomach it any more and thats flat how about this then said the man on the other side of the desk you could stay in with a guarantee from the ministry of war that youd never have to serve alongside the german army the ministry of war makes guarantees like that walsh said slowly under some circumstances yes to some people yes after a moments hesitation the personnel sergeant expanded on that it makes the guarantee to men it judges valuable enough to the army by your rank and experience you would be one of those men and it makes that guarantee where it does not look for any sizable amount of publicity if you take my meaning if i blab about it in the nearest pub the guarantee flies out the window yes walsh took his meaning all right quite the personnel sergeant smiled so what do you say to that regretfully walsh answered i still want out its not just that i dont fancy fighting alongside hitlers goons i dont want britain fighting alongside them it goes dead against everything the country stands for the government thinks otherwise the other veteran said his smile disappearing walsh could hear the capital letter bugger the government he gave it right back churchill was in the sodding government how did he come to die it was an accident a tragic accident the personnel sergeant said primly right mate sure it was and then you wake up walsh retorted youd better wake up any road on account of if you believe that youll believe anything oh youre one of those the personnel sergeant said as if much was now explained let me check something he consulted a typed list walsh recognized his own name even upside down the other man made a tickmark alongside it in pencil his voice went as cold as norwegian winter you still wish to leave his majestys service then what walsh wished right at that moment was for a chance to punch the personnel sergeant in the nose it would have to come some other time though too bad yes i still want that he said heavily well we can accommodate you then and in jig time too the personnel sergeant reached into a drawer pulled out forms and shoved them across the counter at him complete these and well carry on from there right walsh bent to the task when he came to the line that read reason for seeking discharge he couldnt help snorting the personnel sergeant raised a questioning eyebrow walsh pointed to the line and said looks like they want to know why i want the clap damned if it doesnt never noticed that before the personnel sergeant would laugh at such foolishness walsh had trouble imagining a soldier who wouldnt he had no trouble giving his reason adolf hitler is the enemy of the uk he wrote i will not serve with german soldiers or under german officers he thought for a moment that covered most of it but not all he added it is wrong for any british soldier to do so he nodded better now hed taken care of why he didnt want to stay in even if they said he didnt have to go to russia himself hed expected that resigning from the service would take a lot of paperwork he hadnt expected it to take as much as it did he waded through one form after another it all boiled down to ive done my bit and i dont want to play any more as long as i have to play on adolfs side here he said at last he signed his name for the final timehe hoped it was for the final timeand shoved the sheaf of papers back across the counter at the personnel sergeant that worthy went through them to make sure walsh had crossed every i and dotted every t he didnt find anything missing which seemed to disappoint him when hed examined the last form he asked have you any idea what youll do after leaving his majestys service not the foggiest notion walsh answered more cheerfully than he felt something will turn up before i land on the dole i hope so any road if all else fails maybe ill go to spain i hear the republic is still taking on men who want to fight for her the way the personnel sergeant curled his lip said what he thought of that it also said hed watched a lot of aristocratic officers and was doing his best to imitate them it was the kind of sneer that tempted walsh to say the hell with spain and to go sign on with the red army instead any man who didnt turn a bit bolshie when he saw a sneer like that wasnt worth the paper he was printed on youd sooner fight for a pack of wogs than your own country the personnel sergeant said it was that kind of sneer oswald mosley would have been proud of itwhich was in its own way a measure of mosleys damnation no id sooner fight for my own country all right walsh said wondering how long that punch in the nose could be delayed but im not about to fight for the fuhrer they arent the same thing and it doesnt matter if the prime minister says they are i know a damned lie when i hear one i dont care who comes out with it either even under the rather dim bulbs that lit the personnel office he could see the other sergeant go red its just as well that youre getting out the man said you bet it is walsh agreed he started to turn away then paused when does it become official oh youre out dont fret yourself over that the personnel sergeant said the gents who run things they dont want your kind in you can take that to the bank you can for upwards of twenty years officers had been telling walsh that men like him were the backbone of the british army his fitness reports had shown the same thing all the same he didnt doubt the personnel sergeant for a minute men who were not only able to think for themselves but insisted on doing so were dangerousat least to their superiors peace of mindin any army walsh left the personnel office with his last fortnights pay and his provisional discharge papers in hand he wondered if london would look different now that he was a civilian it didnt not so far as he could tell a crew of men in uniform was hauling down a barrage balloon no one expected russian air raids and people didnt have to worry about hitler any more wasnt life grand part of it was no one could give him orders now on the other hand he needed to start worrying about bed and board and everything else what was he going to do now as hed told the personnel sergeant he hadnt the faintest idea but he wouldnt do anything because some damn fritz told him to as far as he was concerned that mattered most the train rolled into germany german soldiersor maybe they were just frontier guards their uniforms looked funnywaved to the french soldiers inside some of the poilus waved back luc harcourt muttered in disgust to hell with him if hed do anything like that most of the fellows who waved were new fish they hadnt come up against german tanks and artillery and machine guns and dive bombers and grenades and the list went on and on they hadnt come up against germans was what it boiled down to luc had politics might put him on the same side as the feldgrau bastards but politics couldnt make him like them beside him lieutenant demange chainsmoked gitanes he would have done that anywhere probably including church i wish i never would have come along for this you know luc said yeah yeah wish for the moon while youre at it demange gave out as much sympathy as he usually did none you should have let the pox eat off your foreskin then they would have thought you were a kike and given you something else to do you love everybody dont you but of course the cigarette in the corner of demanges mouth jerked as he spoke it always did somehow it never fell out even when it got so small the coal was about to singe his lips well come on did you ever figure wed be fighting with the nazis and not trying to blow their heads off no but im not that surprised either cochons weve got running things they were always scared to death of another war with germany thats how come weve got the maginot line thats how come daladier went to fucking munich to hand hitler the sudetenland but hitler went to war anyhow so we got sucked in the good thing about fighting the russians is theyve got to go all the way through germany before they can bother us oh no they dont were going to them luc said demange waved that aside you know what i mean think like a paris politico if the germans took the place theyd grab your mistress and her flat and youd be stuck in the provinces with your wife he rolled his eyes at the inexpressible horror of the idea wonderful fucking marvelous luc said id sooner be a politico stuck with a fat fiftyyearold wife than a poilu on his way to russia to get his dick shot off but the politicos dont give a shit what youd sooner demange pointed out that basic truth with a certain savage gusto all his own and theyve got tough bastards like me to make good and sure you do like they tell you youre on your way to russia to get your dick shot off too luc observed what good does being a politicos watchdog do you hey i still get to tell all the sorry cons under me what to do demange answered now that the dumb fucks went and made me an officer i get to tell more sorry assholes what to do than ever doesnt help when the artillery starts coming in luc said for once he might have got under demanges armored hide ahh shut up the older man said because he was an officer and luc only a sergeant luc had to do as he was told in due course they passed from germany into poland luc had never heard french spoken with a polish accent before germanaccented french was a jokea nervous joke but a joke luc remembered a prewar cartoon of hitler holding out a french translation of mein kampf and going barlons vrancais the way he butchered the french for we speak french gave his words the lie but french with a polish twist sounded extra weirdalong with odd pronunciation the poles put the accent for every multisyllable word on the next to last and poland looked weird too it wasnt the people luc saw from the windows as the troop train rolled through towns well except for the blackhatted longcoated bearded jews who seemed like refugees from another time it wasnt even the towns themselves none of them would turn into paris any time soon but no provincial french towns would either it was the countryside there was too much of it and it was too flat what did they do to get it like this he asked demange if the veteran didnt know everything he sure didnt admit it it looks like somebody ironed the whole place we spent billions of francs building the maginot line like i was talking about a few days ago demange answered how much do you suppose the poles would have to lay out to make themselves some mountain ranges luc hadnt looked at it like that after a moments thought he nodded yeah thats about what it would take isnt it he clicked his tongue between his teeth as another kilometer of plain rolled by but what happens because they cant make mountains lieutenant demanges lips skinned back from his teeth in a horrible grin what happens ill tell you what happens my little cabbage he made as if to pat luc on the cheek luc knocked his hand away unfazed demange finished germans and russians happen thats what mm luc nodded again must be fun being a pole huh well some of the broads arent half bad demange said and luc nodded one more time some of the women hed seen were spectacular beauties with more stuff to hold on to than you could shake a stick at but again demange wasnt done he gave his verdict with the air of a judge passing sentence except for that you couldnt pay me enough to be a pole once more luc didnt care to try to tell him he was wrong when the people running your country saw the nazis as the lesser of two evilsand when they might well prove rightyou were not to put too fine a point on it in deep shit once they got east of warsaw they started passing through country that had been fought over it all looked much too familiar to luc the wrecked farmhouses the untended fields the rusting hulks of tanks and trucks the cratered ground the occasional crashed airplane the hasty graves marked by homemade wooden crosses or just by rifles topped with helmets the farther east they went the worse the fighting looked to have been then things changed again without warning signs stopped making any sense at all luc could no more understand polish than he could fly but he could try to sound out the incomprehensible words chances were he was botching them worse than poles botched french but he could try when the alphabet itself stopped meaning anything when the alphabet itself stopped meaning anything they werent in poland any more they were in the ussr the germans had the same problem here luc saw quite a few of their signs importantly pointing this way and that stark black letters on a snowy ground he didnt read german either though more of the words looked familiar than they did in polish but even seeing letters he could understand felt oddly reassuring the train stopped luc expected silence outside the car now that the noise from the engine and the wheels was gone instead he heard something like faroff thunder somebodys artillery was going to town lieutenant demange gave him that dreadful grin again well we wont have to go real far to find the front will we no what a pity luc said for all the world as if he meant it demanges sour chuckle said he understood a german officer came up to the detraining frenchmen and immediately started shouting ordersin his own language of course none of the soldiers in khaki moved luc knew that even if he did speak german he would sooner lose a nut than admit it apparently he wasnt the only one here who felt that way his government could make him board a train it could ship him east but it couldnt turn him into a good ally if the germans didnt happen to like that well what a pity for the first time since stepping down onto soviet soil he smiled a dormouse might find room to sleep inside a panzer ii an ordinary human being didnt stand a chance theo hossbach and his crewmates did the next best thing they dug out a space under the little panzer using its armored chassis and tracks to protect them from anything the ivans threw their way it was crowded under there but less crowded than inside the machine not so many sharp metal corners to catch you in the knee or the elbow or the side of the head either and theo and adi stoss and hermann witt got along pretty well they shared cigarettes and food and whenever they could liberate some vodka i didnt like those clouds late this afternoon stoss said as they were settling down looked like rain smelled like rain too still does witt put in wrinkling his nose in the fading gloomy light wet dustknow what i mean adi nodded so did theo one of the reasons you dug in under your panzer was to give the beast room to settle if the ground was soft it could settle enough to squash you flat unless you were careful and of course it would settle more if rain softened things but theyd dug enough of a cave so they wouldnt have to worry about that which didnt mean theo didnt worry theo always worried he had reason to worry here too when the fall rains started in this part of the world they didnt stop for six weeks or so all the roads that werent paved turned to bottomless lengths of ooze the next paved road theo saw more than a couple of kilometers outside a soviet city would be the first that was on the panzer commanders mind too you know our maps eat shit he remarked not quite apropos of nothing you bet adi stoss agreed what they call main highways are horrible dirt tracks and the secondary roadsthe ones on the maps i meanmostly arent there at all for real the railroads suck too witt said once soldiers started bitching they commonly had a hard time stopping why did the fucking ivans pick a wider gauge than everybody else in europe so we couldnt use our rolling stock on their lines when a war started adi answered it works too by the same token the russians couldnt use their cars and engines farther to the west their planners must have been afraid they were more likely to retreat than to advance when they banged heads with germany on the evidence of two wars those planners had known what to fear theo pulled his blanket over his head adi and hermann kept talking for a while but they lowered their voices theo fell asleep as if sledgehammered anybody who said war wasnt a wearing business had never been through one he woke early the next morning to a soft insistent drumming on the panzer overhead and on the ground all around no wonder it had looked like rain the afternoon before no no wonder at all his lips shaped a soundless word scheisse his comrades stirred a few minutes later they swore too not at all silently break out the soup spoons adi said the easy advances just quit being easy maybe things will pick up again after the hard freeze comes and we arent stuck in the mud all the goddamn time witt tried to look on the bright side of things yeah maybe adi didnt sound as if he believed it theo didnt believe it either just then a tiny rill trickled down the dirt theyd thrown up from under the panzer and into their little cave adi sighed theatrically forty days and forty nightsisnt that right it was right in the biblical sense it was also about how long the fall rains in russia would last the panzer crewmen glumly emerged into a world that had changed the rain pattered down out of a sky that reminded theo of nothing so much as the bellies of a lot of dirty sheep it cut visibility to a couple of hundred meters at best beyond that everything was lost in a curtain of murk and mist a hooded crow on the roof of a burntout barn sent the germans a nasty look as if to say the evil weather was their fault sorry bird theo thought its not us our generals will be tearing out their hairthe ones who still have hair anyhow the rest will throw down their monocles and cuss his opinion of the wehrmacht s senior commanders was not high his opinion of other armies leadership was even lower adi stooped and eyed the panzer iis tracks sure as hell it was getting muddy sure as hell the panzer was sinking into the mud the driver mournfully shook his head going anywhere in this crap will be fun wont it he said witt nodded to theo get on the horn with the regiment he said see what were supposed to do today if were lucky theyll tell us to hold in place right theo said the panzer commander didnt sound as if he expected them to be lucky since theo didnt either he just climbed into the panzer and warmed up the radio set when he asked headquarters what the days orders were the sergeant or lieutenant at the other end of the connection seemed surprised he needed to no changes since last night the fellow back at hq replied the advance continues why its raining theo said for all he knew it wasnt back there or if it was the deep thinkers at headquarters might not have noticed we go forward the man at headquarters said theo duly relayed his words of wisdom to witt and adi well we try remarked the panzer commander who had a firmer grip on reality than anybody back at hq he nodded to adi start her up right you are stoss said the maybach engine belched itself awake it should have had more horsepower but it was reliable enough the panzer should have had more armor it should have had a better gun it should have been a panzer iii in other words but there still werent enough iiis and ivs to go around so the smaller iis and even is soldiered on witt stood head and shoulders out of the cupola he draped his shelter half so it kept most of the rain off of him and out of the fighting compartment were kicking up a wake he reported sounding more amused than annoyed theo as usual couldnt see out he believed witt though the engine labored to push the panzer through the mud the tracks dug in hard even through the panzers steel sides theo could hear the squelching and the going only got worse theirs wasnt the only panzer trying to use the road the more traffic it took the more ruts filled with water and turned to soup i wonder if wed do better in the fields adi said try it if you want to witt told him damned if i wont the driver said and he did the panzer picked up speedfor a little while then it came to a stretch that german or russian artillery had already chewed up rainwater had soaked into the shell holes producing little gluey puddles adi carefully picked his way between them were using more gas than we have been too he grumbled again theo believed him the engine was working much harder than it had when the road was dry how anyone was supposed to fight in weather like this he consoled himself by remembering that the russians would have just as much trouble seeing enemies and moving as his own side did that turned out not to be quite true the panzer ii was fighting to get out of a mudhole when witt let out a horrified squawk and all but fell back into the turret he frantically traversed it to the left goddamn russian panzer he explained fuckers plowing through the mud like it isnt even there how fast were the ivans turning their turret this way theos gut knotted a mm shell slamming through the thin side armor might answer the question any second now witt started shooting one mm round after another as fast as the toy cannon would fire then he switched to the coaxial machine gun and theo breathed again bastards burning the panzer commander said i think the machine gun got one of the crew but the rest are still on the loose he laughed shakily never a dull moment is there how are we doing adi were fucking stuck thats how stoss answered we need a tow right witt said theo get on the radio let em know im doing it theo said he hoped whatever recovery vehicle the regiment sent out wouldnt bog down before it got here and he hopedhe really really hopedno more russian panzers would come along first rasputitsa russian had a word for the season of mud that came along every spring and fall the spring rasputitsa was worse because it didnt mark rain alone the accumulated winter snow melted making the mud deeper and gooier yet but the fall mud time was bad enough no planes flew during the winter fighters and even bombers landed with skis in place of wheels even that didnt work during the rasputitsa to get airborne and come down again a plane had to use a paved runway as far as sergei yaroslavsky knew the soviet union didnt have any the germans were grounded too poland had a few allweather airstrips but the front had moved too far east for them to matter sergei chuckled sourly advantages to everything even defeat for the next few weeks the flyers had nothing to do but sit around play cards and drink a red air force man sober through the rasputitsa probably had something wrong with his liver when the hard freezes came when planes could take off and land again that would be time enough to get your nose out of the vodka jug now now sergei ate and slept and drank and argued and listened to the radio and argued some more even drunk he was careful about what he said nkvd men got drunk too but they had an ugly habit of remembering what theyd heard then even after they sobered up the war ground on even while sergei and the rest of the red air force men perforce vegetated that was why he listened to the radio to find out what was going on while he couldnt do anything about it he pored over the copies of pravda and izvestia and red star that came to the airstrip even if they commonly got there a week after they were printed their cheap paper already starting to yellow no one wanted to come straight out and say so but the germans and poles were still pushing forwardnot so fast as before but they were the first sighting of french troops raised a fine fury on the radio and then after the usual delays in the papers too the party line raised echoes of the civil war after the october revolution when the capitalist powers allied with the reactionary whites to try to murder the soviet union at birth theyd failed then and they would fail now if you listened to stalins propagandists at any rate back then japan had joined with england france america and the whites against the ussr for a long time the radio had made this war with japan seem more of the same thing were attacked on all sides so we need to fight and work twice as hard was the message that had been the message anyhow but a twoparagraph item in izvestia that sergei almost ignored said foreign commissar litvinov was on a diplomatic mission to khabarovsk it didnt say what kind of diplomatic mission or with whom he was conducting his diplomacy but still khabarovsk you had to know where khabarovsk was for the story to make any sense as it happened sergei did when he was a little kid some school lesson had praised khabarovsk the jewel of eastern siberia the socalled jewel was probably one more soviet industrial town a quarter of the way around the world from where he sat now that wasnt the point the point was why would maxim litvinov be conducting diplomacy in khabarovsk if not to talk some more with the japanese he wouldnt meet british or french officials therethat was for sure but khabarovsk was pretty close to japanand even closer to japans recent siberian conquests nothing else made sense which proved what exactly not a damned thing as sergei also knew he was only a flyer making guesses from what the government deigned to tell the people what the men who ran things knew that they werent telling he could guess about that too but he was much too likely to be wrong only he wasnt wrong not this time one very wet very muddy very hungover morning the radio newsreader followed moscow speaking with i have the honor to present an important announcement from general secretary stalin concerning the course of the struggle against imperialism sergei went over to the samovar and got himself a glass of hot strong sweet tea then he poured a hefty slug of vodka into it put that all together and it might take the edge off his headache he wasnt the only flyer medicating himself that way eithernowhere close some skipped the tea then the newsreader said a definitive and lasting peace has been reached between the empire of japan and the workers and peasants of the ussr the two nations recognizing their common interests have decided to make permanent the ceasefire to which they agreed when foreign commissar litvinov traveled to japan this summer they will end their conflict on the basis of current positions the new borders will be demilitarized on both sides to a distance of twentyfive kilometers each nation also pledges neutrality in the others current and future conflicts the foreign commissar has expressed great satisfaction as a result of the formal termination of hostilities good thats good lieutenant colonel ponamarenko said in fact very good ochen khorosho he repeated the last two words with somber satisfaction as he stubbed out one papiros and lit another he seemed to be one of those people who thought nicotine eased a pain in the haira term sergeid heard from a fellow flyer whod served in spain it fit all right hed smoked a couple of cigarettes himself but just because he smoked not because he thought they made much difference to his morningafters several flyers nodded even under socialism you couldnt go far wrong agreeing with your squadron commanderand more to the point being seen to agree with him sergei only wished he could but the newsreader had left too much out he hadnt said where the new borders were for instance that argued that japan had seized more of southeastern siberia than anyone cared to admit in public the announcer hadnt said anything about returning prisoners of war either maybe none of that mattered with the soviet union officially able to concentrate on the west stalin probably planned to hang on here and renew the fight in the far east when he saw the chance he couldnt let japan hold on to vladivostok could he and what would japan do now she could put more soldiers into china she plainly thought of the vast disorderly country the way england thought of india a place to exploit with plenty of natives to do the hard work for her come to think of it hitler thought of russia that way what else was he doing here but grabbing land and slaves if he won this war he would get his way the thing to do then was make sure he didnt sergei took another swig of vodkalaced tea his headache was backing offsome anyhow he couldnt fight the nazis now not with the best will in the world the rasputitsa made sure of that it left him feeling more than commonly useless it was hard to remember but across the sea lay a country where none of this mattered the united states was the greatest capitalist nation in the world and it was at peace with everybody that struck sergei as most unfairall the more so when he was hung over the americans just sat there watching the rest of the world tear itself to pieces as far as the pilot could tell they didnt care why should they no matter who won they got rich selling grain and guns something should happen to them it would serve them right he thought then he laughed at himself what could happen to the united states the americans had beaten their natives far more completely than the english had won in india or the japanese in china the atlantic and pacific shielded them from the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune they even seemed immune to the inexorable working of the historical dialectic he brought himself up sharply the americans might seem immune but they werent nobody was the revolution would come to the united states too the big capitalists and exploiters would go to the wall as they had in the ussr it would happen in england and france tooand in germany no matter what the hitlerites thought or how little they liked it but when the dialectic didnt speak to that for the ussrs sake sergei hoped it would be soon ome of the russian prisoners at the camp south of harbin were quick to learn bits of japanese they spoke without much grammar but they made themselves understood one skinny hairy fellow bowed to get hideki fujitas attentionthey learned japanese customs tooand said peace now russia japanyes sergeant san hai fujita agreed he couldnt very well deny it not when the peace had at last been officially announced we go home the maruta asked to that the japanese sergeant only shrugged i have no orders one way or the other he answered it was harder to think of the prisoners as logs when they became talking logs not impossible but harder so sorrydont understand this russian said no orders fujita repeated they might be talking logs now but no they didnt talk well you had to keep things as simple as you could as if you were talking to a retarded threeyearold the maruta got it this time arigato he said when orders soon fujita shrugged again i dont know he said again and walked away he didnt expect the orders the russian wanted to come quickly but he could see that admitting as much would only cause trouble the soviet government seemed to care about the men japan had captured almost as little as the imperial government would have worried about japanese prisoners these russians had lost vladivostok and so they were in disgrace it made perfect sense to fujita it made much more sense than most of the things the russians did it was in fact a very japanese attitude and if the russians didnt care what happened to their prisoners how could anyone expect japan to care simple nobody could and nobody did the prisoners became maruta became logs and whatever happened to them was their hard luck muttering fujita rubbed his arm and his backside hed had more shots since coming to pingfan than ever in his life before so it seemed now anyhow he was inoculated against everything from smallpox theyd poked him again even though hed been vaccinated not too long before to housemaids knee again so it seemed to him but there were no inoculations against some of the diseases they used here if you came down with the plague odds were you would die hed never seen people so nervous about fleas as they were at this place if you found one on yourself you had to catch it and kill it and give it to one of the people from the inner compound so he could examine its guts under the microscope or whatever the devil they did in there another maruta said food more food that fujita could and did ignore the prisoners got as much food as the officers in charge of such things said they should he had nothing to do with it either way if the officers wanted them plump and healthy plump and healthy they would be it happened sometimes the scientists needed to see what germs did to people who had nothing wrong with them but a particular disease more often though the pows went hungry as pows deserved to do why treat us like this yet another russian asked us people too what we do to you how many red army soldiers had tried to kill fujita more than he could counthe was sure of that but it wasnt the point japan would have treateddid treatchinese prisoners the same way and she would have treated other japanese who surrendered to their enemies the same way too thousands of years of history proved that too soldiers who gave up werent people any more not in the eyes of their captors they werent could he explain that to a blond gaijin with shaggy cheeks he not only couldnt he didnt feel like wasting his time trying he grudged the russian two words you lost he felt the mans pale eyes boring into him as he walked away but so what those eyes only further separated the prisoner from him they should have belonged to a cat not to a human being a few days later some of the whitecoated men from the inner sanctum came forth they needed fifty russians to test something or other theyd developed and of course they needed guards to make sure none of the russians got unruly or got away a lieutenant a sergeant ten ordinary soldiers fujita was the sergeant what do we do sir he asked the lieutenanta chunky man named ozawawhod been at pingfan when he got there whatever the scientists tell us to do we do that ozawa answered theyre the ones who run this place were here to make sure that whatever they need to have happen happens got it hai fujita said quickly hed already figured out that much for himself he was hoping the officer would tell him more but if not not as long as a sergeant followed orders he couldnt go too far wrong they let fujita choose the soldiers who would come along to keep an eye on the russians one of the first men he grabbed was superior private shinjiro hayashi yes sergeant san ill do it hayashi said as he had to if he was pleased about the assignment his face didnt show it neither did his voice fujita could have just whacked him in the side of the head and told him to do his job but theyd served together for a long time to his own surprise the sergeant found himself explaining why hed chosen the junior man i need you youve got good sense that was part of it but not all he needed hayashis education too because he came off a farm himself but there were things you could say and things you couldnt he said as much as he could if hayashi was so goddamn smart he could figure out the rest for himself he nodded now accepting if still less than thrilled all right sergeant san well see what happens trucks growled up to haul the russians the guards and the bacteriologists away from pingfan a rail spur motor transport laid on whenever they needed it the people who ran things here had it good they had it better than most of the ordinary units in the kwantung army that was for sure fujita thought about all the shoe leather hed gone through because nobody could be bothered with sending out a truck to pick him up well he was riding now north through harbin and then into the forests beyond the city one of the things that had always struck him about manchukuo was all the space here to someone who came from crowded japan it was especially noticeable these were woods where no one had ever logged they might have stood here untouched since the beginning of time or so he thought till the trucks stopped in a clearing gouged out of the woods a couple of hundred kilometers north and east of harbin not far from what had been the siberian border in other words wind whistled cold through the trees fujita had unhappy memories of fighting in country like this so no doubt did hayashi and several other common soldiers for all he knew so did the red army men winter was on the way all right the bacteriologists had memories of their own theyd used this place before poles had been driven into the ground in rough circles around a central open space one of the whitecoated men spoke to lieutenant ozawa who nodded and relayed orders to the other ranks we tie a russian to each pole facing toward the middle there yes sir fujita said he didnt have to do the tying himself he just supervised the advantage of being a sergeant one of the maruta tried to run away a soldier shot him in the back then walked over and bayoneted him the men in white coats scribbled in their notebooks they would be working with fortynine not fifty they set up something that looked like a bomb casing made of pottery in the central open area then they put on gauze masks and handed one to each of the soldiers at their orders all the japanese retreated to the edge of the woods the scientists got behind trees so did the soldiers a beat or two later the bomb or whatever it was went off it sounded louder than a hand grenade softer than a bursting shell now we take the prisoners back and await developments one of the bacteriologists said no one asked him what the developments would be he did condescend to add you would be wise to leave your masks on yesvery wise some of the russian prisoners were wounded by flying potterymostly the ones close to the burst the others didnt seem to have been harmed the soldiers herded them all into the trucks again they rolled south back toward pingfan they got there in the middle of the night the prisoners went into the walledoff compound instead of back to the pens they wont come out of therenot alive they wont senior private hayashi said in a low voice sergeant fujita noddedthe other man was bound to be right well wholl miss em fujita said and hayashis head went up and down in turn as long as the war dragged on sarah goldman was positive things wouldnt get any better for germanys jews rather more to the point she was positive things wouldnt get any better for her or her family and she was positive she would start screaming about that any minute now of course shed been positive of the same thing ever since the war started two years ago was that really possible it was however much she wished it werent not only possible but true she nodded to remind herself that the war had been going on for so long neither the radio nor the newspapers mentioned the anniversary when she did remark on that her father said the powers that be dont want you to remember because then theyll also remember the fighting hasnt all gone the way some people promised it would samuel goldman chose his words with care sarah feared he wasnt careful enough not if the gestapo really was monitoring what they said in the house thered never been any proof of that not in all the time since saul killed his laborgang boss but the worry never went away hanna goldmans view of things was less political and more pragmatic ever since we really started banging heads with the russians rations have gone to the devil they were bad before but theyre a lot worse now when they start taking coupons for potatoes and turnips did they do that even in the last war father asked i was at the front and there was usually enough there it wasnt very good but we got fed and we took everything we could from the countryside im sure some of the bunnies we stewed meowed but we werent fussy hed brought home a rabbit from somebody in his work gang the year before hed hoped it was a rabbit then anyhow no matter what it was hed eaten it without a qualm so had sarah and her mother sarahs mouth filled with spit as she remembered the rich meaty taste she hadnt got to enjoy it much since what happened to that fellow who sold you one here she asked could you get more from him gregor regretfully father shook his head he disappeared not too long after i bought the last one well maybe he disappeared and maybe he was disappeared if you know what i mean i couldnt tell you whether hes on the lam or in a camp i hope sarah paused and thought before she spoke i hope hes in a camp getting what he deserves if some bored gestapo technician did chance to be listening in on her right now he was probably fighting nausea she couldnt imagine anyone saying one thing while more obviously meaning the other fathers eyes twinkled aber naturlich he said so do i so does any rightthinking person thats the truth mother chimed in they beamed at one another in companionable hypocrisy to sarahs amazement a few days later father brought home not a rabbit but half a dozen dressed pigeons wrapped in bloody newspaper he had to hold one arm pressed against his jacket to keep them from falling out together with the limp from his war wound that made him seem more crippled than he was where did you get them mother exclaimed when he set the prize package on the kitchen counter youd better not tell the pigeonracers association but it turns out theres a sly fellow who traps them father answered he lives out on the edge of town so nobodys going to catch him at it if i lived out there i would too it cant be very hard pigeons arent the smartest birds god ever made a few bread crumbs and you can probably get as many as you want as she had with the rabbit mother asked what did you pay for them as he had with the rabbit father looked pained and didnt give her a straight answer its not as though were spending money on nightclubs or strength through joy cruises he said yes yes mother said but we are spending money on food and fuel and rent and we arent made of gold so what did you pay we wont go to the poorhouse tomorrow on account of them samuel goldman told her how about the day after tomorrow sarah suggested her father sent her a reproachful look doesnt the bible say something about sharper than a serpents tooth im not an ungrateful child sarah said ill never be ungrateful when you bring meat home she just hoped her rumbling stomach didnt embarrass her in front of her parents if it didnt that would only be because theirs were rumbling too all right not ungrateful father said difficult though lets see you talk your way out of difficult why should she mother said only right that someone in the family should take after you i dont know what youre talking about father replied with dignity but he did sarah was sure of that so did she her mother was much more easygoing than her father saul was a purely physical being strength and speed served him the way rational thought did for father sarah was rational or hoped she was she was also prickly and impatient with other peoples foolishness that too marked her as her fathers daughter so did her hunger eagerly she asked her mother how are you going to cook them does it matter hanna goldman said as long as theyre hot and not too burnt no father said sarah noddedthat summed things up for her too her mother stuffed the squab with bread crumbs and roasted them they were wonderful i dont dare tell isidor how good that was sarah said after crunching through the smaller bones and sucking all the meat off the larger ones bread may be the staff of life but meat is the gold crown on the end of the staff her father raised an eyebrow that doesnt come from the bible or the greek philosophers but it sounds as though it should just out of my own mouth sorry sarah said dont be father told her old wisdom getswell old we need new wisdom too here and now we really need it we have new wisdom it comes from the fuhrer mother said brightly the fuhrer is always right thats what everybody says well yes of course i knew that myself as a matter of fact father was also playing to the listener who might not be there as soon as the words were out of his mouth he made as if to gag the ss might have planted microphones in the house putting secret movie cameras in there was beyond the nazis skill they might want to but they couldnt sarah smiled at her parents somehow the silly games they had to play made her happy jews in munster had no business being happy the fuhrer would surely have agreed with that but no matter what he wanted to decree no matter what his minions tried to enforce happy she was father winked at her its the meat he said it does strange thingsespecially after so long without if she was the one most like him no wonder he could guess what she was thinking maybe it is whatever it is i like it she answered the fuhrer wouldnt approve of that either well too bad for the fuhrer that was all there was to it one of the ratings on the us conning tower jerked as if a horsefly had bitten the back of his neck he pointed to port mine he said to hell with me if thats not a goddamn mine julius lemps binocularenhanced gaze followed the german sailors outthrust index finger sure as the devil the metal horns of a contact mine and part of the sheetiron sphere itself stuck up out of the cold gray water of the baltic good job sievert he said the mine drifted a few hundred meters away no great danger to the uboat now still nobody in his right mind wanted to leave one of those hateful things bobbing in the sea waiting for a target shall we get rid of it skipper another sailor asked eagerly what was it about things that went boom that got grown men as excited as a pack of kids at a fireworks show whatever it was lemp had it too you bet well get rid of it he answered and bawled an order down into the pressure hull man the deck gun the sailors from the gun crew swarmed up the ladder they hurried to the mm cannon on the deck in front of the tower one of them carefully removed the tompion from the muzzle and let it dangle on its chain lemp nodded to himselfhe hadnt even had time to give the order nothing would ruin your day like opening fire without uncorking your gun he did give the order that swung the cannon toward the floating mine the gun crew banged away with great enthusiasm and no great skill the was really an anachronism left over from the days of more gentlemanly warfare it couldnt fight any kind of surface warship the idea behind it was that a surfaced uboat could stop a freighter pause while the crew took to the lifeboats and then sink the vessel with gunfire saving valuable torpedoes but that didnt work in an age of escorted convoys and radio sets if an enemy destroyer wasnt bearing down on you at top speed the freighter was calling in bombers to blow you out of the water antiaircraft guns gave you a chance against those and the u did carry one aft of the conning tower and it had the too as much from the designers force of habit as for any other reason blam blam blam flame burst from the guns muzzle as each round went off brass cartridge cases clanged on the deck columns of seawater leaped into the air as shells burst all around the mine but the damned thing went right on bobbing in the sea lemp waited for a hit with rapidly mounting impatience at last when he was about to shout something sharp to the gunners he got one it yielded a much bigger blamone that rocked him and the submarine even though the mine wasnt close the gout of water that rose on high was much bigger and much less tidy than the ones the shells had produced at the the ratings shouted and pumped fists in the air and capered like lunatics we killed it one of them yelled a couple of others dug fingers into their ears theyd be ringing all right lemps rang even though he stood up on the conning tower that was part of the chance you took when you played with things that went boom very good heroes he called to the gunners you can go below now they pretended not to hear him or maybe since theyd been playing with explosives they werent pretending lemp figured they were coming topside was a rare treat for a lot of the men cooped up inside his steel cigar they could breathe fresh air they could focus their eyes on something farther away than their outstretched hands why would they want to go down into the dim red light the humid air and the symphony of stinks that characterized any working uboat wasnt it like descending into hell wasnt it much too much like that lemp had to give the order again before the gun crew obeyed it they resealed the and climbed from the deck to the conning tower once more climbed far more slowly than theyd rushed down to start shooting the fun was over now and their dragging steps said as much they were even glummer about climbing down the hatch and into the u one of them wrinkled his nose i wish they could make a uboat that didnt smell like a polecat three days dead he remarked well martin if you dont fancy it you should have stayed in the surface navy lemp said sweetly that did the trick martinbearded grimy in a uniform that hadnt been washed any time latelyvehemently shook his head as if the skipper had suggested that he engage in some unnatural vice not me by god he declared the surface pukes they fuss about every little thing like theyre on the rag or something and he vanished into the uboats fetid bowels his buddies followed without another word of complaint julius lemp smiled it wasnt that he thought the sailor was wrong on the contrary he was a uboat man himself after all not a surface puke he remembered how horribly out of place hed felt when captain patzig summoned him to the bridge of the admiral scheer aboard the u he was lord of all he surveyed on the pocket battleship he felt like a poor relation and a damn scruffy poor relation at that even if hed put on his best clothes for the visit skipper said the man whod spotted the mine eh lemp came back to the hereandnow what is it sievert was that a russian mine or one of ours i dont know lemp replied after a moments thought considering where we are it could be either i sure couldnt tell through field glasses and ive heard the ivans just copied our model when they started making their own mines so there might not have been much to tell from you couldnt read the made in moscow plate bolted to the shell eh sievert asked with a grin erno lemp managed a chuckle of his own even if it took some effort it wasnt that he didnt have a sense of humor but the poor thing did suffer from lack of exercise well it wont take us out and it wont take any of our surface ships out and well do for any russian ships we come across the rating said thats right lemp nodded no jokes lurking in the underbrush there he felt relieved the watchers on the conning tower had gone on scanning sea and sky even while the gun crew played with its big loud toy lemp would have been furious had they let the fireworks distract them in the baltics close confines trouble was never far away it could land on you all too fast even when you were lucky enough to spot it before it showed up if you didnt if you didnt some flyingboat crew would go home to paint a uboat silhouette on the side of their fuselage and then fly off to look for more unwary germans i should have paid more attention too lemp thought he made a quick scan himself first with the naked eye and then sweeping his binoculars through a quadrant of the sky nothing his breath smoked as he sighed with gratitude aimed at a god who didnt listen enough he remembered the horror that had coursed through him when hed spotted a small silver speck in the sky not too long before hed been about to shout for a crash dive before he realized the planet venus probably wouldnt strafe the u he made a more careful scan of the sea looking for periscopes no matter how much the kriegsmarine and luftwaffe harried them red fleet uboats did get out into the baltic ending up on the wrong end of one of their eels would be embarrassing to say the least again nothing his boat might have had the sea all to itself he was master of everything he surveyed gray water and gray sky a gull winging its way south didnt acknowledge his supremacy gulls never did they were an illbred lot scroungers and scavengers and neerdowells they were quite a bit like submariners in other words his nose flinched when he had to lay below after his watch ended he logged the incident with the mine his script was tiny cramped and precise things could have been better he might have sunk a russian battleship but they could also have been worse nothing at all might have happened on his watch or no one might have spotted an approaching enemy uboat he wouldnt have had to log anything then he would have been a trifle too dead the one small detail aside he couldnt see anything to like about that fdr was coming to philadelphia the election was only a few days away four more years peggy druce hoped so at least she supposed she hoped so everything in the world seemed to have turned inside out and upside down since england and france did their spectacular backflip with germany before the big switch roosevelt had sent england and france as many planes and guns as american factories could crank out along with a whole fleet of destroyers he said the united states didnt need any more wendell willkie the latest republican to try to boot fdr out of the white house hadnt yelled at him for that hed yelled at the president for not doing more and not doing it faster a bunch of republicans were isolationists but not willkie trouble was all of a sudden isolationism looked a lot better than it had even a few weeks earlier if england and france were on hitlers side against russia they werent using the american guns and planes and ships against the fuhrer the way fdr had had in mind nobody in washington was or at least admitted to being in love with stalin but nobody much wanted to see all those weapons turned against him either willkies trouble was he agreed too much with roosevelt he was tweedledum complaining about tweedledee after the big switch some republicans tried to boot him off the ticket and run somebody more in line with how they figured the party ought to think their only problem was they settled on alf landon again a man only a diehard isolationist republican could love and even then remembering how fdr had trounced him in it wasnt easy landons campaign mostly amounted to i told you so he himself had no hope of winning the more votes he stole from willkie the easier the time fdr would have you ready herb called to peggy the rally starts at half past seven just about peggy patted each cheek with a powder puff one more time looking in the mirror made her sigh it would have to do but it was a long way from perfect well too goddamn bad she thought she was a long way from perfect perfect would have been twentyfivetwentynine tops they drove down into the city blazing street lamps and headlights and neon signs reminded peggy she wasnt in europe any more she supposed theyd lifted the blackout in london and paris people there were probably happy as could be you could buy happiness all rightas long as you didnt care what you paid for it a valeta kid maybe still in high school maybe just outtook charge of herbs packard in the parking lot as herb tipped him peggy reflected that he would be wearing a different kind of uniform on the other side of the atlantic the usa didnt know how lucky it was at the arena on market street herb confidently said drucethats druce to an importantlooking fellow with a clipboard the man ran his finger down a typed list the moving finger suddenly stopped oh yes sir he said and then to a younger fellow standing behind him eddie take mr and mrs druce down front make sure theyve got good seats sure thing mr terwilliger eddie said come with me folks they couldnt have got better seats unless he put them up on the podium peggy recognized most of the big shots who were sitting up there pennsylvania politicos and union leaders herb was neither for which she thanked heaven he seemed happy enough with where eddie put them peggy also recognized quite a few of the couples sitting near them the men of the family were doctors lawyers accountants clothes and double chins said theyd done well for themselves several couples were obviously jewish remembering what shed seen in czechoslovakia and germany peggy felt better about being here because of that senator guffey introduced the president he spent a few minutes laying into the republicans before he did if you listened to him the republicans had their nerve for running anybody at all against fdr and even more nerve for trying to run two people the donkey is always the donkey he said but over there its like all over again theyve got the elephant and the bullsomething peggy joined the laugh she was old enough to remember taft had run as a regular republican and teddy roosevelt fdrs distant cousin on the progressive or bull moose ticket nobody in his right mind would call starchy upright alf landon a bull moose guffey had to be thinking of something more like bullshit he didnt say that of course you couldnt say anything along those lines in a public forum but letting the audience fill in the dirty word for itself was even more delicious the house lights darkened a tight spot played on senator guffey it gleamed from the frames of his reading glasses now ladies and gentlemen i have the great honor and high privilege to present the president of the united states franklin delano roosevelt he said and stepped away from the lectern next thing you knew fdr was standing behind it instead they must have wheeled him on while the only light in the house was the spot on guffey roosevelt was sensitive about being seenand especially about being photographedin his wheelchair and who could blame him with heavy braces on his legs he could stand and even take a few stiff steps but he also didnt like showing them off in back of the lectern he didnt have to where you could really see him only from the shoulders up roosevelt looked strong and vigorous he waved to the cheering throng in the arena the cheers got louder then he waved again in a different way and they eased off thank you folks he said his voice booming out of the loudspeakers hooked to the microphone thank you very much im glad to be in philadelphia this is where our freedom got its start this is where the declaration of independence was written and where the liberty bell rang out before it cracked more cheers smiling the president waited them out and i want to tell you liberty almost everywhere seems a little cracked or more than a little today no one applauded that people leaned forward to listen to whatever fdr would say next peggy found herself doing it and saw herb was too the president didnt keep them waiting up till very recently the war in europe was a war against libertyliberty there and liberty everywhere we werent fighting but we were involved because what happened there was liable to happen to us next and we acted accordingly doing what we could for the countries that thought more like we did sadly he shook his big strongjawed head but europeans are still europeans president wilson in whose cabinet i had the privilege of serving as assistant secretary of the navy found that out the hard way after the last war and now we discover it all over again when the socalled democracies make common cause with the nazis against the communists no one cares for liberty any longer it returns to the same sad old story of the strong trying to steal from the weak for no better reason than that they think they can and i say and america must say a plague on all their houses the arena went nuts that has how peggy put it when she talked about the speech later on at the moment she and her husband yelled and stomped and clapped as loud as anybody else she was as disgusted by england and frances jump from war against germany to war against russia as shed ever been by anything in her life except perhaps her selfdisgust at waking up in bed with constantine jenkins but wasnt waking up in bed with adolf hitler a thousand times worse and so roosevelt went on we are sending no more weapons to england or to france and i have ordered the appropriate authorities to ensure that we sell no more oil or scrap metal to japan until she ends her aggression against china governments must no longer see their neighbors as their prey he got another ringing round of applause peggy noticed that he didnt say anything about japans justended war with russia chances were he didnt want to remind people even some of his supporters had been hoping the communists would lose as they did roosevelt also didnt say what japanwhose home islands didnt yield much past rice and tough little menwas liable to do when her access to raw materials she needed suddenly got cut off well all find out peggy thought as she left the hall ondon bubbled like a pot of oatmeal left too long on the fire no one could prove the government had arranged for that bentley to run over winston churchill but if neville chamberlain did arrange it he got precious little time to enjoy what hed done he went into the hospital for what were described as routine tests and came out after surgery for cancer of the bowel it soon became obvious he could not go on as prime minister he laid down the office and left number downing street for a stay in the country to recover his strength as the papers said alistair walsh could read between the lines chamberlain was dying and would never amount to anything again his backers still held a tight grip on parliament though despite much impassioned oratory from the men churchill had inspired sir horace wilson succeeded chamberlain as the head of government wilson was if anything even more bonelessly pronazi than his mentor had been were bloody well out of it walsh said one cloudy afternoon over a pint of best bitter at the lion and gryphon a pub not too far from parliament that these days found itself full of men in illfitting civilian clothes they seemed uncomfortable wearing it was in other words a place where veterans the armed services found politically unreliable congregated misery loved and drank with company some of the disgruntled exsoldiers and sailors and flyers nodded but another man who seemed as out of place as walsh in tweeds and linen said we shouldnt let them sideline us by god if the pm and the foreign office have gone off the rails whos going to set em right but us he spoke like an officer with a posh oxbridge accent of the kind much imitated by bbc newsreaders he had an aristocrats long bony features too and an air that said he expected to be taken seriously but ranks didnt matter any more they were all demobbed together anyone could take a potshot at anyone else no matter which accent he had someone at the back of the room said sounds like treason to me the aristohe was too young to have fought the last time aroundonly shrugged winston would have quoted that bit about treasons only being treason if it failsif it prospers none dares call it treason his easy use of the christian name made walsh ask you knew churchill i had that honor yes the younger man replied and you he was trying to place walsh as walsh was trying to place him i talked with him once walsh said he came to see me after they put me on ice here for my sins i was the bloke who met up with hess in the middle of that scottish field the famous sergeant walsh the other fellow said winston spoke well of you if that matters said you rather wished youd plugged the bugger instead of bringing him in walsh didnt remember telling churchill anything like that maybe he had or maybe churchill worked it out from what they had said mightve worked out better if i had walsh said couldnt very well have worked out worse on the same side as the bloody hun he drained his pint to show what he thought of that idea let me buy you a refill if i may said the man whod known churchill he nodded to the fellow behind the bar publican if youd be so kind coming up the barman worked the tap he slid a fresh pint across the smooth surface to walsh obliged walsh said ill do the same for you when you finish there and begging your pardon but youre a step ahead of me oh quite my apologies the younger man laughed the names ronald cartland he held out his hand walsh shook it the name rang a bell youre an mp he blurted ruefully cartland nodded afraid so these days im not what youd call proud of it but they couldnt drum me out of parliament and im not about to resign there the way i did when they tried shipping me off to byelorussia to fight alongside the same bastards id been shelling after they invaded france same with me sir walsh didnt know cartland had been an officer but an mp serving in the ranks struck him as wildly improbable and he liked the certainty of status rank gave after so long away from it the arbitrary whimsical nature of civilian life confused him id just got back from norway when the hun came parachuting down cartland upended his glass of whiskey when walsh signaled to the barman the mp shook his head another time for now why dont you come with me come with you where sir some chaps id like you to meet theyd like to meet you too believe me walsh frowned i fancy the crowd im in with now well i understand that i wouldnt be here if i didnt feel the same way but cartlands voice trailed off as if there were things he wanted to say but didnt want overheard please old boy wondering what he was getting into walsh stood up and lit a navy cut lead on sir i expect ill follow once they were out of the lion and gryphon ronald cartland let out a sigh of relief bound to be people spying in theremaybe the tapman maybe a customer maybe the tapman and a customer to make sure they dont miss anything whos they walsh asked people who report to horace wilson cartland answered like neville before him he keeps tabs on anyone who disagrees with him and has a chance of doing anything about it and hes smarter than neville ever was damn him whys he sucking up to the nazis then walsh demanded because hes afraid of them its the only thing i can think of cartland walked on a few paces then added almost the only thing i should say hes jealous of them too dictators are very popular these days as edward said before he got to be king did he really walsh said crawford nodded walsh blew out a big cloud of smoke a good job he didnt stay king long then yes a lot of people thought so cartland said and not another word leaving walsh to wonder whether edwards passion for his american divorcee was the only thing that caused him to lay down the crown cartlands casehardened reserve would have effortlessly turned a question about that seeing as much walsh just asked where are we going sir you can tell me now eh why to parliament of course cartland answered in surprise i should have thought youd work that out for yourself sorry to be so slow dont worry about it it will all come right in the end unless of course it doesnt on that cheerful note cartland led him past the guards outsidewho nodded respectfullyand into the parliament building everything was smaller and shabbier and lit worse than walsh had expected this was the fount of democracy in the modern world wasnt it shouldnt it be bright and clean and shiny evidently not it reminded walsh of nothing so much as a downattheheels club for veteran sergeants the thought made him feel more at home than hed dreamt he could cartland rounded up several other mps eden macmillan cranborne who seemed to go by bobbety names washed over walsh he wasnt sure he had them all straight or connected to the right faces it seemed to matter little the others were all at least as incensed with the government and its policies as cartland we have to take back the countrys soul one of them said walsh thought it was macmillan but he wasnt sure the mp went on whatever our sins we havent done anything to deserve this he waved his left hand he didnt use his right arm much had he caught a packet in the last war he was the right age how do you propose to do that sir walsh asked short of using soldiers i mean theres plenty who like whats going onespecially the blokes who dont have to fight the fritzes any more macmillan and his comrades all looked unhappy ay theres the rub one of them murmured they think they can ride the tiger without coming back inside him you could get drinks in the commons as you could in a club the mps did cartland put walsh on his chit hed come up in the world a bit all right these men were as disgusted and furious as any of the veterans in the lion and gryphon whether they had any better idea about how to change things remained to be seen november was chilly and gloomy in philadelphia it drizzled on and off it wasnt cold enough to turn the water in the streets to ice but it didnt miss by much peggy druce would have been more disappointed if shed been more surprised indian summer might linger this late but more often than not it didnt her polling place was at a school only a couple of blocks from where she and herb lived every fence and telephone pole was plastered with roosevelt or willkie posters some had both some had alf landon posters too some had one guys stuck on top of the others some had a bunch of different layers going back in time like the rock strata that confounded geologists whoever got there with his stack of flyers and pastepot won till the other sides guys came by she marked her ballot for fdr and stuck it in the box mrs druce has voted intoned the snowybearded poll attendant he didnt look old enough to have fought in the civil war but he might well have been alive through it she wondered if hed ever seen lincoln one of her grandfathers had she also wondered what honest abe would have made of the present sorry state of the world if lincoln could have found anything good to say about it she would have been very much surprised after completing the little secular ceremony she went out onto the street the rain had started up again while she was voting so she raised her umbrella against it as she started home several men who looked like bums collecting a days pay for booze called out roosevelts name several others made noise for willkie pennsylvania had laws against electioneering within a hundred feet of a polling place but it wasnt as if anyone took them seriously peggy peeled off her galoshes when she got back she was glad shed worn them even if they were ugly she boiled water on the stove poured it into a cup and stuck in a bag of liptons tea they laughed at such things in england but for fast and easy you couldnt beat a teabag her mouth twisted shed loved england and everything it stood for when raf bombers unloaded on berlin they might have killed her but she loved them anyhow now now loving england wasnt so easy she wasnt fighting nazi tyranny any more she was marching with it side by side how could you say horace wilsonor chamberlain before himwas any better than hitler oh the english didnt censor their newspapers too much they didnt persecute their jews yet well mussolini didnt persecute his jews either but how many people held him up as a paragon shit peggy said why not nobody was there to hear her so the tree fell soundlessly in the middle of the forest she poured some cognac into the hot tea maybe it would help sweeten her mood she drank the improved tea it did warm her body the best way from the inside out her spirit remained unthawed the radio might help she turned it on and waited for it to warm up the station it was tuned to gave forth with a quiz show so nauseating she almost broke off the dial in her zeal to find a different one glenn millers orchestra blaring away pleased her more for a little while the nazis couldnt stand jazz but her smile quickly slipped now that england was marching with hitler would it outlaw this degenerate music too and how about france how about django reinhardt he wasnt just a jazz guitarist he had the nerve to be a gypsy jazz guitarist the nazis gave gypsies as hard a time as jews though jews outside of germany made more noise about what happened to their kind would the french abuse django to sweeten up their partners in greed a hell of a thing when you couldnt enjoy music without worrying about politics but you couldnt once upon a time shed liked wagnernot always in large doses but she had she couldnt listen to him any more without remembering how he made hitler and the rest of the nazi bonzen stand up and whinny the thought of that congealed her own pleasure and she couldnt hear shostakovichor aaron copland for that matterwithout thinking oh yeah hes a red maybe the music would outlast the politics beethovens had nobody cared any more about what had inspired him all that mattered was what hed conceived in his mind and set down on paper commercials followed ivory soap white king detergent old golds and de sotos thirty seconds a pop with singing and music as professional as theyd be on a piece of music from tin pan alley no great surprise there tin pan alley songsmiths sometimes turned working girl and sold their talent to the highest bidder so did musicians and singers who hadnt quite got to the topand sometimes the ones who had neither the nazis nor the reds would have approved peggy wasnt so sure she did either but for reasons of taste rather than ideology what she wanted was news it was a quarter to the hour the next record was a lot duller than the glenn miller piece it was duller than a couple of the ads in fact they couldnt all be gems that was why some broadway shows went dark after a week the news turned out to be mostly guesses about electoral turnout and reports of tornadoes ripping through the midwest anything across the sea peggy would have done much better to turn on the shortwave set for the bbc or radio berlin orless polishedradio moscow more commercials followed peggy didnt know whether to laugh or to cry this was what shed pined for all the time she was stuck in scandinavia as a matter of fact it was or at least some of what shed pined for the rest the biggest part hadnt come back from the office yet peggy cast a longing look at the brandy bottle but she didnt pick it up she and herb still hadnt had that hearttoheart about whod done what while they were apart for so long she wondered if they ever would a lot of married years had taught her that the best conversations were sometimes the ones you didnt have but there was a difference between didnt and couldnt couldnt constipated things she thought so anyhow maybe herb did too or maybe he didnt have anything like that to talk about she just didnt know and she didnt have the nerve to find out she was pretty sure he would forgive her but she didnt want to get any forgiveness unless she could dole out some of her own at the same time lifes a bastard sometimes you know she told the refrigerator it didnt give her any back talk for which she was duly grateful she had a beef stew going and close to ready when herb walked through the front door he fixed himself a stiff bourbon on the rocks well i voted he said in tones as thrilled as the ones he would have used to announce hed had a cavity filled yeah me too peggy said build me one of those would you sure he suited action to word as he gave her the drink he said not like the last couple of times is it hard to get excited about what happens landon might win then wed all leave town peggy said boy you can sing that in church herb exclaimed after supper they sat around with more drinks and plenty of smooth american cigarettes and listened to the returns come in taken as a whole the republicans put up a better fight against fdr than they had in or they picked up seats in the house and in the senate but with alf landon siphoning votes away from willkie roosevelt won the slot at the top of the ticket going away state after state reported an fdr plurality if not always an fdr majority a third term herb said how about that how about that peggy echoed after a moment she added it feels like it should mean more somehow you know if england and france hadnt flipflopped wed probably be in the war by now herb said peggy nodded they could talk about politics that was easy the other things the harder things still remained unsaid hansulrich rudel didnt think hed ever been so happy to see snow fall not even when he was a little boy and it promised him a white christmas the snow swirling around the airstrip promised him something even better a chance to start pounding the ivans again about time he said sticking out his tongue so snowflakes would land on it i was starting to wonder if the mud would ever freeze hard sergeant albert dieselhorst chuckled wryly everything happens if you wait long enough the trick is not going nuts while youre waitingand not driving everybody around you nuts too did i do that hansulrich sounded less innocent than he might have wished he did you said it sir i didnt dieselhorst answered which could only mean yes it was also pretty much the same thing jesus told pilate when asked if he was king of the jews you shouldnt be thinking about jews hansulrichs welltrained national socialist side insisted but he didnt always listen to that side at the moment his schwanz didnt want to listen to that side at all sofias only a mischling shes not a fullblooded jew he told himself uneasily as if reading his minda trick good sergeants often gave the impression of owningdieselhorst asked and hows your lady friend in bialystok fine as far as i know hansulrich answered uncomfortably i havent heard from her since the last time i went back there on furlough uh huh dieselhorst said which could have meant anything at all you suppose she knows how to write you through the feldpost mail to military men got through almost no matter what even the frontschweine got their letters from friends and family and lovers sometimes under fire in the trenches well i didnt tell her rudel said more uncomfortably still no one superior to him had said anything to him about having a halfjewish girlfriend what would happen if he started getting letters from her though letters always made things seem more official more permanent they might force the powers that be to notice dont fuss dieselhorsts good cheer didnt go with his own worries if she wants to find out im sure she can danke schon that wasnt what hansulrich wanted to hear he changed the subject i wish theyd let us get airborne again now that we can sitting around through the russian mud time had only given him more of a chance to stew in his own juices dont you worry itll happen soon enough whether you want it or not dieselhorst shook his head in resigned amusement somebodys been feeding you raw meat hasnt he by way of reply rudel said something he wished he had back the second it came out of his mouth instead of withering sergeant dieselhorst it made the rear gunner and radioman laugh rudel retreated in disorder he was flying again the very next morning against a concentration of russian armor and infantry west of pskov bursts of colored smoke from german artillery pointed out the village in which the ivans had holed up without that he might not have known which village it was nobody could say the russians werent masters at concealing themselves no matter whether one tried to find them on the ground or from the air several wehrmacht men had got their throats cut inside german lines with no remaining sign of whoeverd done the dirty work but the huts in the village werent big enough to hide panzers from the air the enemy soldiers had done what they could piling brush and whatnot over the parts that stuck out that changed the houses outlines though and gave the game away im going in on one hansulrich told dieselhorst as he tipped the stuka over into a dive however much he wished he would he didnt catch the russians by surprise tracers from enemy machine guns leaped up toward the ju a bullet gouged his thick windshield but didnt get through the panzer hed picked as his own swelled beneath him his thumb hit the firing button the stuka staggered in the air as the underwing cannon went off one round from each of them and rudel was hauling back on the stick for all he was worth yanking the divebomber out of its plunge by brute force you got him dieselhorst yelled through the speaking tube the son of a bitch is burning good hansulrich said lets go around again and see if we can take out another one youre the boss dieselhorst replied if his tone implied that he thought rudel was a few liters short of a full gas tank the pilot didnt have to listen to him listen hansulrich didnt he fought for altitude it took a whilethe ju really did lose performance when it carried these mm guns then he dove again this time the ivans were waiting for him but good they fired off everything they had as his plane plunged toward the ground but they had only machine guns and rifles a stuka was built to shrug off a good many smallarms hits and keep flying hansulrich fired the mm guns again hes burning too dieselhorst reported as the pilot pulled out of the second dive burning like a motherfucker serving in the luftwaffe had got hansulrich past stewing when other people swore the way a pastors son might have that was between dieselhorst and god not between the sergeant and rudel so hansulrich only said good before asking did you see any more panzers in there yeah there was another one south of the two you blasted dieselhorst answered that wasnt what the pilot wanted to hearnot even slightly but he said what needed saying well lets go get it then he half hopedmore than half hopeddieselhorst would try to talk him out of it the rear gunner might not have had too hard a time but dieselhorst just repeated youre the boss he still sounded as if he wondered whether hansulrich had all his oars in the water but he sounded that way too often for hansulrich to worry about it now hansulrich did worry when a pair of flatnosed polikarpov fighters rushed straight at his climbing stuka from out of the east they were monoplanes yes but oldfashioned next to a bf which did him not a bit of good the ju was hideously vulnerable to fighters any old timeand all the more so when it lugged the pair of antipanzer cannon running was pointless they had kilometers an hour on him and so he tried what hed done once in the west he opened up on them at long range with the mm guns and either he was a better shot than he gave himself credit for or he got lucky one of those big shells tore the wing off the lead ivan a round designed to smash through a panzers armor did horrible things to a fighter plane the polikarpov plummeted to the ground flame licking along the fuselage hansulrich didnt see a parachute tough luck fellow he thought after seeing what happened to his buddy the other russian decided he wanted nothing to do with the stuka he whipped his plane into an improbably tight turn and got the devil out of there rudel fired at him too but missed whats going on dieselhorst asked hansulrich explained well shit the rearfacing gunner said youll be a fucking ace by the time the goddamn wars done a stuka ace who wouldve figured that thats not what they need me to do hansulrich said its just to stay alive i like staying alive the sergeant said plaintively well now that you mention it so do i rudel answered but im still going to take care of that other panzer only he didnt the russians holding the village set as many fires as they could by the way some of them smoked the ivans threw motor oil on them he couldnt find the remaining panzer through those gray and black plumes and neither could dieselhorst bombs would still hurt the red army foot soldiers but he didnt have any dieselhorst reported the situation by radio as they flew away one more mission hansulrich thought hed done his job and the polikarpov made a nice bonus vaclav jezek didnt know what hed expected when he agreed to go to spain hed expected not to get handed over to the nazis after france went and crapped out on him hed got that much anyhow as a matter of fact the spaniards made a big fuss over the survivors of the czech regiment the mayor of some town along their route did some speechifying that would have sent a stolid czech audience into gales of helpless laughter he shouted he wailed he wept he beat his breast he used more and more melodramatic gestures than hitler and the spaniards ate it up of course vaclav understood not a word of the local language as benjamin halevy had already shown he could follow it after a fashion so whats he going on about vaclav whispered hes thanking us for not despairing of the republic halevy whispered back i should hope not vaclav said its the only country this side of russia that doesnt want to shoot us on sight its a quotation it goes back to ancient rome the jew told him if you say so vaclav had been on the vocational track in his school days german you couldnt escape german not in a czechoslovakia where one person in four was a fritz but only greasy grinds had anything to do with latin german attitudes had rubbed off on vaclav or been drilled into him in ways he didnt even notice hed often thought the french were less efficient than they might have been they kept trying to muddle through and improvise instead of planning beforehand the way anyone with a gram of sense would have so it seemed to someone whose country had been ruled for centuries by germans anyhow even if they were germans from vienna and not prussians but the french had at least heard of planning whether they bothered to do any or not with spaniards there was nothing but muddling through and improvising the republic must have known ahead of time that the czechs were on their way vaclav would have thought one official or another would have decided where the new force was to go and what it would do after it got there no matter what he would have thought nothing like that had happened along with a bunch of his buddies he got off the train in saguntoanother town that halevy said went back to roman daysto take a leak hed already discovered that spanish pissoirs were even nastier than french ones but when you had to go you damn well had to go he tried not to breathe while tending to his business he came out blinking away ammonia fumes and discovered on the platform a spanish officer and a civilian official shouting and screaming and gesticulating as if their next step would be pistols at dawn tomorrow both of them pointed a lot at the train and at the czech soldiers getting on and off vaclav could no more follow them than if they were speaking tibetan he looked around to see if halevy was anywhere close by sure as hell the redheaded jew just like judas ran through jezeks mind was just emerging from the odorous latrine what are they going on about vaclav asked halevy cocked his head to one side listening where the trains supposed to take us he said they dont know vaclav said in dismay theyre spaniards what can you expect halevy answered so the men of the republic looked sloppy even to someone used to french ways did they that was interestingnot reassuring maybe but interesting and sure enough halevy went on its a good thing the assholes on the other side are spaniards too or this war wouldve been over a long time ago god i bet the nationalists drive the fucking nazis crazy serves the germans right you ask me if the germans went straight to hell and roasted for a million years on redhot griddles with devils turning em every ten minutes with pitchforks that might start to serve them right vaclav spoke with deep conviction a bunch of fuckedup spaniards nah they dont begin to cut it halevys smile reached his mouth but not his eyes when you put it that way youre right the train ended up taking the czechs through the heart of spain to madrid vaclav eyed the city with surprised respect this side of china it was one of the few places that had been bombed before prague all the others were in spain too this was where the nazis and even the italians had learned their tricks mussolini hadnt done much with what hed learned hitler on the other hand an officer in a very plain uniform stood waiting for them on the platform he wasnt a spaniardhe was from the international brigades i am brigadier kossuth i am sorry but i do not speak czech will you follow me if i use russian he said in that language vaclav could almost follow him not least because he spoke slowly russian wasnt kossuths native tongue the name he used and his accent both proclaimed him a magyar vaclav had no use for hungarians they werent as bad as germans but they werent friendly neighbors either and so he wasnt sorry to shake his head and spread his hands he wasnt about to oblige this fellow by stretching to try to understand russian most of his countrymen seemed to feel the same way brigadier kossuths stooped shoulders went up and down in a shrug he switched languages as easily as he might change his cap all right do you understand me now he asked in german he still kept that fierce accent but vaclav had no trouble making out what he said neither did most of the other czechs the older men would have had german pounded into them when they went to school back in austrohungarian days czechs vaclavs age still learned itit was their window on a wider world the same evidently held true for magyars sehr gut kossuth said no german had ever pronounced an r like that but vaclav knew what it was the officer went on you will serve alongside the international brigades it was judged best to put you with men with whom you might be able to talk he gave a thin smile the only kind his weathered face seemed to have room for sometimes this is an advantage sometimes it wasnt too or so vaclav had found in france more than once a blank stare and a mumble had probably kept him from getting killedor from killing some halfsmart french lieutenant kossuth studied the czechs with shrewd experienced eyes one eyebrow rose a millimeter or two when he noticed the antitank rifle slung on jezeks back he ambled up to vaclav so corporal do you use that against german panzers i have mein herr vaclav wasnt surprised kossuth could read czech rank badges he spoke the honorific grudgingly but speak it he did he added it is also an excellent sharpshooting piece hes killed men out to two kilometers with it sergeant halevy said helpfully the brigadier classified him with a single sharp glance wilkommen he said and then bienvenu you will find we already have a good many mouthy jews among the internationals then he said what was probably the same thing in french vaclav wouldnt have been surprised if halevy came back in magyar the french jew was a man of parts but if he knew any of brigadier kossuths birthspeech he didnt let on he replied in yiddishtinged german so vaclav could understand i wouldnt be a bit surprised sir i hope you dont hold it too much against us not too much kossuth said slowly if most czechs didnt like jews most hungarians really didnt like jews after a visible pause for thought the brigadier went on the ones i resent are the ones who stayed home those who came here have shown they can fight this is what the struggle demands we agree there halevy said by his tone there would be plenty of other places where they didnt also by his tone he wanted kossuth to know that even if he was just a sergeant and the other man a brigadier something sparked in kossuths deepset eyes a beat slower than he might have vaclav recognized it as amusement you are another troublemaker kossuth said i might have known would i have come here if i werent sir halevy said and then would you have come here if you werent to vaclavs amazement brigadier kossuth proved he could laugh out loud his is the bbc news those plummy tones coming from the radio seemed out of place in a military hospital in manila pete mcgill was disgusted with the limeys for coming to terms with hitler he would have bet most of the british marines hed known and drunk with and sometimes brawled with in peking and shanghai were just as disgusted but he was glad to listen to the bbc any which way it gave more news and less bullshit than any american station he was also glad he wasnt the only one in the war who wanted to know what the beeb had to say even army files could figure out that what happened in the wider world had a lot to do with the way they did business you didnt have to be a leatherneck to see thatbut it probably helped sir horace wilsons government easily defeated a motion of no confidence in the house of commons yesterday the newsreader said only a handful of tories joined labour and liberal mps in opposing the prime minister even abstentions were fewer than many had anticipated that meant england would go on doing what she had been doing kissing germanys ass pete muttered something foul he couldnt do anything about englands foreign policy but he didnt have to like it he also didnt like it when the newsreader went on about the triumphs the british expeditionary force in the east was winning less bullshit or not the bbc man said nothing about the fact that the tommies were fighting side by side with the wehrmacht and the waffenss maybe the radio network had a guilty conscience if it didnt it should have in other newsthe broadcaster said nyews where it would have been nooz in petes new york mouththe empire of japan has recalled its ambassador from washington in protest over president roosevelts decision to stop sales of petroleum and scrap metal to the japanese no talks regarding this delicate issue have yet been scheduled that came out sheduled instead of the american skeduled but again pete followed with no trouble aw shit said an army corporal with a leg broken in a car crash them japs is gonna come after us next by us pete didnt know whether the army guy meant the united states in general or the men in this military hospital in particular either way the other twostriper was probably right the japs had signaled their intentions by making peace with stalin if they wanted to pick a fight with the us of a they wouldnt have to worry about getting jumped from behind that much had been obvious ever since japan and russia started talking about peace it gave the russkis their free hand in the west too but if the japanese ambassador was on his way home things in these parts might start boiling over any day now and that wouldnt be good for american interests in the far east for one thing the philippines lay within easy range of the japanese home islands and of formosa which had belonged to the japs for most of the past fifty years for another just about all of my buddies are stationed in peking or shanghai one pete said tough luck for them the army corporal replied but chances are they aint a nickels worth worse offn we are right here know what i mean dont i wish i didnt pete said glumly theyre talking about letting me out of my cast pretty soon maybe theyll give me shipboard duty at least then ill be able to shoot back at the little slanteyed pricks thatd be good the army guy agreed you can make it to the bomb shelter too if they do me i gotta lay here and hope the assholes miss me yeah thats not a whole lot of fun pete said ive been thinking the same thing every time they hold an airraid drill he clicked his tongue between his teeth considering if theyre even halfway on the ball theyll run a lot more of em from here on out that only drew a derisive snort from the other corporal if theyre even halfway on the ball they dont get assigned to the philippines to begin with well except maybe macarthur and everybody knows hes a fuckin blowhard pete didnt keep track of army generals it sure wasnt the first time hed heard people bitch about douglas macarthur though a lot of guys still hated him for what hed done breaking up the bonus army at the deepest part of the depression hed heard that from other injured men here he did get the cast off his ankle the very next day he was shocked to see how skinny his leg had got under it i want to go back to duty right away he blurted yeah and people in hell want mint juleps to drink answered the medical technician whod cut the cast off him just cause you want it doesnt mean you can have it get yourself in shape again and see what the brass tells you then it was good sensible advice which didnt mean pete liked it how often does anybody ever like good sensible advice the world would be a different and probably a better place if more people took it but telling a marine he needed to get fit was giving advice he was prepared to heed pete was already in the habit of exercising till everything screamed he was used by now to screams from one part of him or another hed done the same kind of thing after his arm came out of its sling and cast you do heal well a physical therapist told him some people might have ended up in a wheelchair from what happened to you some people might have got killed pete growled the therapist blinked well yes he didnt know about vera she was another reason pete pushed himself so hard while he was working and sweating and hurting he didnt think about her so much he retreated into the gym the way another man might have retreated into the bottle sooner or later though a drunk sobered up and sooner or later pete had to quit working out and start listening again to the demons that lived inside his head there were lots of them some hated the japs not only as enemies of the united states but also as the people who made chinese terrorists want to blow up places like movie houses some of his demons hated the chinamen whod blown up the theater and murdered the love of his life that theyd ruined him too was no more than an afterthought and some of his demons hated his own superiors and the policies and regulations they had to uphold if vera hadnt been a stateless person everything could have worked out pete thought so anyhow he and his lady love could have got married and gone back to the states together and done something or other whatever happened afterwards even if it was only reno and a quickie divorcenot that pete imagined any such thing they wouldnt have been within thousands of miles of some sticks of dynamite attached to a ticking clock if he could kill lots of japs that would make him feel better because he understood as much he pushed his ankle far past the point where a less determined man would have started gulping aspirins and cold beer that fight wouldnt wait and he was bound and determined to be ready for it when it came he couldnt get at the chinamen not any more even if hed gone back to shanghai he wouldnt have known which of the goddamn chinks to go after they kept themselves secret from the japs which meant they also kept themselves secret from everybody else so those demons would just have to stay unsated their blood lust unslaked consciously pete didnt want to go after marine corps higherups but he didnt see the look on his own face when he eyed officersespecially officious bythebook officers of whom the corps had no fewer than any other outfit its size those officers saw the black looks officious they might have been but they werent all stupid some of them recognized the scowls for well for some of what they were anyhow one man said to another we better get that guy out of here before he goes asiatic and does something everybodyd be sorry about afterwards him too not that that would do anybody any good his friend nodded but replied hes liable to do it wherever we send him yeah sure but its not our lookout after that the first officer was indeed an officious type he was also an officer with good personnel connections and so even though pete mcgill wasnt quite a hundred percent yet he found himself released from the military hospital and assigned to the uss boise a light cruiser that was one of the heavier vessels of the far east fleet he didnt complain on the contrary he thought somebody had done him a favor willi dernen thought hed learned all about the wehrmacht greatcoats limits the winter before in france he hadnt been in russia long before he discovered his education in such matters was incomplete the biggest difference was in france you could almost always find somewhere cozy to hole up villages clustered thickly even if you were stuck in a trench the line didnt move much you could fix up your hole till it was fit to live in yeah it was cold outside but if you had a fire and a wall to keep off the wind you could put up with things pretty well it wasnt like that here for one thing the germans and their allies were still advancing you couldnt put down roots the way landsers had in france after the big push to sweep around behind paris fell short for another there were far fewer places in which to put down roots russian villages were few and far between and often seemed all but lost amidst the vastness of fields and forests willi had never imagined such a wide wild country the howls that came from the woods were wolves not dogs his skin had prickled up in gooseflesh when he realized that and finally not to put too fine a point on it the wehrmacht issue greatcoat wasnt up to the challenge a russian winter gave it if you wore one out in the open with no fire to keep you warm eventually youd freeze to death or not so eventually depending on how hard the wind howled down out of the north willi stole a sheepskin vest from a russian peasants hut thatexcept for not running around on giant chicken legsmight have come straight out of fairy tales about baba yaga the inside of the hut was filthy the vest probably carried lice and fleas willi didnt care he was already lousy and fleabitten a little more crawly company so what the damn thing was warm and it fit snugly and he could wear his greatcoat over it the find made his buddies jealous only thing better would have been a jug of vodka adam pfaff said thatd heat you up from the inside outand you might even share it in your dreams willi said sweetly they both grinned pfaff might not have been with the unit very long but he was a good guy he was no combat virgin either he knew what needed doing and he did it without fussand without freezing up in a tight spot willi was glad to have him at his back and it worked both ways that vest also made arno baatz jealous though arno was no buddy of willis and never would be the corporal kept hinting someone of higher ranksay someone of corporals rankdeserved the sheepskins better than a lowly gefreiter did as far as willi was concerned awful arno could hint till everything turned blue he still wouldnt get his grubby mitts on the vest find your own willi told him if i can do it anybody can thats what you always say right baatz came back with something else he said often if not all the time if taken literally it would have swept willi to a place too warm for him to need a sheepskin vest any more willi grinned at him too but more in mockery than in the comradeship he shared with pfaff hes got some nerve the other gefreiter said when willi told the tale of the corporals ponderous hints who does he think he is god willi answered or he thinks god would do a better job if only he listened more to arno baatz pfaff laughed nervously youre kidding arent you dont i wish willi exclaimed that soandsos never been wrong once since the fucking war started if you dont believe me just ask him shit wed be in paris if only the fuhrer listened to old arno id take him more seriously if you said we wouldnt be in russia if only the fuhrer had listened to him pfaff said willi glanced around no nobody else could hear themand a good thing too nice to know you trust me he said dryly hey youve already had your fun and games with those blackshirt cocksuckers adam pfaff answered he threaded a bit of cloth through his gray rifles barrel with a cleaning rod youre not gonna turn me in if i open my mouth and say what everybody can see youre all right you know that willi lit a papiros looted from the same shack where hed got the sheepskin vest the tobacco wasnt the greatest and there wasnt a whole lot of it at the end of the long paper holder why the hell did the ivans make their smokes that way any cigarettes though were better than none pfaff examined the cloth after finishing with the pullthrough he nodded to himself yeah that needed doing all right he muttered then he sounded more hopeful let me have one of those will you ill let you have it all right willi said in mock anger a friend wasnt just somebody with whom you could speak your mind a friend was somebody who could bum smokes off you and whod let you do the same when you were out willi handed pfaff a papiros obliged pfaff said and so he was one of these daysprobably one of these days soonhed pay willi back artillery rumbled not too far behind them those were german s hitting the russians up ahead before long the russians started shooting back to willis relief it was counterbattery fire as long as the gunners went after one another the infantry could breathe easywell easier when the big guns started tearing up the front line landsers didnt enjoy it so much the red army had plenty of cannon and used them as if they were going out of style the ivans also had an abundance of mm mortars willi particularly hated those every platoon of russian infantry seemed to lug one along they didnt have the range of ordinary cannon but the reds could drop a couple of bombs into your foxhole and shred you before you even knew they were around orders from the regiment arno baatz yelled as if he were the one whod issued them we advance under cover of the artillery barrage oh boy adam pfaff said in hollow tones into the meat grinder one more time he managed a raspy chuckle well we arent hamburger yet me im from breslau willi said deadpan pfaff sent him a reproachful look when you get your sorry ass shot off chances are itll be somebody from your own side nah thats awful arno willi chambered a round and scrambled out of his shallow hole cmonlets go german soldiers loped across snowstreaked fields willi spotted corporal baatz trotting along with everybody else and baatzs eye was also on him as it was all too often willi resisted the impulse to send an obscene gesture awful arnos way it wasnt easy but he did it military discipline he told himself occasional rifle shots came from the ivans lines a kilometer or so up ahead but no more not at first then the guys in those scrapes woke up and realized the germans were serious about this business a machine gun started spitting out death rattles industrialized murder at its finest willi hit the snowy dirt he wished he had a white camouflage cape and hood so hed be harder to spot he wasnt the only landser going down shrieks said not everybody was taking cover some of the men had been hit medics and stretcherbearers with red cross armbands and smocks rushed up to tend the wounded the russians shot at them the same way they shot at everybody else ivan didnt play by any of the rules and if the reds caught you it was your hard luck on the other side of the coin captured russians often got short shrift from the germans who took them prisoner german mgs came forward with the assault troops they spat their own curtain of death at the men ahead officers whistles screeched the soldiers got up and advanced once more the russians didnt have much barbed wire in front of their position only a few halfhearted strands getting in among them was easier than it should have been some died some threw up their handsmost of those were actually allowed to surrender and some fled to fight again somewhere else later on hot damn pfaff said going through a dead ivans pockets we do this another couple thousand times we win the fucking war willi set a hand on his shoulder anybody ever tell you youre beautiful pfaff knocked the hand away they both laughed but it wasnt as if willi didnt mean it his friend understood how things worked altogether too well a sundaymorning knock on the door made sarah goldman flinch any knock on the door could make a jew in the third reich flinch this didnt sound fierce enough to be the gestapo but you never could tell ill get it father limped toward the door he opened it whoever was outside spoke in a low voice no that wasnt any nazi official as soon as the people in uniform saw a jew they all started shouting at the top of their lungs and samuel goldman turned around with an odd smile on his face weve got company he announced his voice sounded funny too amused pleased more knowing than it should have all of those and a couple of more besidesones sarah couldnt place so easily who is it she asked then her own voice rose to a surprised squeak oh isidor hello sarah isidor bruck sounded nervous she had no trouble figuring that out he was wearing his best suitpossibly his only suit the yellow star of david on the left breast didnt disfigure the dark wool too much or maybe by now sarah had just got used to the mark of shame he gulped and had to try twice before he managed to go on i need to talk to you and to your mother and father too somehow sarah wasnt surprised to discover her mother standing right behind her at the back of the living room hanna goldman said well come all the way in isidor whatever youve got to say you dont need to say it standing in the front hall oh right sure isidor did take a couple of steps forward that let father close the door behind him now the neighbors wouldnt be able to see what was going on chances were theyd be disappointed well too bad can i get you something to eat isidor something to drink mother was automatically courteous they had next to nothing in the house but she would come up with whatever isidor said he wanted it would be tasty too whatever it was but he shook his head no thank you frau goldman asking was good form so was declining everybody in the reich knew how little everybody else had these days and that little was bound to be even less if you were a jew again isidor needed to gather himself before adding thats not what i came for well what did you come for then father still sounded suspiciously genial as if he already knew the answer i came because isidor paused to cough to say he was nervous as a cat would have been unfair to every cat sarah had ever met he had to gather himself one more time before he could go on at all then he blurted well herr goldman i came because im in love with your daughter and i want to marry her and i hope she wants to marry me thats what i came for oh father said and not another word isidor looked as if he wanted to sink through the floor what do you say sarah mother asked sarah knew what she would say and she said it with as little hesitation as she couldshe didnt want poor isidor going any greener than he was already of course ill marry you isidor the words came out as smoothly as if shed rehearsed them and so she had to herself many times no he wasnt taking her by surprise she didnt think he surprised her folks either her answer at least halfsurprised isidor you will he exclaimed wonderful he rushed up to squeeze her hands in his she squeezed back but was it wonderful she wasnt nearly so sure wasnt love the kind of love you got married for supposed to be a grand consuming passion that swept away everything in its path like redhot lava pouring down from mount vesuvius she might have accepted a bakers son but she was a classical scholars daughter she didnt feel anything like that for isidor but she liked him well enough and she couldnt very well say she felt nothing for him his gently insistent hands were more clever than anything shed ever imagined and he certainly seemed happy when she returned the favor so what if it wasnt perfect when it came to jewish life in the third reich the mere notion of perfection was a cruel joke it was good enough these days good enough was more than good enough father would laugh at her if she said it like that but hed know exactly what she meant what he said now was mazel tov mazel tov mother echoed isidor awkwardly kissed sarah on the cheek she kissed him the same way she had to dodge a little at the last second because hed nicked himself shaving well well father said and stumped back into the kitchen a chair scraped across the floor creaking noises warned that he was climbing up onto it sarah shot mother a look what was he doing mothers microscopic shrug said she didnt know either more creaking noises father descending then he pulled glasses out of a cabinet he came out carrying a squat brown bottle sarah didnt remember seeing before where did you get that mother said so she didnt either i stashed it at the back of a high shelf seven years ago for celebrations and other emergencies father answered not without pride seven years ago that would have been when the nazis took over father had known what he was doing all right he carefully set the glasses on the table in front of the sofa then he poured fine french brandy into them one by one he raised his lchaim lchaim sarah and isidor and mother echoed they all drank together the brandy was smooth as a kisssmoother than some of isidors it slid down sarahs throat with hardly a snarl warmth spread from her middle to life father said again this time in german he went on i dont know how hard or how complicated it is for two jews to get married these days it was a little simpler when hanna and i did itjust a little but where theres a will theres a lawyer or maybe a raft of lawyers isidor blinked he wasnt used to father putting a cynical spin on cliches not yet he wasnt but he was part of the family now or becoming part of the family hed have to get used to it and quick have you looked into it sarah asked him no sorry he said i wasnt sure id be lucky enough to have you say yes and i didnt want to talk to the nazis when it might be for nothing if you know what i mean sarah nodded her knight in shining armor would have gone ahead confident she would be his and confident he could overcome bureaucrats and party flunkies well shed already figured out that isidor wasnt a knight in shining armor this wasnt a fairy tale either this was life more often than not keeping your head down was smart if you stuck it up somethingsomething say wearing a black shirt and ss runeswas much too likely to knock it off theyll probably give you the runaround father said as long as you dont let them get you angry youre still ahead of the game as long as i dont let them see they got me mad isidor said thats right father eyed him with more approval than hed shown up till now thats just right people like that have their fun getting other peoples goats just do whatever they tell you no matter how stupid you think it is my father says the same thing isidor answered he has to deal with the morons who dole out the barley he says they dont know enough to grab their tukhus with both hands but he cant tell them so or theyd just come down on him even harder than they do already he sounds like a sensible man father said close to his highest praise hanna and i have to meet your mother and father one of these days soon that would be good isidor said they want to meet you too something to look forward to i havent had anythinganything but tsuris to look forward to for quite a while now father said isidor looked as if he didnt know how to take that sensibly he kept his mouth shut sarah also didnt know how to take it and she didnt know how much to look forward to her own wedding that also didnt strike her as the way things should have been she knew what she could do about it nothing now she could have said no she wondered if she should have said no but no the way it looked to her would have been even worse than yes so what could you do but go on and see what happened next again nothing not so far as she could see lieutenant colonel ponamarenko slammed his fist down on the rickety table that did duty as his desk papers and a bottle of ink jumped sergei yaroslavsky wondered if the table would fall down it never had yet it didnt this time either we serve the soviet union ponamarenko shouted we serve the soviet union echoed the pilots and other flying officers assembled in front of him sergei brought out the phrase without conscious thought as if he were responding to a priests celebration of the holy liturgy in church a pretty good atheist he didnt think of it that way which made the resemblance no less precise we shall destroy the fascists and imperialists the squadron commander yelled as if working himself up into a frenzy destroy them again sergei chorused along with everyone else instead of falling down and rolling around on the ground and foaming at the mouth lieutenant colonel ponamarenko grew practical and cagey and this is how were going to do it he went on pointing to a map the nazis have gathered together a big supply dump west of velikye luki their forces are drawing on it and so are the shameless french if we can knock it out we badly slow their movements in this sector and so tovarishchi that is what we shall do but for his shaved chin he might have been moses bringing the tablets of the law down from mr sinai moses however didnt have to worry about obsolescent beatup unreliable sbs lieutenant colonel ponamarenko and his particular group of the children of the ussr damn well did one of these days the squadron would convert to pes and come back to fighting the war against the luftwaffe on more or less even terms in the meantime they would do what night bombers could do how much that would be sergei had flown several night missions by now before and after the rasputitsa and he still wasnt sure the advantage of night flying was that enemy interceptors had only the devils grannys chance of finding you up there in the big black sky the disadvantage went right along with that you had a rough time finding your target and an even rougher time hitting it if you did find it as sergei knew too well the same could also apply at high noon on a cloudless summers day his breath smoked as he walked to his sb fur and leather flying togs kept him warm enough like most men lucky enough to have such gear he also wore it a lot on the ground winter was just coming on but in russia you always had to treat it with respect ivan kuchkov waited for him and vladimir federov sothe motherfucking supply dump is it the bombardier said thats right sergei answered the noncoms got briefings of their own of course but sergei had the feeling sergeant kuchkov would know what was what even if nobody said a word to him how the same way a wolf tracked an elk through the forest the wolf knew what supper smelled like and kuchkov kuchkov knew what trouble smelled like groundcrew men started up the engines the props blurred into invisibility sergei and federov eyed the gauges and went through the checklist with uncommon care the sb was coming to the end of its useful life not to put too fine a point on it the sb had come to the end of its useful life quite a while ago but there still werent enough pes to go around so the older machines kept flying pilot and copilot nodded to each other and exchanged thumbsups everything looked all right fuel oil pressure hydraulics as long as the airplane didnt fall apart five thousand meters off the ground they were good for another mission sergei taxied down the long runway lit at the moment by a handful of electric torches red lanterns marked the end of the bumpy frozen dirt strip he yanked back hard on the stick it felt as if he were hauling the sb into the air by the scruff of its neck he wasnt inclined to be fussy as long as the beast got airborne he wouldnt complain all right comrade navigator he said to federov tell me how to get to this miserable nazi supply dump we fly a course of degrees at kilometers an hour for fortyseven minutesand then we start groping around like blind men the way we always do replied the other man in the cockpit and that was about the size of it you could make your course as precise as you pleased you could measure your airspeed well but you couldnt be sure how hard the wind was blowing or from which direction at any given moment your dead reckoning would probably put you somewhere close to your target finding it on a moonless night like this was liable to be a different story shall i stick my head out the window for a better look sergei asked when he thought they were about where they were supposed to be if you think it will help federov answered the nazis or possibly the french imperialists knew they were around antiaircraft fire started coming up from the ground the tracers and burstsscarlet and goldwere eerily beautiful the old sb shook in the air from a couple too close for comfort but the gunners down below were firing more or less blind the groundcrew men had painted the bombers underside matte black to make it as hard as possible to spot from below ivan kuchkovs voice floated forward through the speaking tube wheres this supply cunt at anyway im still looking they hide them you know afterwards sergei felt silly for apologizing to a foulmouthed supply sergeant but that was afterwards it seemed natural enough at the time bombs started bursting down on the ground red blooms of fire swallowed almost at once by smoke and dust were they landing on the dump or were the aircrews dropping them at random so they could get the devil out of here sergei didnt know and then all of a sudden he did one of the soviet bombs must have hit the germans ammunition store things down below started blowing up with great enthusiasm the fireworks show already spectacular got ten times better and best of all these pyrotechnics werent trying to knock the sb out of the sky thats where we unload sergei and federov said together sergei steered the bomber toward the continuing coruscations down below kuchkov would hardly need the order to let the bombs fall free sergei tried to look every which way at once and wished for eyes in the back of his head he wouldnt be the only pilot drawn by those blasts and he didnt want to run into any of the others ducking down into the planes glazed nose federov peered through the bombsight now ivan he shouted through the speaking tube the bitches are fucking gone kuchkov yelled back sergei felt the plane get lighter and friskier he hauled the nose around and started back toward sovietheld territory he hadnt got very far when an antiaircraft shell slammed into the sbs wing flame spewed forth and licked toward the fuselage oh fuck your mother he exclaimed and then his wits starting to work again out weve got to get out he yelled through the voice tube too to make sure ivan knew and they had to hurry the controls went from normal to mushy to nonexistent in nothing flat the fire started invading the cockpit he had to fight through flames to get out of his safety belt and down to the escape hole federov had already used he held his gloved hands and leathercovered arms in front of his face trying to protect eyes and mouth maybe the flying suit was burningor maybe that was his hide then he was down and falling free he hoped like hell the wind would put out the flames he yanked the ripcordand discovered his unfolding parachute was on fire above him only blackness below oh it was a long way down ell thats fucked up lieutenant demange tried to speak with his usual savage satisfaction in spite of himself though he sounded impressed oh just a little luc harcourt agreed the germans had been so sure nothing could happen to their massive supply dump as far as luc could see the germans were always sure the trouble was the damned boches werent always right a wan watery sunrise through roiling clouds showed how very wrong theyd been here back before the shooting started some expert or other had gravely warned the bomber will always get through two years of fighting had proved thatsurprisenothing would always do anything but they also proved that almost anything would sometimes do something and this time the russian bombers had got through smoke still rose from the devastated dump some of it stank of corditeammo of all sizes from smallarms to mm was still cooking off in there the explosionssometimes single spies sometimes in battalionsmade the dawn even more nervous than it would have been otherwise and some of it smelled like the worlds biggest and worst stew forgotten on top of a fire probably on top of a forest fire how many rations were burning up a couple of kilometers away enough to turn a quartermaster sergeant irrational the nazis had assigned several frenchspeaking officers as liaisons with their enemiesturnedallies listening to the guttural rendition of his language coming out of one of their mouths did nothing to reassure luc neither did the officers arrogance even if the german might have been more inclined to call it confidence they got lucky the fellow in feldgrau insisted the advance will go on as if they had not my left one lieutenant demange muttered which pretty much summed up what luc thought of the germans declaration easier to advance when you had supplies than when you didnt that should have been obvious even to a nazi and also easier to advance when it wasnt so goddamn cold at first the germans had been relieved when the ground froze it let their tanks and halftracks and motorcycles and trucks move forward again instead of getting stuck in the mud every few meters but russian cold didnt know when to quit the winter before had been as cold as any luc had ever known in france now hed decided he was only a beginner when it came to frigid winters he also feared he wouldnt be by the time he came home from russiaif he ever did winters hereabouts were born knowing things their tamer cousins in western europe never learned if he ever came home from russia neither he nor his countrymen had been thrilled about the idea of taking on the red army a good many frenchmen were reds themselves and not all of them had been weeded out of the expeditionary force not by a long shot even the french soldiers who werent communists would have been happier to keep fighting hitlers crew the germans after all had invaded them but their politicians had cut a deal and this was what came of it the russians had dropped leaflets written in better french than most germans used urging the french soldiers to go over to them promising not just good treatment as prisoners but practically anything else their little hearts desired a few frenchmen did desert but the promises were so overblown they roused lucs everready suspicions anything that sounded too good to be true probably was he and his comrades hadnt advanced against the russians with any great enthusiasm but the russians no matter how juicy the promises they packed into their leaflets fought like wild animals they werent skilled military technicians the way the germans were they had no quit in them though if you wanted to shift them you had to kill them they werent about to run away and you needed to make sure you killed them all they had the wild animals gift for concealment if you saw one you could bet ten more were hiding close by if you didnt see one ten more were liable to be hiding close by anyhow the russians had the charming habit of digging foxholes camouflaged from the front and shooting troops who incautiously went past them in the back if you walked off into the bushes to take a crap you were liable to get your throat cut you were liable to have worse than that happen to you too one poor bastard in lucs company had been found with a french flagjust the kind you might wave if you were lining the sidewalks at a paris parade on bastille daystuck up his ass luc wondered if that happened to the poor sorry poilus who went over to the russians with leaflets in hand he hoped not but he wouldnt have been surprised one thing the way the red army fought undoubtedly did it made the french fight the same way when the other bastards were sneaky and murderous and cruel the international proletarian brotherhood looked a lot less persuasive all of a sudden you wanted to do unto others as they were doing unto you wasnt that your best chance to stay alive the germans sure thought so theyd fought a pretty clean war in france not perfect but pretty clean luc whod seen landsers shot while trying to give up knew his own side hadnt fought a perfect war either pretty clean maybe but not perfect here in russia the germans didnt even pretend to try they fought at least as foully as the red army did most of the time they didnt bother taking prisoners when they did they often didnt bother feeding them they also often didnt bother feeding civilians in towns they captured whatever they got their hands on they seized for themselves in a way that made military sense in another way they know how to make people love em dont they luc said after tramping through a village full of holloweyed peasants oh maybe a little lieutenant demange said somehow hed managed to keep himself in gitanes luc these days was smoking anything he could find russian tobacco was bad german worse tell you one more thing luc went on demange nodded and raised an eyebrow waiting for whatever the one thing was luc said ive always been glad im not a jew you know i mean who isnt but what with the way the boches and the poles treat em here now im really fucking glad im not a jew i dunno if youd got your cock clipped right after you were born you wouldntve had to come here for some reason or other the brass doesnt think jews and nazis mix so well demange said wonder why that is luc said maybe they arent as dumb as they look couldnt prove it by me the older man answered but the other funny thing is the germans arent doing anything to the kikes in poland they cant stand em and neither can most of the poles like you said but the government there doesnt want the nazis fucking with em on account of theyre polands kikes politics can spin your head around fastern absinthe you ever drink that shit luc asked it had been illegal about as long as hed been alive but demange was old enough to have tried it before it was outlawed and afterwards if he respected the laws against it the same way he respected everything else oh sure the veteran said casually take some mighty strong brandy and smoke some hashish while youre pouring it down thatll give you the idea got you luc had no more smoked hashish than hed drunk absinthe but he wasnt about to let on demange would have been as ready to scorn lowermiddleclass respectability as he was with anything else that drew his notice strong brandy luc did know hed heard about the kinds of things hashish did so he could make what he thought was a halfway decent guess about absinthe if demange saw through him the veteran didnt let on he didnt have much time to let on the russians started shelling the french positions they might have most of europe in arms against them but they showed no signs of giving up holland and belgium luxembourg and denmark had fallen down on their backs with their legs in the air and their bellies showing when the germans invaded them czechoslovakia and norway hadnt lasted much longer now that they were conquered they werent giving the nazis much trouble any more only france had fought back hard with luc grudgingly admitted to himself some help from england france and now russia france hadntjust barely hadnt but hadntlet the wehrmacht nip in behind paris moscow was a hell of a lot farther from the german or even the polish border than paris was from the rhine the same held for st petersburgno it was leningrad these daysand kiev the russians could trade much more space for time than france had been able to luc wished he hadnt had such thoughts with red army s crashing down all around him he wanted to hope hed go home one day not to know hed be stuck in this goddamn russian icebox forever and a day what he wanted and what he was likely to get no doubt werent even related to each other chaim weinberg had seen czechs in spain before there were more than a few of them in the international brigades along with men from just about every other country in central europe thats why they call em internationals smart guy he jeered at himself he admired what hed seen of them too they had the same solid virtues as most germans without being such assholes about it almost all of them spoke german and they could make out his yiddish so he could talk with them he approved of talking plenty of people said he did it too fucking much hed never seen so many czech soldiers all at once though and hed never seen so many who werent all solidly marxistleninist either but the popular front was alive and well in republican spain these czechs might not be communists but nobody could say they werent antifascist theyd hated the nazis enough to keep shooting at them even after their own country went under chaim rapidly discovered they were damn fine soldiers too nothing they saw outside of madrid fazed them not even a little bit on the contrary theyd learned their trade in a harder classroom than any spain offered one guy used an antitank rifle as a snipers piece that struck chaim as swatting flies with an anvil but the czech was a damn maestro with the brute anything that moved out to a mile away from him maybe farther was liable to stop moving very suddenly his name was votslav or something like that he looked down his rather blunt nose at marshal sanjurjos men they dont know much about taking cover do they he said in slow deliberate deutsch theyre brave theyre fascist pishers but theyre brave chaim admired the courage of the spaniards on both sides as far as he was concerned they carried it to and sometimes past the point of insanity but votslav a military pragmatist only shrugged a fat lot of good it does them they wouldnt be so easy to kill if they didnt parade around like a bunch of dumbheads left over from napoleons time it wasnt the first time chaim had heard a european talking about napoleonic tactics when he meant something old and outdated the guys from the abe lincoln battalion who thought about history some cared no more about it than henry ford did spoke of the civil war the same way the other civil war chaim reminded himself a redheaded guy in a newlooking tunic with czechs sergeants pips came up to them in the trench he spoke to votslav in czech but chaim needed no more than the blink of an eye to realize what he was vos macht a yid chaim said and the other fellow needed only a moment to size chaim up youd know the mamaloshen all right he said who are you where are you from im chaim weinberg out of new york city you benjamin halevy paris my folks came from prague so i grew up with a bunch of different languages i was liaison for the free czechs till daladier decided to turn into hitlers tukhuslekher now im here his wave didnt get higher than the parapetthe nationalists would have snipers too the verkakte garden of eden right verkakte is right anyway chaim didnt need to look around to know how abused the landscape was go slow votslav said i have trouble keeping up when you guys jabber like that its not the german i learned in school bet your putz its not buddy chaim said not without pride benjamin halevy chuckled the real czech only sighed and scratched his head both he and halevy wore adrian helmets they covered less of the head than the ones the spanish army issued chaim liked them better even so spanish helmets looked too much like the german stahlhelms they were modeled on he didnt like looking like a nazi storm trooperno way nohow he sometimes did it hed seen too many men dead from a piddly little fragment that happened to pierce their skull to want to avoid that if he had any chance at all nothing could make him happy about it halevy waved again this time toward sanjurjos lines jezeks rightthose guys arent such hot stuff we ought to advance and clean em out was i that eager when i first got here chaim supposed he had been he was still willing he wouldnt have stood in this chilly trench if he werent but he doubted hed ever be eager again he said the french must have been feeding you a lot of raw meat benjamin halevys crooked smile was all jew because were new here we think everythings easy you mean yup that was englishof a sort halevy andjezek was itunderstood anyhow maybe this is true and maybe we have reason for it the czech soldiers german could be awkward but it worked it was a hell of a lot better than chaims spanish jezek explained now that we cannot shoot nazis any more we have to make do with people who get into bed with nazis people who dance the mattress polka with nazis halevy amended chaim grinned the yiddish phrase had more bounce than the polite german both literally and figuratively thinking about dancing the mattress polka naturally made him think about la martellita hed got what he wanted from her all right and hed also got much more than hed bargained for when he first jumped on her shikker bones she didnt want to see an abortionist even under the republics liberal laws they were illegal which didnt mean business ever went bad for them here or anywhere else that she didnt want to find one had surprised chaim la martellita seemed such a perfect red somebody who wouldnt think twice about something like that maybe taking the girl out of the catholic church was easier than taking the catholic church out of the girl heaven knew that was true about plenty of jews who converted to christianity so now things were official the civil ceremony took a minute and a halftwo minutes tops he didnt feel particularly married afterwards married or not he hadnt been anywhere close to sure his brandnew bride would let him touch her again that in fact was an understatement hed wondered if she would plug him as soon as the i dos were over a widow could give a baby a legitimate last name too but no he really must have pleased her the second time they made love together when shed let him touch her after he tenderly battled her hangover and so he got one nights worth of honeymoon back at her cramped flat it would have been just his luck to have a nationalist air raid interrupt things at some critical moment but again no and again he worked hard to please her despite that second time when they started as man and wife she looked ready to spit in his eye and tell him he was the lousiest fuck in the history of fucking had she kept that attitude after they turned out the lights he would have begun with three maybe four strikes against him one more time though no she seemed to decide that as long as she was going to do this she might as well do it right when she did it right she did it up brown she was no blushing virgin brideanything but some of the things she did without being asked might have surprised a pro they sure surprised chaim not that he complained afterwards his heart still thundering he blurted when i can see again ill try to tell you how marvelous that was you are as good as i remember la martellita answeredtepid praise compared to his but better than hed hoped for she added get off me now youre squashing me flat lo siento and chaim had been sorry he hadnt wanted to do anything to ruin this and some time in the not very indefinite future hed looked forward to another round and then with luck one more after that dancing the mattress polka he smiled there in the trench one of these days before too long hed get another furlough and then hed hurry back to madrid hurry back to his new wife if he had only not quite nine months of marriage ahead of him here he aimed to make the most of them julius lemp hated winter patrols a uboat would roll in a spilled glass of water when the seas were high and the wind howled down from the north he feared the u would capsize that wasnt likely uboats were designed for these conditions but the sour stink of puke never left the boat when she tossed and capered like a badly spooked pony hed hoped things would be better in the baltics close confines than in the north sea or the wide wild winter waters of the north atlantic west of the british isles and things were better that only illuminated the vast gap between better and good some of the waves the harsh winds stirred up here were big enough to send deluges of frigid seawater down the hatch at the top of the conning tower and into the u besides drenching the sailors the water shorted out electrical equipment gave the pumps a workout and even threatened the massive batteries that powered the uboats electric motors while she was submerged if we stayed at schnorkel depth skipper we wouldnt have to put up with this gerhard beilharz said up on the conning tower water dripping from his oilskin cape and headgear maybe lemp answered but maybe not too when were running seas like this what are the odds a big waveor a bunch of big waves one after anotherwould make the schnorkel s safety valve shut and then how long would the diesels take to suck all the fresh air out of the pressure hull or if the valve didnt work water would come down the pipe and flood the engines and then wed really be screwed a little stiffly beilharz said that safety valve is plenty reliable all right lemp said in magnanimous tones we wouldnt get flooded wed just have to learn to breathe diesel fumes instead that can happen the engineering officer admitted a good thing for him too lemp might have pitched him off the conning tower and down into the pale gray sea had he tried to deny it still sounding like a maiden aunt talking about the facts of life beilharz went on thats only possible with waves like these when the waters calmer the snort behaves just fine i know i know lemp also knew the schnorkel wasnt the only thing with a slightly unreliable safety valve gerhart beilharz had one too since lemp didnt want it to stick and beilharz to explode he kept on soothing the tall junior engineering officer its very valuable most of the time but you dont want to use it when the seas run this high that you was deliberate beilharz had made it plain he did want to use the snort now lemp made him think twice at least he could think twice which put him one up on a lot of people lemp knew and two up on some with a sigh beilharz said when you put it that way i guess youre right happens to everyone now and again if lemp laughed at himself he beat other people to the punch as usual the ratings atop the conning tower swept sky and sea with their field glasses the sky was cloudy with a low ceiling the seas mountains and chasms changed places without cease the ivans were unlikely to come across them till things moderated which might be tomorrow and might be next spring but unlikely didnt mean impossible the ratings stayed alert they were solid men lemp didnt have to get on them to make sure they stayed that way having escaped one russian plane he didnt want another one to run across him he might not stay lucky twice the baltic wasnt very deep or very wide not when you set it alongside the atlantic but it had plenty of room to let a uboats crushed hull disappear forever and if a russian destroyer suddenly appeared out of seaspray and mist in that case lemp would take the u down as fast as she could go and pray the ivans depth charges didnt peel her open like the key to a tin of sardines but the heavens stayed good and gloomy that made enemy shipping harder to spot at any distance but it also meant no red air force planes were likely to swoop down on the uboat given the choice lemp preferred the low scudding clouds gerhart beilharz eyed the sky too his thoughts ran down a different track how bad will it get in the middle of winter if its already like this will we be able to operate at all or will the whole sea freeze solid not the whole sea lemp answered that doesnt even happen up around murmansk and archangelsk and they face on the arctic ocean for heavens sake the younger officer nodded but he didnt let go oh sure skipper but they have the gulf stream going for them so warm water flows up to them from the southwest without it theyd probably be icebound all year around not just in winter i wish they were it would make our lives easier lemp gave beilharz a grudging nod well fair enoughyouve got a point but the baltic doesnt freeze all the way across there will be ice on it some way out from shore but the ivans have icebreakers to clear the way for their uboats when its at its worst we cant be rid of them so easily however much i wish we could too bad beilharz grinned crookedly isnt it just lemp agreed everything would be a lot easier if the enemy acted like a dummkopf all the time or if the people on our own side werent dummkopfs themselves more often than they ought to be he sighed wondering whether the reich had been wise to get entangled with the soviet union most of russia might be undeveloped but that colossal sweep of red on the map remained intimidating again beilharzs thoughts ran in a different direction now that weve patched things up with england will the royal navy come into the baltic and give us a hand against ivan battleships aircraft carriers more uboats we sure could use em i know lemp said germanys only carrier the graf zeppelin remained incomplete and unlaunched he wondered whether it would ever be finished and go into action or if the powers that be would find better uses for all those thousands of tonnes of steel and order it broken up that wasnt for him to say hells bellshe couldnt even give the schnorkel man a straight answer if the limeys are coming this way nobodys told me about it and now you know as much as i do itd be nice if we found out ahead of time beilharz said plaintively we shoot an eel at an english dreadnought by mistake that wont make em want to stay friendly with us no it wont were the baltic as cold as julius lemps voice it would have frozen solid from surface to bottom on the instant and never thawed out again afterwards lemp had already sunk one important ship by mistake he didnt even want to imagine another screwup so monumental beilharz hadnt joined the crew when the athenia went down the schnorkel man had joined the crew in no small measure because the athenia went down and what theyd seen since the failed putsch against the fuhrer with history playing out before their eyes to the accompaniment of machinegun chords and then the great reversal so that machine guns stopped firing in the west and started up against the reds hitler had a lot to be proud of if he could beat the russians and make it stick the last people whod managed that were the mongols theyd done it a devil of a long time ago now theyd stormed out of the east too coming from the west germans austrians poles swedes turks english and french together everyone had failed which didnt mean the reich and its shiny new anglofrench alliance couldnt succeed where everybody else had had to toss in the sponge of course it didnt of course it doesnt lemp told himself thinking louder than he might have the previous track record sure didnt improve the odds though track record on land these days the track was muddy where it wasnt frozen the wehrmacht and its allies kept gaining ground all the same they just had to go on doing it that was all and the uboats and the rest of the kriegsmarine had to help theo hossbach wondered why he seemed to play football only when it was bloody cold here he was standing in goal on another snowstreaked bumpy pitch watching his buddies andthis timea bunch of tommies pound up and down they got warm running the way they did they would have stayed warm at the south pole he by contrast was freezing his ass off a goalkeeper was often as much a spectator as the germans and englishmen watchingand betting onthe action from the sidelines well he always had been more a detached observer than a participant in life if you were going to play football at all goalkeeper was about the best you could do along those lines as radioman was if you happened to be part of a panzer division sometimes the world came after you whether you wanted it to or not a shell from an enemy panzer or antipanzer gun could smash through your armor unless you were good or at least lucky or was that lucky or at least goodno one seemed to know and sometimes a grinning tommy in khaki dribbled past what were supposed to be your rear four defenders and drew back his leg to drive the ball into the netthey had proper goals this time loot from a russian school unlike an antipanzer round he couldnt blow you to smithereens but he could humiliate you which hurt almost as much and was far more public make yourself big that was what they told goalkeepers in trouble theo duly did it running out at the englishman to cut off the angle waving his arms over his head spreading his legs and for good measure yelling at the top of his lungs the tommy shot the ball banged off theos left foot and slithered out of bounds for a corner kick fucking ell the thwarted footballer snarled theo didnt speak english but he recognized an endearment when he heard one he smiled sweetly as the two sides jostled each other before the kick his own teammates thumped him on the back thats the way to play it adi stoss said you couldnt have done any better thanks theo muttered praise on the pitch from adi was praise indeed as usual the panzer driver seemed to be in his own world here he far outshone his countrymen he far outshone his opponents too and the english had invented the game hed already scored once and only a leaping sprawling save by the other keeper kept him from claiming another goal the tommies did the same thing other german sides did they tried to knock him off his game by knocking him around nasty tackles sent him sprawling a couple of times in a professional match they would have got the guilty parties sent off if nobody needed an ambulance here you just kept playing adi was no fool he could tell which way the wind blew hed probably known it would blow his way long before it did and he took care of things on his own one of his tormentors went down in a heap and didnt get up again for a long time at last when theo was starting to wonder if they would need an ambulance the englishman staggered to his feet and play went on a few minutes later another tommy skidded a long way on his face he rose with blood running from his nose looking for a fight adi stood right there if the fellow in khaki wanted one he could have it he decided he didnt want it the match resumed once more at last the english lieutenant serving as timekeeper and referee blew his officers whistle play ground to a stop the landsers had beaten the tommies a few of the englishmen seemed amazed they could lose at their own game even in a pickup match like this a couple of others seemed furious most though were as winded as their german counterparts they and the germans clapped one another on the back clasped hands and tried to talk using fragmentsoften foul fragmentsof their opponents language on the sidelines cash and chattels personalespecially tobacco and liquorchanged hands as bettors settled up one of the germans who seemed to have done well for himself went up to adi whatever he said didnt sit well with theos crewmate stoss turned away obviously angry the other german said something else adi snarled something in return theo trotted over to them ready for anything you didnt let your buddies down on the battlefield or on the pitch but the fellow whod infuriated adi didnt want to bang heads he just looked bewildered at what hed started you can clear off pal he said to theo i didnt mean to get him mad at me oh yeah theo only halfbelieved that on the one hand nobody in his right mind would want adi stoss mad at him the englishman with the bloody nose had seen that hed backed off too on the other hand adi wasnt a guy with a short fuse he didnt go looking for trouble or start it he didnt get sore for no reason at all either or did he the other german said yeah honest to god all i said was he played as well as the last time i saw him on the pitch liar adi said and if that wasnt murder in his voice theo had never heard it i dont think so theo might have heard the danger in his voice but the other fellow plainly didnt he went on i was selling stuff in munster three four years ago and bayern munchen was playing a friendly against some town sidethe foresters thats who they were im from munich so i went i remember you cause you were the only good thing on the pitch for your club adi shook his head i dont know who youre talking about but that wasnt me right the man from munich didnt believe it for a second then it was either your twin or your ghostthats all ive got to tell you could have been either one adi said all ive got to tell you is it wasnt me huh no the stranger wasnt convinced but what could he do in the face of such stubborn stony denial walk off shaking his head was the only thing that occurred to theo and that was just what the fellow from munich did adi stoss swore loudly and foully he kicked at the halffrozen ground under his feet now i cant even play fucking football any more he muttered dont worry about it words never came easily for theo he found a few more anyway hes from munich not munster whatever youre running from he doesnt know anything about it sudden hard suspicion filled adis voice why do you think im running from anything hed been ready to kill the guy from munich hes liable to want to murder me too theo realized and all things considered how can you blame him he picked his next words with even more care and reluctance than he usually used its not like half the guys in the company dont already know know what stoss demanded this time theo didnt say a word he glanced toward the crotch of adis black coveralls held his eyes there long enough to make sure the driver noticed him doing it and then looked away adi was swarthier than most germans that didnt keep him from going white now you know he whispered fraid so theo answered and you didnt turn me in to the gestapo or the sd or the rest of those pigdogs oh sure i did six months ago the rest of the panzer guys have done it dozens of times theo said deadpan stoss stared for a second maybe a second and a half he believed theo he didnt know whether to clout him with a rock look around frantically for blackshirts or just start running then he realized hed tripped over irony you son of a bitch he said and he couldnt have sounded more relieved if the panzer iis armor had just held out a burst of machinegun fire you son of a bitch maybe the whole worlds not out to ruin us after all he didnt say which us the world was after but theo hadnt either they both knew all right hings werent going well for the soviet union the news broadcasts from moscow did their best to disguise that and their best was surprisingly good had anastas mouradian not been a frontline fighter he never would have realized how rotten things looked but he was and he did it wasnt even that the front kept moving east the ussr was an enormous place trading space for time was an old russian strategy and now a new soviet one the way the red army and red air force were making the trade though stas heard much more about all the devils relations than he wanted to bad language about them filled the military frequencies among russians that was a surefire sign things were badly buggered up and generals and colonels kept getting replaced one after another nobody said anything about what happened to the men who were relieved mouradian could draw his own pictures they werent pretty which didnt mean they werent true the replacements came in and gave enthusiastic orders the germans and the allies theyd seduced into campaigning against socialism kept gaining ground regardless in weeks or days or sometimes hours the enthusiastic replacements got replaced themselves some of them probably didnt even know why they went into the gulags which didnt stop them from going there were timesthere were quite a few times in factwhen mouradian was glad to be only a lowly lieutenant all he had to do was follow orders from above as long as he did that he was safewell as safe as any soviet frontline fighter he just had to worry about the nazis and their allies he didnt have to worry that the nkvd would blame him for the next unauthorized retreat josef stalin spoke on the radio something he seldom did workers and peasants of the soviet union you must not take one step farther back he declared his georgian accent was thicker than mouradians armenian intonations russians threw everybody from the caucasus into the same pile people from the caucasus knew better georgia and armenia bordered each other but so what their peoples were as different as magyars and czechs to them it was obvious to russians but what did russians know georgians and armenians were both dark and both used peculiar alphabets nobody else could read if that didnt make them brothers you werent a russian we must hold the enemy in place the country is in danger stalin went on every wrecker and traitor we capture must and shall face the most severe punishment around mouradian heads in the squadron ready room solemnly bobbed up and down stas made himself nod too so as not to seem out of place anyone who paid attention to what he read and heard followed more than the mere words blaring out of the radio speaker the most severe punishment was a government euphemism for execution commonly by bullet in the back of the neck and by every wrecker and traitor stalin meant everyone who disagreed with him even in the slightest or most trivial way the show trials and purges before the war proved that we shall fight for the rodina we shall fight for holy mother russia stalin declared alexander beat napoleon peter the great beat the swedes we beat the teutonic knightsfilthy plundering germanswhen they invaded us and our cause the russian cause is just again we will win again several of the flyers in the ready room banged their hands together and burst into cheers the ones who did were russians to a man as for mouradian he had to fight the impulse to dig a finger into his ear and see if the canal was clogged with wax stalin had mentioned the workers and peasants of the soviet union in his speech hed mentioned them yesand then hed proceeded to forget all about them instead hed used as many symbols from russian history as he could find not soviet historyrussian stas had never dreamt he would hear a soviet leader talk about holy mother russia that stalin himself was no more russian than a kazakh or an uzbek obviously bothered the general secretary of the communist party of the ussr not at all holy mother russia didnt mean much to stas mouradian that wouldnt bother stalin either armenia was only a little place jammed into the bottom lefthand corner of most maps the vast expanse of russia was the map martial music thundered out of the radio it wasnt martial music stas had heard before which meant exactly nothing stalin had factories from here to khabarovsk cranking out planes and tanks and guns and uniforms as fast as they could he had swarms of collective farms cranking out food as fast as they could and if he had to starve millions of people to force more millions to labor on those farms hed proved he would do that without batting an eye of course he would have conservatories full of composers cranking out martial music as fast as they could if the composers didnt feel like serving the soviet union that way what would they do then theyd start de composing that was what and the crazy thing was the martial music worked by the time the piece finished mouradian wanted to belt somebody in the chopsby choice somebody in a fieldgray uniform and a coalscuttle helmet he understood that he was being manipulated understanding it and being able to stop it were as different as tea and tobacco the squadron co was not surprisingly a russian the soviet union held as many russians as all its other peoples put together and the ussr had sprung up like a flower fertilized by the russian empires corpse some would say like a vulture feeding on the russian empires corpse but notusuallymouradian it was no surprise that russians still ran so much of the ussr depressing sometimes but no surprise lieutenant colonel tomashevsky waited till the last strains of the brandnew martial composition had faded away then he stood up and said you all heard comrade stalins brilliant speech he promised the soviet people victory we are going to deliver that victory comrades we are going to use our wonderful new airplanesthe finest products of soviet science and engineeringto show the fascist hyenas and their plutocratic lackeys hell on earth less than the sons of bitches deserve too as the flyers had nodded for stalin so they nodded for the squadron leader anastas mouradian made sure he wasnt behindhand there all the same he got the feeling tomashevsky hadnt listened to the general secretary so closely as he might have tomashevsky talked about the soviet people about soviet science and engineering that had been the party line for a long time by the way stalin talked today though the line was changing stalin talked about tsar alexander and peter the great about russian victories over invaders from the west stas had heard rumors that people in the northwestern ukraine were welcoming the germans and their allies as liberators he didnt know if the whispers were true but anyone who repeated a story like that took his life in his hands stas did know the ukrainians had little reason to love stalin or the soviet government not after the way they were starved by hecatombs during collectivization after that even the nazis might look good by comparison today we fly against velikye luki the squadron commander continued the poles and the french are staging through there building up for an attack farther east our mission is to strike the train station and the railroad yards he paused then asked questions what are the german defenses like comrade colonel mouradian said even if the poles and french were coming through velikye luki the fighters above the place and the antiaircraft guns inside would be operated by germans he was as sure of that as made no difference tomashevsky only shrugged it does not matter we are to strike the city regardless i serve the soviet union mouradian replied maybe the squadron commander had no idea what was waiting for them or maybe the germans were loaded for bear before long everybody would find out which even if the luftwaffe had bfs patrolling over velikye luki stas knew he might get away anyhow in a pe he wondered how sergei yaroslavsky and the chimp were doing in that ancient sb pretty soon with any luck at all theyd start flying the more modern bomber too after his bold question the mission turned out to be a mission bfs did fly above occupied velikye luki but not in swarms there was a lot of ground fire but there wasnt a lot of ground fire he watched in dismay as one bomber in the formation fell out of the sky and cometed groundward trailing flame and smoke a couple of shell fragments clanged against his planes aluminum skin but they did no damage he could find at ivan kulkaanens command sergeant mechnikov let the bombs fall free stas could only hope they landed on the target or close to it bombing from meters was not an exact science you aimed them as best you could you dropped them and you got the hell out of there stas had sat in kulkaanens seat he knew how hard the job was once you landed you made the afteraction report sound good that was also part of the job yes another mission all right and how many more still to come harbin held enough japanese settlers to keep a daily newspaper in business copies came down to pingfan sometimes on the day they were printed sometimes the day after the local rag would never run the yomiuri shinbun out of business but hideki fujita read it avidly just the same along with the radio it helped remind him that there was a world beyond shiro ishiis bacteriologicalwarfare camp he needed the reminder too when you dealt with maruta every day when you sent them into the secret center compound and they never came out again you really did start thinking of them as logs the other choice was remembering that they were human beings even if they were russians or chinese considering the kinds of things that happened to them in there fujita neither knew nor wanted to know the details the broad outlines were more than bad enough they would have been better off if they were made of wood the local paper was full of a rising tide of abuse aimed at the united states whoever wrote the stories roared out hatred against the country across the pacific for refusing to sell japan any more of the raw materials she needed roosevelt thinks he can bring us to our knees through economic warfare an editorial declared he has yet to learn that the empire of japan goes to its knees before no man and no nation he has yet to learn this important fact but we japanese stand ready to teach him the lesson shinjiro hayashi read the newspaper too he was less enthusiastic about what he found in it than fujita was are you ready to fight another war so soon sergeant san he asked we just patched up a peace with russia and the war with china goes on and on war with the united states isnt our worry fujita answered the sailors will carry the load on that one some of it sure but not all of it hayashi said the philippines sit just south of the home islands and who runs them the americans thats who if war breaks out well have to take them away from the usa otherwise theyre a perfect base for enemy ships and planes and it wont be the sailors who do most of the fighting down there itll be bowlegged bastards like us fujita laughed neither he nor hayashi was bowlegged but he knew what the senior private meant the navy was the aristocratic service the army took peasants and turned them into men it had done just that with fujita it had turned hayashi into a man too even if hed put on more airs than peasants before conscriptionand some sergeants hard handsknocked them out of him all right fine thats the philippines fujita said but it will still mostly be the navys war i suppose so sergeant san hayashi said by which he meant he supposed no such thing but wasnt stupid enough to come right out and tell fujita he was wrong but if a fight like that starts it wont be a halfway affair french indochina singapore the dutch east indies with oil and rubber and tin when you grab you should grab with both hands if you grab too much your hands fill up and you trip over your own feet fujita responded theres such a thing as getting greedy you know i suppose so hayashi said again but sometimes you only get the one chance if you dont take hold of it while its there you may never see it again its like a chance with a pretty girl neh you always grab with both hands then fujita made as if to cup breasts in his callused palms both soldiers barked harsh male laughter a couple of days later lieutenant ozawa summoned fujita to his tent he had a little coal stove in there for warmth but it was fighting out of its weight against winter in manchukuo i need your squad to take care of something for me the officer said yes sir fujita said and saluted he had no idea what ozawa would tell him to do that hardly mattered whatever it was he and his men would take a whack at it if the lieutenant wanted him to bring back a piece of rock from the moon he wouldnt fail through lack of effort but ozawa had nothing so ridiculous in mind take as many russian and chinese maruta as you need he said build a new prisoner compound site it at least fifty meters away from any others make it of a size to hold oh about a thousand men yes sir fujita repeated for good measure he saluted again too this was something he knew how to handle how soon do you need it ready three weeks should be plenty of time the lieutenant answered fujita considered thatll be a little tight sir for running up all the barracks halls and everything the weather wont help us any if he didnt get the job done on time he wanted his excuses lined up in advance you take care of it ozawa said you dont want me to assign the work to someone else do you part of fujita wanted just that but if he admitted it he wouldnt get any other interesting work as long as he stayed at pingfan not interesting in the good sense of the word anyhow they might give him things no one else wanted to do or was able to do and then blame him when he had trouble that wouldnt be good and so with no hesitation the officer would notice he replied no sir all right then three weeks see to it ozawa said dismissed fujita didnt even mutter under his breath till he left the tent and the lieutenant couldnt hear him any more you didnt want to give the jerks who ordered you around any kind of handle to let them screw you even harder they already had enough advantage on account of their rank he told senior private hayashi about the new assignment and directed him to gather up the labor theyd need to construct a new compound hayashi might have had his own opinion about people whose rank let them give orders if he did he also had the sense not to put it on display laying out the barbedwire perimeter around the new compound was easy any maruta could handle it because it needed no skill but the barracks required people who could use hammer and saw chisel and plane the prisoners clamored for the work because they knew theyd get fed a little better while they were doing it they also wouldnt have to go into the secret inner facility while they were working hayashi efficiently weeded out the ones who were only pretending to be carpenters he and the other japanese soldiers beat up some of them to teach them not to play stupid games with their betters chinese and russians forced to work together screamed and gestured at one another trying to communicate without a common language hayashi knew a little chinese no one in fujitas squad spoke russian he had drawings to show what he required those pictures were worth an untold number of words the barracks rose on schedule the next interesting question was who would live in the new compound when new shipments of chinese came to pingfan they got dumped in with their countrymen those barracks grew insanely crowded so what the same had been true of the russians though no new red army men were coming in now that peace with the soviet union had been arranged didnt a new compound argue for a new kind of prisoner so it seemed to fujita lieutenant ozawa either didnt know or didnt want to talk about it you couldnt properly grill officers however much you wanted to one more proof that they werent good for much pete mcgill got something he never expected in a million years a combination christmas and getwell card from the leathernecks of the shanghai garrison almost everybody signed it even guys he couldnt stand and who he knew couldnt stand him herman szulc wrote you dont know how lucky you are to get away max weinstein said power to the proletariat if hed told that to pete facetoface pete wouldve wanted to punch him in the snoot seeing the cramped scrawl on the card only made pete miss the stubborn pinko more airraid alarms sounded in manila these days at first theyd panicked the filipinos now the locals ignored them so did pete he was up and about but not exactly swift even though the boise had accepted him aboard he remained on light duty there were times when he wondered if somebodyd pulled strings to get him out of the military hospital but he didnt worry about it he still wished he were back in shanghai with the men hed known for so long if the japs did jump the leathernecks in china would get it in the neck they couldnt very well do anything else except runand running wasnt marine corps style theyd make the best fight they could but when there were hundreds of them and zillions of little yellow monkeys even the hero of a bad western shootemup couldnt blast that many redskins before they got him pete remembered the bet hed won from his buddies by barging into a line of jap soldiers and watching a movie with them the samurai warriors in their movie wore funny clothes and had funnier haircuts they used swords instead of sixshooters they spoke a language he didnt begin to understand such minor details aside the flick might have been a gradec hollywood oater whenever pete heard airplane engines over manila he got nervous the japs bombed the crap out of chinese cities every chance they got if they decided to mix it up with the usa of course theyd do the same thing here theyd have to be nuts not to for a wonder the american government seemed to realize as much some of the engines pete heard belonged to p fighters people said those would blast the japs scrapmetal planes out of the sky others came in pairs on fatbellied b digby bombers if the japanese did come flying to their bases and blowing them skyhigh looked like a pretty decent plan the american government also waved its magic wand and turned philippine field marshal douglas macarthur back into american general douglas macarthur some of the guys pete drank with off duty applauded that others just jeered the longer soldiers had served under macarthur the more skeptical they seemed pete leaned toward the doubters macarthur belonged to the army didnt he of course that meant he was likely to screw things up christmas came so did new years pete got a wire from his folks in the bronx that was nice but it might as well have come from another world the card from the fellows hed served with meant more to him foreign news didnt get any better no one would confuse with the millennium not any time soon the nazis and their little friends kept bashing heads with the reds the japanese kept banging away in china their foreign minister said no power can accept the dictates of another without becoming a slave that was the translation anyhow maybe it sounded friendlier in japanese but again pete leaned toward the doubters then the foreign minister clammed up altogether nobody at all took that for a good sign manila went right on having airraid drills the day after new years a nervous antiaircraftgun crew opened up on a digby they shot it down that was good news as far as gunnery went pete didnt suppose the other digbys flyers thought so if a bunch of jumpy halftrained american soldiers could knock a b out of the sky what would jap veterans do to them what would jap fighters do to them those were interesting questions werent they the second sunday of january was the twelfth the night before pete had gone out and got crocked he couldnt remember how many times hed got crocked on saturday nights in the far east he couldnt remember what all had happened on some of those nights either that was the point for him and a swarm of guys just like him if getting crocked on saturday night wasnt a great american military tradition he didnt know what would be maybe waking up on sunday morning feeling like death pete lived up to that one in spades the fuck he muttered trying to figure out exactly what kind of ungodly racket had ripped him untimely from the womb of sleepand from the oblivion of all the cheap whiskey hed poured down the night before he didnt need long to figure out what the racket was all the airraid sirens in town were going off at once jesus h christ groaned the guy in the bunk above his has to be that cocksucking macarthur hes the only asshole big enough to boot us out of the sack at sunup on a fucking sunday morning if macarthur was that big an asshole pete was all for stringing him up by the balls he was also all for gallons of hot coffee a handful of aspirins to finish corroding his stomach lining but quiet his pounding head and some more zzzs after the sirens quit screeching if they ever did a moment later antiaircraft guns added a bass note to the cacophony more digbys pete wondered vaguely some of the guys at the guns would catch hell or would they if those were digbys overhead they were fighting back bombs crumped down they didnt land that close to the cruiserbut they werent that far away either holy motherfucking shit i think were under attack exclaimed the marine in the upper nothing gets by you does it sherlock pete said huh the other guy said it wasnt a brilliant comeback but pete didnt gig him for it instead he scrambled out of the bunk trying to find out what the hell was going on he didnt forget his hangoverhe would have had to be dead for real to do thatbut he did shove it aside for once he had more important things to worry about klaxons hooted all hands battle stations all hands battle stations boomed from the loudspeakers on light duty pete didnt have a battle station he got topside as fast as he could anyway the sky was full of planes and puffs of antiaircraft fire shrapnel started pattering down he suddenly wished for a tin hat some of those chunks of shell casing could put your lights out for good if they came down on top of your head most of the planes overhead had unfamiliar linesbut not that unfamiliar not to him hed seen them every now and then in china hed seen the big red meatballs on their wings and fuselages too sure as hell they were japs he didnt know why he should be so surprised and outraged but he was the philippines belonged to the us of a god damn it to hell those enemy warplanes had no business coming here no business at all overhead a brightly painted peashooter dueled a japanese fighter americans laughed at the shit the japs manufactured but the plane with the meatballs was far faster and more maneuverable than the admittedly obsolescent american machine the peashooter spun toward the ground trailing a plume of fire and smoke no parachute blossomed in the muggy air scratch one american flyer pete thought then the japanese fighters pilot spotted him and the other marines and sailors on the boise s deck he dove on them machine guns blazing pete couldnt move fast no matter how much he wanted toand he wanted to one hell of a lot bullets spanged off steel wounded men screeched the fighter roared away at not much over stack height something not nearly far enough away blew up with a rending crash of course the japs were coming after the far east fleet small as it was they were bound to have carriers offshore theyd want to make damn sure nobody could go after those precious ships they knew how to get what they wanted too a bigger explosion followed the first one an enormous cloud of black smoke toadstooled up into the sky rifles yelled another marine coming up from below ive got rifles so we can shoot back at the lousy yellow bastards pete gratefully grabbed a springfield you could shoot down a plane with a rifle you had to be mighty goddamn lucky mighty goddamn luckybut you could and even if you didnt shoot anything down you were trying to you were in the fight noyou were in the war it had taken almost two and a half years but the united states was finally in the war war the headline on the philadelphia inquirer took up most of the space above the fold peggy druce had to turn the newspaper over to learn that japan had launched attacks on the philippines and hawaii and was also moving into french indonesia and british malaya it wasnt that she didnt already know some of thatshe and herb had been glued to the radio ever since news of what was going on halfway around the world broke here in the states but the paper had more details than the hasty radio bulletins shed heard before many of them delivered by men who sounded as if they could hardly believe the copy they were reading she brought the inquirer in to her husband who was eating fried eggs and buttered toast and getting down a second cup of coffee heavy with sugar and almost white with cream she remembered some of the rationed breakfasts shed had in europe and what passed for coffee in germany americans didnt always understand how lucky they were she handed herb the front page without a pang shed glanced at the headlines and hed fill her in on anything important she might have missed he took the inquirer with a word of thanks as soon as he had it in front of him he lit a cigarette breathing out smoke he said lord what a mess peggy nodded but didnt answer shed been in the middle of such an exploding mess herb of course had seen and done even worse things when he went over there a generation earlier that wasnt quite the same though the mess then had already exploded by the time he got to it he knew what he was supposed to do and how to go about it things now were up in the air as they had been when peggy found herself too close to the german border as hitler marched into czechoslovakia some of those things had been machinegun bullets and mm shells and kg bombs theyd come down much too close to her head looks like manila got caught napping herb remarked exhaling more smoke hawaiis not so bad we were ready for em therebut why didnt we spot em while they were on the way darn it maybe they came from a funny direction peggy said maybe they didbut we ought to be looking every which way at once when theres liable to be a war on dont you think herb opened the inquirer to get a look at the inside pages he shook his head we were ready in hawaii and we still lost a carrier and a battlewagon and some of the fuel store weve got there he held up a page with a photo for peggy she supposed it was smoke from burning fuel oil or whatever the hell it looked more like a volcano going off what about manila she asked its a lot closer to the japs and it got hit a lot harder herb answered theyll probably try invading the philippines if they havent already he went to another inside page macarthur says we shall prevail that sounds pretty doesnt it it sure does peggy said i wonder how he expects to do it though ha her husband finished the toast and stubbed out his cigarette theres the sixtyfourdollar question all right what does fdr have to say about it peggy asked adding there wasnt anything on the front page herb nodded acknowledging that shed looked as she brought in the paper he settled his bifocals more firmly on his nose as he looked for an answer he grunted not much liking what he found a white house aide says obviously we are at war obviously we didnt want to be our goldfish could tell us that much and we havent got a goldfish peggy said yeah i know herb nodded then he let out a different grunt one that said now were getting somewhere the presidents going to address congress at noon emergency session itll go by radio all over the country peggy wondered how many people would miss church to hear him it was still sunday morning herestill very early sunday morning on the pacific coast it had been sunday morning for quite a while in manila though hawaii had got hit at midday saturday their time when peggy remarked on that herb grunted one more time now as if to convey well what do you expect some of the guys there were still sober i bet he said odds are thats why they did better why does everybody get smashed on saturday night she wondered his look told her she could have asked a better question she thought hed grunt yet again but he fooled her he only rolled his eyes youre in the service what else is there to do he said then slowly and deliberately he lit another cigarette his cheeks hollowed as he took a deep drag when he let it out in twin streams through his nose he looked like a locomotive venting steam peering down at the paper rather than at peggy he went on if theyll have me hon im going to put the uniform on again oh no but that was dismay not surprise peggy knew him too well for such a thing to surprise her she did take her best shot at changing his mind you did your bit the last time aroundyour bit and then some herb chuckled sourly if they have to stick a springfield in my paws the usas in deep water all right he admitted but i know some stuff i didnt back in all kinds of thingsll run smoother if somebody like me who knows the ropes is there to keep an eye on em she imagined swarms of canny successful middleaged men with gimlet eyes and skeptical stares descending on war plants all over the country and telling army regulars how to do their jobs better if you think the regulars will thank you for it youre nuts she predicted she squeezed another chuckle out of him this one might in fact have been amused they may hate us but theyll need us maybe he was right maybe wrong maybe the army wouldnt take him back peggy hoped it wouldnt and feared it would she said i dont remember the last time i wanted a drink so bad first thing in the morning to her amazement herb built her a strong one and himself one stronger yet what the dickens he said we dont go to war every day thank god and if we get sleepy later on so what its sunday ice cubes clinked as he raised his glass heres to the usa to the usa peggy echoed the bourbon hit her hard in spite of her morning coffee but herb couldnt have put it any better what the dickens so what they both had another hefty knock after the first one the newspaper stopped being interesting reading felt like too much effort and on the morning the united states found itself at war the funnies werent very funny peggy turned on the radio she and herb took turns spinning the dial music and prayersmany of them hastily and badly written to take account of suddenly changed circumstancesand confused war news came from one station after another peggy didnt worry about any of it she was paying attention to the state of the nation which was what the times called for a little before noon herb turned the dial to for wip the mutual broadcasting systems local affiliate no doubt most stations would carry fdr but you could count on that one right on the hour an announcer spoke in hushed tones ladies and gentlemen the president of the united states addressing a joint session of congress here is the president mr vice president mr speaker members of the senate and the house of representatives yesterday the empire of japan attacked american possessions without warning or provocation roosevelt said his voice raspy with anger the empires despicable action shows that its leaders think us weak and irresolute like it or notand no sane man can relish warwe are at war with the japanese they have started this fight we will finish it and we will win it a great cheer rose from the members of congress fdr went on to ask them to make a formal declaration of war against japan that cheer told peggy hed get exactly what he asked for he ivans were getting frisky somewhere a long way ahead lay smolensk the orders for willi dernens regiment said it was one part of a giant pincer that would help encircle the russian city but to encircle a place you first had to nip round behind it the orders came out of berlin and berlin didnt get what was going on all these kilometers to the east willi hadnt shaved since he couldnt remember quite when his face fungus helped a little when it came to keeping his cheeks and chin warm it would have done more if it werent full of rime from his breath and he was better off than many he had his greatcoat and the sheepskin vest underneath and he had a pair of fine felt boots some russian didnt need any more his feet wouldnt freeze too soon compared to those of his buddies still stuck with wehrmacht issue gear he was well off compared to the french and english whose coldweather clothing was nowhere near so good as what the germans made he was incredibly lucky but the poles didnt have to scrounge to get their hands on stuff like this they knew ahead of time what these winters were like seeing german troops collect pitying stares from a bunch of damn poles was galling to say the least red army men had clothes made for this hideous weather too they also had gun oil that didnt freeze up when it got really cold unlike the fancy shit the germans used willi carried a little tube of that taken from the dead russian whod supplied him with valenki the action on his mauser still worked just fine he shared the gun oil with his friends he even shared it with awful arno more from expediency than affection baatz might be the worlds biggest pain in the ass but he was almost as dangerous to the bastards on the other side as he was to his own men fighting went back and forth back and forth german panzer lubricants didnt like the bitter weather any better than german gun oil did sometimes you could get panzer support sometimes not russian panzers didnt seem bothered they had wider tracks than german machines too they could go through or over mud and snowdrifts that made german panzers bog down squatting by a fire in a hut in a wrecked village willi said if the ivans even halfway knew what the fuck they were doing they could run us back into poland in about a week and a half nah adam pfaff shook his head he was as grimy and shaggy as willi wed hang on for two weeks easy arno baatz crouched by that crackling blaze too he didnt growl at pfaff for defeatism he just bummed a papiros off of him there might not be much tobacco in the damn things but what there was was a lot stronger than germanissue smokes willi also had some papirosi in a greatcoat pocket it wasnt as if there werent plenty of dead russians to frisk poor brave stupid shitheads he went on their officers tell em to do something they keep on trying to do it no matter how dumb it is you mean like charging off to surround smolensk adam pfaff inquired awful arno stirred at that but for a wonder he didnt say anything maybe he was taking mental notes if he waswell fuck him and willi shook his head no not like that were trying all kinds of ways to do it none of ems come close to working yet pfaff said arno baatz stirred again willi ignored him but theyre all different he said the russians keep doing the same goddamn thing over and over no matter how many of em get killed its like they dont care or they dont dare get any ideas for themselves always more russians to throw in baatz said for once in his life he wasnt even close to wrong soviet generals spent men the way a sailor on leave spent money on girls more where those came from seemed to be their guiding principle the germans always killed more enemies than they lost themselves but the ivans kept on coming the thought had hardly crossed willis mind before a sentry out at the edge of the village yelled halt who goes there only a burst from a russian submachine gun answered him the burst must have missed because the german fired back and an mgnot too frozen to operatechattered to irate life fuck awful arno grabbed his rifle like willi hed slapped whitewash on the stock and barrel so the piece wouldnt stand out against the snow adam pfaffs remained graynot perfect camouflage but not bad either since whitewashing his own mauser baatz had quit riding pfaff about it urra urra the russian battle shout dinned through the village the red army soldiers were probably liquored uptheir daily ration was a hundred grams of vodka and their officers upped it when they went into action booze drove fear into the background willi wished for a hundred grams of potent spirits himself he burst out of the hut pfaff and baatz at his heels bullets cracked past them they ran toward the heaviest fighting at the eastern edge of the village most of the ivans wore white snow smocks on the same principle as the whitewashed mausers the poles had them too german quartermasters kept promising to produce some and kept breaking promises some landsers improvised their own from captured bedsheets but there werent nearly enough of those to go around willi wished he had one his feldgrau greatcoat turned him into a big blot against the snowy background he flopped down behind the burnt and mashed wreckage of another hut and snapped off a shot at the oncoming russians one of the snowsuited figures went down was he hit or just taking cover himself no way to tell not from where willi sprawled adam pfaff lay on his belly ten or fifteen meters away also firing at the ivans after we capture smolensk he said slapping a fresh fiveround magazine onto his rifle fuck that shit willi answered all i want to do is get out of this lousy place in one piece thats on account of youve got your head on straight pfaff said now if the clowns in berlin did too wish for the moon while youre at it willi fired at another russian enemy fire eased off none of the germans in the little village relaxed the russians loved to play games like this to lull their foes into a false sense of security and then jump on them again from a new direction sure as hell the next attack came in from the south mortar bombs burst here and there then it was another wave of drunken ivans bawling urra at the top of their lungs this time the russians broke into the village no matter how frigid the weather was the work got very warm for a while the mg worked fearful execution among the ivans they couldnt bring their heavier clumsier machine guns up for close combat but raked the village with them at long range willis head might have been on a swivel he tried to look every which way at once adam he screamed behind you pfaff heard and the gray mauser knocked over a russian who would have rammed a bayonet through his kidney in another few seconds pfaff shot the russian again deliberately this time to make sure he wasnt shamming he wouldnt pull a lazarus now not with the top of his head blown off his blood steamed in the snow obliged pfaff said this is a whole bunch of fun isnt it if you say so willi answered the other gefreiter chuckled sullenly the russians pulled back bodies littered the ground some in snow smocks over khaki others wearing feldgrau wounded men wailed injured russians and germans sounded pretty much alike the landsers kept a few wounded ivans for questioning and disposed of the rest it wasnt as if the red army men wouldnt have done the same to them willi went back to that hut hoping the fire was still burning as a matter of fact the hut was on fireit had taken a direct hit from a mortar anything but fussy willi got as close to the flames as he could stand warmth meant more than anything else he could think of adam pfaff came up beside him also soaking in heat like a lizard in the sun smolensk moscow all easy right pfaff said well sure willi drawled in a way that left no doubt about what he really thought they both grinned it wasnt as if they could do anything about where fateand the wehrmacht had stuck them a russian machine gun fired a burst from the woods beyond the fields that surrounded the village willi flopped down in the snow again but no quicker than his friend reds bomb scapa flow read all about it a newsboy shouted waving a paper on a london street corner alistair walsh handed him a broad copper penny and got a times in exchange sure as the devil the russians had hit the great british naval base in the orkneys walsh couldnt imagine how theyd done it the story told him they evidently had some huge lumbering fourengined bombers to which no one in the royal navy had given a second thought till they lumbered southwest from murmansk struck the great anchorage and droned away homeward before the raf could give chase radio moscows claims as to the damage inflicted on our ships are grossly exaggerated a royal navy spokesman has stated the times story said primly once upon a time not so long agobefore he resigned from the armywalsh would have been sure that was true trust the russians ahead of his own government not a chance but there was a chance and maybe a good chance if a bentley could run down a prominent critic of the governments policy what was safe after that not a thing not so far as walsh could see not for the first time he wondered if he was safe himself he supposed sohe was too small a fish to worry the likes of sir horace wilson the same didnt hold though for his newfound friends that he should be friends with mps still amazed him if the wind had blown rudolf hess parachute a few fields over odds were hed still be a senior noncom today odds were id be happier too he muttered that however was easier to say than to prove he might be fighting the russians right this minute and wondering how the hell his country came to make the big switch as things had worked out he bloody well knew how whether he was better off knowing was a different question somebodyd once said you didnt want to look too closely at what went into making sausages or politics walsh was damned if he could remember who the bright bastard was any which way hed hit it spot on walsh walked down the street soaking up more war news from the times japanese troops had landed in the philippines the yanks were fighting now whether they liked it or not and more japanese troops had invaded french indochina more still were in malaya and others in the dutch east indies he scanned the paper for reports that theyd landed in madagascar or possibly peru he didnt see any he supposed that was good news other good news about japan seemed harder to find none of the stories said anything of japanese troops retreating wherever theyd landed they were moving forward if the same were true of english troops in russia walsh knew he still would have been disgusted at allying with hitlers germany but it wasnt true winter had frozen the front line solid except where the red army prodded at it berlin warsaw paris and london denied any serious soviet penetrations they might all have been telling the truth if they were it would have been a worlds first for radio berlin with a grimace walsh chucked the paper into a rubbish bin the nazis had a particularly nasty radio traitor an irishman named william joyce who was usually called lord hawhaw because of the posh affected accent he could put on lots of people listened to him though few took him seriously ever since the big switch hed been broadcasting variations on the theme of i told you so it made walsh want to chuck a rock or a pint mug at the wireless set every time the louses voice came out of it hed just turned away from the bin when he noticed the skinny fellow with the fawn fedora and the big ears hed seen the man a couple of times before as he walked through london he hadnt paid much attention to him london was the biggest city of the world and full of people now he wondered if he was being followed well he could find out he walked rapidly down the street and turned a corner then he stood in front of a shop window pretending to admire a display of wellingtons sure as hell here came the little pitcher with the big ears he jammed on the brakes when he saw walsh going nowhere fast walsh turned away from the wellies and ambled on as if he hadnt a care in the world he rounded another corner this next block had exactly what he was looking for a deep doorway in which he could stand and wait he didnt have to wait long the little man walked past him then stopped in dismay when he realized he no longer had his target in his sights he turned aroundand there stood walsh right behind him hello chum walsh said almost pleasantly do we know each other not to my knowledge the little man answered sounding nearly as affected as lord hawhaw but his ears betrayed him they flamed red seeing that told walsh he wasnt imagining things then why are you following me he demanded even though the strangers ears went redder yet he said im sure i dont know what youre talking about and im bloody sure you do if walsh clouted the bugger right here a bobby would bring him up on charges and that wouldnt be so good he deliberately kept his hands in the pockets of his civilian topcoat go tell whoevers paying you that im wise to him and hed damn well better leave me alone from here on out the little man licked his lips you dont know who youre messing with mate he said trying for bravado hell i dont you can tell that to sir horace himself by jesus walsh said this time the little mans ears went white as if hed rubbed them with crushed ice he wasted no more time trading words with alistair walsh instead he ran off like a fox pursued by a prime pack of hounds cor a cockney voice said from in back of walsh yer didnt arf put the fear o god in im did yer whatever i gave him he deserves worse walsh said later that day he met ronald cartland and some of the other insurgent mps at a pub not far from the palace of westminster when he described his shadow cartland whistled thoughtfully i do believe ive made the acquaintance of that particular gentleman he said knocking back the whiskey in his glass he gets his pay from scotland yard bleeding hell walsh burst out theyre making it into the gestapo then he had no warrant from a judge to give him the right to follow the government has no warrant for worse things than that cartland said ah well they spy on us we spy on them they diddle us we diddle them the games not all onesided not by a long chalk one of cartlands comrades in insurgency did his best to wax philosophical philosophy didnt appeal to alistair walsh they tell people what to do they tell the blasted country what to do and the blasted country damned well does it and we we sit around in pubs and complain oh we do rather more than that cartland said we do a good deal more than that as a matter of fact id tell you more but the walls have ears if scotland yard tapped telephones if it used operatives to follow the likes of exsergeant walsh no doubt it could and would plant microphones in the public houses the insurgents frequented god help the poor blighter whos got to wade through all the other drivel another mp began before he wades through our drivel cartlands interruption neatly capped him talk is cheap walsh said weve got to take the country back from them is what weve got to do by the way they eyed him he might have been something escaped from a zoo or then again he might not theres been no successful coup detat here since cartland said in musing tones maybe its high time for another one maybe its past time walsh said and he might not have been such a strange beast after all even before the nazis took over german bureaucracy had been among the most formidable in europe german functionaries didnt invent pseudorational reasons for denying requests that was a french game they didnt casually lose or forget about papers the way their italian counterparts were known to do once a paper landed in a german file it was there forevermore and ready to be retrieved at a moments notice efficiency before the nazis took over sarah goldmans father had taught her to admire germanic efficiency he hadnt altogether changed his mind even when that efficiency began to be aimed at him sarah now sarah had a different opinion the downside to german bureaucracy was that everything had to be perfectly aligned before anything moved if a signature was missing if a permission was not in place if a rubber stamp was applied so that a few millimeters of colored ink came down outside the box officially designated for them whatever you were trying to achieve ground to a halt until the defect could be remedied when you were trying to get married that wore on the nerves even more than it did any other time sarah was convinced it did anyhow the real trouble was the nazis didnt want jews getting married to begin with they wanted fewer jews in germany not more of them but damn them they werent altogether stupid they recognized that jews denied the right to marry would cohabit without benefit of ceremony and registration and would then produce more little jews in spite of everything and so they didnt deny them the right to marry they just made it as hard as they possibly could after yet another infuriating and fruitless afternoon wandering the corridors of munsters city hall sarah trudged home readyeagerto bite nails in half those rotten filthy pigdogs she snarled to anyone who would listen which meant her mother and father that crazy kafka in austria saw all of this foolishness coming right after the last war her father said he couldnt get his stories published people thought they were impossible nonsense everybody laughed at him but hed have the last laugh now if he were still alive was he a jew did they kill him for being a jew sarah asked he was a jew all right but thats not what killed him father answered he had consumption and he died of it he died young poor devil or maybe he wouldnt have wanted to live to see that he knew what he was talking about after all sarah had no way to guess about that she said for all the trouble theyre putting me through youd think i was marrying an aryan you wouldnt have any trouble with them then mother said huh sarah replied theyd tell you no and that would be that father nodded new marriages between jews and aryans are as verboten as jews serving in the wehrmacht we cant pollute the state with our blood and we cant shed our blood for the state either he still sounded bitter about that one of the clerks asked me for a certificate showing my aryan bloodlines sarah said he got mad when i couldnt give him one even though i had the jewish star right where i was supposed to she patted the front of her ratty coat even brown coal was in short supply for jews and the inside of the house got almost as cold as the outside all the goldmans wore plenty of clothes all the time too bad you couldnt father said ive heard there are some jews whove bought themselves an aryan pedigree im only sorry i dont have the connections to do it myself or the money mother put in or that he agreed i dont want to be an aryan i just want to be what i am and not have people hate me on account of it sarah said is that too much to ask for i didnt used to think so i was a grown man before i had to wonder these days though the answer seems to be yesit is too much to ask for samuel goldman said they took over not long before my thirteenth birthday sarah said no need to wonder who they were i dont even know what its like being a grownup without laws against me neither did my greatgrandfathers but the laws against them werent as bad as these and they came off one by one instead of getting piled on again and again father sighed i used to believe in progress i really did now now i wonder how can you help wondering you think its progress that a professor of ancient history and classics at the university should become one of munsters finest pavement repairers mother said sarah stared at her father was usually the one who came out with those sardonic gibes mother was sunnierexcept all of a sudden she wasnt anymore father chuckled selfconsciously you give me too much credit sweetheart if you dont believe me ask my gang boss if im anything more than one of munsters slightly below average pavement repairers id be amazed he turned back to sarah so what did the clerk say when you couldnt give him the piece of paper that would have made his heart go pitterpat i told him i was a jew like i said he could already see i was but i told him anyhow good never underestimate the power of human stupidity and then then he told me hed have to talk withto consult with he saidhis superior so he could get orders about what to do and he slammed down the brass bars in front of his window thing and he went away and he didnt come back hell be there tomorrow mother said i know sarah was anything but delighted that means i have to go back there again too just what i want is isidor having as much trouble getting his permission father asked he was the last time i talked to him a couple of days ago sarah still wondered whether shed done the right thing when she said yes even though she and isidor pleased each other in bed or wherever else they could find a little privacy she couldnt make herself believe they had a grand passion and wasnt that what marriage was supposed to be about she made herself finish answering he makes it sound as though hes having more tsuris than i am well youre prettier than he is father said if you think that doesnt make a difference youre crazy it shouldnt hanna goldman said which wasnt what i said her husband replied and so it wasnt the nazis are harder on jewish men than they are on women sarah said they havent thrown mother and me into a labor gang for instance theyre soft on women any way you look at it father said from bits and pieces ive heard the other countries that are fighting have put a lot more women into war plants than the reich has kinder kuche kirche mother said with no irony a microphone was likely to pick up that was what the nazis wanted out of women all right children cooking and going to church anything else anything more was modern and degeneratetwo words that often marched side by side in national socialist propaganda it will be interesting to see how long they can keep that up if the war against the russians drags on and on father might have been talking about a bacteriologists experiment with cultures of germs growing on agaragar in petri dishes but he wasnt the nazis experimented with human beings with whole countries with whole continents so did the communists maybe the war would show that one bunch of those gangsters or the other was wrong maybe it would end up showing that both bunches of gangsters were wrong it looked that way to sarah which proved what exactly she could almost hear her fathers dry voice asking the question they might be wrong but they were running things and the past eight years shed seen without any room for doubt that who had the whip hand carried more weight than who happened to be right nobodyd come looking for adalbert stoss nobodyd come looking for anyone using another name either as far as theo hossbach was concerned sometimeshell oftenthe very best thing that could happen was nothing at all hed considered telling adi it would be smart not to play football any more for fear of giving himself away but adi had thought of that for himself besides telling him not to play didnt have a prayer of working whenever a match was on the panzer men clamored for him because he played so well how was he supposed to say no to them when they did so theo did what theo did best he kept his mouth shut he didnt see the munich man whod recognized adi from a munster football pitch again maybe the fellowd stopped a mortar bomb with his face maybe his unit had got shipped hundreds of kilometers away to shore up the line against russian counterattacks from the south maybe maybe a million things but that landser wouldnt be the only one sooner or later somebody else would work out whoand more to the point whatadi was it might not matter despite the nazis best efforts not everybody cared theo certainly didnt too many people did though it also might not matter another way adi might end up slightly dead or more than slightly before any snoopy germans cared about who he was if he did theo had much too good a chance of ending up dead with him the russians didnt really know how to fight with panzers all the same they had a lot of them and they kept on trying not only that but almost all of their machines mounted better guns and armor than a panzer ii and if the ivans didnt do for the aging machines crew the russian winter was liable to take care of it theo had never dreamt he would have to build a fire under the engine compartment to thaw out the lubricants before the panzers engine would turn over you risked setting the panzer on fire and wrecking it you also risked drawing ivans with the flames but if you didnt build that fire there you were stuck in the snow without a prayer of starting and so morning after freezing morning theo helped get the beast going any way he could so did adi like any soldier worth his boots he pissed and moaned about it too i bet the russians dont have to put up with this shit he grumbled chopping wood almost as fine as kindling the less gasoline they had to pour over the fuel to get it burning the better sergeant witt threw a match on the fire such were the privileges of a panzer commandernot that there werent plenty of days when hed done his own share of chopping wood and then some flames leaped up fortunately not too high all three panzer men huddled close to the fire soaking up as much warmth as they could after a bit the gasoline heated the wood so it dried out and caught too now if we had some sausages to roast for breakfast witt said then wed be going from bed to wurst adi put in witt groaned theo winced hed loathe himself forever if he turned in a man for being a jew for a pun like that though who could blame him the panzer commander said dont be more ridiculous than you can help whens the last time you slept in a bed that brothel they set up for us only i wasnt sleeping adi said i should hope not witt studied the fire why dont you climb in and see if you can get her running that sounded like a polite request which was the way a good panzer crew worked together it was in fact an order adi took it as such that he said right sergeant instead of zu befehl changed things not a bit he scrambled up and into the drivers position theo hoped the selfstarter would fire up the engine if not theyd have to crank ithard labor even in frigid weather and labor that could break your arm if you werent careful when the engine did catch grinding noises came from the starter as they would have from a car with a low battery witt rolled his eyes theo swallowed a sigh holding a charge when your battery cells froze up was no fun either adi tried again the grinding noise was louder this time and went on longer a cough a bang and the maybach engine burst into fullthroated life the exhaust blatting out of the tailpipes was the sweetest thing theod smelled this morningthough he did still yearn for sausages he paused for a moment atop the panzer ii before sliding down into the radiomans seat the morning might be cold but it was clear sunrise would come soon the eastern sky near the horizon held no color at allnot gray not white not blue it was as if god had left the windowshade up a little bit and let a mere man get a glimpse of the nothing that lay beyond the edge of the universe given russian vastness that didnt seem so absurd as it would have back in germany theo took his place and closed the hatch behind him with more relief than usual with the engine growling right behind him theo soon stopped freezing before long he started sweating instead a panzer man had only two temperatures too cold and too hot so it often seemed anyhow the panzer company picked up a battalion of infantry half a kilometer to the north and advanced on a large village or small town that was supposed to hold a red army garrison the place did too mortar bombs started falling near the panzers as they approached fragments of redhot metal clattered off the panzer iis sides witt hastily ducked down into the turret and slammed the hatch shut what were those bombs doing to the landsers who loped between the panzers the poor bastards had no armored shelters into which they could retreat then again they also didnt have to worry about antipanzer guns theo supposed it evened out if you were at the front you got the shitty end of the stick no matter how you fought as usual once the ivans dug in somewhere they didnt feel like leaving sergeant witt fired the panzer iis main armament several times and squeezed off burst after burst from the coaxial machine gun that and the panzer commanders occasional obscenities were as much as theo knew about the details of the fighting enemy bullets and more fragments rang from the panzers armored hide nothing big enough to get through hit the machine theos missing finger twinged even though it wasnt there phantom pain the docs called it he knew what happened when a panzer brewed up if you were luckyand he had beenyou bailed out then the enemy shot at you as if you were a landser that was how theo had got hurt he hadnt had anything with which to shoot back a submachine gun hung on brackets near the radio set now yes if he was bailing out again with the panzer on fire though he doubted hed worry about taking the schmeisser along regiment kept relaying orders to the panzer company theo dutifully passed them on to hermann witt the panzer commander laughed at some swore at others and ignored almost all of them if those shitheads were up here with us theyd know better than to sound like a bunch of jackasses he said you hope theo answered adi let out a sudden warning shout left fast bastard with a molotov cocktail witt had no time to traverse the turret he popped up through the top hatch like a jackinthebox he didnt forget his schmeisser a long burst from it sent cartridge cases of yet another caliber clanking down onto the fighting compartments floor got the mother he said as he ducked down again theos heart descended from his throat burning gasoline dripping in through vision ports and under hatches no that wasnt his idea of a good time firing eased off theo knew what the quiet meant no live ivans left to fight one more village taken a few more hectares now belonged to the reich except for the red army soldiers still wandering across those snowy hectares with rifles in their hands and anger in their hearts russia went on and on and on could you ever come to the end of it germany and her allies seemed determined to try theo didnt know whether they could or not he didnt much care either he was alive hed probably stay that way a while longer he wouldnt get any more maimed than he was already for now that would do just fine harry turtledove is the awardwinning author of the
