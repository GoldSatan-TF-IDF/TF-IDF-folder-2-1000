united states finally became the last nation on earth to convert to the metric system its easy kilometer roughly equals a little more than mile meter is slightly more than a yard about inches the alexandria library truly existed and if it had remained unravished by wars and religious zealots it would have given us not only the knowledge of the egyptian greek and roman empires but those littleknown civilizations that rose and fell far beyond the shores of the mediterranean in ad christian emperor theodosius ordered all books and art depicting anything remotely pagan which included the teachings of the immortal greek philosophers burned and destroyed much of the collection was thought to have been secretly saved and spirited away what became of it or where it was hidden remains a mystery sixteen centuries later the precursors july ad a land unknown a small flickering light danced eerily through the black of the tunneled passageway a man dressed in a woolen tunic that dropped below his knees paused and raised an oil lamp above his head the dim glow illuminated a human figure inside a goldandcrystal casket while casting a grotesque wavering shadow against the smoothly cut wall behind the man in the tunic stared into the sightless eyes for a few moments and then he lowered the lamp and turned away he studied the long line of stationary forms that stood in deathlike silence so great in number they seemed to trail off into infinity before vanishing in the darkness of the long cavern junius venator moved on his strap sandals scraping over the uneven floor with a bare whisper of sound gradually the tunnel widened into a vast gallery soaring to a height of nearly thirty feet the domed ceiling was divided by a series of arches to give it structural strength gutters carved in the limestone spiraled down the walls so water seepage could run into deep drainage basins the walls were laced with cavities filled with thousands of strangelooking circular containers made of bronze except for the large wooden crates stacked uniformly in the center of the carved chamber the forbidding place might have been mistaken for the catacombs beneath rome venator peered at the copper tags attached to the crates checking their numbers against those on a scroll he flattened on a small folding table the air was dry and heavy and sweat began to course through the layers of dust that blanketed his skin two hours later satisfied everything was catalogued and in proper order he rolled up the scroll and slid it into a sash at his waist he took one final solemn look at the objects in the gallery and exhaled a sigh of regret he knew he would never see or touch them again tiredly he turned held the little lamp in front of him and retraced his steps through the tunnel venator was not a young man he was approaching his fiftyseventh year tired dragging steps reflected the weariness of a man who had no more heart for life and yet down deep he felt a glow of warmth itfrom an inner satisfaction the immense project was successfully completed the great burden lifted from his bent shoulders all that remained for him was to survive the long voyage to rome he passed four other tunnels leading off into the hill one had been blocked off by a great pile of rubble twelve slaves excavating deep inside had perished when the roof collapsed they were still in there crushed and buried where they fell venator felt little remorse better for them to have died quickly than suffer years of misery in the mines of the empire on a bare subsistence diet before dropping from disease or being abandoned when they were too old to work he took the far passage on the left and walked toward a pale glimmer of daylight the entrance shaft had been handcut inside a small grotto and measured twoandahalf meters in diameterjust wide enough to permit entry of the largest crates suddenly the sound of a faraway scream echoed down the shaft from the outside a frown of concern furrowed venators forehead and he increased his pace out of habit he squinted his eyes against the brilliance of the sun as he stepped into its light he hesitated and studied the camp that lay a short distance away on a sloping plain a group of roman legionaries stood around several barbarian women one young girl screamed again and tried to scramble away she almost broke through the cordon of soldiers but one of them grabbed her by her long flowing black hair he pulled her back and she stumbled to her knees in the coarse dirt a huge hardbitten character spied venator and approached the man was a giant standing a good full head above everyone else in camp with great shoulders and hips joined nearly as one and a pair of oakbeam arms ending in hands that dropped almost to his knees latinius macer a gaul was the chief overseer of the slaves he waved a greeting and spoke in a voice that was surprisingly highpitched is all in readiness he asked venator nodded the tally is finished you can seal off the entrance consider it done what is the disturbance in camp macer glanced at the soldiers peering through black cold eyes and spat on the ground stupid legionaries became restless and raided a village five leagues north of here the massacre was senseless at least forty barbarians were killed only ten were men the rest women and children and for no good reason no gold no booty worth mule dung returned with a few ugly women to gamble over little else venators face tensed were there any other survivors i was told two of the men escaped into the brush they will sound the alarm in other villages i fear severus has kicked a hornets nest severus macer spat the word in unison with another salvo of saliva that damned centurion and his lot do nothing but steep and drink our wine supply a pain in the buttocks to bring the lazy baggage along in my judgment they were hired to protect us venator reminded him from what macer demanded primitive heathen who eat insects and reptiles gather the slaves and seal off the tunnel quickly and make a good job of it the barbarians must not be able to dig through after we leave little fear of that from what ive seen no one around this cursed land has mastered the art of metalworking macer paused and pointed to the massive heap of excavated takings poised above the entrance to the shaft precariously held in place by a giant crib of logs once that falls you can stop worrying about your precious antiquities no barbarian will ever get to them not by scratching with his bare hands reassured venator dismissed the overseer and strode angrily toward the tent of domitius severus he passed the personal emblem of the military detachment a silver symbol of taurus the bull atop a lance and brushed aside the sentry who attempted to block his passage he found the centurion seated in a camp chair contemplating a naked unwashed barbarian woman who sat on her haunches uttering a chorus of strange vowel sounds she was young no more than fourteen severus was wearing a brief red tunic clasp over his left shoulder his bare arms were ornamented with two bronze bands fastened around his biceps they were the muscled arms of a soldier trained for the sword and shield severus did not bother to look up at venators sudden appearance this is how you pass your time domitius snapped venator his voice coldly sarcastic scorning gods will by raping a heathen child severus slowly turned his hard gray eyes to venator the day is too warm to listen to your christian tripe my god is more tolerant than your god true but you worship a pagan purely a matter of preference neither of us has met our gods face to face who is to say who is right christ was the son of the true god severus gave venator a look of exasperation you have invaded my privacy state your case and leave so you can ravage this poor heathen severus did not answer he rose grabbed the chanting girl by the arm and threw her roughly on his camp cot would you care to join me junius you may go first venator stared at the centurion a chill of fear ran through him the roman centurion who led an infantry unit was expected to be a hard master this man was merciless a savage our mission here is finished said venator macer and the slaves are preparing to seal off the storage cave we can strike camp and return to the ships eleven months tomorrow since we left egypt one more day to enjoy the local pleasures will not matter our mission was not to pillage the barbarians will seek revenge we are few they are many ill match my legionaries against any horde the barbarians can throw against us your men have grown soft as mercenaries they havent forgotten how to fight severus said with a confident smile but will they die for the honor of rome why should they why should any of us the great years of the empire have come and gone our once glorious city on the tiber has turned into a slum little roman blood runs in our veins most of my men are natives of the provinces i am a spaniard and you are greek junius in these chaotic days who can feel an ounce of loyalty toward an emperor who rules far to the east in a city none of us have ever seen no junius my soldiers will fight because they are professionals and because they are paid to fight it may be the barbarians will give them no choice well deal with that scum when the time comes better to avoid conflict i say we leave before dark venator was interrupted by a loud rumble that shook the ground he rushed from the tent and stared at the cliff wall the slaves had pulled the supports from under the crib releasing a thundering avalanche that plunged over the cave opening burying it beneath tons of massive boulders a great dust cloud erupted and spilled into the ravine the echoing rumble was followed by cheers from the slaves and legionnaires its done said venator his voice solemn his face weary the wisdom of the ages is safe severus came and stood beside him a pity the same cant be said for us venator turned if god grants us a smooth voyage home what have we to fear torture and execution said severus flatly we have defied the emperor theodosius does not forgive easily there will be no place for us to hide in the empire better we find refuge in a foreign land my wife and daughter they were to meet me at our family villa at antioch the emperors agents have probably intercepted them by now they are either dead or sold into slavery venator shook his head disbelievingly i have friends in power who will protect them until my return friends can be threatened and bought venators eyes widened in sudden defiance no sacrifice is too heavy for what we have achieved all would be for nothing if we did not return with a record and chart of the voyage severus was about to reply when he observed his second in command artofius noricus running up the slight grade toward the tent the young legionarys dark face glistened in the noonday heat and he was gesturing up at the edge of the low cliffs venator held up a hand to ward off the sun and stared upward his mouth pressed into a tight line the barbarians severus they have come to pay back the sack of their village it was as if the hills swarmed with ants over a thousand barbarian men and women stared down at the cruel intruders of their land they were armed with bows and arrows shields of leather hide and spears with chipped obsidian points some gripped clubs of rock tied to short wooden handles the men wore only waistcloths they stood in stony silence expressionless savage and as ominous as an approaching storm another force of barbarians has massed between us and our ships noricus shouted venator turned his face ashen this is the result of your stupidity severus his voice was vicious with anger you have killed us all then he dropped to his knees and began to pray your divinity will not turn the barbarians into sheep old man severus said sarcastically only the sword can provide deliverance he turned and took noricus by the arm and began issuing commands order the bugler to sound battle assembly tell latinius macer to arm the slaves form the men in a tight fighting square well march in formation to the river bugler noricus threw a taut salute and ran for the center of the camp the infantry unit of sixty soldiers quickly formed in a hollow square the syrian archers took their place on the flanks between the armed slaves facing outward while the romans formed on front and rear screened in the center were venator and his small staff of egyptian and greek aides and a three man medical unit the main infantry weapons of fourthcentury rome were the gladius a doubleedged pointed sword eightytwo centimeters long and the pilum a twometer throwing and thrusting spear for protection and armor the soldiers wore an iron helmet with hinged cheek pieces that tied under the chin with a strap and looked like a jockey cap with the brim turned backward a cuirass made up of overlapping metal plates encircling the body and covering the shoulders and a guard worn over the shins called a greavetheir defensive tool was an oval shield made out of laminated wood instead of rushing in to attack the barbarians took their time and slowly encircled the column at first they tried to draw the soldiers out of the solid lines by sending a few men up close who shouted strange words and made threatening gestures but their heavily outnumbered foe did not panic and run as expected centurion severus was too much a veteran to feel fear he stepped ahead of his front line and surveyed the terrain crawling with barbarians he waved derisively at them this was not the first time he had faced overwhelming odds in a fight severus had volunteered for the legion when he was sixteen he advanced from common soldier winning several decorations for distinguished bravery in battles against the goths along the danube and the franks at the rhine after his retirement he had become a mercenary hiring out to the highest bidder in this case junius venator severus had unswerving confidence in his legionaries the sun gilded their helmets and unsheathed swords they were strong fighters and battlehardened men who knew victory without ever enduring defeat most of the livestock including his horse had died on the grueling voyage from egypt so he walked at the head of the square turning every few steps so as to keep a constant wary eye on the enemy with a roar that rose and broke like crashing surf the barbarians rushed down the sunbaked incline and fell on the romans the first wave was decimated pierced by the long throwing spears of the soldiers and the arrows from the syrian archers the second wave burst forward crashed into the thin ranks and were cut down like wheat before a scythe the gleaming swords dulled and turned red with barbarian blood driven by a stream of salty oaths and threatened by the scourging lash of latinius macer the slaves gave a good account of themselves and stood firm the formation moved forward at a crawl as the barbarians pressed from all sides fed by continuous reserves great red stains fanned on the dirt of the and slope more and more naked bodies dropped and crumpled lifeless those who surged from behind fought on their comrades corpses slicing bare feet on shattered weapons throwing flesh against the terrible shafts of iron that thrust into breasts and stomachs then falling on the death heap at close quarters they were no match for roman discipline the battle now took a different turn realizing they could make no headway against the swords and spears of the foreigners the barbarians pulled back and regrouped then they began shooting flights of arrows and throwing their crude spears while their women hurled rocks the romans closed shields over their heads like large tortoise shells and stoutly maintained their march for the river and the safety of their ships only the syrian archers were able to cause casualties among the barbarians there were not enough shields to go around for the slaves and they fought open and unprotected from the hail of missiles they were weakened from the long tiring voyage and the exhausting excavation of the cavern many fell and were left behind their bodies immediately stripped and horribly mutilated severus was an old hand at this style of fighting he had experienced it against the britons noting that his enemy was reckless and untrained he called a halt and ordered all weapons be dropped on the ground the barbarians taking it as a gesture of surrender were deceived into making a rash charge then at seveniss order the swords were snatched up and the romans counterattacked straddling two rocks the centurion swung his sword in almost measured metronomic strokes four barbarians dropped at his feet he knocked another one sprawling with the flat of his sword and slashed the throat of one who lunged against his side then the frenzied tide receded and the naked horde retreated out of handtohand range severus took advantage of the breathing spell to count his casualties out of sixty of his soldiers twelve lay dead or were dying fourteen more sustained various wounds the slaves had suffered the worst more than half were killed or missing he approached venator who was binding up a gash on one arm with a torn piece of his tunic the greek wise man still carried his precious tally sheet securely under his sash still with us old man venator looked up his eyes brimming with fear mixed with determinationyoull die before me sevenis is that a dream or a prophecy does it matter none of us will see the empire again severus did not reply the fight abruptly resumed as the barbarians unleashed another discharge of spears and rocks that filled the air and thumped against the shields he quickly returned to his place in front of the depleted square the romans fought viciously but their numbers were dwindling almost all of the syrian archers were down the square was closing in on itself as the withering assault continued unabated the survivors many of them wounded were exhausted and suffered from the heat and the attack their swords began to sag and they switched them from one hand to the other the barbarians were equally exhausted and taking huge losses yet they stubbornly contested every foot of the gradual slope to the neverhalf a dozen of their corpses could be counted around every slain legionary the mercenaries bodies pierced by scores of arrows looked like pincushions the giant overseer macer was struck in one knee and the thigh he stayed on his feet but could not keep up with the moving formationhe dropped behind and soon attracted a group of twenty barbarians who swiftly surrounded him he turned at bay waved his sword like a windmill and cut three of them completely in two before the rest drew back and hesitated in respect of his awesome strength he shouted and motioned for them to come close and fight the barbarians had learned their lesson the hard way and refused to be drawn into armslength combat they stood back and launched a torrent of spears at macer in seconds blood gushed from five wounds on his body he grasped the shafts and pulled out the points a barbarian ran close and hurled his spear striking macer in the throat slowly he toppled over from the loss of blood and dropped into the dust the barbarian women rushed in like a pack of mad wolves and stoned him to pulp only a high sandstone bluff separated the romans from the rivers edge beyond it seemed that the sky had suddenly turned from blue to orange then a column of smoke rolled upward black and heavy and the wind brought the smell of burning wood shock gripped venator quickly replaced with despair the ships he shouted the barbarians are attacking the ships the bloodied slaves panicked and made a suicidal dash for the river the barbarians rushed in from the flanks and viciously assaulted them several of the slaves threw down their arms in surrender and were slaughtered the rest tried to make a fight of it from behind a grove of small trees but their pursuers cut them down to a man the dust of the sage land became their shroud the dry brush their sepulcher severus and his surviving legionaries fought their way to the summit of the bluff and suddenly halted oblivious to the murderous onslaught raging around them and stared in stunned fascination at the disaster below pillars of fire rose and merged into a coil of smoke that unwound and reached upward like a serpent the fleet their only hope of escape was burning along the rivers edge the enormous grain ships they had commandeered in egypt were being incinerated under great sheets of rolling flame venator pushed his way through the front rank and stood beside severus the centurion was silent blood and sweat stained his tunic and armor he gazed in frustration at the sea of flame and smoke seeing the blazing sails disintegrate in a maelstrom of sparks the dreadful reality of defeat branded in his eyes the ships had been anchored on the shoreline and lay naked and exposed a force of barbarians had engulfed the small body of seamen and torched everything that could burn only a small merchant ship had escaped the conflagration its crew somehow beating off their attackers four seamen were struggling to raise the sails while several of their shipmates strained at the oars in their struggle to reach the safety of deep water venator tasted the falling soot and the bitterness of calamity in his mouth even the sky itself seemed red to him he stood there in helpless rage the faith he had placed in his carefully executed plan to safeguard the priceless knowledge of the past died in his heart a hand was laid on his shoulder and he turned and stared into the strange expression of cold amusement on severuss face i had always hoped to die said the centurion drunk on good wine while lying on a good woman only god can choose a mans death venator replied vaguely i rather think luck plays a heavy role a waste a terrible waste at least your goods are safely hidden said severus and those escaping sailors will tell the scholars of the empire what we did here no said venator shaking his head no one will believe the fanciful tales of ignorant seamen he turned and gazed back at the low hills in the distance it will remain lost for all time can you swim venators eyes returned to severus swim ill give you five of my best men to cut a passage to the water if you think you can reach the ship i im not certain he studied the waters of the river and the widening gap between the ship and shoreline use a piece of debris for a raft if you have to severus said harshly but hurry well all be meeting our gods in a few more minutes what about you this hill is as good a place as any to make a stand venator embraced the centurion god be with you better he walk with you severus turned and swiftly selected five soldiers who were unwounded and ordered them to protect venator on their run for the river then he went about the business of reforming his ravaged unit for a final defense the few legionaries clustered around venatorthen they made their dash for the river shouting and hacking their way through a loose line of startled barbarians they cut and slashed like madmen on a bloody rampage venator was exhausted beyond feeling but his sword never hesitated his step never faltered he was a scholar who had become an executioner he was long past the point of no return there was only grim stubbornness left now any fear of dying had disappeared they fought through the mad whirl of fiery heat venator could smell the odor of burnt flesh he threw off another shred of his tunic and covered his nose and mouth as they fought through the smoke the soldiers went down protecting venator to their last breath suddenly his feet were in the water and he sprang forward diving the instant it rose above his knees he glimpsed a spar that had fallen free of a burning ship and feverishly paddled toward it not daring to look back the soldiers still on the bluff countered everything that was thrown at them the barbarians dodged and chanted defiance while probing for a weak spot in the roman defenses four times they grouped in mass formations and charged and four times they were hurled back but not before they took down a few more of the exhausted legionaries the square became a small knot as the few survivors closed ranks and fought shoulder to shoulder bloody heaps of dead and dying carpeted the land their blood flowing in streams down the slopes and still the romans resisted the battle had been raging without letup for nearly two hours but the barbarians were attacking with the same intensity as at the beginning they began to smell victory and massed for one last charge severus broke off the arrow shafts that protruded from his exposed flesh and fought on barbarian corpses carpeted the ground around him only a handful of his legionaries remained at his side one by one they perished sword in hand buried beneath swarms of rocks arrows and spears severus was the last to fall his legs folded under him and his arm could no longer lift his sword he swayed on his knees made a futile effort to rise then looked up to the sky and muttered softly mother father carry me to your arms as if in answer to his plea the barbarians rushed forward and savagely clubbed him until death released his agony in the water venator grimly clutched the spar and kicked his legs in a desperate attempt to reach the retreating ship his effort was in vain the rivers current and a puff of wind pushed the merchant vessel further away he shouted to the crew and frantically waved his free hand a group of seamen and a young girl holding a dog stood on the stern staring at him without compassion making no move to bring the ship around they continued their escape down river as if venator did not exist they were abandoning him he realized helplessly there would be no rescue he beat a fist on the spar in anguish and sobbed uncontrollably convinced that his god had forsaken him finally he turned his eyes toward shore and gazed at the carnage and devastation the expedition was gone vanished in a nightmare part i october heathrow airport london no one paid the slightest attention to the pilot as he slipped around the crowd of media correspondents who overflowed from the interior of the vip lounge nor did any of the passengers sitting in the waiting area of gate notice that he carried a large duffel bag instead of a briefcase he kept his head down eyes straight ahead carefully avoiding the battery of tv cameras aimed at a attractive woman with a smooth brown face and compelling coalblack eyes who was the hub of the noisy activity the pilot quickly walked through the enclosed boarding ramp and halted in front of a pair of airport security agents they wore plain clothes and blocked the aircraft door he threw a casual wave and tried to shoulder his way past them but a hand firmly grasped his arm one moment captain the pilot stopped a questioning but friendly expression on his darkskinned face he seemed idly amused at the inconvenience his olivebrown eyes had a gypsylike piercing quality about them the nose had been broken more than once and a long scar ran down the base of his face he stood nearly six feet four inches thickset with a slightly rounded paunch seasoned confident and standing straight in a tailored uniform he looked like any one of ten thousand airline pilots who captained international passenger jets he removed his identification from a breast pocket and handed it to the security agent carrying vips this trip he asked innocently the british guard correct immaculately dressed nodded a body of united nations people returning to new york including the new secretarygeneral hala kamil yes hardly the job for a woman sex didnt prove a hindrance for prime minister thatcher she wasnt in water over her head kamil is an astute lady shell do all right providing moslem fanatics from her own country dont blow her away replied the pilot in a decided american accent the britisher gave him a strange look indeed but made no further comment as he compared the photo on the id card with the face before him and read the name aloud captain dale lemk any problem no simply preventing any the guard replied flatly lemk extended his arms do you want to frisk me too not necessary a pilot would hardly hijack his own airplane but we must check your credentials to be certain youre a genuine crew member im not wearing this uniform for a costume party may we see your carry bag be my guest he set the blue nylon bag on the floor and opened it the second agent lifted out and riffled the pages of the standard pilots aircraft and flight operations manuals and then held up a mechanical device with a small hydraulic cylinder mind telling us what this is an actuator arm for an oilcooling door it stuck in the open position and our maintenance people at kennedy asked me to handcarry it home for inspection the agent poked at a bulky object tightly packed on the bottom of the bag hello what do we have here then he looked up a curious expression in his eyes since when do airline pilots carry parachutes lemk laughed my hobby is skydiving whenever i have an extended layover i jump with friends at croydon i dont suppose you would consider jumping from a jetliner not from one flying five hundred knots at thirtyfive thousand feet over the atlantic ocean the agents exchanged satisfied glances the duffel bag was closed and the id card was passed back sorry to have delayed you captain lemk i enjoyed the chat have a good flight to new york thank you lemk ducked into the plane and entered the cockpit he locked the door and switched off the cabin lights so any casual observer could not view his movements through the windows from the concourse above in wellrehearsed sequence he knelt behind the seats pulled a small flashlight from his coat pocket and raised a trapdoor leading to the electronics bay below the cockpit a compartment that was named by some longforgotten joker as the hell hole he dropped down the ladder into pure darkness underscored by the murmur of the flight attendants voices as they prepared the main cabin for boarding and the thump of the luggage being loaded in the rear by the baggage handlers lemk reached up and tugged the duffel bag down after him and switched on the penlight a glance at his watch told him he had about five minutes before his flight crew arrived in an exercise he had practiced nearly fifty times he retrieved the actuator arm from the bag and connected it to a miniature device he had concealed in his flight cap he attached the assembled unit to the hinges of a small access door to the outside used by groundmaintenance mechanics then he laid out the parachute when his first and second officers arrived lemk was sitting in the pilots seat his face buried in an information manual they exchanged casual greetings and began running through their preflight check routine neither the copilot nor the engineer perceived that lemk seemed unusually quiet and withdrawn their senses might have been sharper if they had known this was to be their last night on earth inside the crowded lounge hala kamil faced a forest of microphones and glaring camera lights with seemingly inexhaustible patience she fielded the barrage of questions thrown at her by the mob of inquisitive reporters few asked about her sweep through europe and the nonstop meetings with heads of state most probed for insights on the imminent overthrow of her egyptian government by moslem fundamentalists the extent of the turmoil was unclear to her fanatical mullahs led by akhmad yazid an islac law scholar had ignited religious passions that ran through the millions of destitute villagers of the nile and the impoverished masses in the slums of cairo highranking officers in the army and air force were openly conspiring with the islamic radicals to remove the recently installed president nadav hasan the situation was extremely volatile but hala had received no uptotheminute intelligence from her government and she was forced to keep her answers vague and ambiguous on the surface hala appeared infinitely poised and sphinxlike as she replied calmly without emotion inwardly she floated between confusion and spiritual shock she felt distant and alone as though uncontrollable events were swirling around someone else someone beyond help for whom she could only feel sorrow she could have posed for the painted portrait bust of queen nefertiti in the berlin museum they both possessed the same longstemmed neck delicate features and haunting look fortytwo years old slim black eyes flawless tawny complexion and long jetblack silken hair brushed straight and falling down to her shoulders she stood five feet eleven inches in heels and her lithe shapely body was enhanced by a designer suit with pleated skirt hala had enjoyed the attentions of four lovers over the years but had never married a husband and children seemed foreign to her she refused to spare the time for longterm attachments and making love held little more ecstasy for her than buying a ticket and attending the ballet as a child in cairo where her mother was a teacher and her father a shoemaker she had spent every minute of her free time sketching and digging in the ancient ruins within bicycle distance of her home a gourmet cook and an artist with a phd in egyptian antiquities she had landed one of the few jobs open to moslem women as researcher for the ministry of culture with great individual effort and prodigious energy she then successfully fought islamic discrimination and worked up to director of antiquities and later head of the department of informationshe caught the eye of then president mubarak who asked her to serve on the egyptian delegation to the united nations general assembly five years later hala was named vice chairman when javier prez de cudllar stepped down in the middle of his second tour during an upheaval when five moslemrun nations withdrew from the charter during a controversy over demands for religious reform because the men in line ahead of her refused the job she was appointed to serve as secretarygeneral in a tenuous hope she might mend the widening cracks in the organizations foundation now with her own government teetering on the brink of disintegration there was a good chance she might become the first chief representative of the united nations without a good try an aide came up and whispered in her ear she nodded and held up one hand im told the plane is ready to take off she said ill take one more question hands flew up and a dozen queries filled the air at once hala pointed to a man standing at the doorway holding a tape recorder leigh hunt of bbc madame kamil if akhmad yazid replaces president hasans democratic government with an islamic republic will you return to egypt i am a moslem and an egyptian if my countrys leaders regardless of the government in power wish me to come home i will comply even though akhmad yazid has called you a heretic and a traitor yes hala replied evenly if hes half as fanatical as the ayatollah khomeini you might be running into an execution would you care to comment hala shook her head smiled gracefully and said i must leave now thank you a circle of security guards escorted her from the throng of reporters and onto the boarding ramp her aides and a large delegation from unesco were already seated four members of the world bank were sharing a bottle of champagne and conversing in low tones in the pantry the main cabin smelled of jet fuel and beef wellington wearily hala fastened the catch of her seat belt and glanced out the window there was a light mist and the blue lights along the taxi strips blurred into a dull glow before disappearing completely she removed her shoes closed her eyes and gratefully dozed off before the stewardess could offer her a cocktail after waiting its turn behind the warm exhaust of a twa united nations charter flight finally moved onto the end of the runway when takeoff clearance came down from the control tower lemk eased the thrust levers forward and the boeing b rolled over the damp concrete and rose into the soggy air as soon as he reached his cruising altitude of meters and engaged the autopilot lemk unbuckled his belt and rose from his seat a call of nature he said heading for the cabin door his second officer and engineer a frecklefaced man with sandy hair smiled without turning from the instrument panel ill wait right here lemk forced a short laugh and stepped into the passenger cabin the flight attendants were preparing the meal service the aroma of beef wellington came stronger than ever he made a gesture and drew the chief steward aside can i get you anything captain just a cup of coffee replied lemk but dont bother i can manage no bother the steward stepped into the pantry and poured a cup there is one other thing sir the company has asked us to take part in a government sponsored meteorology study when were twentyeight hundred kilometers out from london im going to drop down to fifteenhundred meters for about ten minutes while we record wind and temperature readings then return to our normal altitude hard to believe the company went along i wish my bank account totaled what it will cost in lost fuel you can bet those cheap bastards in top management will send a bill to washington ill inform the passengers when the time comes so they wont be alarmed you might also announce that if anyone spots any lights through the windows theyll be coming from a fishing fleet ill see to it lemks eyes swept the main cabin pausing for an instant on the sleeping form of hala kamil before moving on did it strike you that security was unusually heavy lemk asked conversationally of those reporting told me scotland yard caught wind of a plot to assassinate the secretarygeneral they act as though theres a terrorist plot under every rock i had to show my identification while they searched my flight bag the steward shrugged what the hell its for our protection as well as the passengers lemk motioned down the aisle at least none of them looks like a hijacker not unless theyve taken to wearing threepiece suits just to be on the safe side ill keep the cockpit door locked call me on the intercom only if its important will do lemk took a sip of his coffee set it aside and returned to the cockpit the first officer his copilot was gazing out the side window at the lights of wales to the north while behind him the engineer was occupied with computing fuel consumption lemk turned his back to the others and slipped a small case from the breast pocket of his coat he opened it and readied a syringe containing a highly lethal nerve agent called sarin then he faced his crew again and made a fumbling step as if losing his balance and grabbed the arm of the second officer for support sorry frank i tripped on the carpet frank hartley wore a bushy mustache had thin gray hair and a long handsome face he never felt the needle enter his shoulder he looked up from the gauges and lights of his engineers panel and laughed easily youre going to have to lay off the sauce dale i can fly straight lemk replied goodnaturedly its walking that gives me a hard time hartley opened his mouth as if to say something but suddenly a blank expression crossed his face he shook his head as if to clear his vision then his eyes rolled upward and he went limp leaning his body against hartley so the engineer would not fall to one side lemk withdrew the syringe and quickly replaced it with another i think something is wrong with frank jerry oswald swung around in the copilots seat a big man with the pinched features of a desert prospector he stared questioningly what ails him better come take a look oswald twisted his bulk past the seat and bent over hartley lemk jabbed the needle and pushed the plunger but oswald felt the prick what the hell was that he blurted whirling around and gazing dumbly at the hypodermic needle in lemks hand he was far heavier and more muscular than hartley and the toxin did not take effect immediately his eyes widened in sudden comprehension and then he lurched forward gripping lemk by the neck youre not dale lemk he snarled why are you made up to look like him the man who called himself lemk could not have answered if he wanted the great hands were choking the breath out of him crammed against a bulkhead by the immense weight of oswald he tried to gasp out the words of a lie but no words could come he rammed his knee into the engineers groin the only reaction was a short grunt blackness began to creep into the corners of his vision then slowly the pressure was released and oswald reeled backward his eyes became terrorstricken as he realized he was dying he looked at lemk in confused hatred with the few final beats left in his heart he swung his fist landing a solid blow into lemks stomach lemk drifted to his knees dazed the breath punched out of him he watched as if looking through fog as oswald fell against the pilots seat and crashed to the cockpit floor lemk slid to a sitting position and rested for a minute gasping for air massaging the pain in his gut he rose awkwardly to his feet and listened for any curious voices coming from the other side of the door the main cabin seemed quiet none of the passengers or flight crew had heard anything unusual above the monotonous whine of the engines he was drenched in sweat by the time he manhandled oswald into the copilots seat and strapped him in hartleys safety belt was already fastened so lemk ignored him at last he settled behind the control column on the pilots side of the cockpit and plotted the aircrafts position fortyfive minutes later lemk banked the plane from its scheduled flight path to new york onto a new heading toward the frozen arctic it is one of the most barren spots on the earth and one never seen or experienced by tourists in the last hundred years only a handful of explorers and scientists have trod its forbidding landscape the sea along the rugged shore is frozen for all but a few weeks each year and in the early fall temperatures hover around degrees the cold sides for the long winter months and even in summer dazzling sunshine can be replaced by an impenetrable gale in less than an hour yet shadowed by scarred mountains and swept by a constant wind the magnificent desolation in the upper reaches of ardencaple fjord on the northeast coast of greenland was inhabited nearly two thousand years ago by a band of hunters radiocarbon dating on excavated relics indicated the site was occupied from ad to ad a short time span for the archaeological clock but they left behind twenty dwellings which had been preserved by the frigid ice a prefabricated aluminum structure had been airlifted by helicopter and assembled over the ancient village by scientists from the university of colorado a balky heating arrangement and foamglass insulation fought a lopsided battle against the cold but at least denied entry to the neverending wind moaning eerily around the outside walls the shelter also enabled an archaeological team to work the site into the beginning stages of winter lily sharp a professor of anthropology at colorado was oblivious to the cold that seeped into the covered village she rested on her knees on the floor of a singlefamily dwelling carefully scraping away the frozen earth with a small hand trowel she was alone and lost in deep concentration as she probed the distant past belonging to the prehistoric people they were seamammal hunters who spent the harsh arctic winters in dwellings dug partially into the ground with low walls of rock and turf roofs often supported by whale bones they entertained themselves with oil lamps passing the long dark months carving miniature sculptures out of driftwood ivory and antlers they had settled this part of greenland during the first centuries after christ then inexplicably at the height of their culture they pulled up stakes and vanished leaving behind a revealing cache of relics lilys perseverance paid off while the three men on the archaeology team relaxed after dinner in the hut that was their living quarters she had returned to the protected settlement and continued to excavate unearthing a length of caribou antler with twenty bearlike figures sculpted on its surface a delicately carved womans comb and a stone cooking pot suddenly lilys trowel clinked on something she repeated the movement and listened carefully fascinated she tapped again it was not the familiar sound from the edge of the trowel striking a rock though a bit flat it had a definite metallic ring to it she straightened and stretched her back strands of her dark red hair long and thick shining under the glare from the coleman lantern fell from under her heavy woolen cap her bluegreen eyes mirrored skeptical curiosity as she gazed at the tiny speck protruding from the charcoalblack earth a prehistoric people lived here she pondered they never knew iron or bronze lily tried to stay calm but a feeling of astonishment crept over her then excitement followed by urgency she missed the archaeologists fussbudget passion for prudence she scraped and dug furiously at the hardcrusted soil every few minutes she stopped and painstakingly brushed away the loose dirt with a small painters brush at last the artifact lay fully exposed she leaned over for a closer look staring in awe as it glimmered yellow under the bright white from the coleman lantern lily had excavated a gold coin a very old one by the look of the worn edges there was a tiny hole and a piece of rotted leather thong on one side suggesting that it had once been worn as a pendant or personal amulet she sat back and took a deep breath almost wanting to reach down and touch it five minutes later lily was still crouched there on her knees her mind trying to create a solution when abruptly the shelters door opened and a largebellied man with a blackwhiskered kindlylooking face stepped in from the cold accompanied by a swirl of snow he exhaled clouds of steam as he breathed his eyebrows and beard were matted with ice which made him look like some frozen monster from a sciencefiction movie until he broke into a great toothy smile it was dr hiram gronquist the chief archaeologist of the fourperson dig sorry to interrupt lily he said in his soft deep voice but youve been pushing too hard take a break come back to the hut warm up and let me pour you a good stiff brandy hiram said lily doing her best to stifle the excitement in her voice i want you to see something gronquist moved closer and knelt down beside her what have you found see for yourself gronquist fumbled for his reading glasses inside his parka and slid them over his red nose he bent over the coin until his face was only inches away and studied it from every angle after several moments he looked up at lily an amused twinkle in his eyes you putting me on lady lily looked at him sternly then relaxed and laughed oh my god you think i salted it youve got to admit its like finding a virgin in a bor dello cute he gave her a friendly pat on one knee congratulations this is a rare discovery how do you suppose it got here there isnt a workable gold deposit within a thousand miles and it certainly wasnt minted by the early inhabitants their level of development was only a notch above stone age the coin obviously came from another source at a later date how do you explain the fact it was buried with artifacts weve dated within a century either side of ad gronquist shrugged i cant whats your best guess asked lily off the top of my head id say the coin was probably traded or lost by a viking there is no record of vikings sailing this far north along the east coast said lily okay maybe eskimos from a more recent time frame traded goods with the norse settlements to the south and used this site to camp during hunting expeditions you know better hiram weve found no evidence of habitation after ad four hundred gronquist gave lily a scolding look you never give in do you we dont even have a date on the coin mike graham is an expert on ancient coins one of his specialties is dating sites around the mediterranean he might identify it wont cost us a nickel for an appraisal said gronquist agreeably come along mike can examine it while we have that brandy lily donned her heavy furlined gloves adjusted the hood of her parka and turned down the coleman gronquist switched on a flashlight and held the door open for her she stepped into the agony of the numbing cold and wind that groaned like a ghost in a churchyard the freezing air struck her exposed cheeks and made her shudder a reaction that always seemed to sneak up on her even though she should have been quite used to it by now she grasped the rope that led to the living quarters and groped along behind the protecting bulk of gronquist she stole a glance upward the sky was unclouded and the stars seemed to melt into one vast carpet of shimmering diamonds illustrating the barren mountains to the west and the sheet of ice that ran down the fjord to sea in the east the strange beauty of the arctic was a compelling mistress lily decided she could understand why men lost their souls to its spell after a thirtyyard hike through the dark they entered the storm corridor of their hut walked another ten feet and opened a second door to the living quarters inside to lily after the abominable cold outside it was like stepping inside a furnace the aroma of coffee caressed her nostrils like perfume and she immediately pulled off her parka and gloves and poured herself a cup sam hoskins necklength blond hair matching an enormous blond handlebar mustache was hunched over a drafting board a new york architect with a love for archaeology hoskins allowed two months a year out of his busy schedule to rough it on digs around the world he provided invaluable assistance by rendering detailed drawings of how the prehistoric village might have looked seventeen hundred years ago the other team member a lightskinned man with thinning sandy hair reclined on a cot reading a dogeared paperback novel lily couldnt remember seeing mike graham without an adventure book in one hand or stuffed in a coat pocket one of the leading field archaeologists in the country graham was as laid back as a mortician hey mike gronquist boomed take a look at what lily dug up he flipped the coin across the room lily gasped in shock but graham expertly snatched it out of the air and peered at the face after a moment he looked up his eyes narrowed doubtfully youre putting me on gronquist laughed heartily my exact words when i laid eyes on it no gag she excavated it at site eight graham pulled a briefcase from under his cot and retrieved a magnifying glass he held the coin under the lens examining it from every angle well whats the verdict lily asked impatiently incredible murmured graham captivated a gold miliarensia about thirteen and a half grams ive never seen one before theyre quite rare a collector would probably pay between six and eight thousand dollars for it who is the likeness on the face a standing figure of theodosius the great emperor of the roman and byzantine empires his position is a common motif found on the face of coins from that era if you look closely you can make out captives at his feet while his hands hold a globe and a labarum a labarum yes a banner bearing the greek letters xp and forming a kind of monogram meaning the the name of christ the emperor constantine adopted it after his conversion to christianity and it was handed down through his successors what do you make of the lettering on the reverse asked gronquist grahams eyeball enlarged out of proportion through the glass as he studied the coin three words first one looks like trivmfator cant make out the other two theyre nearly worn smooth a collectors catalogue should give a description and latin translation ill have to wait until we return to civilization before i can look them up can you date it graham stared at the ceiling thoughtfully coined during the reign of theodosius which if i remember correctly was from ad to lily stared at gronquist right in the ballpark he shook his head sheer fantasy to suggest fourthcentury eskimos had contact with the roman empire we cant rule out the infinity of chance lily persisted once this gets out there will be a flood of speculation and hype by the news media said hoskins inspecting the coin for the first time gronquist took a swallow of his brandy ancient coinage has turned up in odd places before but the date and source of its deposit could rarely be proven to the full satisfaction of the archaeologists community perhaps said graham slowly but id give my mercedes convertible to know how it turned up here they all gazed at the coin for a few moments without speaking each lost in their own thoughts finally gronquist broke the silence it seems the only thing we know for certain is that we have a real mystery on our hands shortly before midnight the imposter began his practiced drill to abandon the jetliner the air was sparkling clear and the dim smudge that was iceland rose above the flat black horizon line of the sea the small island country was outlined by a faint but eerie display of greenish rays from the aurora borealis he was oblivious to the dead men around him he had grown used to the smell of blood and it no longer sickened him death and gore simply went with the job he was as indifferent to mutilated bodies as a pathologist or the neighborhood butcher the imposter was quite clinical about killing numbers of dead were merely mathematical sums he was paid well he was a mercenary as well as a religious fanatic who murdered for a cause oddly the only part of his work that offended him was being called an assassin or a terrorist he detested the words they had a political ring about them and he nurtured a passionate dislike for politicians he was a man of a thousand identities a perfectionist who rejected random gunfire in crowds or sloppy car bombs considering them tools for juvenile idiots his methods were far more subtle he never left anything to chance international investigators found it difficult to separate many of his hits from what appeared to be accidents the death of hala kamil was more than an assigned task he considered it a duty his elaborate plan had taken five months to perfect followed by the patient wait for the opportune moment almost a waste he mused kamil was a beautiful woman but she was a threat that had to be nullified he gently eased back on the throttles and nudged the control column forward beginning a shallow rate of descent to anyone but another pilot the slight drop in speed and altitude was imperceptible the main cabin crew had not troubled him by now the passengers were dozing attempting but failing to fall into the deep sleep so elusive on long aircraft flights for the twentieth time he rechecked his heading and studied the computer he had reprogrammed to indicate the time and distance to his drop zone fifteen minutes later the jetliner crossed over an uninhabited section of icelands southern coastline and headed inland the landscape below became a montage of gray rock and white snow he lowered the flaps and reduced speed until the boeing b was flying at kilometers an hour he reengaged the auto pilot on a new radio frequency transmitted from a beacon placed on the hofsjokull a glacier rising meters from the center of the island then he set the altitude so the aircraft would impact meters below the peak methodically he smashed and disabled the communication and direction indicators he also began dumping fuel as a backup in case a flaw somehow marred his carefully conceived plan eight minutes to go he dropped through the trapdoor into the hell hole he already wore a pair of french paraboots with thick elastic soles he hurriedly removed a jumpsuit from the duffel bag and slipped into it there had been no room for a helmet so he pulled on a ski mask and stocking cap next came a pair of gloves goggles and an altimeter which he strapped to one wrist he clipped the harness snaps and checked the straps for snugness he wore a piggyback rig where the reserve sat on his shoulder blades and the main chute fit into the small of his back he relied on a ram air canopy a square air foil that is more flown than jumped he glanced at the dial of his watch one minute twenty seconds he opened the escape door and a rush of air swept through the hell hole he studied the sweep second hand on the watch and began counting down when he reached zero he launched his body through the narrow opening feet first facing in the direction of flight the velocity of the airstream struck him with the icy force of an avalanche crushing the breath from his lungs the plane soared past with a deafening roar for a brief instant he felt the heat from the turbines exhaust and then he was away and falling face down in a stable arched and spread position knees slightly flexed hands spread in front lemk looked down and saw only blackness no lights burned on the ground he assumed the worst his crew had failed to reach the correct rendezvous point without a defined target zone he could not gauge his wind drift or direction he might land kilometers away or worse impact in the middle of jagged ice with serious injury and never be found in time in ten seconds he had already dropped nearly meters the needle on the luminous dial of his altimeter was crossing into the red he could not wait any longer he pulled the pilot chute from a pouch and threw it into the wind it anchored to the sky and strung out the main canopy he heard the chute open with a satisfying thump and he was jerked into an upright position he took his penlight and aimed the narrow beam over his head the canopy blossomed above him suddenly a small circle of lights blinked on about one mile away to his right then a flare went up and hung for several seconds just long enough for him to judge wind direction and speed he pulled on the right steering toggle and began gliding toward the lights another flare went up the wind held steady with no fluctuation as he neared the ground he could clearly see his crew now they had laid out another line of lights leading to the previously lit circle he jockeyed the steering toggles and made a degree bank into the wind lemk prepared to strike the ground his crew had chosen the terrain well the balls of his feet made contact with soft tundra and he made a perfect standup landing in the center of the circle without a word he unsnapped the harness and walked outside the glare of the lights he looked up at the sky the aircraft with its unsuspecting crew and passengers flew straight toward the glacier that gradually rose closing the gap between ice and metal he stood there watching as the faint sound of the jet engines died and the blinking navigation lights melted into the black night back in the galley one of the flight attendants tilted her head listening whats that tinny noise coming from the cockpit she asked gary rubin the chief steward stepped into the aisle and faced toward the bow of the plane he could hear what sounded like a continuous muffled roar almost like rushing water in the distance ten seconds after the imposters exodus the timer on the actuator set the hydraulic arm in motion closing the hatch in the hell hole and cutting off the strange sound it stopped he said i dont hear it any more what do you suppose it was cant say ive never heard anything quite like it for a moment i thought we might have suffered a pressure leak a passenger call light came on and the flight attendant brushed back her blond hair and stepped into the main cabin maybe you better check it out with the captain she said over her shoulder rubin hesitated remembering lemks order not to bother the flight crew except for a matter of importance better safe than sorry the welfare of the passengers came first he lifted the intercom phone to his ear and pressed the cockpit call button captain chief steward here weve just experienced a weird noise forward of the main cabin is there a problem he received no reply he tried three times but the receiver remained dead he stood there at a loss for several moments wondering why the flight cabin did not respond in twelve years of flying this was a new experience for him he was still trying to fathom the mystery when the flight attendant rushed up and said something at first he ignored her but the urgency in her voice got through to him what what did you say were over land land directly beneath us she said eyes blank with confusion a passenger pointed it out to me rubin shook his head doubtfully impossible we have to be over the middle of the ocean he probably saw lights from fishing boats the captain said we might spot them during our descent for the meteorology study see for yourself she pleaded the ground is coming up fast i think were landing he stepped over to the galley window and looked down instead of the dark waters of the atlantic there was a glimmer of white a vast sheet of ice was slipping under the aircraft no more than meters below it was near enough for the ice crystals to reflect the strobe flashes from the navigation lights he froze uncomprehending trying to make some sense out of what his eyes told him was true if this was an emergency landing why hadnt the captain alerted the main cabin crew the fasten seat belts and no smoking signs had not been turned on almost all of the un passengers were awake reading or engaged in conversation only hala kamil was sound asleep several representatives from mexico returning from an economic mission to the world bank headquarters were huddled around a table in the tail section director of foreign financing minister salazar talked in grim undertones the atmosphere around the table was dampened by defeat mexico had suffered a disastrous economic collapse and was going through technical bankruptcy with no monetary aid in sight dread flared within rubin and the words rustled from his mouth what in hell is going on the flight attendant muttered as her face paled and her eyes widened shouldnt we begin emergency procedures dont alarm the passengers not yet anyway let me check with the captain first is there time i dont know controlling his fear rubin walked quickly almost at a jog toward the cockpit faking a bored yawn to divert any curiosity at his rapid step he whipped the curtain closed that shielded the boarding entryway from the main cabin when he tried the door it was locked he frantically rapped his knuckles against the door no one answered from inside he stared dumbly at the thin barrier that blocked the cockpit his mind an incredulous blank and then in a flash of desperation he lashed out his foot and kicked in the door the panel was built to open outward but the blow smashed it against the inner wall rubin stared into the cramped space of the cockpit disbelief bewilderment fear they swirled through his mind like a flood hurtling down a shattered dam one swift glance took in the slumped form of the men oswalds head on the floor face up ever staring sightlessly at the cabin roof lemk had seemingly vanished rubin stumbled over oswalds body leaned across the panelstaring through the wind the massive summit of the hofsjokull loomed beyond the bow of the plane no more than ten miles away the flickering n lights silhouetted against the rising ice the uneven surface with ghostly shades of gray and green driven by panic the steward climbed into the pilots seat and firmly clutched the control column he pulled the wheel toward his chest nothing happened the column refused to give glancing at the panel he observed that it showed a slow but steady increase in altitude he yanked at the wheel again but harder this time it gave slightly he was stunned by the unyielding pressure there was no time to think straight he was too inexperienced to realize he was trying to override the automatic pilot with brute strength when only twentyfive pounds of pressure was required to overpower it the sharp cold air made the glacier appear near enough to reach out and touch he pushed the throttles forward and hauled back on the control column again it gave sluggishly like the wheel of a speeding car that lost its power steering and inched back with agonizing slowness the boeing lifted its nose and swept past the icy peak with less than a hundred feet to spare down on the glacier the man who had murdered the bona fide flight pilot date lemk in london and taken his place peered into the distance through a pair of night glasses the northern lights had faded to a dim glow but the uneven rim of the hofsjokull still showed against the sky the air was hushed with expectancy the only sounds came from the twoman crew who were loading the flights transmitter beacon into the hull of a helicopter suleiman aziz arnmars eyes became accustomed to the darkness and he could make out the broken ridges scarring the wall of the ice floe ammar stood like a statue counting the seconds waiting for the small speck of flame that would mark the crash of flight but the distant fireball did not materialize finally ammar lowered the glasses and sighed the stillness of the glacier spread around him cold and remote he pulled off the grayhaired wig and threw it into the darkness next he removed a pair of specially handcrafted boots and took out the fourinch risers in the heels he became aware of his servant and friend ibn telmuk standing beside him good makeup job suleiman i wouldnt recognize you said ibn a swarthy type with a curly mass of ebony hair the equipment loaded ammar asked all secured was the mission a success a minor miscalculation the plane somehow cleared the crest allah has given miss kamil a few more minutes of life akhmad yazid will not be pleased kamil will die as planned annnar said confidently nothing was left to chance the plane still flies even allah cant keep it in the air indefinitely you have failed said a new voice ammar swung and stared into the frozen scowl of muhammad ismail the egyptians round face was a curious blend of malevolence and childish innocence the beady black eyes gazed with evil intensity over a heavy mustache but they lacked the power of penetration bravado without substance a facade of toughness pulling a trigger was his only skill ammar had had little choice in working with lsmail the obscure village mullah had been forced on him by akhmad yazid the islamic idol hoarded his trust re a miser rationing it out only to those he believed possessed a fighting spirit and a traditionalists devotion to the original laws of islam firm religious traits meant more to yazid than competency and professionalism ammar professed to being a true believer of the faith but yazid was wary of him the assassins habit of talking to moslem leaders as though they were mortal equals did not sit well with yazid he insisted that ammar carry out his death missions under the guarded eye of ismail ammar had accepted his watchdog without protest he was a master at the game of deceit he quickly reversed ismails role into that of a dupe for his own intelligence purposes but the stupidity of arabs was a constant irritation to ammar cold analytical reasoning was beyond them he shook his head wearily and then patiently explained the situation to ismail events can happen beyond our control an updraft a malfunction in the automatic pilot or altimeters a sudden change in the wind a hundred different variables could have caused the plane to miss the peak but all probabilities were considered the automatic pilot is locked on a course toward the pole no more than ninety minutes of air time is left and if someone discovers the bodies in the cockpit and one of the passengers knows how to fly ismail persisted the dossiers of all on the plane were carefully examined none indicated any pilot experience besides i smashed the radio and navigation instruments anyone attempting to take control will be lost no compass no landmarks to give them a direction hala kamil and her un bedfellows will vanish in the cold waters of the arctic sea is there no hope for survival asked ismad none said ammar firmly absolutely none dirk pitt relaxed and slouched in a swivel chair stretching out his legs until his sixfootthreeinch body was on a near horizontal plane then he yawned and ran his hands through a thick mat of wavy black hair pitt was a lean firmmuscled man in prime physical shape for someone who didnt run ten miles every day or look upon the exertion and sweat of bodybuilding as a celestial tonic against old age his face wore the tanned weathered skin of an outdoorsman who preferred the sun to the fluorescent lighting of an office his deep green opaque eyes radiated a strange combination of warmth and cruelty while his lips seemed eternally locked in a friendly grin he was a smooth article who moved easily among the rich and powerful but preferred the company of men and women who drank their liquor straight up and liked to get their hands dirty a product of the air force academy he was listed on active status with the rank of major although he had been on loan to the national underwater marine agency numa for nearly six years as their special projects director along with al giordino his closest friend since childhood he had lived and adventured in every sea on the surface and in the depths encountering in half a decade more wild experiences than most men would see in ten lifetimes he had found the vanished manhattan limited express train after swimming through an underground cavern in new york salvaged a few passengers before being sent to the bottom of the saint lawrence river with a thousand souls he had hunted down the lost nuclear submarine starbuck in the middle of the pacific and tracked the ghost ship cyclops to her grave under the caribbean and he raised the titanic he was giordino often mused a man driven to rediscover the past born eighty years too late you might want to see this giordino said suddenly from the other side of the room pitt turned from a color video monitor that displayed a view of the seascape one hundred meters beneath the hull of the icebreaker survey ship polar explorer she was a sturdy new vessel especially built for sailing through icecovered waters the massive boxlike superstructure towering above the hull resembled a fivestory office building and her great bow pushed by horsepower engines could pound a path through ice up to oneandahalf meters thick pitt placed one foot against a counter flexed his knee and pushed the motion was honed through weeks of practice and with the gentle roll of the ship for momentum he twisted degrees in his swivel chair as its castors carried him some meters across the slanting deck of the electronics compartment looks like a crater coming up al giordino sat at a console studying an image on the klein sidescan sonar recorder short standing a little over centimeters in stockinged sizeeleven feet broadened with beefy shoulders in the shape of a wedge he looked as if he were assembled out of spare bulldozer parts his hair was dark and curly an inheritance from italian ancestry and if he had worn a bandanna and an earring he could have moonlighted as an organgrinder dryhumored steadfast and reliable as the tides giordino was pitts insurance policy against murphys law his concentration never flickered while pitt feet extended as bumpers came to an abrupt stop against the console beside him pitt watched the computerenhanced sonograph as the ridge of a crater slowly rose to a crest and then made a steep descent into the interior void shes dropping fast said giordino pitt glanced at the echo sounder down from to meters hardly any slope to the outer rim two hundred and still falling weird formation for a volcano said giordino no sign of lava rock a tall floridfaced man with thick graying brown hair that struggled to escape from a baseball cap tilted toward the back of his head opened the door and leaned in the compartment you night owls in the mood for food or drink peanutbutter sandwich and a cup of black coffee sounds good pitt replied without turning leveling out at meters a couple of doughnuts with milk giordino answered navy commander byron knight skipper of the survey vessel nodded besides pitt and giordino he was the only man with access to the electronics compartment it was off limits to the rest of the officers and crew ill have your orders rustled up from the galley youre a wonderful human being byron pitt said with a sarcastic smile i dont care what the rest of the navy says about you you ever try peanut butter with arsenic knight threw at him over his shoulder giordino watched intently as the arc of the formation spread and widened diameter almost two kilometers interior is smooth sediment said pitt no breakup of the floor must have been one gigantic volcano not a volcano giordino faced pitt a curious look in his eyes you have another name for a submerged pockmark how about meteor impact giordino looked skeptical a meteor crater this deep on the sea bottom probably struck thousands maybe millions of years ago at a time when the sea level was lower what led you up that street three clues pitt explained first we have a well defined rim without a prominent outer upsiope second the subbottom profiler indicates a bowlshaped cross section and third he paused pointing at a stylus that was making furious sweeps across a roll of graph paper the magnetometer is having a spasm theres enough iron down there to build a fleet of battleships suddenly giordino stiffened we have a target where two hundred meters to starboard lying perpendicular on the craters slope pretty vague reading the object is partly obscured by the geology pitt snatched the phone and rang the bridge weve had a malfunction in the equipment continue our heading to the end of the run if we can make the repair in time come around and repeat the track will do sir replied the watch officer you should have sold snake oil said giordino smiling no telling the size of soviet ears anything from the video cameras pitt glanced at the monitors just out of range they should pick it up on the next pass the initial sonar image that appeared on the recording paper looked like a brown smudge against the lighter geology of the craters wall then it slipped past the sidescans viewing window and disappeared into a computer that enhanced the detail the finished picture came out on a special large highresolution color video monitor the smudge had become a well defined shape using a joystick pitt moved a pair of crosshairs to the center of the image and clicked the button to expand the image the computer churned away for a few seconds and then a new larger even more detailed image appeared on the screen a rectangle automatically appeared around the target and showed the dimensions at the same time another machine reproduced the color image on a sheet of glossy paper commander knight came rushing back into the compartment after days of tedium cruising back and forth as though mowing a vast lawn staring for hours on end at the video display and sidescan readings he was galvanized anticipation written in every line of his face i was given your message about a malfunction you have a target neither pitt nor giordino answered they smiled like prospectors who have hit the mother lode knight staring at them suddenly knew good god above he blurted weve found her really found her hiding in the seascape said pitt pointing to the monitor while handing knight the photo the perfect image of one alfaclass soviet submarine knight stared fascinated at both sonar images the russians probed all around this section of the sea incredible they didnt find her shes easy to miss said pitt the ice pack was heavier when they conducted their search they couldnt maintain a straight track probably skirted the opposite side of the upslope and their sonar beams only showed a shadow where the sub was lying also the unusually heavy concentration of iron under the crater would have thrown off their magnetic profile our intelligence people will dance on the ceiling when they see this not if the reds get wise said giordino theyll hardly stand idle and watch us repeat our seventyfive snatch of their golf class sub with the glomar explorer you suggesting they havent swallowed our story about conducting a geological survey of the seafloor pitt asked with deep sarcasm giordino gave pitt a sour look indeed intelligence is a weird business he said the crew on the other side of these bulkheads has no idea of what were up to yet soviet agents in washington smelled out our mission weeks ago the only reason they havent interfered is because our undersea technology is better and they want us to lead the way to their sub wont be easy to deceive them agreed knight two of their trawlers have been shadowing our every move since we left port so have their surveillance satellites added giordino pitt said all reasons why i asked the bridge to run out our last track before coming about for a closer look good try but the russians will pick up our track rerun no doubt except once we pass over the sub we go on and turn onto the next lane continuing as before then ill radio our engineers in washington to complain of equipment problems and ask for maintenance instructions every couple of miles well rerun a lane to reinforce the ruse giordino looked at knight they might buy it its believable enough knight considered that okay we wont hang around this will be our last look at the target then we continue on acting as if weve found nothing and after weve finished this grid pitt said we can start a new one thirty miles away and fake a discovery a nice added touch giordino said approvingly drop a red herring across our trail knight smiled wryly sounds like a good script lets go for it the ship rolled and the deck canted slightly to starboard as the helmsman brought her around on a reverse course far behind the stern like an obstinate dog on a long leash a robot submersible called sherlock automatically refocused its two movie cameras and one still camera while continuing to send out probing sonar waves presumedly named by its designer after the fictional detective sherlock revealed detailed features of the seafloor previously unseen by man minutes ticked by with the slowness of hours until at last the crest of the crater began slipping across the sidescan the polar explorers course towed sherlock along the plunging slope of the craters interior three pairs of eyes locked on the sidescan recorder here she comes giordino said with the barest tremor of excitement the soviet submarine nearly filled the port side of the sonograph she was lying on a steep angle with her stern toward the center of the crater her bow pointing at the rim the hull was upright and she was in one piece unlike the us submarines thresher and scorpion which had imploded into hundreds of pieces when they sank in the s the slight list to her starboard side was no more than two or three degrees ten months had passed since she went missing but her outer works were free of growth and rust in the frigid arctic waters no doubt of her being an alfa class said knight nuclearpowered titanium hull nonmagnetic and noncorrosive in salt water latest silentpropellor technology the deepestdiving and fastest submarines in both the soviet and us navies the lag between the sonar recording and the video view was around thirty seconds as if watching a tennis match their heads turned in unison from the sonar as they stared intently at the tv monitors the subs smooth lines slid into view under the cameras lights and were revealed in a ghostly bluishgray hue the americans found it hard to believe the russian vessel was a graveyard with over a hundred and fifty men resting inside it looked like a childs toy sitting on the bottom of a wading pool any indication of unusual radioactivity asked knight very slight rise answered giordino probably from the subs reactor she didnt suffer a meltdown pitt surmised not according to the readings knight stared at the monitors and made a cursory damage report some damage to the bow port diving plane torn away a long gouge in her port bottom running for about twenty meters a deep one by the looks of it observed pitt penetrated her ballast tanks into the inner pressure hull she must have struck the opposite rim of the crater tearing the guts out of her easy to imagine the crew struggling to raise her to the surface as she kept running across the center of the crater but she took in more water than she could blow off and lost depth finally impacting about halfway up the slope on this side the compartment fell into a momentary silence as the submarine dropped astern of the sherlock and slowly faded from view of the cameras they continued to gaze at the monitors as the broken contour of the sea bottom glided past their minds visualizing the horrible death that stalked men who sailed the hostile depths beneath the sea for nearly half a minute no one spoke they hardly breathed then slowly each shook off the nightmare and turned away from the monitors the ice was broken they began to relax and laugh with all the spontaneous enthusiasm of saloon patrons celebrating a winning touchdown by the home team pitt and giordino could sit back and take it easy for the rest of the voyage their part in the search project was over they had found a needle in a haystack then slowly pitts expression turned serious and he stared off into space giordino knew the symptoms from long experience once a project was successfully completed pitt suffered a letdown the challenge was gone and his restless mind quickly turned to the next one damn fine job dirk and you too al knight said warmly you numa people know your search techniques this has to be the most remarkable intelligence coup in twenty years dont get carried away said pitt the tough part is yet to come recovering the sub under russian noses will be a delicate operation no glomar explorer this time no salvage from highly visible surface ships the entire operation will have to be carried out underwater what the hell is that giordinos eyes had returned to the monitor looks like a fat jug more like an urn knight confirmed pitt stared into the monitor for a long moment his face thoughtful his eyes tired red and suddenly intense the object was standing straight up two handles protruded from opposite sides of a narrow neck flaring sharply into a broad oval body that in turn tapered toward the base buried in the silt a terracotta amphora pitt announced finally i believe youre right said knight the greeks and romans used them to transport wine and olive oil theyve been recovered all over the bottom of the mediterranean whats one doing in the greenland sea giordino asked no one in particular there to the left of the picture weve picked up a second then a cluster of three drifted under the cameras followed by five more running in a ragged line from southeast to northwest knight turned to pitt youre the shipwreck expert how do youread it a good ten seconds passed before pitt replied then at last he did his voice was distant as though it came from someone in the next compartment my guess is they lead toward an ancient shipwreck the history books say isnt supposed to be here rubin would have traded his soul to abandon the impossible task remove hands slick with sweat from the control rolumn close tired eyes and accept death but his sense of responsibility to the flight crew and passengers drove him on never in his wildest nightmares did he see himself in such a crazy predicament one wrong physical movement a slight error in judgment and fifty people would find a deep unknown grave in the sea not fair he cried in his mind over and over not fair none of the navigation instruments was fullctioning all communications equipment was dead not one of the passengers had ever flown an aircraft even a light plane he was totally disoriented and hopelessly lost inexplicably the needles on the fuel gauges wavered on empty his mind strained at the confusion of it all where was the pilot what caused the flight officers deaths who was behind this insane madness the questions swarmed in his mind but the answers remained wrapped in frustration rubins only consolation was that he was not alone another man shared the cockpit eduardo ybarra a member of the mexican delegation had once served as a mechanic in his countrys air force thirty years had passed since he wielded a wrench on propellerdriven aircraft but bits and pieces of the old knowledge had returned to him as he sat in the copilots seatreading the instruments for rubin and taking command of the throttles ybarras face was round and brown the hair thick and black with traces of gray the brown eyes widely spaced and expressionless in his threepiece suit he seemed out of place in the cockpit oddly there was no beaded perspiration on his forehead and he had not loosened his tie or removed his coat he motioned upward at the sky through the windshield judging from the stars id say were on a heading toward the north pole probably flying east over russia for all i know rubin said grimly i havent a vague idea of our direction that was an island we left behind us think it was greenland ybarra shook his head weve had water under us for the last few hours wed still be over the icecap if it was greenland my guess is we crossed iceland my god how long have we been heading north no telling when the pilot turned off his londontonew york course another fear added to rubins aching confusion calamity was piling on calamity the oneinathousand chance of coming through alive had rapidly risen to one in a million he had to make a desperate decision the only decision im going to bring her around ninety degrees to port we have no other choice ybarra agreed solemnly a few might survive if we crash on land near impossible to pull off a water landing on high waves in the dark even by an experienced pilot and if by some miracle we set her down intact no human dressed in street clothes could last more than a few minutes in a freezing sea we may already be too late the un delegate from mexico nodded at the instrument panel the red fuel warning lights were flashing across the board i fear our time in the air has run out rubin stared in astonishment at the telltale instruments he did not realize that the boeing flying knots at meters ate up the same amount of fuel as it did when flying knots at meters okay we head west until she drops from under us rubin rubbed his palms on his pants legs and gripped the control column he had not taken command of the aircraft again since climbing over the glaciers peak he took a deep breath and pressed the autopilot release button on the control column he was too unsure of himself to slip the boeing into a bank with the ailerons so he used only the rudder controls to gently crab around in a flat turn as soon as the nose came onto a straight course he felt something was wrong rpms dropping on number four engine said ybarra with a noticeable tremor in his voice its starving for fuel shouldnt we shut it down or something i dont know the procedure ybarra replied dumbly oh dear lord rubin thought to himself the blind leading the blind the altimeter began to register a steady drop the airspeed indicated a decrease too his mind strained beyond reason rubin tried to will the plane in the air rather than fly it he also tried to fight time as the distance between the plane and the sea slowly relentlessly narrowed then without warning the control column began to grow sluggish and vibrate in his hands shes stalling shouted ybarra his stoic face showing fear at last push the nose down rubin eased the control column forward fully aware he was hastening the inevitable lower the flaps to increase our lift he ordered ybarra flaps coming down ybarra replied through pursed lips this is it rubin muttered were going in a stewardess stood in the open cockpit door listening to the exchange eyes wide with fright face pale as a sheet of paper are we going to crash she asked barely above a whisper rubin tensed in his seat too busy to turn yes dammit he swore strap yourself in she spun and nearly fell down as she raced back to the main cabin to alert the other flight attendants and passengers for the worst everyone realized there was no putting off the inevitable and thankfully there was no panic or hysterical outcry even the prayers came softly ybarra twisted in his seat and stared down the aisle kamil was comforting an older man who was shaking uncontrollably her face was completely calm and seemed to bear a smiling expression of contentment she was truly a lovely woman ybarra thought a pity her beauty would soon be erased he sighed and turned back to the instrument panel the altimeter was falling past two hundred meters ybarra took a great risk and increased the throttle settings on the three remaining engines it was a useless gesture born of desperation the engines would burn their last few gallons of fuel at a faster rate and die sooner but ybarra wasnt thinking logically he could not sit and do nothing he felt he had to perform one final defiant act anything even if it meant hastening his own death five tormenting minutes passed as one the black sea reached up to clutch the aircraft i see lights rubin blurted suddenly dead ahead his eyes instantly flicked up and focused through the windshield a ship he cried its a ship almost as he shouted the plane roared over the polar explorer missing the radar mast by less than ten meters the crew of the icebreaker had been alerted by radar to the approaching aircraft the men standing inside the bridge involuntarily ducked as the airliner exhaust from its two straining engines screaming like an army of banshees swept overhead toward the greenland coast to the west the roar filled the electronics compartment and it emptied like a lake through a split dam knight took off for the bridge at a dead run with pitt and giordino right behind him none of the men manning the bridge as much as turned as the captain burst past the door everyone was peering in the direction of the receding aircraft what in hell was that knight demanded from the officer on watch an unidentified aircraft nearly ranmied the ship captain military no sir i caught a quick glimpse of the lower wings as she flashed overhead she bore no markings a spy plane maybe i doubt it all her windows were lit up a commercial airliner giordino suggested knights expression became vague and a trifle irritated where does the pilot get off endangering my ship whats he doing around here anyway were hundreds of miles off commercial flight paths shes losing altitude said pitt staring at the blinking lights as they grew smaller in the east id say shes going in god help them if they set down on this sea in the dark strange he hasnt turned on the landing lights the watch officer nodded his head in agreement strange is the word a pilot in trouble would surely send out a distress signal the communications room hasnt heard a peep you tried to raise him asked knight as soon as they came at us on radar no reply knight stepped to the window and gazed out he dnimmed his fingertips thoughtfully for no more than four seconds then he turned and faced the watch officer maintain course continue the grid pattern pitt looked at him i understand your decision but i cant say i applaud it youre on a navy ship mr pitt said knight sternly were not the coast guard our mission takes first priority there could be women and children on board that plane the facts dont spell tragedy shes still in the air if the polar explorer is the only hope of rescue in this part of the sea why no distress call no attempt to signal us with his landing lights no sign of preparations to ditch youre a flyer you tell me why the pilot hasnt circled the ship if hes in trouble could be hes trying for land begging the captains pardon interrupted the watch officer i forgot to mention the landing flaps were down still no proof of an immanent crash knight said stubbornly damn the compassion full steam ahead pitt said coldly this isnt war captain were talking about a mission of mercy i wouldnt want it on my conscience if a hundred people died because i failed to act the navy can well afford the time it takes to investigate knight tilted his head toward the empty chart room closing the door after pitt and giordino entered we have our own mission to consider he persisted calmly we turn off course now and the russians will suspect we found their sub and home in on this area solid point pitt acknowledged but you can still send giordino and me into the game im listening we use our numa helicopter on the aft deck and you supply your medical people and a couple of strong bodies well chase the aircraft while the polar explorer keeps running search lanes and russian surveillance what will their intelligence analysts make of it at first they wont see it as a coincidence theyre already probably trying to paint a connection but if god forbid the plane crashes and proves out to be a commercial airliner then at least youll have a legitimate reason for turning off course to launch a rescue mission afterward we resume our search pattern fake out the russians and gamble on turning a disaster into a windfall and your helicopter flight theyll monitor your every move al and i will use open communications and keep a running dialogue of our search for the downed mystery plane that should pacify their suspicions knights eyes turned downward staring at something beyond the deck then he sighed and raised his head to look at pitt were wasting time get your bird untied and warmed up ill see to the medical personnel and a team of volunteers rubin made no attempt to circle the polar explorer because of the almost nonexistent altitude and his sad lack of flying talent there was every chance he would stall the plane and send it cartwheeling into the rising swells the mere sight of the ship had ignited a small glimmer of hope in the cockpit now they had been sighted and rescuers would know where to look for survivors a small comfort but better than none at all the black sea abruptly turned to solid pack ice and magmfied by starlight whirled crazily beneath the windshield rubin almost felt as if he were sledding through it with the final impact only minutes away it finally occurred to him to order ybarra to turn on the landing lights the mexican feverishly scanned the instrument panel found the marked switches and flicked them to on a startled polar bear was caught in the sudden glare before he vanished beneath and behind the aircraft they were hurtling over a dead frozen plain mother of jesus murmured ybarra i see hills on our right weve crossed overland lucks pendulum had finally swung in rubins favor ybarras hills were a desolate range of mountains that swept above the jagged greenland coast for a hundred miles in both directions but rubin had somehow missed them and miraculously manhandled the descending boeing into the middle of ardencaple fjord he was flying up the narrow inlet to the sea below and between the summits of steep sloping cliffs luck also conjured up a headwilld which gave the aircraft added lift the ice seemed close enough for him to reach out and drag his hand over it the lights reflected a kaleidoscope of shivering colors a dark mass loomed ahead he gently pushed the right rudder pedal and the mass slid away to his port side lower the landing gear rubin shouted ybarra wordlessly complied under normal emergency landing procedures it was the worst possible action to take but in their ignorance they unwittingly made the correct decision for the terrain the landing gear dropped from their wheel wells and the plane quickly lost speed due to the added wind resistance rubin gripped the control wheel until his knuckles turned ivory and he glanced down directly at the ice flashing past the blazing crystals seemed to be rising up to meet him spreading as they came rubin closed his eyes praying they would come down in soft snow instead of striking unyielding ice there was nothing more he and ybarra could do the end was approaching with horrifying speed mercifully he did not know could not know the ice was only one meter thick far too thin to support the weight of a boeing b the maze of instrument lights had gone crazy and the lights were flashing red the ice rushed out of the darkness rubin had the sensation of bursting through a black curtain into a white void he pulled back on the control column and the speed of the boeing fell away as the nose rose up for the last time in a feeble attempt to cling to the sky ybarra sat terrified oblivious to the kilometeranhour airspeed frozen in shock he made no attempt to yank back the throttles nor did his dazed mind think to cut the electrical switches then the impact on reflex rubin and ybarra flung up their hands and closed their eyes the tires touched slid and gouged twill trails through the ice the port inboard engine buckled and was torn from its mounts madly gyrating into the darkness both starboard engines dug in at the same time caught and twisted the wing away in a shrieking mangled mass then all power was lost and the lights went dark the boeing careened across the fjords ice sheet shedding pieces of protesting metal like particles behind a comet it smashed into a pressure ridge that had been thrust up when the pack ice collided the nose gear was crushed back against the forward belly tearing into the hell hole the bow dropped and plowed through the ice crushing the thin aluminum plates inward against the cockpit at last the momentum fell off and the crumpled plane distorted and dismembered came to the end of its shattering journey it came to a stop just thirty meters short of a jumbled group of large rocks near the icebound shore for a brief few seconds there was a deathly silence then the ice made a loud series of cracking sounds metal groaned as it twisted against metal and the battered aircraft slowly settled through the ice into the frigid water the archaeologists heard the boeing fly up the valley too they rushed out of their hut in time to catch a brief look at the planes outline reflected in the ice glare by the landing lights they could clearly make out the illuminated cabin windows and the extended landing gear almost immediately came the sound of shrieking metal and a scant instant later the vibration of the impact carried through the frozen surface the lights went dead but the protest of tortured metal continued for several seconds then suddenly a dead silence swept out of the darkness a silence that overpowered the dreary moan of the wind the archaeologists stood in disbelieving shock stunned frozen immobile immune to the cold they stared into the black night like haunted statues good lord gronquist finally muttered in awe it crashed in the fjord lily could not conceal the shock in her voice horrible no one could have survived uninjured more than likely dead if they went in the water probably why theres no fire added graham did anyone see what kind of plane it was asked hoskins graham shook his head happened too fast good size though looked to be multiengine might be an ice recon patrol how far do you make it asked gronquist probably a kilometer a kilometer and a quarter lilys expression was pale and strained weve got to do something to help them gronquist took a visual bearing and rubbed his unprotected cheeks lets get back inside before we freeze and form a plan before we charge off halfcocked lily began to come back on track gather up blankets any extra warm clothing she said brusquely ill see to the medical supplies mike get on the radio gronquist ordered notify the weather station at daneborg theyll spread the word to air force rescue units at thule graham made an affirmative motion with his hand and was the first one inside the hut wed better bring along tools for prying any survivors from the wreckage said hoskins gronquist nodded as he yanked on his parka and gloves good thinking figure out whatever else well require ill hook up the sled to one of the snowmobiles we can pile all the stuff in that five minutes ago they had all been asleep now they were throwing on coldweather gear and hurriedly rushing about their respective chores forgotten was the enigmatic byzantine coin forgotten was the warm comfort of sleep all that mattered was the urgency of getting to the downed plane as quickly as possible returning outside head against a sudden shift of wind gronquist dashed around the hut to a small snowcovered shed that protected the projects two snowmobiles he kicked away the ice that had formed around the bottom of the door and pulled it open inside a small oil heater struggled with all the efficiency of a candle inside a freezer to keep the interior air twenty degrees above the temperature outside he tried the starter buttons but the batteries were badly drained after months of hard use and both engines balked at turning over cursing in vapored breaths he removed his heavy gloves with his teeth and began yanking on the manual pull ropes the engine on the first snowmobile caught on the fifth attempt but the second played stubborn finally after two pulls gronquist counted them the engine obstinately coughed to life he hitched the tongue of a large sled to the rear catch on the snowmobile whose engine had had extra time to warm up he finished none too soon as his fingers were beginning to turn numb the others had already stacked the supplies and equipment outside the entryway to the hut when he rode up except for gronquist they were all bundled up in downfilled jumpsuits the sled was loaded to the top of its sideboards in less than two minutes graham passed everyone a heavyduty flashlight and they were ready to set off if they crashed through the ice shouted hoskins above the wind we might as well forget it hes right graham shouted back theyd be dead from hypothemiia by now lilys eyes turned hard behind her ski mask pessimism never saved anybody i suggest you big jocks get a move on gronquist grabbed her by the waist and lifted her onto the snowmobile do what the lady says boys therere people dying out there he swung a leg over the seat in front of lily and cracked the throttle as hoskins and graham raced for the idling snowmobile in the shed the engines exhaust purred and the rear tread gripped the snow he cut a sharp uturn and took off toward the shore the sled bouncing along behind they swept over the uneven icecovered stones of the beach onto the frozen fjord it was dangerous going the beam from the single light mounted in front of the handgrips wavered over the ice pack in a crazy jumble of white flashes against black shadows making it nearly impossible for gronquist to see any pressure ridges until they were plowing up and over them like a lifeguard boat through heavy surf and no amount of driving skill could prevent the heavily laden sled from veenng and seesawing in their wake lily clasped her hands around gronquists great stomach in a death grip her eyes closed head buried against his shoulder she yelled for him to slow down but he ignored her she turned and spied the bobbing light of the other snowmobile rapidly closing on their tail without the drag of the sled the overtaking vehicle with hoskins steering and graham behind quickly caught up and passed soon all lily could see of the other two men was an indistinct blur of hunched figures through a trailing cloud of fine surface snow she felt gronquist tense as a large metal object rose up out of the darkness at the far edge of the lights ray gronquist abruptly jammed the handgrips around to his left the edges of the front skis dug into the ice and the snowmobile swerved away just one meter from striking a piece of the planes shattered wing he made a frantic attempt to straighten out but the sudden twist of centrifugal force whipped the sled around like the tail of a maddened rattlesnake the topheavy sled went into a wild skid jackknifed against the snowmobile and snapped the hitch the tips of the runners dug in and it flipped upside down scattering its load in the air like debris from an explosion gronquist shouted something but the words were cut off as the flat side of a runner unerringly caught him on the shoulder knocking him off the snowmobile he was thrown in a wide arc like a demolition ball about to smash a wall the hood of his coat was jerked back and the ice rose up and struck his unprotected head lilys arms were torn from around gronquists waist as he vanished into the darkness she thought she might be thrown clear the sled missed her crashing to a stop a few meters away but the snowmobile had other ideas without gronquists hands on the clutch lever and throttle it came to a stop teetering precariously at a fortyfivedegree angle engine popping at idle it hung there for a brief moment and then slowly heeled over to one side falling on lilys legs from her hips down and pinning her helplessly against the ice sheet hoskins and graham were not immediately aware of the accident behind them but they were about to run into a disaster of their own after covering another two hundred meters graham turned more out of curiosity than intuition to check how far they had outdistanced lily and gronquist he was surprised to see their light hewn far to the rear stationary and pointing downward he pounded hoskinss shoulder and shouted in his ear i think somethings happened to the others it had been hoskinss original intention to find the depression in the ice carved by the plane after it touched down and then follow it to the final crash site his eyes were straining to penetrate the gloom beyond when graham interrupted his concentration the words came indistinct over the growl of the snowmobiles exhaust he twisted his head and shouted back at graham i cant hear you somethings wrong hoskins nodded in understanding and refocused his attention on the terrain ahead the distraction was to cost them too late he glimpsed one of the troughs gouged by the landing gear almost as he was on it the snowmobile flew over the twometer opening in the ice and became airborne the weight of the two riders forced the nose to dip down and it collided against the opposite wall with a sharp crack like the blast of a pistol fortunately for hoskins and graham they were pitched over the edge and onto the ice surface their bodies tumbling crazily as if they were cottonstuffed dolls thrown across a waxed floor thirty seconds later a stunned graham moving like a ninetyyearold man stiffly lifted himself to his hands and knees he sat there dazed not fully aware of how he got there he heard a strange hissing sound and looked around hoskins was sitting in an upright position doubled up in agony with both hands tightly pressed against his groin he was sucking and exhaling air through clenched teeth while rocking back and forth graham removed his outer mitten and lightly touched his nose it didnt feel broken but blood was flowing from the nostrils forcing him to breathe through his mouth a series of stretches indicated all joints were still mobile all limbs in place not too surprising considering the heavy padding of his clothing he crawled over to hoskins whose tortured hissing had become a string of mournful groans what happened graham asked regreuing such a stupid question the instant he uttered it we hit a gash furrowed in the ice by the aircraft hoskins managed between groans jesus i think ive been castrated let me have a look graham pried away the hands and unzipped the front of hoskinss jumpsuit he took a flashlight from a pocket and pushed the switch he could not suppress a smile your wife will need another excuse to dump you theres no sign of blood your sex life is secure wheres lily and gronquist hoskins asked haltingly about two hundred meters back weve got to make our way around the ice opening and check out their situation hoskins rose painfully to his feet and hobbled to the edge of the ice break amazingly the snowmobiles headlamp was still burning its dim glow playing on the bottom of the flord while backlighting the bubbles that traveled up six meters to the surface graham walked over and peered down then they looked at each other as lifesavers said hoskins dejectedly wed better stick with archaeology quiet graham snapped suddenly he cupped his mittens to his ears and turned from side to side like a radar dish then he stopped and pointed excitedly at flashing lights in the distance hot damn he shouted theres a helicopter coming up the fjord lily floated in and out of reality she could not understand why it became increasingly difficult for her to think straight she lifted her head and looked around for gronquist he lay unmoving several meters away she shouted desperately trying to get a response but he lay as though dead she gave up and gradually entered a halfdream world as her legs lost all sensation of feeling only when she began to shiver did lily realize she was in a mild state of shock she was certain graham and hoskins would return any moment but the moments soon grew into painful minutes and they did not show she felt very tired and was about to gratefully slip away into sleep when she heard a strange thumping sound approaching from overhead then a dazzling light cut the dark sky and blinded her eyes loose snow was kicked up by a sudden windstorm and swept around her the thumping sound died in intensity and a vague figure encircled by the light came toward her the figure became a man in a heavy fur parka who immediately summed up the situation took a strong grip on the snowmobile and heaved it off her legs to an upright position he walked around her until the light illuminated his face lilys eyes werent focusing as they should but they stared into a pair of sparkling green eyes that took her breath away they seemed to reflect hardness gentleness and sincere concern in one glinting montage they narrowed a fraction when he saw that she was a woman she wondered dizzily where he came from lily couldnt think of anything to say except oh am i ever glad to see you names dirk pitt answered a warm voice if youre not busy why dont you have dinner with me tomorrow night lily looked up at pitt trying to read him not sure she had heard him correctly i may not be up to it he pushed back the hood of his parka and ran his hands up and down her legs he gently squeezed her ankles no apparent breaks or swelling he said in a friendly voice are you in pain im too cold to hurt pitt retrieved a pair of blankets that had been pitched from the sled d you get here he asked her im one of a team of archaeologists doing an excavation on an ancient eskimo village we heard the plane come up the fjord and ran out of our hut in time to see it land on the ice we were heading for the crash site with blankets and medical supplies when we lilys words became vague and she weakly gestured toward the overturned sled we in the light from the helicopter pitt quickly read the accident in the snow coating the ice the straight trail of the snowmobile the abrupt swerve around the severed aircraft wing the sharp cuts made by the runners of the outofcontrol sledonly then did he glimpse another human form lying nearly ten meters beyond the wing hold on pitt walked over and knelt down beside gronquist the big archaeologist was breathing evenly pitt gave him a cursory examination lily watched for a few moments and then asked anxiously is he dead hardly a nasty contusion on his forehead concussion most likely possible fracture but i doubt it he has a head like a bank vault graham came trudging up hoskins limping along behind both looking like snowmen their arctic jumpsuits dusted white their face masks plastered with ice from their breathing graham lifted his mask exposing his bloodied face and studied pitt blankly for a moment then he smiled bleakly welcome stranger your timing was perfect no one on the helicopter had seen the other two members of the archaeology expedition from the air and pitt began to wonder how many other ambulance cases were wandering around the fjord we have an injured man and lady here pitt said without formalities are they part of your group the smile fell from grahams face what happened they took a bad spill we took one too you see the aircraft saw it go down but we didnt reach it hoskins moved around graham and stared down at lily and then glanced around until he spied gronquist how badly are they hurt know better after theyve had xrays weve got to help them i have a team of medics on board the helicopter then what in hell are you waiting for hoskins cut him off call them out here he made as if to brush past pitt but he was stopped dead by an iron grip on his arm he stared uncomprehending into a pair of unblinking eyes your friends will have to wait pitt said firmly any survivors on the downed aircraft must come first how far to your camp a kilometer to the south hoskins answered compliantly the snowmobile is still operable you and your partner rehitch the sled and carry them back to your camp go easy in case they have any internal injuries you have a radio yes keep it set on frequency thirtytwo and stand by said pitt if the plane was a commercial jetliner loaded with passengers well have a real mess on our hands well stand by graham assured him pitt leaned over lily and squeezed her hand dont forget our date he said then he yanked the parka hood over his head turned and jogged back to the helicopter rubin felt a great weight smothering him from all sides as if some relentless force was driving him backward the seat belt and harness pressed cruelly into his gut and shoulders he opened his eyes and saw only vague and shadowy images as he waited for his vision to clear he tried to move his hands and arms but they seemed locked in place then his eyes gradually focused and he saw why an avalanche of snow and ice had forged through the shattered windshield entrapping his body up to the chest he made a desperate attempt to free himself after a few minutes of struggling he gave up the unyielding pressure held him like a straitjacket there was no way he could escape the cockpit without help the shock slowly began to fade and he gritted his teeth from the pain that erupted from his broken legs rubin thought it strange that his feet felt as though they were immersed in water he rationalized that it was his own blood rubin was wrong the plane had settled through the ice in water nearly three meters deep and it had flooded the cabin floor up to the seats only then did he remember ybarra he turned his head to his right and squinted through the darkness the starboard side of the aircrafts bow had been crushed inward almost to the engineers panel all he could see of the mexican delegate was a rigid upraised arm protruding from the snow and telescoped wreckage rubin turned away sick in the sudden realization that the little man who had sat at his side throughout the terrible ordeal was dead every bone crushed rubin also realized he had only a short time to live before he froze to death he began to cry she should be coming up giordino shouted over the engine and rotor noise pitt nodded and stared down at the gouge that cut across the merciless ice its sides littered with bits and pieces of jagged debris he saw it now a tangible object with mamnade straight lines imperceptibly appeared in the gloom ahead then they were on top of it there was a sad and ominous appearance about the crumplead aircraft one wing had completely ripped off and the other was twisted back against the fuselage the tail section was buckled at a pathetic angle the remains had the look of a mashed bug on a white carpet the fuselage sank through the ice and twothirds of it is immersed in water pitt observed she didnt burn said giordino thats a piece of luck he held up his hand to shade his eyes from the dazzling reflection as the helicopters lights swept the airliners length talk about highly polished skin her maintenance people took good care of her id guess she was a boeing b any sign of life none replied pitt it doesnt look good how about identification markings three stripes running down the hull light blue and purple separated by a band of gold not the colors of any airline im familiar with drop down and circle her said pitt while you spot a landing site ill try and read her lettering giordino banked and spiraled toward the wreckage the landing lights mounted on bow and tail of the helicopter exposed the halfsunken aircraft in a sea of brilliance the name above the decorative stripes was in a slantedstyle instead of the usual easier to read blocktype letters nebula pitt read aloud nebula air never heard of it said giordino his eyes fixed on the ice a plush airline that caters to vips what in hell is it doing so far from the beaten track well soon know if anybodys alive to tell us pitt turned to the eight men sitting comfortably in the warm belly of the chopper they were all appropriately clothed in blue navy arctic weather gear one was the ships surgeon three were medics and four were damagecontrol experts they chatted back and forth as casually as if they were on a bus trip to denver between them tied down by straps in the center of the floor boxes of medical supplies bundles of blankets and a rack of stretchers sat stacked beside asbestos suits and a crate of firefighting equipment an auxiliarypowered heating unit was secured opposite the main door its hoisting cables attached to an overhead winch next to it stood a compact snowmobile with an enclosed cabin and side tracks the grayhaired man seated just aft of the cockpit with gray mustache and beard to match looked back at pitt and grinned about time for us to earn our pay he asked cheerfully nothing it seemed could dim dr jack gales merry disposition were setting down now answered pitt nothing stirring around the plane no indication of fire the cockpit is buried and the fuselage looks distorted but intact nothing ever comes easy gale shrugged still it beats hell out of treating burn cases thats the full news the tough news is the main cabin is filled with nearly a meter of water and we didnt bring our galoshes gales face turned serious god help any injured who didnt stay dry they wouldnt have lasted eight minutes in freezing water if none of the survivors can open an emergency exit we may have to cut our way inside sparks from cutting equipment have a nasty habit of igniting sloshing jet fuel said lieutenant cork simon the stocky leader of the polar explorers damagecontrol team he bore the confident look of a man who knew his job inside out and then some better we go in through the main cabin door doc gale here will need all the space he can get to remove any stretcher cases i agree said pitt but a pressurized door thats been jammed against its stops by the distortion of the crash will take time to force open people may be freezing to death in there our first job is to make an opening to insert the vent pipe from the heater he broke off as giordino cut a steep turn and dropped down toward a flat area only a stones throw from the wreck everyone tensed in readiness outside the beat of the rotor blades whipped up a small blizzard of snow and ice particles turning the landing site into an alabastercolored stew that wiped out all vision giordino had barely touched the wheels to the ice and set the throttles on idle when pitt shoved open the loading door jumped into the cold and headed toward the wreckage behind him doc gale began directing the unloading of supplies while cork simon and his team willched the auxiliary heater and the snowmobile onto the ice halfrunning halfslipping pi made a visual inspection of the interior of the fuse lage carefully avoiding open breaks in the ice the air reeked with the unwelcome smell of jet fuel he climbed up the ice mound that was piled a meter thick over the cockpit windows climbing the slick surface was like crawling up a greased ramp he tried to scoop an opening into the cockpit but quickly gave it up it would have taken an hour or more to dig through the packed ice and then tunnel inside he slid down and ran around to the remaining wing the right section was twisted and broken from its supporting mounts the tip pointing toward the tail it lay on the ice crushed against the sunken fuselage only an arms length below the row of windows using the wing as a platform over the open water pitt dropped to his hands and knees and tried to peer inside the lights from the helicopter reflected off the plexiglas and he had to cup his hands around his eyes to close out the glare at first he could not detect any movement only darkness and a deathly stillness then quite suddenly a grotesque face materialized on the other side of the window scant centimeters from pitts eyes he unconsciously stepped back the sudden appearance of a woman with a cut over one eye and blood flowing over half the features all distorted by the hairline cracks running through the window startled pitt momentarily he quickly shook off the shock and studied the unblemished side of the face the high cheekbones the long dark hair and one olivebrown eye was enough to suggest a very beautiful woman pitt thought charitably he leaned close to the window and yelled can you open an emergency exit hatch the plucked eyebrow raised a fraction but the eye looked blank do you hear me at that instant simons men fired up the auxiliary power unit and a stand of floodlights flashed on illuminating the aircraft in a glare as bright as daylight they quickly connected the heater unit and simon began dragging the flexible hose across the ice over here on the wing pitt waved and bring something to cut through a window the damagecontrol team had been trained for emergency ship repair and they went about their trade competent and without wasted movement as if rescuing trapped passengers from a downed airplane was an everyday exercise when pitt turned back the womans face was gone simon and one of his team scrambled up on the twisted wing struggling to keep their footing while tugging the widemouthed heater hose behind pitt felt a blast of hot air and was amazed that the heating unit required so little time to warm up well need a fire ax to break through said pitt simon feigned a haughty look give the us navy credit for a touch of finesse weve advanced far beyond crude chopping methods he removed a compact batterypowered tool from his coat pocket he pushed the switch and a small abrasive wheel on one end began to spin goes through aluminum and plexiglas like butter do your stuff pitt said dryly moving back out of the way simon was as good as his word the little cutting device sliced through the thick exterior window in less than two minutes the sheet inside took only seconds pitt hunched down and extended his arm inside and beamed a flashlight there was no sign of the woman the cold water of the fjord glittered under the lights ray the water lapped at the edge of empty nearby seats simon and pitt inserted the end of the heater hose through the window and then hurried around to the forward section of the aircraft the navy men had reached under the water and released the latch to the main exit door but as expected it was jammed they rapidly drilled holes and screwed in stainlesssteel hooks which were attached to cables leading to the snowmobile the driver engaged the clutch and the snowmobile slowly inched ahead until the slack was taken up then he revved the engine the metal spikes of the treads dug in and the little snowmobile strained forward for a few seconds nothing seemed to happen there was only the growl of the exhaust and the crunching noise of the treads as they chiseled their way into the ice after an anxious wait a new sound broke the coldan unearthly screeching of protesting metal and then the lower edge of the cabin door raised out of the water the cables were unhooked and the entire rescue crew crouched down set their shoulders against the door and heaved upward until it creaked almost to a full open position the inside of the plane was dark and ominous pitt leaned across the narrow stretch of open water and stared into the unknown his stomach churning with morbid curiosity his figure threw a shadow over the water in the aisle of the main cabin and at first he saw nothing but the gleam from the walls of the galley it was strangely quiet and there was no sign of human remains pitt hesitated and looked back doc gale and his medical team were standing behind him staring in grim anticipation while simons men were unreeling cable from the power unit to light the planes interior going in pitt said he jumped across the opening into the plane he landed on the deck in water that splashed over his knees his legs felt like they had been suddenly stabbed by a thousand needles he waded around the bulkhead and into the aisle separating the seats of the passenger cabin the eerie silence was unnerving the only sound came from the sloshing of his movement then he froze in shock his worst fears unfolding like the petals of a poisonous flower pitt found himself exchanging blank looks with a sea of ghostly white faces none moved none blinked none spoke they just sat strapped in their seats and stared at him with the sightless expression of the dead a chill colder than the freezing air spread over the back of pitts neck the light from outside filtered through the windows casting eerie shadows on the walls he looked from seat to seat as if expecting one of the passengers to wave a greeting or say something but they sat as still as mummies in a tomb he leaned over a man with slickedback redblond hair precisely parted down the middle of the skull who sat in an aisle seat there was no expression of agony on the face the eyes were half open as if they were about to close in sleep the lips met natumfly the jaw slightly loose pitt lifted a limp hand and placed his fingertips just below the base of the thumb and pressed against the artery running beneath the skin on the inner side of the wrist his touch felt no pulsationsthe heart had stopped anything asked doc gale wading past him and examining another passenger hes gone replied pin sos this one from what cause cant tell yet no apparent injuries dead only a short time no indication of intense pain or struggle skin coloring doesnt suggest asphyxiation if he last fits said pitt the oxygen masks are still in the overhead panels gale quickly moved from body to body ill know better after a more thorough examination he paused as simon finished mounting a light unit above the doorway and safely above the water the naval officer motioned outside and suddenly the interior of the passenger cabin was flooded with light pitt surveyed the cabin the only noticeable damage was a slight distortion in the ceiling all seats were in an upright position and the seat belts buckled impossible to believe they just sat here half immersed in ice water and died from hypothermia without making any movement he said while checking an elderly brownhaired woman for life signs there was no hint of suffering in her face she looked as if she had simply fallen asleep a small rosary hung loosely from her fingers obviously all were dead before the plane struck the ice offered gale a valid answer pitt murmured rapidly scanning the seat rows as if searching for someone death probably came from toxic fumes smell anything no neither do i what does that leave us digested poison gale stared at pitt a long hard moment youre talking mass murder we appear to be headed in that direction might help if we had a witness we do gale stiffened and hurriedly looked over the white faces you spot someone still breathing point him out before we broke inside pitt explained a woman stared at me through a window she was alive i dont see her now before gale could reply simon sloshed down the aisle and stopped his eyes bulging with shock and incomprehension what in hell he stiffened and stared wildly around the cabin they look like figures in a wax museum try cadavers in a morgue said pitt dryly theyre dead everyone youre absolutely sure someone is alive answered pitt either in the cockpit or hiding out in the bathrooms to the rear then theyre in need of my attention said gale pitt nodded i think it best if you continue your examination in the slim chance theres a spark of life in any of these people simon can check the cockpit area ill head aft and search the bathrooms what about all these stiffs asked simon irreverently shouldnt we alert commander knight and begin evacuating them leave them be pitt said quietly and stay off the radio well make our report to commander knight in person keep your men outside seal the door and place the interior of the aircraft off limits same goes for your medical team doc touch nothing unless its absolutely necessary somethings happened here beyond our depth word of the crash has already gone out within hours aircrash investigators and the news media will be swarming around like locusts best to keep what weve found under wraps until we hear from the proper authorities simon weighed pitts words for a moment i get the picture then lets get a move on and find a survivor what was normally a twentysecond walk took pitt nearly two minutes of struggle through the thighhigh water before he reached the bathrooms his feet had already turned numb and he didnt require the services of doc gale to tell him hed have to dry and warm them in the next half hour or risk frostbite the death toll would have been much higher if the plane had carried a full load of passengers but even with many of the seats vacant he still counted fiftythree bodies he paused to examine a female flight attendant seated against the rear bulkhead her head was tilted forward and blond hair spilled across her face he felt no pulse he reached the compartment containing the bathrooms three had the vacant sign showing and he peered inside they were empty the fourth read occupied and was locked someone had to be inside to have slipped the latch he knocked loudly on the door and said can you understand me help is here please try to unlock the door pitt put his ear to the panel and thought he heard a soft sobbing from the other side followed by low murmurs as if two people were conversing in hushed tones he raised his voice stand back im going to force the door pitt raised his dripping leg and gave a sharp but controlled kick just enough to break the latch without smashing the door against whoever was inside his heel impacted just above the knob and the catch ripped from the jam the door gave about an inch a gentle nudge with his shoulder and it swung inward two women were huddled in the cramped rear of the bathroom standing on top of the toilet platform out of the water shivering and clutching each other for support actually the one doing the clutching was a uniformed flight attendant her eyes wide with alarm and the fear of a trapped doe she was standing on her right leg the left was stiffly extended to the side a wrenched knee pitt guessed the other woman straightened and stared back at pitt defiantly pitt immediately recognized her as the apparition at the window part of her face was still masked with coagulated blood but both eyes were open now and had the cold look of hatred pitt was surprised at her hostility who are you and what do you want she demanded in a husky voice with a slight trace of an accent a dumb question was the first thought that crossed pitts mind but he quickly wrote off the womans testy challenge to shock he smiled his best boy scout trustworthy smile my name is dirk pitt im part of a rescue team from the united states ship polar explorer can you prove it sorry i left my drivers license at home this was bordering on the ridiculous he tried another tack and leaned against the door frame and casually crossed his arms please rest easy he said soothingly i want to help not harm you the flight attendant seemed to relax for an instant her eyes softened and the edges of her lips lifted in a timid smile then abruptly the fear returned and she sobbed hysterically theyre all dead murdered yes i know said pitt gently he held out his hand let me take you where its warm and the ships doctor can tend your injuries pitts face was shadowed by the floodlights irt the forward part of the cabin and the stronger woman of the two could not read his eyes you might be one of the terrorists who caused all this she said in a controlled tone why should we trust you because youll freeze to death if you dont pitt tired of the word games he stepped forward carefully lifted the flight attendant in his arms and eased her out into the aisle she offered him no resistance but her body was stiff with apprehension just relax he said pretend youre scarlett ohara and im rhett butler come to sweep you off your feet i dont feel much like scarlett i must look a mess not to me pitt grinned how about dinner some night can my husband come along only if he picks up the check she gave in then and he felt her body sag in exhausted relief slowly her arms circled his neck and she buried her head in his shoulder he paused and turned to the other woman the warmth of his smile was revealed and his eyes glinted in the light hang tight ill be right back for you for the first time hala knew she was safe only then did the dam holding back the nightmare of fright the stunning disbelief that any of this was happening to her flood over the gates the suppressed emotions ran free and she wept rubin knew he was slipping away the cold and the pain had ceased to exist the strange voices the sudden display of light formed no meaning for him he felt detached to his confused mind they were like obscure recollections from a distant place a former time suddenly a white brilliance filled the shattered cockpit he wondered if this was the light at the end of the tunnel people who had died and returned claimed to have experienced a disembodied voice nearby said take it easy take it easy rubin tried to focus his eyes on a vague figure hovering over him are you god simons face went blank for a brief moment then he smiled compassionately only a mere mortal who happened to be in the neighborhood im not dead sorry but if im any judge of age youll have to wait at least another fifty years i cant move my legs feel like theyre pinned i think they might be broken please please get me out thats why im here said simon cheerfully he used his hands to scoop a good foot of ice and snow away from rubins upper torso until the trapped arms came free there now you can scratch your nose until i return with a shovel and cutting tools simon reentered the main cabin as pitt was easing the flight attendant through the door into the waiting arms of gales medics who gently lowerrd her onto a stretcher hey doc ive got a live one in the cockpit on my way replied gale i could use your help too simon said to pitt pitt nodded give me a couple of minutes to carry another from the aft section hala slid to her knees and leaned over and looked into the mirror there was enough light to clearly see her reflection the face that stared back was flateyed and expressionless it was also a disaster she looked like an overthehill streetwalker who had been beaten up by her pimp she reached out and pulled several paper towels from a rack she dipped them in the cold water then wiped clear the clotted blood and lipstick which had smeared around her mouth her mascara and eye shadow looked as if they had been applied by jackson pollock on a drip painting she wiped away that mess too her hair was still reasonably intact so she patted the loose ends into place she still looked awful she thought despairingly she forced a smile when pitt reappeared hoping she looked more presentable he looked at her a long moment and then screwed his face into an expression of awed curiosity excuse me gorgeous creature but have you seen an old crone anywhere tears welled in halas eyes and she halflaughed halfcried youre a nice man mr pitt thank you i try god icnows i try he said humorously pitt had returned with several blankets and he bundled them around her he placed one arm under her knees and the other around her waist and lifted her without the slightest sign of strain as he carried her up the aisle his numbed legs began to give out and he stumbled for several steps before recovering are you all right she asked nothing a shot of jack daniels tennessee whiskey wont cure as soon as i return home ill send you a whole case wheres home at the moment new york next time im in town lets have dinner together id consider it an honor mister pitt likewise miss kaniil hala raised her eyebrows you recognized me looking horrible like this i admit it wasnt until after youd fixed your face a bit forgive me for putting you to all this trouble your legs and feet must be frozen stiff a minor discomfort is a small price for freezingi held the secretarygeneral of the un in my arms amazing truly amazing thought pitt this has to be a redbanner day dating the only three women and attractive ones at that within two thousand miles of frigid desolation inside of minutes had to be some sort of record the feat meant more to him than discovering the russian submarine fifteen minutes later after hala rubin and the flight attendant were comfortably settled inside the helicopter pitt stood in front of the cockpit and waved to giordino who acknowledged with a thumbs up sign the rotors were engaged and the craft rose in the air above a swirling cloud of snow swung around a hundred and eighty degrees and headed for the polar explorer only when it was safely airborne and on its way did pitt hobble over to the auxiliary heating unit he pulled off his waterlogged boots and soggy socks and dangled his feet over the exhaust soaking up the heat and gratefully accepting the stabbing pain of recirculation he became vaguely aware of simons approach simon stopped and stood gazing at the wrinkled sides of the aircraft it did not look forlorn any more to him the knowledge of the dead inside gave it a camel house appearance united nations delegates simon said distantly is that who they were several were members of the general assembly answered pitt the lized agencies according to kamil most of them were returning from a tour of their field service organizations whod gain by murdering them pitt wrung out his socks and laid them over the heater tube i have no idea middle east terrorists simon persisted news to me theyve taken up murder by poison howre your feet in a state of gradual thaw how about yours the navy issues foulweather boots mine are dry and warm as toast hooray for considerate admirals pitt muttered sardonically id say one of the three survivors did the dirty work pitt shook his head if in fact it proves to be poison it probably was introduced into the meal at the food services kitchen before it was loaded on board the aircraft the chief steward or a flight attendant could have done it in the galley too difficult to poison over fifty meals one at a time without being detected what about the drinks simon tested again youre a persistent bastard might as well speculate until were relieved pitt checked his socks they were still damp okay drinks are a possibility especially coffee and tea simon seemed pleased that one of his theories had been accepted okay smartass of the three survivors whos your candidate for most duly suspect none of the above you saying the culprit knowingly took the poison and committed suicide no im saying it was the fourth survivor i only counted three after the plane crashed before that there were four you dont mean the little mexican fellow in the copilots seat i do simon looked totally skeptical what brilliant logic brought you to that conclusion elementary pitt said with a sly grin the killer in the best murdermystery tradition is always the least obvious suspect who dealt this mess julius schiller under secretary for political affairs grimaced goodnaturedly as he studied his cards his teeth clamped on a cold stogie he looked up and peered over his hand his intelligent blue eyes moving from player to player four men sat across the poker table from him none smoked and schiller diplomatically refrained from lighting his cigar a small bundle of cedar logs crackled in an antique mariners stove taking the edge off an early fall chill the burning cedar gave an agreeable aroma to the teakpaneled dining saloon inside schillers yacht the beautifully proportioned metermotor sailer was moored in the potomac river near south island just opposite alexandria virginia soviet deputy chief of mission aleksey korolenko heavybodied and composed wore a fixed jovial expression that had become his trademark in washingtons social circles a pity were not playing in moscow he said in a stern but mocking tone i know a nice spot in siberia where we could send the dealer i second the motion said schiller he looked at the man wfio had dealt the cards next time date shuffle them up if your hands are so rotten growled dale nichols special assistant to the president why dont you fold senator george pitt who headed up the senate foreign relations committee stood and removed a salmoncolored sport jacket he draped it over the back of the chair and turned to yuri vyhousky i dont know what these guys are complaining about you and i have yet to will a pot the soviet embassys special adviser on american affairs nodded i havent seen a good hand since we all began playing five years ago the nightly poker sessions had indeed been held on sctfillers boat since and went far beyond a simple card game between friends who needed one evening out of the week to unwilld it was originally set up as a small crack in the wall separating the opposing superpowers alone without an official setting and inaccessible to the news media they could informally give and take viewpoints while ignoring bureaucratic red tape and diplomatic protocol ideas and information were exchanged that often had a direct bearing on sovietamerican relations i open for fifty cents announced schiller ill raise that a dollar said korolenko and they wonder why we dont trust them nichols groaned the senator spoke to korolenko without looking at him whats the prediction from your side on open revolt in egypt aleksey i give president hasan no more than days before his government is overthrown by akhmad yazid you dont see a prolonged fight no not if the military throws its weight behind yazid you in senator asked nichols ill go along for the ride yujri vyhousky dropped fiftycent pieces in the pot since husan took over after mubaraks resignation said schiller hes achieved a level of stability i hell holdon you said the same about the shah of iran korolenko goaded no denying we called the wrong shots schffler paused and dropped his throwaway cards on the table let me have two korolenko held up one finger and received his card you might as well pour your massive aid into a bottomless pit the egyptian masses are on the brink of starvation a situation that fuels the surge of religious fanaticism sweeping the slums and villages you stand as little chance of stopping yazid as you did khomeini and what is the kremlins stance asked senator pitt we wait said korolenko impassively we wait until the dust settles schiller eyed his cards and shifted them around no matter the outcome nobody wills true we all lose you may be the great satan in the eyes of islamic fundamentalists but as good communist atheists were not loved either i dont have to tell you the biggest loser is israel with the disastrous defeat of iraq by iran and the assassination of president saddam husayn the road is now open for him and syria to threaten the moderate arab nations into combining forces for a massive threefront attack against israel the jews will surely be defeated this time the senator shook his head doubtfully the israelis have the finest fighting machine in the middle east theyve won before and theyre prepared to do it again not against human wave attacks by nearly two million arabs warned vyhousky assads forces will drive south while yazids egyptians attack north across the sinai as they did in sixtyseven and seventythree only this time hans army will sweep over saudi arabia and jordan crossing the river jordan from the west despite their fighting skills and superior technology the israelis will be overwhelmed and when the slaughter finally ends added korolenko ominously the west will be thrown into a state of economic depression when the united muslim governments with total control of fiftyfive percent of the worlds oil reserves drive prices to astronomical heights as they surely will your bet nichols said to schiller two bucks raise you two came korolenko vyhousky threw his cards on the table i fold the senator contemplated his hand a moment ill match the four and raise another four the sharks are circling said nichols with a tight smile count me out lets not kid ourselves said the senator its no secret the israelis have a small arsenal of nuclear weapons and they wont hesitate to use them if theyre down to the last roll of the dice schiller sighed deeply i dont even like to think about the consequences he looked up as his boats skipper knocked on the door and hesitantly stepped in excuse me for interrupting mr schiller but theres an important call for you schiller pushed his cards toward nichols no sense in prolonging the agony with this hand would you excuse me one of the cardinal niles of the weekly gettogether was no phone calls unless it was a matter of urgency that in some way concerned everyone at the table the game continued but the four men played automatically their curiosity mounting your bet aleksey said the senator raise you another four dollars i call korolenko shrugged resignedly and laid down his cards face up all he had was a pair of fours the senator smiled wryly and turned over his cards he won with a pair of sixes oh good lord moaned nichols i dropped out with a pair of kings there goes your lunch money aleksey vyhousky laughed so we bluffed each other said korolenko now i know why i wont buy a used car from an american politician the senator leaned back in his chair and ran a hand through a thick mane of silver hair as a matter of fact i worked my way through law school selling cars best training i ever had for running for the senate schiller reentered the room and sat down at the table sorry to leave but ive just been notified that a chartered united nations plane crashed on the coast of northern greenland over fifty known dead no word on survivors any soviet representatives on board asked vyhousky the passenger list hasnt come through yet a terrorist bombing too early to tell but first sketchy reports say it was no accident what flight was it nichols asked london to new york northern greenland nichols repeated thoughtfully they must have strayed over a thousand miles off course smells of a hijacking suggested vyhousky rescue units are on the site explained schiller we should know more within the hour the expression on senator pitts face darkened i have a dire suspicion that hala kamil was on that flight she was due back at united nations headquarters from europe for next weeks session of the general assembly i believe george is right said vyhousky two of our soviet delegates were traveling in her party madness said schiller wearily shaking his head utter madness who would gain by murdering a planeload of un people no one answered immediately there was a long moments silence korolenko stared expressionless at the center of the table then he spoke in a quiet voice the senator stared the russian straight in the eye you knew i guessed you think yazid ordered kamils death i can only say our intelligence sources discovered there was an islamic faction in cairo that was planning an attempt and you stood by and said nothing while fifty innocent people died a miscalculation admitted korolenko we did not know how or when the assassination was to take place it was assumed kmfls life would be in danger only if she went to egyptnot from yazid lf but rather his fanatical followers yazid has never been tied to any terrorist acts your profile of him reads the same as ours a brilliant man who thinkqs of himself as a muslim gandhi so much for kgb and cia profiles said vyhousky candidly another classic case of intelligence experts being suckered by a wellconceived publicrelations campaign sighed the senator the man is a bigger psycho case than we figured schiller nodded in agreement yazid has to be responsible for the tragedy his followers would never have considered it without his blessing he had the motive said nichols kamil has immense flair and charm her level of popularity with the people and the military far exceeds president hasans she was a strong buffer if shes dead egypt is only hours away from a government led by extremist mullahs and when hasan falls asked korolenko slyly what will be the white house position then schiller and nichols exchanged knowing looks why the same as the kremlins said schiller were going to wait until the dust settles for a moment the fixed smile faded from korolenkos face and if make that when the combined arab nations attack the jewish state well back israel to the hilt as we have in the past but will you send in american forces probably not arab leaders might be less cautious if only they knew that be our guest only remember this time were not going to use our leverage to stop the israelis from taking cairo beirut and damascus youre saying the president wont stand in their way if they resort to nuclear weapons something like that schiller said with studied indifference he turned to nichols whose deal i believe its mine said the senator trying his best to sound casual this switch in the presidents middle east policy was news to him shall we ante fifty cents the russians were not about to let loose i find this most disturbing said vyhousky a new posture had to come sometime nichols confessed the latest projections put united states oil reserves at eighty billion barrels with prices pushing fifty dollars a barrel our oil companies can now afford to mount a massive exploration program and of course we can still count on mexican and south american reserves the bottom line is that we no longer have to rely on the middle east for oil so were cutting bait if the soviet government wants to inherit the arab mess take it as a gift korolenko couldnt believe what he was hearing his ingrained wariness made him skeptical but he knew the americans too well to doubt they would bluff or mislead him on an issue of such magnitude senator pitt had his doubts too about the game plan the president was leaking to the soviet representatives there was a strong possibility oil would not flow over the rio grande when america needed it mexico was a revolution waiting for the starters gun egypt was cursed with a dark ages fanatic like yazid but mexico had its madman in a topiltzin a benito juarezemilio zapata messiah who preached a return to a religious state based on aztec culture like yazid topiltzin was supported by millions of his nations poor and he was also inches away from sweeping out the existing government where were all the madmen coming from the senator wondered who was spawning these devils he made a conscious effort to keep his hands steady as he began to deal five card stud gentlemen jokers wild huge figures rose up in the eerie silence of the night and gazed through empty eyes at the barren landscape as if waiting for some unknown presence to bring them to life the stark rigid figures stood as tall as a twostory building their grim expressionless faces highlighted by a full moon a thousand years ago they had supported a temple roof that sat on top of the fivestep pyramid of quetzalcoatl in the toltec city of tula the temple was gone but the pyramid remained and was reconstructed by archaeologists the ruins stretched along a low ridge and during the citys glory sixtythousand people lived and walked on its streets few visitors found their way to the site and those who took the trouble were awed by tvias haunted desolation the moon cast ghostly shadows through the dead city as a solitary man climbed the steep steps of the pyramid to the stone statues at the summit he was dressed in a suit and tie and carried a leather attached case at each of the five terraces he stopped for a few moments and peered at the macabre sculptured friezes decorating the walls human faces protruded from the gaping mouths of serpents while eagles shredded human hearts with their beaks he continued passing an altar carved with skulls and crossbones symbols used in later centuries by pirates of the caribbean he was sweating when he finally reached the top of the pyramid and looked around he was not alone two figures stepped forward and roughly searched him they motioned at his attache case he obligingly opened it and the men rummaged through the contents finding no weapons they silently retreated to the edge of the temple platform rivas relaxed and pressed a hidden switch on the handle of the case a small tape recorder secreted inside the lid began to roll after a short minute had passed a figure emerged from the shadows of the great stone statues he was dressed in a floorlength robe of white cloth his hair was long and tied at the base giving it the look of a rooster tail his feet were hidden under the robe but the moons light revealed circular bands around his arms that were carved from gold and inlaid with turquoise he was short and the smooth oval face suggested indian ancestry his dark eyes studied the tall faircomplexioned man before him taking in the oddlyoutofplace business suit he crossed his arms and spoke strange words that sounded almost lyrical i am topiltzin my name is guy rivas special representative for the president of the united states rivas had expected an older man it was difficult to guess the mexican messiahs age but he didnt look a year over thirty topiltzin gestured to a low wall shall we sit while we talk rivas nodded a thank you and sat down you chose a most unusual setting yes i thought it appropriate topiltzins tone suddenly turned contemptuous your president was afraid for us to confer openly he did not want to embarrass and anger his friends in mexico city rivas knew better than to be baited the president asked me to express his gratitude for allowing me to talk with you i expected someone with a higher rank of state your conditions were youd speak with only one man we took that to mean no interpreter for our side and since you do not wish to speak spanish or english i am the only ranking government official who has a tongue for nahuatl the language of the aztecs you speak it very well my family immigrated to america from the town of escampo they taught it to me when i was quite young i know escampo a small village with proud people who barely survive you claim youll end poverty in mexico the president is most interested in your programs is that why he sent you topiltzin asked rivas nodded he wishes to open a line of communication there was silence as a grim smile crossed topiltzins features a shrewd man because of my countrys economic collapse he knows my movement will sweep the ruling partido revolutionary institutional out of office and he fears an upheaval in us and mexican relations so he plays both ends against the middle i cant read the presidents mind he will soon learn the great majority of mexican people are finished with being doormats for the ruling class and wealthy they are sick of political fraud and corruption they are tired of digging garbage in the slums they will suffer no more by building a utopia from the dust of the aztecs your own nation would do well to return to the ways of your founding fathers the aztecs were the biggest butchers in the americas to fashion a modern government on ancient barbarian beliefs is rivas paused he almost said idiotic instead he pulled back and said naive topiltzins round face tensed and his hands worked compulsively you forget it was the spanish conquistadors who slaughtered our common ancestors spain could say the same about the moors which would hardly justify restoring the inquisition what does your president want from me merely peace and prosperity in mexico replied rivas holding the line and a promise you will not steer a course toward communism i am not a marxist i detest communists as much as he does no armed guerrillas exist among my followers hell be glad to hear it our new aztec nation will attain greatness once the criminally wealthy the corrupt officials and present government and army leaders are sacrificed rivas wasnt sure he interpreted right youre talking about the execution of thousands of people no mr rivas im talking sacrificial victims for our revered gods quetzalcoad huitzilopochtli tezcatlipoca rivas looked at him not comprehending sacrificial victims topiltzin did not reply rivas staring at the stoic face suddenly knew no he burst out you cant be serious our country will again be known by its aztec name of tenochtitian topiltzin continued impassively we shall be a religious state nahuatl will become our official language population will be brought under control by stern measures foreign industries will be the property of the state only the native born can be allowed to live within our borders all others will be expelled from the country rivas was stunned he sat whitefaced listening in silence topiltzin went on without pause no more goods are to be purchased from the united states nor will you be allowed to buy our oil our debts to world banks will be declared null and void and all foreign assets confiscated i also demand the return of our lands in california texas new mexico and arizona to ensure this return i intend to turn loose millions of my people across the border topiltzins threats were nothing short of frightening rivass distraught mind could not conceive the terrible consequences pure madness rivas said desperately the president will never listen to such absurd demands he will not believe what i say no sane man would rivas in his uneasiness had stepped too far topiltzin slowly rose to his feet eyes unblinking head lowered and spoke in a toneless voice then i must send him a message he will understand he raised his hands over his head arms outstretched toward the dark sky as if on cue four indians appeared wearing white capes clasped at the neck and nothing else approaching from all sides they quickly subdued rivas who froze in astonishment they carried him to the stone altar sculpted with the skulls and crossbones and threw him on his back holding him down by the arms and legs at first rivas was too dazed to protest too incredulous with shock to comprehend topiltzins intention when horrorstruck realization came he cried out oh god no no topiltzin coldly ignored the terrified american the pitiful fright in his eyes and stepped to the side of the altar he gave a nod and one of the men ripped away rivass shirt exposing the chest dont do this rivas pleaded a razorsharp obsidian knife seemed to materialize in topiltzins upraised left hand the moonlight glinted from the black glassy blade as it hung poised rivas screamedthe last sound he would ever make then the knife plunged the tall columnstatues looked down upon the bloody act with stonecold indifference they had witnessed the horrible display of inhuman cruelty thousands of times a thousand years ago there was no pity in their timeworn chiseled eyes as rivass stillbeating heart was torn from his chest despite the people and activity around him pitt was captivated by the dense silence of the cold north there was an incredible stillness about it that seemed to overwhelm the voices and sounds of machinery he felt as though he were standing in numbing solitude inside a refrigerator on a desolate world daylight finally appeared filtered by a peculiar gray mist that permitted no shadows by midmorning the sun began to burn away the icy haze and the sky turned a soft orangewhite the ethereal light made the rocky peaks overlooking the fjord look like tombstones in a snowcovered cemetery the scene surrounding the crash site was beginning to resemble a military invasion a fleet of five air force helicopters had been the first to arrive ferrying an army special service force of heavily armed and determinedlooking men who immediately cordoned off the fuselage and began patrolling the entire area an hour later federal aviation accident investigators landed and set about marking the scattered wreckage for removal they were followed by a team of pathologists who tagged and removed the bodies to the helicopters which quickly airlifted them to the morgue at tule air force base the navy was represented by commander knight and the unexpected appearance of the polar explorer all halted their grisly chores and turned their eyes toward the sea as a series of loud whoops from the ships siren echoed off the jagged mountains dodging newlyformed ice calves floating low and opaque and the winters first bergs which resembled the ruins of gothic castles the polar explorer came about slowly and entered the mouth of the fjord for a time the ashblue sea hissed quietly past the scarred and then it turned to white the immense prow of the icebreaker effortlessly bulldozed a path through the ice pack heaving to less than fifty meters from the wreckage knight stopped engines climbed down a ladder to the ice and graciously offered the facilities of the ship to the security and investigation teams as a command postan offer that was thankfully accepted without a seconds hesitation pitt was impressed with the security the news blackout had not yet been penetrated the story given out at kennedy airport revealed only that the un flight was overdue it was only a matter of another hour before a shrewd correspondent got wise and blew the whistle i think my eyeballs just froze to their lids giordino said gloomily he was sitting in the pilots seat of the numa helicopter trying to drink a cup of coffee before it froze must be colder than a minnesota dairy cows tit in january pitt gave his friend a dubious look how would you know you havent been outside your heated cockpit all night i get frostbite by looking at an ice cube in a glass of scotch giordino held up one hand five fingers an all spread look at that im so stiff with cold i cant make a fist pitt happened to glance out the side window and spotted commander knight trudging over the ice from the ship he walked back to the cabin and opened the cargo door when knight reached the boarding ladder giordino moaned in selfpity as his precious heat escaped and a frigid breeze engulfed the interior of the chopper knight waved a greeting and climbed on board exhaling clouds of vapor he reached inside his parka and produced a leathercovered flask a little something from the sick bay cognac cant begin to guess the brand thought you might find a good use for it i think you just sent giordino to heaven pitt said laughing id rather be in hell giordino muttered he tipped the flask and savored the brandy as it trickled into his stomach then he raised his hand again and made a fist i im cured might as well settle in said knight weve been ordered to remain on station for the next twentyfour hours if youll pardon the awful pun they want to keep us on ice until the cleanup is over how are the survivors doing inquired pitt miss kamil is resting comfortably incidentally she asked to see you something about having dinner together in new york dinner asked pitt innocently fullny thing knight continued just before doc gale surgically repaired the flight attendants torn knee ligaments she mentioned a dinner date with you too pitt had a pureasthedrivensnow expression on his face i guess they must be hungry giordino rolled his eyes and tilted the flask again i ive heard this song before and the steward rough shape knight replied but doc thinks hell pull through his name is rubin while he was slipping under the anesthetic he babbled some wild story about the pilot murdering the first and second officers and then vanishing in flight maybe not so wild said pitt the pilots body has yet to be found not my territory knight shagged ive got enough to worry about without getting bogged down in an unsolved air mystery where do we stand on the russian sub asked giordino we keep the lid on our discovery until we can report face to face with the big brass at the pentagon stupid to fumble away the ball away through a communications leak a piece of luck for us at any rate the plane crashing gives us the logical excuse to set a course for home and our dock in portsmouth as soon as the survivors can be airlifted to a stateside hospital lets hope the unexpected diversion will confuse soviet intelligence analysts enough to get them off our back dont count on it giordino said his face beginning to glow if the russians had the slightest suspicion we struck pay dirt and theyre paranoid enough to think our side caused the plane crash as a diversion theyll come charging in with salvage ships a protective fleet of warships a swarm of covering aircraft and when they pinpoint the sub raise and tow it back to their station at severomorsk on the kola peninsula or blow it into smithereens pitt added destroy it the soviets dont have major salvage technology their prime objective would be to make certain no one else laid hands on it giordino passed the cognac to pitt no sense debating the cold war here why dont we return to the ship where its nice and warm might as well said knight you two have already done more than your share pitt stretched and began zipping up his parka think ill take a hike youre not coming back with us in a bit thought id look in on the archaeologists and see how they are wasted trip doc sent one of his medics over to their camp hes already reported back except for a few bruises and strains they were all fine might find it interesting to see what theyve dug up pitt persisted giordino was an old hand at reading pitts mind maybe theyve found a few old greek amphoras lying around wont hurt to ask knight gave pitt the benefit of a hard stare mind what you say i have our geological survey story down pat and the aircraft passengers and crew they were all trapped among the wreckage and died from hypothermia brought on by exposure to the frigid water i think hes ready for the big sting said giordino dryly good knight nodded youve got the right idea just dont suggest anything they have no reason to know pitt opened the cargo door and gave a casual nod dont wait up then he stepped into the cold persistent cuss knight muttered i didnt know pitt was interested in antiquities giordino gazed through the cockpit window as pitt set off across the fjord then he sighed neither did he the ice field was firm and flat and pitt made good time across the fjord he scanned the ominous gray cloud ceiling rolling in from the northwest the weather could change from bright sunshine to a blinding blizzard within minutes and obliterate all landmarks he wasnt keen on wandering lost without even a compass and he increased his pace a pair of white gyrfalcons soared above him seemingly immune to the arctic cold they were a select group of birds that remained in the north during the harsh winter moving in a southerly direction he crossed the shoreline and kept his bearings on the smoke that rose above the archaeologists hut the distant and indistinct smudge appeared as though seen through the wrong end of a telescope pitt was only ten minutes away from the camp when the storm struck one minute he could see nearly twenty kilometers the next his visibility was cut to less than five meters he started jogging desperately hoping he was traveling in something remotely resembling a straight line the horizontally driving snow came against his left shoulder and he leaned into it slightly to compensate for his drift the wind increased and beat against him until he could barely stand he shuffled blindly forward looking down at his feet counting his strides his arms huddled about his head he knew it was impossible to walk sightless without gradually wandering in a circle he was also aware that he could walk past the archaeolgists hut missing it by a few meters and stumble on until he dropped from exhaustion despite the high windchill factor his heavy clothing kept him reasonably warm and he could tell by his heartbeat that he was not unduly exerting himself pitt paused when he calculated that he was in the approximate vicinity of the hut he continued walking another thirty paces before stopping again he turned to his right and moved over about three meters until he could still see his footprints trailing off in the blowing snow from the opposite direction then he walked parallel to his original path mowing the lawn as if he was searching for an object beneath the sea he took about sixty steps before his old footprints faded and disappeared m the snow he walked five lanes before he swung to his right again repeating the pattern until he was sure he had retraced the now obliterated center line then he picked up the grid again on the other side on the third lane he stumbled into a snowdrift and fell against a metal wall he followed it around two corners before meeting a rope that led to a door with a great sigh of relief pitt pushed open the door savoring the knowledge that his life had been in danger and he had won he stepped inside and tensed this was not the living quarters but rather a large quonsetlike shelter covering a series of excavations in the exposed earth the interior temperature was not much above freezing but he was thankful to be safe from the galeforce wind the only light came from a coleman lantern at first he thought the structure was deserted but then a head and pair of shoulders seemed to rise up from a trough in the ground the figure was kneeling facing away from pitt and seeming absorbed in carefully scraping loose gravel from a small shelf in the trough pitt stepped from the shadows and looked down youready he asked lily spun around more puzzled than startled the light was in her eyes and all she could make out was a vague form ready for what to go out on the town the voice came back to her she lifted the lamp and slowly rose to her feet she looked into his face captivated once again by pitts eyes while he was taken by her dark red hair that looked like fire under the bright light of the hissing coleman mr pitt isnt it she slipped off her right glove and extended her hand he also removed his glove reached out and gave her hand a firm squeeze i prefer attractive ladies to call me dirk she felt like an embarrassed little girl mad at herself for not having any makeup on wondering if he noticed the calluses on her hand and to make it worse she could feel herself blushing lily sharp she stammered my friends and i were hoping we could thank you for last night i thought you were joking about dinner i really didnt think id see you again as you can hear he paused and tilted his head toward the moaning wind outside a blizzard couldnt keep me away you must be crazy no just stupid for thinking i could outrun an arctic storm they both laughed and the tension fell away lily began to climb out of the excavation trough pitt took her arm and helped her up she winced and he quickly released his grip you shouldnt be on your feet lily smiled gamely stiff and a little sore from a sea of blackandblue marks i cant show you but ill live pitt held up the lantern and peered around the oddly grouped rocks and excavations just what is it you have here an ancient eskimo village inhabited one hundred to five hundred years after christ have you a name for it we call the site gronquist bay village after dr hiram gronquist who discovered it five years ago one of the three men i met last night the big man who was knocked unconscious hows he getting along despite a large purplish dome on his forehead he swears he doesnt suffer from headaches or dizziness when i left the hut he was roasting like a turkey turkey pitt repeated surprised you must have a firstrate supply system a verticallift minerva aircraft on loan to the university by a wealthy alumnus flies in once every two weeks from thule i thought excavations this far north were limited to midsummer when abovefreezing temperatures thawed the ground generally speaking thats true but with the heated prefab shelter over the main section of the village we can work from april through october find anything out of the ordinary like an object that doesnt belong here lily gave pitt a queer look why do you ask curiosity weve unearthed hundreds of interesting artifacts representing prehistoric eskimo lifestyles and technology we have them in the hut if you care to examine them hows chances of looking at them over the turkey good to excellent dr gronquist cooks gourmet i had hoped to invite you all to the ships galley for dinner but the sudden storm messed up my plans were always happy to see a new face at the table youve discovered something unusual havent you pitt asked abruptly lilys eyes widened suspiciously how could you knowt greek or roman roman empire byzantium actually byzantium what pitt pushed her his eyes turned hard how old a gold coin late fourth century he seemed to relax then he took a deep breath and slowly let it out while she looked at him in confusion and no small degree of irritation make your point lily snapped at him what if i was to tell you pitt began slowly there is a trail of amphoras scattered along the seabed that leads into the fjord amphoras lily repeated in astonishment i have them on videotape from our underwater cameras they came she spoke as in a trance they really crossed the atlantic the romans set foot on greenland before the vikings the evidence points in that direction pitt eased his arm around lilys waist and aimed her toward the door speaking of direction are we stuck here for the duration of the storm or does that rope outside the door lead to your hut she nodded yes the line stretches between the two buildings she paused and stared into the excavation where she had discovered the coin pytheas the greek navigator made an epic voyage in bc the legends say he sailed north into the atlantic and eventually reached iceland strange there are no records or legends telling of a roman voyage this far north and west seven hundred and fifty years later pytheas was lucky he made it home to tell the tale you think the romans who came here were lost on the return voyage no i think theyre still here pi pinned her with a determined grin and you and i lovely lady are going to find them part ii the serapis october washington dc a cold bleak drizzle shrouded the nations capital as a taxi pulled to a stop at seventeenth and pennsylvania avenue in front of the old executive office building a man dressed in a deliverymans uniform stepped from the rear seat and told the driver to wait he leaned back in the taxi and retrieved a package wrapped in red silk he hurried across the sidewalk and down several steps passing through a doorway into the reception area of the mail room for the president he said with a spanish accent a postal service employee signed in the package and the time he looked up and said still raining more like a fine spray just enough to make life miserable and slow traffic the deliveryman said with a sour face have a good day anyway you too the deliveryman left as the postal worker took the package and ran it under the fluoroscope he stood back and stared at the screen as the xrays revealed the object under the wrapping he easily identified it as a briefcase but the picture puzzled him there was no indication of files or papers inside no hard object with a distinguishing outline nothing that looked like explosives he was an old hand at xray identification but the contents of the case threw him he picked up the phone and made a request to the person on the other end less than two minutes later a security agent appeared with a dog got one for sweetpea asked the agent the postal worker nodded as he set the package on the floor cant make an id on the scope sweetpea hardly resembled her namesake she was a mutt the result of a brief affair between a beagle and a dachshund huge brown eyes a fat little body supported by short spindly legs sweetpea was highly trained to sniff out every explosive from the common to the exotic as the two men watched she waddled around the package nose quivering like a plump dowager sniffing at a perfume counter suddenly she stiffened the hair on her neck and back stood up and she began backing away her face took on an odd suspicious kind of distasteful expression and she began to growl the agent looked surprised thats not her usual reaction theres something weird in there said the postal worker who is the package addressed to the president the agent walked over and punched a number on the phone we better get jim gerhart down here gerhart special agent in charge of physical security for the white house took the call during a brief lunch at his desk and left immediately for the mail reception room he observed the dogs reaction and eyebafled the package under the fluoroscope i dont detect any wiring or detonation device he said in a georgia drawl not a bomb the postal worker agreed okay lets open it the red silk wrapper was carefully removed revealing a black leather attache case there were no markings not even a manufacturers name or model number instead of a combination lock both latches had inserts for a key gerhart tried the latches simultaneously they both unsnapped the moment of truth he said with a cautious gun he placed his hands on each corner of the upper lid and slowly lifted until the case was open and the contents in view jesus gerhart gasped the security agents face went white and he turned away the postal worker made gagging noises and staggered for the lavatory gerhart slammed the lid shut get this thing over to george washington university hospital the security agent couldnt reply until he swallowed the acidtasting bile that had risen in his throat finally he coughed is that thing real or is this some kind of halloween trick or treat its genuine said gerhart grindy and believe you me it aint no treat in his white house office dale nichols settled back in his swivel chair and adjusted his reading glasses for perhaps the tenth time he began scrutinizing the contents of a folder routed to him by arrnando lpez the presidents senior director of latin american affairs nichols gave off the image of a university professor which indeed he had been when the president persuaded him to switch his sedate campus classroom at stanford for the political cesspool of washington his initial reluctance had turned to amazement when he discovered he had a hidden talent for manipulating the white house bureaucracy his thicket of coffeebrown hair was parted neatly down the middle his oldstyle spectacles with small round lenses and thin wire frames reflected a plodding temperament a neversaydie type who was oblivious to everything but his immediate project and finally the ultimate in academic clichds the bow tie and the pipe he lit the pipe without removing his eyes from the articles clipped from mexican newspapers and magazines dealing with only one subject topiltzin included were interviews granted by the charismatic messiah to officials who represented central and south american countries but he had refused to talk to american journalists or government representatives and none had penetrated his army of bodyguards nichols had learned spanish during a twoyear tour in peru for the peace corps and easily read the stories he took a legal pad and began making a list of claims and statements that came to light during the interviews topiltzin describes himself as a man who came from the poorest of the poor born in a cardboard shack on the edge of mexico citys sprawling garbage dump with no idea of the day month or year somehow he survived and learned what it was to live amid the stink and flies and manure and muck of the hungry and homeless admits to no schooling history from childhood until his emergence as a selfstyled high priest of archaic tolteclaztec religion is blank claims to be the reincarnation of topiltzin tenthcentury ruler of the toltecs who was identified with the legendary god quetzalcoatl political philosophy a crazy blend of ancient culture and religion with vague sort of autocratic oneman noparty rule intends to play benevolent father role to mexican people ignores questions on how he intends to revive shattered economy refuses to discuss how he will restructure government if he comes to power spellbinding orator has uncanny rapport with his audience speaks only in old aztec tongue through interpreters language still used by many indians of central mexico mainstream supporters are fanatical his popularity has swept the country like the proverbial tidal wave political analysts predict he could will a national election by nearly six percentage points yet he refuses to participate in free elections claiming and rightly so that corrupt leaders would never surrender the government after a losing campaign topiltzin expects to take over the country by public acclaim nichols set his pipe in an ashtray stared at the ceiling thoughtfully for a few moments and began writing again summary topiltzin is either incredibly ignorant or incredibly gifted ignorant if he is what he says he is gifted if he has a method to his madness a goat only he can see trouble trouble trouble nichols was going over the articles again searching for a key to topiltzins character when his phone buzzed he picked up the receiver the president on one announced his secretary nichols punched the button yes mr president any news of guy rivas no nothing there was a pause on the presidents end then finally he was scheduled to meet with me two hours ago im concerned if he encountered a problem his pilot should have sent us word by now he didnt fly to mexico city in a white house jet explained nichols in the interests of secrecy he booked passage on a commercial airliner and flew coach class as a tourist on vacation i understand the president agreed if president de lorenzo learned i sent a personal representative behind his back to make contact with his opposition hed take it as an insult and scratch our arizona conference next week our primary concern nichols assured him have you been briefed on the un charter crash the president asked suddenly changing tack no sir replied nichols my only information is that hala kamil survived she and two crew members the rest died from poison poison nichols blurted incredulously thats the word from the investigators they believe the pilot tried to poison everyone on board before parachuting from the plane over iceland the pilot must have been an imposter we wont know till a body is found warm or cold christ what terrorist movement would have a motive for murdering over fifty un representatives so far none have claimed credit for the disaster according to martin brogan at cia if it is the work of terrorists they stepped out of character on this one hala karnil might have been the target suggested nichols akhmad yazid has sworn to eliminate her we cant ignore the possibility the president admitted have the news media gotten wind of it the story will be all over the papers and tv in the next hour i saw no reason to hold it back is there anything youd like me to do mr president id appreciate it dale if youd monitor reaction from president de lorenzos people there were eleven delegates and agency representatives from mexico on the flight offer condolences in my name and any cooperation within limits oh yes youd better keep julius schiller over at the state department informed so we dont stumble over each other ill get my staff right on it and let me know the minute you hear from rivas yes mr president nichols hung up and forced his attention back to the file he began to wonder if topiltzin was somehow connected with the un murder if only there was a thread he could grasp nichols was not a detective he had no talent for coldly dissecting a prime suspect layer by layer until he knew what made the man tick his academic specialty was in systems projections of international political movements topiltzin was an enigma to him hitler had a misguided vision of aryan supremacy driven by religious fervor khomeini wanted to return the middle east to the muslim fulldamentals of the dark ages lenin preached a crusade of world communism what was topiltzins objective a mexico of the aztecs a return to the past no modern society could function under such archaic rules mexico was not a nation to be run on the fantasies of a don quixote there had to be another driving force behind the man nichols was conjecturing in a vacuum he glimpsed topiltzin only as a caricature a villain in a cartoon series his secretary entered unannounced and laid a file folder on his desk the report you asked for from the ciaand you have a call on line three who is it a james gerhart she replied white house security said nichols did he say what he wanted only that it was urgent nichols became curious he answered the call this is dale nichols jim gerhart sir in charge of yes i know nichols interrupted yyhats the problem i think you better come down to the pathology lab at george washington the university hospital yes sir what in hell for id rather not say too much over the phone im very busy mr gerhart youll have to be more specific there was a short silence this is a matter concerning you and the president thats all i can say cant you at least give me a clue gerhart ignored the probe one of my men is waiting outside your office he will drive you to the lab ill meet you in the waiting room listen to me gerhart that was as far as nichols got when the snarl of the dial tone struck his ear the drizzle had turned to rain and nicholss disposition rrored the dismal weather as he was led through the university hospitals entrance to the pathology laboratory he hated the etherlike smells that permeated the halls true to his word gerhart waited in the anteroom the two men knew each other by sight and name but had never spoken gerhart came forward but made no effort to shake hands thank you for coming he said in an official tone why am i here nichols asked directly for an identification nichols was suddenly flooded with foreboding who id prefer you tell me i dont have the stomach for looking at dead bodies this isnt exactly a body but you will need a strong stomach nichols shrugged all right lets get it over with gerhart held the door open and guided him down a long corridor and into a room with large white tiles inlaid on the walls and floor the floor was slightly concave with a drain in its center a stainless steel table stood in stark solitude in the middle of the room a white opaque plastic sheet covered a long object that rose no more than an inch above the surface of the table nichols looked at gerhart in bewilderment what am i supposed to identify without a word gerhart lifted the sheet and pulled it away letting it drop in a crumpled wad on the floor nichols stared at the thing on the table uncomprehendingat first he thought it was a paper outline of a mans figure then he shuddered as the gory truth struck him he leaned over the floor drain and threw up gerhart stepped from the room and quickly returned with a folding chair and a towel he steered nichols to the chair and passed him the towel here he said without sympathy use this nichols sat for nearly two minutes clutching the towel against his face and dryretching at last he recovered enough to look up at gerhart and stammer good lord thats nothing but skin gerhart finished for him flayed human skin nichols forced himself to stare at the grisly thing stretched out on the table he was reminded of a deflated balloon that was the only way he could describe it an incision had been made from the back of the head down to the ankles and the skin peeled away from the body like a pelt from an animal there was a long vertical slit in the chest that had been crudely sewn the eyes were missing but the entire denmis was there including both shriveled hands and feet can you tell me who you think he might be asked gerhart softly nichols made a conscious effort but the grotesque misshapen facial features made it all but impossible only the hair seemed vaguely familiar yet he knew guy rivas he murmured gerhart said nothing he took nichols by the arm and helped him to another room that was comfortably shed with soft chairs and a coffee urn he poured a cup of coffee and handed it to nichols ill be back in a minute nichols sat there as if in a nightmare shocked by the sick sight in the other room he could not bring himself to grips with the reality of rivass horrible death gerhail came back carrying an attached case he set it on a low table this was dropped off at the mail reception room the body skin was tightly folded inside at first i thought it was the work of some psycho then i made a thorough search and found a miniature tape recorder mounted beneath the interior lining you played it lot of good it did sounds like a conversation between two men in some kind of code how did you trace rivas to me rivass government id card had been placed inside his flayed skin whoever murdered him wanted to make sure wed put a make on the remains i went to rivass office and interrogated his secretary i wormed it out of her that he met with you and the president for two hours before leaving for the airport and a flight to an unknown destination i thought it unusual that his own secretary didnt know his destination so i reckoned hed been sent on a classified mission thats why i contacted you first nichols looked at him narrowly you say theres a conversation on the tape gerhart nodded gravely that and rivass screams as he was cut apart nichols closed his eyes trying to force the vision from his mind his next of kin will have to be notified gerhart continued he have a wife and four kids you know him well guy rivas was a nice man one of the few people with integrity ive met since coming to washington we worked together on several diplomatic missions for the first time gerharts stony face went soft im sorry nichols didnt hear him his eyes slowly turned bitter and cold the nightmarelike expression had gone he no longer tasted the vomit or felt sickened by the horror the brutal savagery inflicted on someone close to him had triggered a floodgate of anger anger such as nichols had never known before the professor whose scope of power was limited to the walls of a classroom no longer existed in his place was a man close to the president one of a small elite group of washington power brokers with the muscle to shape events or create havoc around the globe by whatever means and power that were his in the white house with or without presidential favor or official sanction nichols was set on avenging the murder of rivas topiltzin had to die the small beechcraft executive jet touched down with a faint squeal from the tires and turned off the crushedrock runway of a privately owned airport twenty kilometers south of alexandria egypt less than a minute after it rolled to a halt beside a green volvo with taxi lettered on the doors in english the whine from the engines ceased and the passenger door raised open the man that stepped to the ground was wearing a white suit with matching tie over a dark blue shirt slightly under six feet with a slim body he paused a moment and dabbed a handkerchief around a receding hairline and then smugly brushed a large black mustache with one forefinger his eyes were hidden by dark glasses and his hands covered by white leather gloves suleiman aziz ammar did not resemble in the slightest the pilot who had boarded flight in london he walked over to the volvo and greeted the short muscular dxiver who emerged from behind the wheel good morning ibn find any problems on your return your affairs are in good order ibn replied opening the rear door and making no effort to conceal a pisto shotgun in a shoulder holster take me to yazid ibn nodded silently as ammar settled into the rear seat the exterior of the taxi was as deceptive as ammars many disguises the darkly tinted windows and body panels were bulletproof inside ammar sat in a low comfortable leather chair in front of a compact desk cabinet containing a compact array of electronics that included two telephones a computer radio transmitter and tv monitor there were also a bar and a rack with two automatic rifles as the car skirted the crowded central section of alexandria and turned onto the abeach road annnar busied himself by monitoring his farflung investment operations his wealth known only to him was enormous his financial success was accomplished more by ruthlessness than shrewdness if any corporate executive or government official stood in ammars way on a profitable business deal he was simply eliminated at the end of a twentykilometer drive ibn slowed the volvo and stopped at a gate leading up to a small villa squatting on a low hill overlooking a wide sandy beach ammar shut down the computer and stepped from the car four guards in desert sandcolored fatigues surrounded him and efficiently searched his clothing as a backup safeguard he was directed to walk through an airporttype xray detector he was then led up a stone stairway to the villa past crudely built concrete compounds manned by a small army of yazids elite bodyguards ammar smiled as they bypassed the ornate front archway open to honored visitors and entered through a small side door he brushed off the insult knowing it was yazids shallowminded way of humbling those who did his dirty work but were not accepted to his inner circle of fanatic grovelers he was ushered into a stark and empty room furnished with only one wooden stool and a large persian kashan carpet that hung from one wall the interior was hot and stuffy there were no windows and the only illumination came from an overhead skylight without a word the guards retreated and closed the door annnar yawned casually held up his wristwatch as if checking the time next he removed his dark glasses and rubbed his eyes the practiced gestures enabled him to locate the tiny lens of a tv camera within the design of the hanging carpet without giving his discovery away he stewed for nearly an hour before the carpet was pulled aside and akhmad yazid strutted through a small archway into the room the spiritual leader of the egyptian muslims was young no more than thirtyfive he was a small man he had to look up to meet ammars eyes his face did not have the precise features of most egyptians the chin and cheekbones were softer more rounded his head was covered by a white lace cloth wound in an abbreviated turban and his broom handledun body was draped in a white silk caftan when moving from shadow to light his eyes seemingly altered from black to dark brown as a sign of respect ammar gave a slight nod without looking yazid in the eye ah my friend yazid said warmly good to have you back ammar looked up smiled and began playing the game im honored to stand in your presence akhmad yazid please sit yazid said it was an order rather than an invitation ammar complied sitting on the small wooden stool so yazid could look down on him yazid also added another form of humiliation he circled the room as he lectured without prologue forcing amrnar to twist around the stool to follow him every week brings a major challenge to president hasans fragile authority all that prevents his fall is the loyalty of the military he can still rely on the strong army for support for the moment defense minister abu hamid straddles the fence he has assured me he will throw his support to ouir movement for an islamic republic but only if we will a national referendum without bloodshed is that bad asked ammar with an innocent expression yazid gave him a cold stare the man is a prowestern charlatan too cowardly to give up american aid all that matters to him are his precious jets helicopter gunships and tanks he fears egypt will go the way of iran the idiot insists on an orderly transition of governments so loans from world banks and financial aid from america will keep pouring in them he paused gazing directly into ammars eyes as if daring his prize assassin to contradict him again ammar remained silent the stifling room began to close in on him abu hamid also demands my promise that hala kamil will remain secretarygeneral of the united nations yazid added yet you ordered me to eliminate her ammar said curious yazid nodded yes i wanted the bitch dead because she is using her position in the un as a platform to voice her opposition to our movement and turn world opinion against me abu haniid however would have slammed the door in my face if shed been openly assassinatedthe reason why i counted on you suleiman to remove her with an unquestionable accident regrettably you failed you managed to kill everyone on board the aircraft except kamil the last words fell like a hammer ammars outward calm disintegrated he looked up at yazid in blank confusion she lives yazids eyes went cold the news broke in washington less than one hour ago the plane crashed in greenland every un passenger except kamil and all but two of the crew were found dead from poison poison ammar murmured skeptically our paid sources in the american news media have confirmed the report what were you thinking of suleiman you assured me the plane was supposed to vanish in the sea do they say how it reached greenland a flight steward discovered the bodies of the flight crew with help from a mexican delegate he took over the controls and managed to crashland in a fjord on the coast kamil might have died from exposure cutting you off the hook but an american naval vessel happened to be crusing nearby they responded almost immediately and saved her life ammar was stunned he was not used to failure he could not imagine how his exactingly conceived plan had gone so far off track he closed his eyes seeing the plane clear the summit of the glacier almost instantly he gleaned the imponderables focusing on a piece of the puzzle that didnt fit yazid stood qtuetly for a few moments then broke ammars concentration you realize of course i will be accused of this mess there is no evidence tying me to the disaster or me to you ammar said firmly perhaps but call it guilt by motive speculation and rumor will convict me in the western news media i should have you executed ammar wiped his mind clear and shrugged indifferently that would be a sad waste im still the best eliminator in the middle east and the highest paid im not in the habit of charging for unfinished projects i would hope not said yazid acidly he abruptly spun and walked toward the hanging carpet he reached out and pulled it back with his left hand paused and turned back to ammar i must prepare my mind for prayer you may go suleiman aziz ammar and hala kaniil the job is unfinished i am turning her removal over to muhammad ismail ismail ammar grunted the man is a cretin he can be trusted for what cleaning sewers yazids hard cold eyes stared at ammar menacingly kamil is no longer your concern remain here in egypt near my side my faithful advisers and i have another project to advance our cause you will have an opportunity to redeem yourself in the eyes of allah before yazid could enter the archway ammar rose to his feet the mexican delegate who helped fly the aircraft was he also poisoned yazid turned and shook his head the report states he was killed in the crash then he was gone and the carpet dropped back ammar settled on the stool again slowly the revelation broke through the mists of the enigma he should have been maddened but there wasnt the slightest feeling of anger instead an amused smile curled under his mustache so there were two of us he mused aloud to the empty room and the other one poisoned the inflight meal service then he shook his head in wonderment poison in the beef wellington my god how quaint at first no one paid any attention to the tiny blur that crept across the outer edge of the sidescan sonars recording paper six hours into the search they had found several manmade objects parts of the downed aircraft that were pinpointed for retrieval a sunken fishing trawler bits and pieces of junk thrown over by fishing fleets seeking shelter in the fjord from storms all were identified by video camera and eliminated the last anomaly was not resting on the bottom of the fjord as expected it sat inside a small inlet encircled by sheer cliffs only one end protruded into clear water the rest was buried under a wall of ice pitt was the first to realize its significance he was sitting in front of the recorder surrounded by giordino commander knight and the archaeologists he spoke into a transmitter swing the fish bearing onefivezero degrees the polar explorer was still stationary in the icebound fjord outside on the pack a team led by cork simon had augered through the ice and lowered the sensing unit into the water very slowly they swung the fish as they called it scanning a degree grid after searching one area they unreeled more cable and tried again at another site farther away from the ship simon acknowledged pitts command and twisted the cable until the fishs sonar probes were trained at degrees hows this he queried youre right on target pitt replied from the ship seen from a better angle the target became more distinct pitt circled it with a black felt pen i think weve got something gronquist moved in closer and nodded not much showing to identify what do you make of it pretty vague answered pitt you have to use some imagination since most of the object is covered by ice that has fallen from the surrounding cliffs but the part that shows underwater suggests a wooden ship theres a definite angular shape coming together at what might be a high curving sternpost yes said lily excitedly high and graceful typical of a fourthcentury merchant ship dont get carried away cautioned knight she could be an old sailrigged fisherman possibly giordino looked thoughtful but if my memory serves me correctly the danes icelanders and norwegians who have fished these waters over the centuries sailed in more narrow beamed doubleenders youre right said pitt the sharp bow and stern were handed down from the vikings what were seeing here might also be a doubleender but with a broader sweep cant get a clear picture through the icecovered section of the hull said gronquist but we could drop a camera back of the stern in clear water for a better identification giordino looked doubtful a camera might confirm the stern section of a wrecked ship but little else weve plenty of strong male backs on the ship said lily we could tunnel down through the ice and inspect her at first hand gronquist took a pair of binoculars and walked out of the electronics compartment to the bridge he returned in half a minute i make the ice cover over the wreck to be a good four meters thick take at least two days to cut through youll have to dig without us im afraid said knight my orders are to get under way before hours weve no time left for a lengthy excavation gronquist was taken aback thats only five hours from now knight made a helpless gesture im sorry i have no say in the matter pitt studied the dark spot on the recording paper then he turned to knight if i proved positively thats a fourthcentury roman ship out there could you persuade north atlantic command to keep us on station for another day or two knights eyes took on a foxy look what are you cooking up will you go along pitt crowded him yes knight stated firmly but only if you prove without a shadow of a doubt thats a thousandyearold shipwreck then its a deal how are you going to do it simple said pitt reeling knight in im going to dive under the ice and come up into the hull cork simon and his crew worked quickly at cutting an access hole through the onemeterthick ice sheet with chain saws they quarried multiple squares until they reached the final layer they broke through with a sledgehammer mounted on a long pipe and then removed the ice fragments with grappling hooks so pitt could safely submerge when he was satisfied the hole was clear simon walked a few steps and entered a small canvascovered shelter the interior was heated and warm and crowded with men and diving equipment an air compressor sat next to the heating unit chugging away its exhaust vented to the outside lily and the other archaeologists were sitting at a folding table in one corner of the shelter making a series of drawings and discussing them with pitt as he suited up for the dive ready when you are simon announced another five minutes giordino replied while busily checking the valve assemblies and regulator on a mark i navy divers mask pitt had slipped a special dry suit over long underwear made of heavy nylon pile for thermal insulation next he pulled on a hood and then a quickrelease weight belt while trying to absorb a cram course in ancient ship construction in early merchant vessels the shipwrights favored cedar and cypress and often pine for the planking lectured gronquist they mostly used oak for the keel i wont be able to tell one wood from another pitt said then study the hull the planks were tightly joined by tenons and mortises many ships had lead plates laid on their underwater surface the hardware may be of iron or copper what about the rudder asked pitt anything i should look for in design and fastenings you wont find a sterncentered rudder said sam hoskins they didnt turn up for another eight hundred years all early mediterranean merchantmen used twill steering oars that extended from the aft quarters do you want a reserve come home air bottle giordino interrupted pitt shook his head not necessary for a dive this shallow as long as im on a lifeline giordino lifted the mark i mask and helped pitt pull it down over his head he checked the face seal adjusted the position and cinched up the spider straps the air supply was on and when pitt signaled that he had proper air flow giordino secured the communications line to the mask anie one of the navy men unreeled and straightened the airsupply hose and communications line giordino tied a manila lifeline around pitts waist he performed the predive checkout and then donned a headset with microphone you hear me okay he asked clear but faint pitt answered turn up the volume a notch better much how do you feel nice and cozy so long as im breathing warm air all set pitt answered by making an okay sign with his thumb and forefinger he paused to hook an underwater dive light to his belt lily gave him a hug and gazed up through his face mask good hunting and be careful he willked back at her he turned and walked through the entryway of the shelter into the cold outside trailed by two navy men who tended his lines giordino began to follow when lily clutched his arm will we be able to hear him she asked anxiously yes ive connected him into a speaker you and dr gronquist can stay here where its warm and listen in if you have a message for pitt simply come and tell me and ill pass it on pitt walked stiffly to the edge of the ice hole and sat down the air temperature had dropped to zero it was a crystalline november day with a biting edge courtesy of a tenmileanhour wind as he slipped on his fins he looked up at the sheer sides of the mountains that soared above the inlet the tons of snow and ice clinging to the steep palisades seemed as if they could fall at any moment he turned to the upper end of the fjord where he could see glacier arms curling and grinding toward the sea then he looked down the water in the dive hole looked jade ominous and cold commander knight approached and put his hand on pitts shoulder all he could see was a pair of intense green eyes through the glass of the mask he spoke loudly so pitt could hear one hour twentythree minutes left i thought you ought to know pitt gave him a steeledged stare but did not reply he made a thumbs up sign and slipped through the narrow hole into the forbidding water he slowly settled past the encircling white walls he felt as if he were diving down a well once clear he was dazzled by the glistening kaleidoscope of color from the suns rays that penetrated the ice the underside of the sheet was jagged and uneven and specked with small hanging stalactites formed by brine from the rapidly freezing fresh water carried into the fjord by glaciers underwater visibility was almost eighty meters on a horizontal range he glanced down and saw a small kelp community grasping the rocky mass carpeting the bottom thousands of small shrimplike crustaceans suspended in the still water swirled past his sight a huge threemeter bearded seal eyed him curiously at a distance tufts of coarse bristles sprouting from its muzzle pitt waved his arms and the big seal shot him a wary look and swam away pitt touched the bottom and paused to equalize his ears there was a danger in diving with a buoyancycompensatortype lifejacket under ice and he did not wear one he was slightly heavy so he adjusted by removing and dropping a lead weight from his belt the air that flowed from the compressor through a filter and then an accumulator into his mask tasted bland but pure he gazed upward and oriented himself from the eerie glow of the ice hole and checked his compass he hadnt bothered to carry a depth gauge he wouldnt be working in water over four meters deep talk to me the voice of al giordino came through the masks earphones im on the bottom replied pitt all systems up to par pitt spun and stared through the green void she lies about ten meters north of me im going to move toward her give me some slack in the lines he swain slowly taking care his lines didnt foul on the rock outcroppings the intense cold of the frigid water began to seep into his body he was thankful giordino had had the foresight to see that his air supply was warm and dry the stern of the wreck slowly unveiled before his eyes the sides were covered with a mat of algae he brushed away a small area with his gloved hand stirnng up a green cloud he waited a minute for the cloud to dissipate and then peered at the result inform lily and doc im looking at a wooden hull without a stern rudder but no sign of steering oars acknowledged said giordino pitt pulled a knife from a sheath strapped to one leg and pried at the underside of the hull near the keel the point revealed soft metal we have a leadsheathed bottom he announced looking good replied giordino doc gronquist wants to know if there is any sign of carving on the sternpost hold on pitt carefully wiped off the growth over a flat section of the sternpost just before it disappeared upward into the ice waiting patiently for the resulting algae cloud to drift away theres some kind of a hardwood plaque imbedded into the sternpost i can make out lettering and a face a face with a curly head of hair and heavy beard what does it read sorry i cant translate greek not latin giordino asked skeptically the raised carving was indistinct in the shimmering light that filtered through the ice pitt moved in until his face mask nearly touched the wooden plaque greek pitt stated firmly certain i used to go with a girl who was an alpha delta pi hold on youve thrown the bone pickers into spasms after nearly two minutes giordinos voice returned over the earphones gronquist thinks youre hallucinating but mike graham says he studied classical greek in college and asks if you can describe the lettering first letter resembles an s shaped like a lightning strike then an a with the right leg missing next a p followed by another handicapped a and what looks like an inverted l or a gallows then an last letter is another lightning strike s thats the best i can do listening over the speaker inside the shelter graham copied pitts meager description on the page of a notebook he scrutinized what appeared to be a word for several moments something was out of place he struggled to jog his memory and then he had it the letters were classical but eastern greek his thoughtful expression slowly turned incredulous he furiously wrote a short word tore out the page and held it upin modern capitals it read s a r a pi s lily stared at graham questioningly does it mean anything gronquist said i think its the name of a greekegyptian god a popular deity throughout the mediterranean agreed hoskins modern spelling is usually serapis so our ship is the serapes murmured lily pensively knight grunted so we might have either a roman grecian or egyptian shipwreck which is it were over our heads answered gronquist well need the expertise of a marine archaeologist who knows ancient mediterranean shipping to sort this one out below the ice pitt moved across the starboard side of the hull stopping where the planking vanished into the ice he swam around the sternpost to the port the planking looked warped and bowed outward a few kicks of his fins and he could see a section that was stove in by the ice he eased up to the opening and slipped his head inside it was like looking in a dark closet he saw only vague indiscernible shapes he reached in and felt something round and hard he gauged the distance between the broken panels the gap was too small to squeeze his shoulders through he grasped the upper plank planted a finned foot against the hull and pulled the wellpreserved wood slowly bent but refused to give pitt tried both feet and heaved with everything he had the plank still held firm when he was just about to call it quits the treenails suddenly tore off the inside ribs and the waterlogged wood peeled away throwing pitt backward in awkward slow motion against a large rock any respectable cardcarrying marine archaeologist would have gone into cardiac arrest at such irreverent brutality toward an ancient artifact pitt felt totally unsympathetic toward academic scruples he was cold and getting colder his shoulder began to ache from the impact on the rock and he knew he couldnt stay down much longer ive found a break in the hull he said panting like a marathon runner send down a camera understood replied the stolid voice of giordino come back and ill pass it to you pitt returned to the dive hole and followed his bubbles to the surface giordino lay on his stomach on the ice reached down and handed pitt a compact underwater video camerarecorder take a few meters of tape and get out said giordino youve accomplished enough what about commander knight hold tight ill put him on knights voice came over the earphones dirk go ahead byron are you one hundred percent certain weve got a thousandyearold relic in pristine condition all indications look solid ill need something tangible if im to convince atlantic command to keep us on station another fortyeight hours stand by and ill seal it with a kiss an identifiable antiquity will suffice knight said dourly pitt threw a wave and faded from view he did not enter the wreck immediately how long he floated motionless outside the jagged opening he couldnt be sure probably about one minute certainly no longer then two why he hesitated he didnt know maybe he was waiting for an invitation from a skeletal hand beckoning from within maybe he was afraid of finding nothing more than debris from an eightyyearold icelandic fishing schooner or maybe he was just leery of entering what might be a tomb finally he lowered his head tightened his shoulders and cautiously kicked his fins the black unknown opened up and he swam in once pitt squeezed inside he paused and hung motionless slowly settling on his knees listening to his pounding heart and his breath escaping from the exhaust valve waiting until his eyes eventually became accustomed to the fluid gloom he didnt know what hed expected to find what he found was an array of terracotta jars pitchers cups and plates neatly stacked in shelves set in the bulkheads one was a large copper pot he had touched when groping through the hull its walls had turned a deep patina green at first he thought his knees were resting on the hard surface of the deck he felt about with his hands and discovered he was kneeling on the tiled surface of a hearth he glanced up and saw his bubbles rise up and spread in a wavering cover he stood and surfaced into clear air his head and shoulders having risen above the water level of the fjord im inside the ships galley he notified the spellbound party on the ice the upper half is dry camera is rolling acknowledged giordino said briefly pitt used the next few minutes to videorecord the galleys interior above and below the water level while keeping a running dialogue on the inventory he found an open cupboard stocked with several elegant glass vessels he lifted one and peered inside it held coins he picked one out rubbed away the algae with his gloved fingers and shot tape with one hand the coins surface revealed a golden color a sense of awe and apprehension flooded over pitt he looked quickly around as if expecting a ghostly crew or at least their skeletal apparitions to come bursting through the hatchway to accuse him of theft only there was no crew he was alone and touching objects that belonged to men who had walked the same deck prepared food and eaten heremen who had been dead for sixteen centuries he began to wonder what had happened to them how had they come to be in the frozen north when there were no records of such a historic voyage they must have died of exposure but where did their bodies lie youd better come up said giordino youve been down almost thirty minutes not yet replied pitt thirty minutes he thought it seemed more like five time was slipping away from him the cold was beginning to affect his brain he dropped the coin back in the glass vessel and continued his inspection the galleys ceiling rose half a meter above the main deck overhead and small arched windows that normally allowed ventilation were battened down on the upper side of the forward bulkhead pitt pried one partially open only to confront a solid wall of ice he made a rough measurement and found the water level was deeper toward the aft end of the galley pitt took this to indicate that the bow and central section of the hull were aground on the raised slope of the iceburied shoreline come up with anything else giordino inquired with burning curiosity like what remains of the crew sorry no bones to be seen pitt ducked under the water and scanned the deck to make certain it was free and clean of litter they probably panicked and abandoned ship at sea giordlo theorized nothing points to a panic said pitt the galley could pass a general inspection can you penetrate the rest of the ship theres a hatchway in the forward bulkhead im going to see whats on the other side he leaned down and ducked through the low and narrow opening carefully pulling his lifeline and air hose after him the darkness was oppressive he unhooked the dive light from his weight belt and swept its beam around a small compartment im now in some kind of storeroom the water is shallower here rising just short of my knees i can see tools yes the ships carpenters tools spare anchors a large steelyard steelyard giordino broke in a balance scale that hangs from a hook got you theres also an assortment of axes lead weights and fish netting hold on while i document a narrow wooden ladder led upward through an opening in the main deck after shooting tape he cautiously tested it surprised to find it still stout enough to support his weight pitt slowly climbed the rungs and poked his head into the shattered remains of a deck cabin little was visible except a few buried bits of debris the cabin had been nearly crushed flat by the build up of ice he dropped down and waded through another hatch that opened into the cargo hold he swung the dive lights beam from starboard to port and instantly went numb from shock it was not only a cargo hold it was also a crypt the extreme cold had transformed the dry hold into a cryogenic chamber eight bodies in a state of nearperfect preservation were grouped around a small iron stove toward the bow each was covered by a shroud of ice making them look as though they had been individually wrapped in a thick clear plastic their facial expressions appeared peaceful and their eyes were locked openlike mannikins in a shop window they were posed in different positions as if placed and adjusted for the correct attitude four sat around a table eating plates in hand cups raised to mouth two reclined side by side against the hull reading what pitt guessed were scrolls one was bent over a wooden chest while the last was seated in the act of writing pitt felt as if he had entered a time machine he could not believe he was staring at men who had been citizens of imperial rome ancient mariners who sailed into ports long buried under the debris of later civilizations ancestors over sixty generations from the past they had not been prepared for the arctic cold none wore heavy clothing all were bundled in coarse blankets they seemed small in size compared to pitt all would have measured a good head shorter one little man was bald with gray woolly side hair another had shaggy red hair and was heavily bearded most were cleanshaven from what he could read through their icy covering the youngest was around eighteen and the oldest close to forty years of age the mariner who had died while writing had a leather cap pulled tight around his head and long strips of wool wrapped around his legs and feet he was bent over a small stack of wax tablets resting on the scarred surface of a small folding table a stylus was still gripped in his right hand the crew did not look as if they had starved or died slowly from the cold death had come suddenly and unexpectedly pitt guessed the cause all hatch covers had been tightly sealed to keep out the cold and the only opening for ventilation had frozen over the pots containing the last meal were sitting on the small oil stove there was no way for the heat and smoke to escape to the outside lethal carbon monoxide had built up within the cargo hold unconsciousness had struck without warning and each man died where he sat almost as if he was afraid to awaken the longdead seaman pitt very carefully chipped the ice away from the wax tablets until they came free then he unzipped the front of his dry suit and slipped them inside pitt no longer noticed the agony of the cold the nervous sweat that was trickling from his pores or the shivering his mind was so absorbed in the morbid scene that he failed to hear giordinos repeated demands for a reply are you still with us asked giordino answer dammit pitt mumbled a few unintelligible words say again are you in trouble giordinos concerned tone finally shook pitt out of his trancelike state inform commander knight his worst fear is confirmed pitt answered the antique status of the ship is genuine and by the way he added in a monotonous laconic voice you might also mention that if he needs witnesses i can produce the crew youre wanted on the phone julius schihers wife called through the kitchen window schiller looked up from the barbecue in the backyard of his treeshaded home in chevy chase they give a name no but it sounds like dale nichols he sighed and held up a pair of tongs come mind the steaks so they wont burn mrs schiller gave her husband a brief kiss as they passed each other on the porch he entered his study closed the door and picked up the receiver yes julius dale whats on your mind sorry to call on a sunday said nichols did i interrupt anything only a family barbecue you must be a diehard its only fortyfive degrees outside beats smoking up the garage steak and scrambled eggs thats my favorite schiller caught nicholss drift on the eggs and switched his phone onto a secure line that entered a computer scramble mode okay dale what have you got hala kamil the exchange came off smoothly her lookalike is at walter reed hospital schiller asked under tight security to go along with the act who doubled for her teri rooney the actress she did a superb makeup job you couldnt tell her apart from the real secretarygeneral unless you were nose to noseas a backup we arranged a press conference by hospital doctors they gave out a story describing her serious condition and kantil she remained on the air force plane that brought her from greenland after refueling it flew to buckley field near denver from there she was flown by helicopter to breckenridge the ski resort in colorado yes shes resting comfortably at senator pitts chalet just outside of town no injuries except a few bruises and a mild case of frostbite how is she taking her forced convalescence no word yet hala was heavily sedated when she was carried from the hospital at thule but shell go along when she learns of our operation to safeguard her arrival at the un headquarters to address the opening session of the general assembly a reliable source close to her says she plans on making a scathing indictment of yazid exposing him as a religious charlatan and offering proof of his underground terrorist activities ive read a report from the same source schiller admitted five days until the opening session said nichols yazid will pull out all stops to blow her away shes got to be kept on ice until she steps to the podium schiller said deadly serious shes safe said nichols any word from the egyptian government on your end president hasan is giving us his full cooperation regarding kantil hes scratching every hour he can buy or steal to launch his new economic reforms and replace military leaders with men he can trust hala kantil is the only thread preventing yazid from attempting a quick grab for the egyptian government if yazids assassins stop her before her speech goes out over world news satellite channels there is a real danger of egypt becoming another iran before the monday is out relax yazid wont get wise to the scam until its too late said nichols confidentially i assume she is under heavy guard by a top team of secret service agents the president is personally keeping a tight grip on the operation schillers wife knocked on the door and spoke loudly from the other side steaks are ready julius in a minute he answered nichols picked up on the exchange thats all i have for now ill let you get back to your steaks id feel better if the fbi was lending a hand said schiller the white house security staff has considered every contingency the president thought it best to keep all intelligence within a tight circle schiller paused pensively for a moment then he said dont screw it up dale not to worry i promise hala kamil will arrive at the un building in new york in pristine condition and full of fire shed better does the sun set in the west schiller set down the phone he had an uneasy feeling he hoped to god the white house knew what it was doing across the street three men sat in the back of a ford van with capitol plumbing hour emergency service painted on the panels the cramped interior was crowded with electronic eavesdropping equipment tedium had set in five hours ago surveillance is perhaps the most boring job since watching rails rust one man smoked and the other two didnt and couldnt stand the stale air all were stiff and cold former counterespionage agents they had resigned to become independent contractors most retired agents occasionally take on an outside job for the government but these three were among the very few who respected money more than patriotic duty and they sold what ever classified information they could ferret out to the highest bidder one of them a blond scarecrow type peered through binoculars out a tinted window at schillers house hes leaving the study the fat man hunched over a recording machine with earphones nodded in agreement all talk has ceased the man had a great waxed handlebar mustache operated a laser parabolic a sensitive microphone that received voice sounds inside a room from the vibrations on a windowpane and then magnified them through fiber optics onto a sound channel anything interesting asked the skinny blond the fat man removed the earphones and wiped his sweating forehead my share from this gig will pay off my fishing boat i love a marketable commodity this information is worth big bucks to the right party whove you got in mind asked the one with the mustache the fat man grinned like a glutted coyote a wealthy highly placed raghead who wants to make points with akhmad yazid the president rose from behind his desk and gave a brief nod as cia director martin brogan was ushered into the oval office for the morning intelligence briefing the formality of a handshake between the two men had fallen by the wayside soon after their daily meetings began the slim urbane brogan didnt mind in the least he had narrow longfingered violinists hands while the tall twohundredpound president had massive paws and a bonecrushing grip brogan waited until the president sat down before settling in a leather chair almost as if it were a ritual the president poured a cup of coffee ladled in a teaspoon of sugar and graciously handed a large mug to brogan the president brushed a hand over his head of silver hair and fixed brogan with a limpid pair of gray eyes well what secrets does the world hold this morning brogan shrugged and passed a leatherbound file across the desk at moscow time soviet president georgi antonov balled his mistress in the backseat of his limousine on the way to the kremlin i envy his method for starting the day the president said with a broad smile he also made two calls from his car phone one to sergei komilov head of the soviet space program the other to his son who works in the commercial section of the embassy in mexico city youll find the transcript of the conversations on pages four and five the president opened the file slipped on a pair of reading glasses and scanned the transcript amazed as always at the penetration of intelligence gathering and how was the rest of georgis day he spent most of his time on domestic affairs you wouldnt want to be in his shoes the outlook on the soviet economy grows worse by the day his reforms in the fields and factories have gone down the toilet the old guard in the politburo is trying to undermine him the military isnt happy with his programs proposals and has gone public with its opposition soviet citizens are getting more vocal as the lines get longer with a little prodding by our operatives graffiti knocking the government are appearing throughout the cities overall economic growth has flattened out at two percent there is a strong possibility antonov may be forced from power before next summer if our deficit doesnt level off i may wind up in the same boat the president said grimly brogan made no comment he wasnt expected to whats the latest intelligence from egypt the president asked moving on president hasan is also hanging by the skin of his teeth the air force remains loyal but the army generals are close to throwing in with yazid defense minister abu hamid held a secret meeting with yazid in port said our informants say haniid wont swing his support without assurances of a solid power position he does not want to be dictated to by yazids circle of fanatical mullahs think yazid will give in brogan shook his head no he has no intention of sharing power hanlid has underestimated yazids ruthlessness weve already uncovered a conspiracy to place a bomb in haniids private plane have you alerted harried ill need your authority you have it said the president hamid is cagey he may think were pulling a ploy to keep him out of yazids camp we can supply the names of yazids assassin team hamid can take it from there if he insists on proof the president leaned back and stared at the ceiling for a moment can we tie yazid to the crash of the un plane carrying hala kamfl circumstantial evidence at best brogan admitted we wont have any concrete conclusions until the investigators wrap up and make their report for now the disaster is a real puzzle only a few facts have been uncovered we do know the genuine pilot was murdered his body was found in the trunk of a car parked at heathrow airport sounds like a maria hit almost except the killer did a masterful job of disguising himself well enough to double as the pilot after actually taking off the plane he killed the flight crew by injecting them with a toxic nerve agent known as sarin turned off course and abandoned the aircraft over iceland he must have worked with a team of highly trained professionals the president said admiringly we have reason to think he acted alone said brogan alone the presidents expression turned incredulous this guy has to be one canny son of a bitch the finesse and intricacy are trademarks of an arab whose name is suleiman aziz ammar a terrorist not in the crude sense animar is one of the cleverest assassins in the game i wish he was on our side never let the liberals in congress hear you say that the president said wryly or the news media brogan added do you have a file on ammar about a meter thick hes what the trade used to call a master of disguise a good practicing muslim who has little interest in politics a mercenary with no known association with fanatical islamic diehards ammar charges enormous fees and gets them a shrewd businessman his wealth is estimated at over sixty million dollars he seldom goes by the book his hits are ingeniously planned and carried out all are planned to look like accidents none can be laid on his doorstep with certainty innocent victims mean nothing to him so long as his target is taken out we suspect he is responsible for over a hundred deaths in the past ten years his attempt proven to kill hala k i would mark his first recorded failure the president adjusted his glasses and turned to the report on the air crash i must have missed something if he meant for the plane to vanish in the ocean why did he bother poisoning the passengers what possible reason could he have for killing them twice theres the catch explained brogan my analysts dont think ammar was responsible for murdering the passengers the presidents eyes took on a look of surprise youve switched me on a sidetrack martin what in hell are you talking about pathologists from the fbi labs flew up to thule and performed autopsies on the victims they found fifty times the sarin required to kill inside the flight crews bodies but their tests showed the passengers died from ingesting manchineel in the flight meal brogan paused to sip his coffee the president waited impatiently tapping a pen against a desk calendar manchineel or poison guava as its called is native to the caribbean and gulf coast of mexico brogan continued it comes from a tree that bears a deadly sweettasting appleshaped fruit carib indians used the sap to tip their arrows any number of early shipwrecked sailors and modern tourists have died after eating the manchineels poisonous juices and your people believe an assassin of ammars caliber wouldnt stoop to using manchineel something like that brogan nodded ammars connections would have no trouble buying or stealing sarin from a european chemicalsupply company manchineel is something else you cant find it on a shelf it also works too slowly for a quick kill i find it doubtful ammar would even consider using it if not the arab then who we dont know answered brogan certainly none of the three survivors the only trail and a faint one leads to a mexican delegate by the name of eduardo ybarra hes the only other passenger besides hala kaniil who didnt eat the meal it says here he died in the crash the president looked up from the briefing file how could he insert poison in the flight meals without being seen that was done in the kitchen of the company that caters for the airline british investigators are checking out that lead now maybe ybarra is innocent maybe for some simple reason he didnt eat according to the surviving flight attendant hala slept through the meal but ybarra feigned an upset stomach its possible the surviving flight attendant saw him eating a sandwich from his briefcase then he knew looks that way why did he risk coming on board if he knew everyone was going to die except him as a backup in case the main target or targets probably the entire contingent of mexicans didnt take the poison the president leaned back in his chair and studied the ceiling okay kamil is a thorn in the side of yazid he pays animar to erase her the job is botched and the plane doesnt disappear in the middle of the arctic ocean as planned but comes down in greenland so much for mystery number one solid facts for a good case well call it the egyptian connection mystery number two the mexican connection is far more cloudy there is no obvious motive for a mass murder and the only suspect is dead if i were a judge id order the case dismissed for lack of evidence id have to go along said brogan there has been no evidence of terrorist movements operating out of mexico you forget topiltzin the president said unexpectedly brogan was surprised at the cold mysterious look of pure anger that spread across the presidents face the agency has not forgotten topiltzin brogan assured him or what he did to guy rivas ill have him taken out whenever you say the word the president suddenly sighed and sagged in his chair if only it was that simple snap my fingers and the cia obliterates a foreign opposition leader the risk is too great ken nedy found that out when he condoned the mafias attempt to kill castro reagan made no objections to the attempts to get muarnmar qaddafi yes the president said wearily if only he had known qaddafi would fool everyone and die of cancer no such luck with topiltzin medical reports say hes as strong as a missouri mule the man is a bloody lunatic if he takes over mexico well have a disaster on our hands you played the tape made by rivas brogan asked knowing the answer four times the president said bitterly its enough to provoke nightmares and if topiltzin topples the present government and makes good his threat by sending millions of his people flooding across our border in a mad attempt to recover the american southwest brogan let the question hang the president replied in a strangely mild tone then i will have no choice but to order our armed forces to treat any horde of illegal aliens as foreign invaders brogan arrived back in his office at the cia headquarters in langley and found the assistant secretary of the navy elmer shaw waiting for him sorry to foul up your busy schedule said shaw but i have some interesting news that might make your day must be important to warrant your personal visit it is come in and sit down is the news good or bad very good nothing else is going right lately said brogan solemnly ill be glad to hear something decent for a change our survey ship the polar explorer has been searching for the soviet alfaclass submarine that went missing im familiar with the mission brogan interrupted well theyve found it brogans eyes widened slightly and he rapped his desk in a rare display of pleasure congratulations the alfa class is the finest sub in both navies your people have pulled off a master stroke we havent got our hands on it yet said shaw brogans eyes suddenly narrowed what about the russians are they aware of the discovery we dont think so shortly after instruments detected the sunken sub which by the way includes videotape of the wreckage our ship pulled off the search track and assisted in the rescue operations of the downed un aircraft a heavensent smoke screen our best intelligence from inside the soviet navy confirms business as usual nothing from the kgb either and our space surveillance of their north atlantic fleet shows no indication of dramatic course changes toward the search area odd they didnt have a spy trawler shadow the polar explorer they did explained shaw they also kept a close eye on our operations all right monitoring our ships course and communications by satellite they left it alone sitting back and hoping our more advanced underwater search technology would get lucky where theirs failed then they banked their expectations on the clear possibility our crew would give away the location through the tiniest of errors but they didnt no answered shaw firmly ship security was airtight except for the captain and two numa underwater search experts the entire crew was briefed to think they were on an icebergtracking and seabottom geology survey my report on the success of the discovery was handcarried from greenland by the polar explorers executive officer so there was no chance of communications penetration okay wherr do we go from here inquired brogan obviously the soviets would never allow another glomar explorer snatch and they still have a ship patrolling the area where they lost that missile sub off the east coast in eightysix we have an underwater salvage job in mind said shaw when if we began putting together the operation now redesigning and modifying existing submersibles and equipment we should be ready for salvage in ten months so we ignore the sub or act like it until then correct replied shaw in the meantime another event has fallen into our laps that will confuse the soviets the navy needs your agencys cooperation to carry it out im listening during rescue and subsequent investigation of the air crash the numa people working with us in the search accidentally stumbled on what looks like an ancient roman shipwreck buried in ice brogan stared at shaw skeptically in greenland shaw nodded the word from experts is its genuine what can the cia do to help the navy with an old shipwreck a little disinformation wed like the russians to think the polar explorer was looking for the roman ship all along brogan noted a flashing light on his intercom a sound concept while the navy prepares to grab their newest sub we scatter bread crumbs down the wrong path something like that how will you handle the roman wreck from your end we set up an archaeological project as a cover for an onsite base of operations the polar explorer will remain on station so the crew can give a hand in the excavation is the sub close by less than ten miles away any idea of her condition some structural damage from a collision with a rise on the seafloor but otherwise intact and the roman ship our men on the scene claim theyve found the frozen bodies of the crew in an excellent state of preservation brogan rose from his desk and walked with shaw to the door incredible he said fascinated then he grinned impishly i wonder if any ancient state secrets will be found too shaw grinned back better a hoard of treasure under the direction of the archaeologists the crew of the polar explorer cut their way down to the icelocked ship layer by layer until the top deck was laid bare from bow stern to sternpost everyone in the fjord was drawn to the site hypnotized by curiosity only pitt and lily were missing they remained on board the icebreaker to study the wax tablets a compelling silence gripped the crowd of seamen and archaeologists joined by the aircrash investigating team as they stood on the edge of the excavation they stared down at the partially cleared vessel as though it were a hidden tomb of ancient royalty hoskins and graham measured the hull arriving at an overall length of just under twenty meters with a beam of seven meters the mast had broken two meters above its step and was missing the remains of the hemp rigging snaked over the weather deck and sides as if wadded up and dropped by a giant bird a few shredded pieces of canvas were all that remained of the once broad square sail the deck planking was tested for strength and found to be as solid as the day the ship was launched from some longforgotten mediterranean shipyard the artifacts strewn about the deck were photographed tagged and carefully lifted to the surface and carried to the polar explorer where they were cleaned and catalogued then each object was stored in the ships ice locker to prevent decay during the voyage to a nation that was not in existence when the old merchant vessel sailed on her final voyage gronquist hoskins and graham did not touch the collapsed deckhouse or enter the galley slowly almort tenderly the three of them lifted one end of the cargo hatch and propped it halfopen gronquist stretched out on his stomach and leaned his head and shoulders into the gap until his vision ranged beneath the deck beams are they there graham asked excitedly are they as pitt described them gronquist stared at the ghastly white faces the frozen masklike expressions it seemed to him that if he scraped away the ice and shook them their eyes would b and theyd come alive he hesitated before answering the bright daylight above gave him a clear view of the entire hold and he glimpsed two forms huddled together in the extreme angle of the bow that pitt had missed theyre just as pitt described he said soberly except for the dog and the girl pitt stood in the shelter of a deck crane and watched as giordino jockeyed the numa helicopter over the stern of the polar explorer fifteen months later the landing skids touched the painted bullseye on the deck the sound of the turbines whine fell away and the rotor blades beat to a slow stop the righthand cockpit door opened and a tall man wearing a green turtleneck sweater under a brown corduroy sport jacket jumped to the deck he looked around for a moment as though getting his bearings and then spied pitt who threw a wave of greeting he walked swiftly shoulders huddled hands shoved deeply into pockets to shield them from the cold pitt stepped forward and quickly ushered the visitor through a hatch into the warmth of the ship dr redfem you dirk pitt yes im pitt ive read of your exploits thank you for taking time from your busy schedule to come are you kidding blurted redfem eyes wide with enthusiasm i jumped at your invitation there isnt an archaeologist in the world who wouldnt give an eyetooth to be in on this find when can i take a look be dark in another ten minutes i think it will be practical if youre briefed by doctor gronquist the archaeologist who supervised the excavation hell also show you the artifacts hes recovered off the main deck then at first light you set foot on the vessel and take charge of the project sounds good have any luggage pitt asked i traveled light only a briefcase and a small tote bag al giordino will bring them down the helicopter pilot yes al will see that your gear is taken to your quarters now if youll follow me ill see you get something warm in your stomach and pick your brain on an intriguing puzzle after you dr mel redfem towered over pitt and had to duck halfway to his navel when he passed through a hatch his blond hair had receded to a widows peak and he wore designer glasses in front of grayblue eyes his long body was still reasonably trim for a man of forty with a slight but noticeable paunch a former college basketball star who passed on playing for the pros to earn his doctorate in anthropology redfem later turned his considerable talents to underwater exploration and became one of the worlds leading experts in classical marine archaeology did you have a good flight from athens to reykjavik asked pitt slept through most of that one answered redfem it was the ride in the navy patrol plane from iceland to the eskimo settlement a hundred miles to the south of here that damned near turned me into an ice cube i hope i can borrow some coldweather clothing i packed for the sunny islands of greece and didnt plan for a rush trip to the arctic circle commander knight the ships skipper can fix you up what were you working on a secondcentury bc greek merchant ship that sank with a cargo of marble sculptures redfem could not contain his curiosity and began to grill pitt you didnt state in your radio message what the ship was carrying except for the bodies of the crew i found the cargo hold empty cant have it all your way redfemn said philosophically but you did say the ship was basically intact yes thats true if we repair a hole in the hull restore the mast and the rigging and hang new steering oars you could sail her into new york harbor god thats astounding has dr gronquist been able to determine an approximate date on her yes by coins minted around ad we even know her name serapisit was carved in greek on the sternpost a completely preserved fourthcen byzantine merchant ship redfem murmured in wonder this has to be the archaeological find of the century i cant wait to lay my hands on her pitt led him into the officers wardroom where lily sat at a dining table copying the wording from the wax tablets onto paper pitt made the introductions dr lily sharp ir mel redfem lily rose and extended her hand this is an honor doctor although my field is land science ive been a fan of your underwater work since grad school the honor is mine said redfem politely lets cut the fancy titles and stick with first names what can we get you asked pitt a gallon of hot chocolate and a bowl of soup should thaw me out just fine pitt relayed the order to a steward well wheres this puzzle you mentioned asked redfem with the anxiousness of a kid leaping out of bed on christmas day pitt stared at him and smiled hows your latin mel passable i thought you said the ship was greek it is answered lily but the captain wrote out his log on wax tablets in latin six were inscribed with wording the seventh has lines like a map dirk recovered them during his initial entry into the ship ive transposed the writing into more readable form on paper so it can be run off on a copy machinne i drew an enlarged scale of the tablet depicting a chart of some kind so far we havent been able to pin down a geographical location because it lacks labels redfem sat down and held one of the tablets in his hand he studied it almost reverently for several moments before setting it aside then he picked up lilys pages and began to read the steward brought a mug of hot chocolate and a large bowl of boston clam chowder redfem became so engrossed in the translation that he lost his appetite like a robot he raised the cup and sipped the chocolate without taking his eyes from the handwritten pages after nearly ten minutes he stood up and paced the deck between the officers dining tables muttering latin phrases to himself oblivious to his rapt audience pitt and lily sat in utter silence careful not to interrupt his thoughts curiously watching his reactions redfem stopped as if mentally placing a problem into proper perspective he returned to the table and examined the pages again the air fairly crackled with expectancy several more minutes dragged by before redfem finally laid the pages on the table with trembling hands then he stared vacantly into the distance his eyes strangely blurred redfem had been rocked right down to his toenails you look like you just found the holy grail said pitt what is it asked lily what did you find they could barely hear redfems answer his head was down he said its possible just possible your chance discovery may unlock the door to the collection of art and literary treasures the world has ever known now that you have our undivided attention pitt said dryly you mind sharing your revelation redfem shook his head as if to clear it the storysaga is a better definitionis overwhelming i cant quite comprehend it all lily asked do the tablets tell why a graecoroman ship sailed far beyond her home waters not graecoroman but byzantine redfem corrected her when the serapes sailed the ancient world the seat of the empire had been moved by constantine the great from rome to the bosporus where the greek city of byzantium once stood which became constantinople said pitt and then istanbul redfem turned to lily sorry for not giving you a direct answer but yes the tablets reveal how and why the ship came here to fully explain we have to set the stage beginning with bc the year alexander the great died in babylonhis empire was split up by his generals one of them ptoleiny carved out egypt and became king a canny guy ptolemy he also managed to get his hands on alexanders corpse encasing it in a goldandcrystal coffin he later enshrined the body in an elegant mausoleum and built a magnificent city around it that surpassed athens in honor of his former king ptolemy called it alexandria what does all this have to do with the serapes asked lily please bear with me replied redfem gently ptolemy founded a massive museum and library from scratch the inventory became monumental his descendants through cleopatra and later successors all continued to acquire manuscripts and art objects until the museum and especially the library became one of the largest storehouses of art science and literature that has ever existed this vast collection of knowledge lasted until ad in that year emperor theodosius and the patriarch of alexandria theophilos who was a religious nut case decided all reference to anything except newly fanned christian principles was paganism they masterminded the destruction of the librarys contents statues fabulous works of art in marble bronze gold and ivory incredible paintings and tapestries countless numbers of books inscribed on lambskin or papyrus scrolls even alexanders corpse all were to be smashed into dust or burned to ashes what kind of numbers are we talking about pitt asked the books alone numbered in the hundreds of thousands lily shook her head sadly what a terrible waste only biblical and church writings were left continued redfem the entire library and museum was finally leveled after arab and islamic rebbels swept egypt sometime around ad the earlier masterworks that took centuries to collect were lost gone forever pitt summed up lost redfem agreed so historians have thought until now but if what i just read rings true the cream of the collection is not gone forever it lies hidden somewhere lily was confused it exists to this day smuggled out of alexandria by the serapis before the burning according to the inscriptions on the tablets pitt looked doubtful no way the serapes sneaked off with more than a tiny fraction of the collection it wont wash the ship is too small less than forty tons burden the crew might have carried a few thousand scrolls and a couple of statues into the cargo hold but nothing like the quanity youre talking about redfem gave pitt a respectful gaze yourevery astute you have a good knowledge of early ships lets get back to the serapes washing up in greenland pitt urged as redfem picked up the appropriate pages of lilys text and shuffled them into order i wont give you a literal translation of fourthcentury latin too stiff and formal instead ill try and relate the text in english vernacular the first entry is under the julian calendar date of april ad the report begins i cuccius rufinus captain of the serapes in the em ploy of nicias greek shipping merchant of the port city of rhodes have agreed to transport a cargo for junius venator of alexandria the voyage is said to be long and arduous and venator will not disclose our destination my daughter hypatia sailed with me this trip and her mother will be very concerned at our lengthy separation but venator is paying twenty times the usual rate a good fortune that will greatly benefit nicias as well as myself and the crew the cargo was put on board at night under heavy guard and quite mysteriously as i was ordered to remain at the docks with my crew during the loading four sol diers under the command of the centurion dominus se verus have been commanded to stay on the ship and sail with us i do not like the look of it but venator has paid me for the voyage in full and i cannot go back on my con tract an honest man said pitt hard to believe he didnt discover the nature of his cargo he comes to that later the next few lines are a log of the voyage he also makes mention of his ships namesake ill skip to where they make their first port our god serapes for providing us with a smooth and fast passage of fourteen days to carthago nova where we rested for five days and took on four times our normal supply of provisions here we joined junius venators other ships most are over two hundred tons burden some close to three hundred we total sixteen with vena tors flagship our sturdy serapes is the smallest vessel in the fleet a fleet lily cried her eyes gleamed her whole body taut they did save the collection redfem nodded delightedly a damned good chunk of it anyway twotothreehundredtonships were representative of large merchantmen of that era allowing for two ships to carry men and provisions and taking an average tonnage of two hundred for the other fourteen ships you have a gross tonnage for the fleet of tons enough to transport a third of the librarys books and a fair share of the museums art treasures pitt called for a break he went to the galley counter and brought back two cups of coffee he set one in front of lily and returned for a plate of doughnuts he remained standing he thought and concentrated better on his feet so far the great library snatch is theory he said ive heard nothing that proves the goods were actually spirited away rufinus nails it down further on said redfem the description of the serapiss cargo comes near the end of the log pitt gave the marine archaeologist an impatient look and sat back waiting on the next tablet rufinus mentions minor repairs to the ship dockside gossip and a tourists eye of carthago nova now cartagena spain oddly he doesnt express any further uneasiness about the coming voyage he even failed to note the date the fleet left port but the really offbeat part is the censorship listen to the next paragraph we sailed today toward great sea the faster ships towing the slower ones i can write no more the soldiers are watching under strict orders of junius venator there can be no record of the voyage just when we set the straight pieces of the puzzle together pitt muttered the center section is missing there must be more lily insisted i know i copied beyond that part of the report you did acknowledged redfem shuffling the pages rufinus takes up the tale eleven months later i am free now to record our cruel voyage without fear of punishment venator and his small army of slaves se verus and his legionaries all the ships crews have all been slain by the barbarians and the fleet burned the serapes escaped because my fear of venator made me cautious i learned the source and contents of the fleets cargo and know its hiding place in the hills secrets such as these must be kept from mortal men i suspected venator and severus meant to murder all but a few of their trusted soldiers and the crew of one ship to insure their return home i feared for the life of my daughter so i armed my crew and ordered them to remain close to the ship so we could cast off at the first sign of treachery but the barbarians struck first slaughtering venators slaves and se veruss legion our guards died in the battle and we cut the lines and heaved our ship from the beach venator tried to save himself by running into the water he shouted for rescue i could not risk the lives of hypatia and the crew to save him and refused to turn back to do so against the current would have been suicidal redfem paused in the translation before continuing at this point rufinus jumps around and flashes back to the fleets departure from cartagena the voyage from hispania to our destination in the strange land took fiftyeight days the weather was favorable with winds at our backs for this good fortune serapis demanded a sacrifice two of our crew died from a malady unknown to me he must mean scurvy said lily ancient seamen rarely sailed more than a week or two without touching land pitt clarified scurvy did not become common until the long voyages of the spanish could be they died from any number of reasons lily nodded at redfem sorry for interrupting please go on we first stepped ashore on a large island inhabited by barbarians who resembled scythians but with darker skins they proved friendly and willingly helped the fleet replenish our food and fresh water supplies we sighted more islands but the flagship sailed on only venator knew where the fleet was to land at last we sighted a barren shore and came to the wide mouth of a river we stood off for five days and nights until the winds blew to our advantage then we set sail up the river rowing at times until we reached the hills of rome the hills of rome lily repeated absently thats a twist he must have meant it as a comparison said pitt a tough riddle to crack redfem admitted the slaves under the overseer latiriius macer dug into the hills above the river eight months later the fleets cargo was carried from the ships to the hiding ground did he describe the hiding ground asked pitt redfern picked up a tablet and compared it to lilys copy parts of the wording are indistinct ill have to fill in as best i can thus the secret of the secrets lies within the hill inside a chamber dug by the slaves the place cannot be seen because of the palisade after all was stored the barbarian horde swarmed from the hills i do not know if the chamber was sealed in time as i was busy helping my crew push the boat from the sand rufinus fails to record distances said pitt disillusioned and nevergives directions now we have an oddson chance the barbarians whoever the hell they were robbed the store redfems expression turned grim we cant ignore the possibility i dont think the worst happened said lily optimistically an immense collection cant be erased as though it never existed a few pieces would have eventually turned up depends on the area where the action took place said pittfiftyeight days at an average speed ofsay three and a half knots a vessel designed along the adcient lines of the serapismight have sailed over four thousand nautical miles providing they sailed in a straight line said redfem not a likely prospect rufinus merely states they sailed fiftyeight days before stepping ashore traveling in unknown waters they probably hugged the coastlines but traveling to where lily asked the southern coast of western africa is the most logical destination answered redfem a crew of phoenicians sailed around africa clockwise in the fifth century bc quite a bit of it was charted by rufinuss time stands to reason venator would have turned his fleet south after passing through the straits of gibraltar never sell a jury said pitt rufinus described islands could be the madeira canary or cape verde islands still wont sell you cant explain how the serapes ended up halfway across the globe from the tip of africa to greenland youre talking a distance of eight thousand miles thats true im confused on that count my vote goes for a northern course said lily the islands also might be the shetlands or the faroes that would put the excavation site along the norwegian coast or better yet iceland she makes a good case pitt agreed her theory would explain how the serapes came to be stranded in greenland what does rufinus tell us after he escaped the barbarians she asked redfern paused to finish off his hot chocolate he goes on to say we reached the open sea navigating was difficult the stars are in different positions the sun is not the same also violent storms struck us from the south one crewman was swept overboard on the tenth day a gale we continued to be driven toward the north on the first day our god led us to a safe bay where we made repairs and took what provisions we could find from the land we also added extra ballast stone some distance beyond the beach there is a great sea of dwarflike pines fresh water seeps from sand with the jab of a stick six days of good sailing and then another tempest worse than the last our sails are split and useless the great gale shattered the mast and the steering oars were swept away we drifted helplessly under the merciless wind for many days i lost record of days sleep became impossible the weather turned very cold ice formed on the deck the ship became very unstable i ordered my frozen and exhausted crew to throw our water and wine jars over the side the amphoras you found on the bottom outside the fjord redfem paused nodding at pitt then he continued reading shortly after we were driven into this long bay we managed to beach the ship and fall into a dead sleep for two days and nights the god serapis is unkind winter has set in and ice has bound the ship we have no choice but to brave out the winter until the days warm a barbarian village lies across the bay and we have found them open to trade we barter with them for food they use our gold coins as trinkets having no idea of their value they have showed us how to keep warm by burning oil from a monstrous fish our stomachs are full and i think we shall survive while i am comfortable with much time on my hands i will write a few words each day this entry i shall recall the amount and type of cargo that venators slaves unloaded from the hold of the serapis as i watched unseen from the galley and made an accounting at the sight of the great object everyone sank to their knees in proper reverence what does he mean asked lily patience said redfem listen three hundred twenty copper tubes marked geologic charts sixtythree large tapestries these were packed around the grand goldandglass casket of alexander my knees trembled i could see his face through rufinus wrote no more redfem said sadly he didnt finish the sentence the last tablet is a drawing showing the general configuration of the shoreline and the course of the river the lost coffin of alexander the great lily said slightly above a whisper can he still lie buried in a cavern somewhere along with treasures from the alexandria library redfem added to lilys question we can do little else but hope pitts reaction was quite different it was one of profound confidence hope is for spectatorsi figure i can find your antiques in thirty make that twenty days lilys and redfems eyes opened wide they regarded pitt with the suspicion usually awarded a politician promising to lower taxes they flatly didnt believe him they should have you sound pretty cocky said lily pitts green eyes glowed with a look of utter sincerity lets have a look at the map redfem handed him a rendering lily had made from the tablet and then enlarged there was little to examine except a series of wavy lines wont tell us much he said rufinus didnt label anything its enough said pitt his tone dry and unperturbed enough to lead us to the front door it was four in the morning when pitt awoke he automatically rolled over to return to sleep but realized through the cobwebs that someone had turned on the light and was talking to him sorry pal but youve got to rise and shine pitt groggily squinted into the serious face of commander knight what gives orders from the top youre to shove off for washington immediately they say why they is the pentagon and no they didnt grace me with an explanation pitt sat up and swung his bare feet onto the deck i was hoping to hang around a bit longer and watch the excavation no such luck said knight you giordino and dr sharp have to be on your way within the hour lily pitt stood and made his way to the head i can understand the big brass wanting to question al and me about the soviet sub but why are they interested in lily the joint chiefs dont confide in the serfs knight smiled wryly i havent a clue what about transportation same way redfem came in helicopter to the eskimo village and weather station a navy plane to iceland where you transfer to an air force b bomber thats rotating back to the states for overhaul not the way its done mumbled pitt with a toothbrush in his mouth if they want my wholehearted cooperation its private jet or nothing youre pretty heady for this early in the morning when im kicked out of bed before dawn im not shy about telling the joint chiefs to insert it among their hemorrhoids there goes my next promotion moaned knight guilt by association stick with me and youll wind up fleet admiral i bet pitt tapped his head with the toothbrush gemus has struck fire off a message say well meet them halfway giordino and i will fly our numa copter direct to thule air force base they can damn well have a government jet waiting to zap us to the capital you might as well tease a doberman when hes eating pitt threw up his hands why is it nobody around here has any faith in my creative smartst washington closed down after a dazzling clear day the crisp fall weather sharpened the air as the setting sun glazed the white granite of the government buildings into a goldue porcelain the sky was sprinkled with cottonball clouds that looked solid enough for the gulfstream iv jetliner to land on the plane could carry up to nineteen passengers but pitt giordino and lily had the main cabin all to themselves giordino had promptly fallen asleep before the planes wheels lifted from the us air force base at nule and hadnt opened an eye since lily had dozed on and off or read marlys milihisers the threshold pitt stayed awake lost in his thoughts occasionally making entries in a small notebook he turned and stared out the small window at the homewardbound traffic slowly beating its way from the core of the capital his thoughts wandered back to the frozen crew of the serapis its skipper rufinus and his daughter hypatia pitt was sorry his eyes had failed to find the girl in the darkness of the cargo hold even though the video camera had recorded her quite clearly arms circled around a s all longhaired dog gronquist almost cried when he described her pitt wondered if she would end up as a frozen display in a museum viewed in hushed astonishment by endless lines of the curious gazing down at the washington mall as the gulfstream circled for its approach pitt put off his thoughts of the serapis and focused on the search for the alexandria library treasures he knew exactly how he was going about it the part of his plan that didnt thrill him was putting all his eggs in one basket he had to bank his entire search on a few crudely scratched in wax by the freezing hand of a dying man murphys lawwhatever can go wrong will go wrong was already erecting the barricades against him the lines in the map might not fit a known geographical location for any number of reasons distortion in the wax from rapid temperature changes during the initial freeze on the serapis and later thaw on board the polar explorer or perhaps ruflnus erred in the scale and misplaced the curves and angles of the shoreline and river or the worst and most probable scenariogreat changes in the landscape due to soil buildup or erosion earthquakes or extreme changes in climate during the past years no river in the world had maintained an unvarying course over a thousand years pitt smelled the intoxicating scent of challenge to restless men it is a real scent that wafts somewhere between a sexually aroused woman and newly cut grass after a rain it tempts and addicts until the challenger is oblivious to any thought of failure or danger the excitement of the chase meant as much to pitt as actual success and yet when he did achieve the nearimpossible there was always the inevitable letdown afterward his first obstacle was lack of time to conduct a search the second was the soviet sub he and giordino were the frontrunning candidates to oversee the underwater salvage operation pitts reverie was interrupted by the pilots voice over the speakers to fasten seat belts he watched the planes tiny shadow enlarge against the leafless trees below the brown grass flashed past and turned to concrete the pilot taxied off the main runway at andrews air force base and braked to a stop beside a ford taurus station wagon pitt helped lily step from the plane then he and giordino unloaded the luggage and stacked it in the rear of the taurus driver a young athletic prepschool type stood back as if afraid to interfere with the two hardcore types who handled the heavy suitcases and duffel bags as lightly as pillows whats the plan pitt asked the driver dinner with admiral sandecker at his club admiral who asked lily sandecker answered giordino our boss at numa we must have done something right its a rare treat when he pops for a meal not to mention an invitation to the john paul jones club added pitt exclusive giordino nodded a depository for rusty old naval officers with bilge water in their bladders it was dark when the driver finally turned into a quiet residential street in georgetown five blocks later he eased the car onto a gravel drive and stopped beneath the portico of a redbrick victorian mansion in the entrance hall a short gamecock of a man stepped across the carpet dressed in a tailored silk suit with a vest he moved in rapid energetic steps like a cat sneaking through a door crack his features were sharp and always remlinded pitt noticed the deep red hair on his head connected to a meticulously ed van dyke beard his eyes seemed filled with spit and vinegar admiral james sandecker was not the kind to creep into a room he took it by storm good to see you boys back he snapped in a tone more official than friendly i hear your ancient ship discovery may change the history books the news media is giving it a big play we had a few lucky breaks said pitt may i present dr lily sharp lily admiral james sandecker sandecker beamed like a lighthouse when he was in the presence of an attractive woman and he went luminous for lily doctor you have to be the loveliest lady to ever honor these walls im happy to see your club shows no discrimination against females not because the membership is opensaid giordino slyly most women would rather get a tetanus shot than come here and hear old derelicts rehash the wars on toward sandecker shot giordino a withering stare lily looked at the two men puzzled she thought perhaps she was caught in the middle of a longstanding feud pitt forced back a laugh but couldnt suppress a smile hed witnessed the giveandtake for ten years everyone close to them knew giordino and sandecker were the warmest of friends lily decided to make a tactical retreat if one of you gentlemen will point out the ladies room ill freshen up sandecker gestured up a hallway first door on the right please take your time as soon as she had left the admiral motioned pitt and giordino into a small sitting room and closed the door i have to leave for a meeting with the secretary of the navy in an hour this will be our only chance to talk in private so ill have to make it quick before dr sharp returns let me begin by saying you did a damned fine job finding the soviet sub and then clamping a lid on it the president was most pleased when he received the news and asked me to thank you when do we start asked giordino start what a covert underwater salvage operation on the sub our intelligence people insist it be put on hold their scheme is to feed soviet agents misleading information make it appear any further search is a waste of taxpayers money and weve written it off as a lost cause for how long pitt asked maybe a year whatever time it takes for the mission project people to draw up plans and construct the equipment for the project pitt stared at the admiral suspiciously i get the feeling we wont be included dead on sandecker said flatly as they say at the police precinct youre off the case i have a more important job for you two characters what could be more important than stealing the secrets of the soviet navys deadliest submarine pitt asked guardedly a skiing holiday sandecker replied nothing like the invigorating air and the powder snow of the rockies youre booked on a commercial flight to denver tomorrow morning at ten fortyfive dr sharp will accompany you pitt looked at giordino who merely shrugged he turned back to sandecker is this a reward or exile call it a working vacation senator pitt will explain the details my dad hes expecting you later this evening at his home sandecker pulled a large gold pocket watch from his vest pocket and read the ivory face we must not keep a pretty lady waiting sandecker started for the door while pitt and giordino stood dumbly rooted to the rooms faded carpet dont hold back admiral pitts voice was sharp unless you play it straight theres no way in hell ill be on that plane tomorrow accept my regrets too giordino said i feel an attack of borneo jungle fullgus coming on sandecker paused in midstride mined lifted an eyebrow and stared directly at pitt you dont fool me for a minute mister you dont give a damn about the soviet sub you want to find the relics of the alexandria library so bad youd give up sex pitt said with forbearance your insight is flawless as usual so is your underground grapevine i intended to turn over the transcription of the serapiss log to you on our return to washington apparently someone beat me to it commander knight he radioed dr redfems translation in code to the navy department who turned it over to the national security council and the president i read a copy before you left iceland you opened pandoras box and didnt know it if the cache exists and can be found it will cause a political upheaval but im not about to go into it that job was given to your father for reasons hes better qualified to explain how does lily fit in the picture shes part of your cover a backup in the event theres a leak or the kgb suspects their sub was actually found martin brogan wants to make it clear youre working on a legitimate archaeological project thats why im meeting you at the club and your father will brief you at home your movements must look routine should you be tailed sounds like an ove i to me the bureaucracy works in mysterious ways said giordino resignedly i wonder if i can get tickets to a denver bronco game im glad we see eye to eye sandecker said with some satisfaction now lets find our table im starved they dropped lily off at the jefferson hotel she gave them both a hug and entered the lobby followed by a porter with her bags pitt and giordino directed the driver to the tenstory solarglass building that was the headquarters for the national underwater agency giordino went directly to his office on the fourth floor while pitt remained on the elevator and rode up to the communicationandinformation network on the top level he left an attached case with the receptionist and removed an envelope slipping it in his coat pocket he wandered around the seemingly endless rows of electronic equipment and computer hardware until he found a man sitting crosslegged on the tiled floor contemplating a miniature tape recorder dissected from a large kangaroo doll does it sing waltzing matilda offkey pitt asked howd you know a lucky guess hiram yaeger looked up and grinned he had a droll face with straight blond hair tied in a ponytail his beard curled in long ringlets looked as if he had borrowed it from a costume rental he peered through a pair of granny spectacles and was dressed like a downandout rodeo performer in old levis and boots a bag lady would throw away sandecker had pirated yaeger away from a computerdesign company in californias silicon valley and had given him free reign to create numas data complex from scratch it was a perfect mamage between human gemus and central processing unit yaeger supervised a vast library of information containing every known report and book written about the worlds oceans yaeger studied the dolls recording and speaker unit with a critical eye i could have designed a better system than this with kitchen utensils can you fix it probably not pitt shook his head and gestured around the computer complex you set up all this but cant repair a simple cassette player my heart isnt in it yaeger rose walked into an office and stood the stuffed kangaroo on one corner of his desk maybe someday when im inspired ill modify it into a talking lamp pitt followed him and closed the door feel in the mood for a more exotic project along what lines research lay it on me pitt removed the envelope from his pocket and gave it to yaegernumas computer wizard slouched in a chair opened the envelope flap and withdrew the contents he rapidly scanned the typed transcript then read through it again more slowly after a long silence he peered over his spectacles at pitt this from that old ship you found you know of it have to be blind and deaf not to the story has been all over the newspapers and tv pitt nodded at the papers in yaegers hand a translation from latin of the ships log what do you want from me take a look at the page with the map yaeger held it up and studied the uniabeled lines you want me to make a match with a known geographical location if you can pitt acknowledged not a hell of a lot to go on what is it an ocean shoreline and a river when was it drawn ad yaeger gave pitt a bemused look you might as well ask me to name the streets of atlantis program your electronic playmates for a projection of the ships course after the fleet left cartagena you might also try working backwards from the shipwreck site in greenland ive included the position you realize this river may not exist any more the thought entered my mind ill need authorization from the admiral youll get it first thing in the morning all right yaeger said glumly ill give it my best shot whats my deadline just stay with it until you have something pitt replied ive got to go out of town for a while ill check in with you the day after tomorrow to see how youre doing can i ask a question sure is this really important yes pitt said slowly i think it is maybe more important than you and i can ever imagine when pitts father opened the door to his colonial home on massachusetts avenue in bethesda maryland he wore a faded pair of khaki pants and a wellsnagged pullover sweater the socrates of the senate was noted for his expensive and fashionable suits always embellished with a california golden poppy in the lapel but out of the public eye he dressed like a rancher camped out on the range dirk he said with pleasure giving his son a warm bear hug i see you too infrequently these days pitt put his arm around the senators shoulder and they walked side by side into a paneled den with rifled bookshelves stretching from floor to ceiling a fire flickered under an ornate mantel carved from teak the senator motioned his son to a chair and walked behind a wet bar bombay gin martini with a twist isnt it a bit cool for gin how about a jack daniels straight up every man to his own poison hows mom shes at some highfalutin spa a fat farm in california on her annual crusade to lose weight shell be back day after tomorrow two pounds heavier she never gives up it keeps her happy the senator passed pitt a bourbon and then poured himself a port he raised the glass heres to a fruitful trip to colorado pitt didnt drink whose bright idea was it to send me skiing mine pitt calmly took a swallow of jack daniels and gave his father a hard stare what is your involvement with the alexandria library artifacts very heavy if they truly exist are you speaking as a private citizen or a bureaucrat a patriot all right pitt said with a deep sigh fill me in how are classical art and literary works and the coffin of alexander so vital to united states interests none of the above said the senator the prime meat of the inventory is maps showing geological resources of the ancient world the lost gold mines of the pharaohs the forgotten emerald mines of cleopatra the fabled but mystic land of punt that was famous for its riches of silver antimony and unusual greenish gold locations known two and three thousand years ago but buried in the oblivion of time there was also the fabulous land of ophir and its recorded wealth of precious minerals its location still remains a tantalizing mystery the mines of king solomon nebuchadnezzar of babylon and sheba the queen of saba whose fabled land today is only a biblical memory the legendary wealth of the ages still lies hidden under the sands of the middle east so its found so what how can preciousmineral deposits belonging to other countries concern our government as bargaining chips answered the senator if were able to point the way negotiations can be opened for joint ventures in the exploitation we can also make points with national leaders and spread a little badly needed goodwill pitt shook his head and considered news to me congress has turned to prospecting for good foreign relations must be more to this than meets the eye the senator nodded marveling at his sons insight there is are you familiar with the term stratigraphic trap i should be pitt smiled i found one in the labrador sea off quebec province a few years ago yes the doodlebug project i remember a stratigraphic trap is one of the toughest oil deposits to discover normal seismic exploration wont detect it yet they often prove out to have incredibly high yields which leads us to bitumen a hydrocarbonlike tar or asphatt that was used in mesopotamia as long as five thousand years ago for waterproofing buildings canals clay drainage pipes and caulking boats other uses included roads treatment of wounds and adhesives much later the greeks mention springs along the north african coast that bubble with oil the romans recorded a site in the sinai they called petrol mountain and the bible tells of god ordering jacob to suck oil out of flintlike rock and describes the vale of siddim being frill of slime pits which can be interpreted as tar pits none of these areas has been relocated or drilled pitt asked there has been drilling yes but no significant strikes to date geologists claim theres a ninety percent probability of finding five hundred million barrels of crude petroleum under israel alone unfortunately the ancient sites have been lost and covered over through the centuries due to land upheavals and earthquakes then the main goal is to find a massive oil bonanza in israel you have to admit it would solve a multitude of problems yes i guess it would the senator and pitt sat in silence for the next minute staring into the fire if yaeger and his computer banks didnt pick up a lead the chances were at best hopeless pitt was suddenly angered that the power brokers in the te house and congress were more interested in oil and gold than in the art and literature that could fill in the missing gaps of history it was he thought a sad commentary on the affairs of state the silence was broken by the ring of the telephone the senator walked over to a desk and picked up the receiver he said nothing merely listened for a moment then he hung up i doubt if ill find the lost library in colorado pitt said dryly everyone concerned would be surprised if you did the senator came back my staff has arranged a briefing for you by the leading authority on the subject dr bertram rothberg a professor of classical history at the university of colorado has made the study of the alexandria library his lifes work hell fill you in on background data that could help your search why do i have to go to him seems to me it would be more practical to bring him to washington you met with admiral sandecker yes then you know its vital to distance yourself and al giordino from the discovery of the soviet submarine that phone call a minute ago was from an fbi agent who is talking a kgb agent who is talking you nice to know im popular youre to make no move that would cause suspicion pitt nodded approvingly fine and dandy but suppose the russians get wise to the mission they have as much to gain by laying their hands on the library data as we do the possibility exists but is extremely remote the senator said guardedly weve taken every precaution to keep the wax tablets secret next question shoot im under surveillance said pitt whats to stop the kgb from following me to dr rothbergs doorstep nothing the senator answered we have every intention of sitting on the sidelines and cheering them on so we put on a show of status quo exactly why me because of your l cord my cord the classic car you had restored in denver the man you hired called here last week and said to tell you the job is finished and she looks beautiful so i travel to colorado under a spotlight to pick up my collector car get in a little ski time on the slopes and party with dr sharp exactly the senator repeated youre to check into the hotel breckenridge a message will be waiting explaining where and when youll make contact with dr rothberg remind me never to trade horses with you the senator laughed youve been involved with some pretty devious schemes yourself pitt finished the bourbon stood and placed his glass on the mantel mind if i borrow the family lodge id prefer you stay away from it but my boots and skis are stored in the garage you can rent your equipment thats ridiculous not so ridiculous the senator said in an even voice when you consider that the instant you open the front door youll be shot you sure you want to get out here buddy the cabdriver inquired as he stopped beside what looked like an abandoned hangar on one corner of washingtons international airport this is the place replied pitt the driver glanced warily around at the deserted unlit area this had all the earmarks of a mugging he thought he reached under the front seat for a length of pipe he hid for such an occasion he kept an apprehensive eye on the rearview mirror as pitt pulled a wallet from his inside coat pocket the driver relaxed slightly his fare wasnt acting like a mugger what do i owe you i got eightsixty on the meter the driver replied pitt paid the fare plus tip and exited the cab waiting for the driver to open the trunk and remove the luggage hell of a place for a drop the driver muttered someone is meeting me pitt stood and watched the cabs taillights dim in the distance before he turned off the hangars alarm system with a pocket transmitter and entered through a side door he pressed a code on the transmitter and the interior became bathed in bright fluorescent light the hangar was pitts home the main floor was lined with a glittering collection of classic and restored automobiles there were also an old pullman railroad car and a ford tri motor airplane the most bizarre oddity was a castiron bathtub with an outboard motor attached to it he walked toward his living quarters which stretched across an upper level against the far wall reached by an ornate iron spiral staircase the door at the top opened onto a living room flanked by a large bedroom and a study on one side and a dining area and kitchen on the other he unpacked and entered a shower stall turning up the hot water and aiming the nozzle against a tiled wall he lay on his back with his feet stretched upward just below the faucets so he could control the spray temperature with his toes then he promptly dozed off fortyfive minutes later pitt slipped on a robe and turned on the tv set he was about to reheat a pot of texas chili when the buzzer on the intercom sounded he pressed the door speaker button halfexpecting al giordino to answer yes greenland catering a feminine voice answered he laughed and pressed a switch that unlocked the side door he stepped onto the balcony and stared down lily walked in carrying a large picnic basket she stopped and gazed in astonishment for several moments her eyes dazzled by the light reflecting off the sea of chrome and highly polished lacquer paint admiral sandecker tried to describe your place to me she said admiringly but he didnt do it justice pitt came down the stairs to meet her he took the picnic basket and nearly dropped it this thing weighs a ton whats in it our late dinner i stopped off at a delicatessen and picked up a few goodies smells like a tasty menu we begin with smoked salmon followed by wild mushroom soup spinach salad with pheasant and walnuts linguine in oyster sauce and white wine all washed down with a bottle of principessa gavi for dessert we have coffee chocolate trifle pitt looked down at lily and smiled in genuine admiration her face was alive and her eyes sparkling there was a vibrancy he had not noticed before her hair was brushed long and straight she wore a tightfitting tank dress with a revealing back and black sequins that flashed as she walked free of the heavy coat she had worn since greenland her breasts loomed larger and her hips more slender than he had pictured them in his imagination her legs were long and angled provocatively and she moved with a sensual vivacity after they entered his living room pitt dropped the food basket in a chair and reached out and took her hand we can eat later he said softly in automatic shyness she dropped her gaze downward then slowly as if drawn by an irresistible force her eyes slowly rose to meet his pitts green eyes were so piercing that her legs grew weak and her hands trembled she began to flush this was stupid lily thought she had carried the seduction down to the right wine the dress and the alluring black lace bra and panties beneath and now she was swept by confusion and doubt she didnt dream things would move so quickly without a word pitt peeled the straps from lilys shoulders allowing the sequined dress to fall in a pool of shimmering light around her high heels he slipped his hands around her bare waist and under her knees lifting her body in one flowing motion as he carried her into the bedroom she buried her face against his chest i feel like a brazen harlot she whispered pitt tenderly laid her on the bed and looked down the sight of her body made the fire burn within him better he said in a husky voice that you act like one yazid entered the dining hall of his villa he paused and gave a brief nod at the long table covered with plates serving dishes eating utensils and goblets all cast in bronze i trust my friends enjoyed their dinner mohammed alhakim a scholarly mullah who was yazids shadow pushed back his chair and stood excellent as always akhmad but we missed your enlightened presence allah does not reveal his wishes to me when my stomach is full yazid said with a faint smile he looked around the room at the five men who had risen to their feet and were acknowledging his authority with varied degrees of respect no two were dressed alike colonel naguib bashir leader of a clandestine organization of proyazid officers had worn a loose flowing djellaba with long sleeves and hood to conceal his identity since leaving cairo a turban sat like a grotesque lump on the head of alhakim and his frail body was covered from shoulders to feet in a drab robe of black cotton worn smooth mussa moheidin a journalist who was yazids chief propagandist was dressed casually in slacks and a sports shirt open at the neck while the young turk of the group khaled fawzy the ramrod of the revolutionary council wore battle fatigues only suleiman ammar was impeccably dressed in a wlored safari suit you must all be wondering why i called this emergency meeting yazid announced so i wont waste time allah has provided me with a plan to rid ourselves of president hasan and his den of corrupt thieves in one master stroke now please be seated and finish your coffee he walked over to one wall and pushed a switch a large colored map slowly dropped toward the floor amniar recognized it as a standard egyptian school map of south america a blowup of the coastal city of punta del este uruguay was circled in red taped to the lower half of the map was an enlarged photo of a luxury cruise ship the men around the table sat down again their faces expressionless their interest was hooked they waited patiently to hear the revelation allah had bestowed on their religious leader only ammar veiled his skepticism he was too much the realist to believe in pious concoctions in six days yazid began the international economic summit meetings brought on by the world monetary crisis will be held in the resort city of punta del este former scene of the interamerican economic and social council conference which proclaimed the alliance for progress the debtor nations except egypt have banded together to repudiate all loans and erase foreign debt this act will force hundreds of banks in the united states and europe to fail western bankers and their national financial experts have called for roundtheclock talks in a lastditch attempt to stall the coming economic catastrophe our imperialist bootlicking president is the only holdout hasan is scheduled to attend the talks and underminetine our islamic brothers and third world friends by begging the western money changers for more loans to keep his eroding grip on egypt this we will not permit bis millah we will take advantage of this moment to establish a true islamic government for our people i say we kill the tyrant and be done with it khaled fawzy said harshly he was young and arrogant and tactless already his impatience had resulted in a failed coup by his student revolutionaries that had cost thirty lives his dark eyes darted back and forth around the table one wellplaced groundto air missile as hasans plane takes off for uruguay and we will be rid of his corrupt regime for good and open the door for defense minister abu hamid to set himself up as dictator before we are ready finished mussa moheidin the famous egyptian writer was in his midsixties he was a witty urbane and articulate man with a slow and gracious manner moheidin was the only man at the table ammar truly respected yazid turned to bashir is that a valid prediction colonel bashir nodded a vain and shallow man he was quick to display his narrow vision of military affairs mussa is right abu hamid dangles the prospect of his support for you using the excuse that he is waiting for you to produce a mandate from the people this is merely a stalling tactic hamid is ambitious he is banking on an opportunity to use the army to set himself up as president all too true said fawzy one of his close aides is a member of our movement he revealed that haniid plans to install himself as president and consolidate his position by marrying hala kamil because of her popularity with the people yazid smiled he has built a castle of sand hala kamil will not be available for the marriage ceremony is that a certainty asked ammar yes yazid answered smoothly allah has willed that she not live beyond the next sun please share your revelation akhmad begged alhakim unlike the other darkskinned men around him alhakim had the face of a man who had spent half his life in a dungeon his pale skin seemed almost transparent yet the eyes which were magnified by thicklensed glasses were set in unshakable determination yazid nodded i have been informed by my wellplaced sources in mexico that because of an unexpected heavy invasion of tourists there is a shortage of luxury hotel rooms and palatial residences in punta del este to keep their nation from losing the summit talks and the international limelight uruguayan officials have arranged for the foreign leaders and their statesmen to be hosted on board chartered luxury cruise ships moored in the port hasan and the egyptian delegation will be staying on a british liner called the lady flamborough president de lo nzo of mexico and his staff will also be on board yazid paused and looked from one man to the next then he said ahah came to me in a vision and commanded me to seize the ship praise be to allah fawzy burst out the other men glanced at each other incredulous then they turned their attention back to yazid expectantly without voicing a question i see by the look in your eyes my friends you doubt my vision never said alhakim solemnly but perhaps you misinterpreted allahs command no it was quite clear the ship with president hasan and his ministers must be seized for what purpose asked mussa moheidin to seal off hasan and prevent his return to cairo while our forces sweep into power abu hamid wig call out the army to foil any overthrow other than his cautioned colonel bashir i know this for a fact haniid cannot stop a tidal wave of revolutionary fervor said yazid civil unrest is at a peak the masses are fed up with harsh austerity brought on by payment demands on foreign loans he and hasan are cutting their own throats by not denouncing the godless moneylenders egypt can only be saved by embracing the purity of islamic law khaled fawzy leaped to his feet and raised a fist you have only to give me the order akhmad and i will have people in the streets yazid paused breathing heavily with religious zeal then he said the people will lead i will follow the expression on alhakims face was grave i must confessi have dark misgivings you are a coward fawzy snapped in rash defiance mo ed alhakim is wiser than you said moheidin patiently i know his mind he does not wish a repeat of the achille lauro fiasco in nineteen eightyfive when palestinians commandeered the ltahan crew liner and murdered an old jew invalid in a wheelchair bashir spoke up terrorist slaughter will not help our cause you wish to go against the will of allah said yazid annoyed everyone began talking at once the room went sour with vehemence as they argued back and forth only ammar remained detached theyre idiots he thought goddamned idiots he tuned out of the debate and stared at the photo of the cruise ship the wheels inside his head began to shift through the gears we are not only egyptians argued bashir we are arabs the other arab nations will turn against us if we murder our officials and any of theirs who get in the way they wont see it as a gift from allah but rather as a political terrorist plot moheidin gestured toward fawzy khaled made a point better to kill hasan on home territory than launch a bloodbath on board a ship holding the leader of mexico and his delegation as well we cannot condone an act of mass terrorism said alhakim the negative consequences for our new government would be disastrous you are all worms who belong in hasans camp fawzy spat i say attack the ship and show the world our power nobody paid any attention to the militant fanatic who was viciously antijew and antichristian dont you see akhmad pleaded bashir security in punta del este will be impossible to penetrate uruguayan patrol boats will be thick as locusts every ship housing sumnut leaders will be heavily guarded youre talking a suicide assault by an army of commandos it simply cant be done we will have help from a source that must remain confidential said yazid he turned and studied ammar you suleimanyoure our expert on undercover operations if a team of our best fighters can be smuggled on board the lady flamborough without detection can the ship be taken and held until we can form a republic in the name of islam yes replied ammar without taking his eyes off the cruise ships photo the voice was quiet but it carried total conviction six days is cutting it slim but the ship can be carried with ten experienced fighting men and five experienced seamen with no bloodshed providing we have the element of suprise yazids eyes gleamed ah i knew i could count on you impossible bashir roared you could never smuggle that many men into uniguay without arousing suspicion and even if through some miracyou captured the ship and subdued the crew every special assault team in the west would be swarming over your hide inside of twentyfour hours threats to kill the hostages wont stop them youd i can take and hold the lady flamborough for two weeks bashir shook his head youre lost in a dream world how is that possible asked moheidin im interested in learning how you expect to outwit an army of highly trained international security forces without a pitched battle i dont intend to fight this is nonsense yazid said shocked not really said ammar its all in knowing the trick trick precisely ammar smiled benignly you see i plan on making the lady flamborough her crew and passengers an crew disappear my visit is strictly unofficial julius schiller advised hala kamil as they stepped into the logbeamed sitting room of senator pitts ski lodge my aides are covering for me saying im fishing in key west i understand said hala im grateful for the chance to talk to someone other than the cook and secret service guards she greeted him dressed fashionably in an icelandic brown wool sweaterjacket with matching pants looking even younger than schiller remembered he looked out of place at a ski resort in a business suit polished wingtip shoes and carrying an attached case is there anything i can arrange to make your safety more bearable no thank you nothing can relieve the frustration of inactivity when there is so much i must do a few more days and it will be over schiller said consolingly i hardly expected to see you here julius something has come up that concerns egypt our president thought it prudent you be consulted on a recent event hala curled her legs under her and sipped at the tea should i be flattered lets say hed be grateful for your cooperation regarding what schiller opened the attache case gave hala a bound folder and sat back with his tea he watched as the soft features of her angelic face slowly tightened as she realized the scope of what she read finally she finished the last page and closed the folder she gave schiller a penetrating stare is the public aware of this he nodded the discovery of the ship will be announced this afternoon but were holding off any reference to the alexandria library treasures hala gazed out the window our loss of the library sixteen centuries ago would compare to your president suddenly ordering the burning of the washington archives the smithsonian institution and the national art gallery schiller nodded a fair comparison is there hope the ancient books can be recovered we dont know yet the wax tables from the ship only provided a few tantalizing clues the hiding place could be anywhere between iceland and south africa but you do intend to search she said her interest growing the discovery project is underway who else knows about this only the president myself and a few trusted members of our government and now you why have you included me and not president hasan schiller got up and walked across the room then he turned back to hala your nations leader may not be in control much longer we feel the information is too farreaching to fall into the wrong hands akhmad yazid frankly yes your government will have to deal with him sooner or later said hala if the library treasures and their valuable geological data can be located yazid will demand they be returned to egypt we understand said schiller thats the purpose behind our meeting here in breckinridgethe president wishes you to announce the imminent discovery in your address to the united nations hala looked at schiller thoughtfully for a moment then her eyes turned and anger came into her voice how can i say the discovery is just around the corner when a search may take years and never be successful i find it most distasteful that the president and his advisers insist on creating a lie and using me to speak it is this another one of your stupid middle east foreign policy games julius a lastditch gamble to keep president hasan in power and erode akhmad yazids influence am i the tool to mislead the egyptian people into believing rich mineral deposits are about to be found in their country that will turn around our depressed economy and eliminate the terrible poverty schiller sat silently and made no denials you have come to the wrong woman julius ill see my government fall and face death from yazids executioners before i deceive my people with false hope noble sentiments schiller said quietly i admire your principles however i firmly believe the plan is sound the risk is too great if the president fails to provide the librarys great knowledge he will be inviting a political disaster yazid will take advantage with a propaganda campaign that will broaden his power base and make him stronger than your experts on egypt can ever conceive for the tenth time in as many years united states foreign policy experts will look like amateurish clowns in the eyes of the world mistakes have been made schiller admitted if only you hadnt interfered in our affairs i didnt come here to debate middle eastern policy hala i came to ask your help she shook her head and turned away im sorry i cant go on record with a lie schiller looked at her with compassion in his eyes he didnt push her but thought it better to back off ill tell the president of your response he said picking up his attache case and making for the doorway hell be most disappointed wait he turned expectantly hala rose and came to him prove to me that your people have a positive lead to the location of the library artifacts and not a foggy clue and ill do as the white house wishes youll make the announcement yes four days until your address is not much time those are my terms hala said bluntly schiller nodded gravely accepted then he turned and walked out the door muhammad ismail watched schillers limousine come off the private road leading to senator pitts lodge and turn onto highway toward the ski town of breckenridge he did not see who was seated in the rear seat and he did not care the sight of the official car men patrolling the grounds who spoke into radio transmitters at regular intervals and the two armed guards inside a dodge van at the roads enumce were all he needed to confirm the information purchased by yazids agents in washington ismail leaned casually against a large mercedesbenz diesel sedan shielding a man sitting inside peeling out an open window through a pair of binoculars a rack on the roof held several sets of skis lsmail was dressed in a white ski suit a matching ski mask hid his perpetually scowling face seen enough he asked while seemingly adjusting the ski rack another minute answered the observer he was staring at the lodge which was partially visible through the trees all that could be seen around the binoculars was a heavy black beard and a mass of uncombed hair make it quick im freezing out here just standing around bear with me another minute how does it look asked ismail no more than a fiveman detail three in the house two in the van only one man patrols around the grounds at a time not a second more than thirty minutes they dont dally the cold gets to them too they walk the same trail through the snow no sign of tv cameras but they probably have one mounted in the van that is monitored inside the house well move in two groups said ismail one takes the house the other kills the guard patrolling outside and destroys the van from the road where they least expect an attack the observer dropped the glasses do you plan to move in tonight muhammad no answered ismail tomorrow when the american pigs are stuffing their mouths with their morning meal a daylight raid will be dangerous we will not sneak around in the dark like women but our only escape route to the airport is through the center of town the observer protested the streets will be crowded with traffic and hundreds of skiers suleiman ammar would not risk such an adventure lsmail suddenly spun and slapped the observer with his gloved hand i am in charge here he snapped suleiman is an overrated jackal do not speak his name in my presence the observer did not cower his dark eyes flashed with hostility youll kill us all he said quietly so be it ismail hissed his voice as cold as the snow if we die so hala kamil can die the price will be cheap magnificent said pitt gorgeous simply gorgeous lily murmured giordino nodded in agreement a real winner they were standing in an antique and classic automobile restoration shop and their admiring stares were directed toward a l cord town car a model with an open front for the chauffeur the body was painted burgundy while the fenders were a buff that was matched by the leathercovered roof over the passengers compartment elegantly styled long and graceful the car had frontwheel drive that helped to give it a low silhouette the original coachmaker had stretched the chassis until it measured nearly fiveandahalf meters from front to rear bumper almost half the length was hood beginning with a racecartype grill and ending with a sharply raked windshield it was big and sleek a thing of beauty that belonged to an era fondly revered by older generations but unknown to those who followed the man who had found pitts car stored in an old garage hidden under forty years of trash and had restored it from a mangled hulk was proud of his handiwork robert esbenson a tall man with a pixie face and limpid blue eyes gave the hood a final loving wipe with a dust cloth and turned the car over to pitt i hate to see this one go youve done a remarkable job said pitt are you going to ship it home not just yet id like to drive it for a few days esbenson nodded okay let me adjust the carburetor and distributor for our high altitude then when you return to the shop ill have it detailed and arrange for an auto transporter to ship it to washington can i ride in it lily asked anxiously all the way to breckenridge pitt replied he turned to giordino coming with us al why not we can leave the rental car outside in the parking lot they switched the luggage and ten minutes later pitt turned the cord onto interstate and aimed the long hood toward the foothills leading into the snowpeaked rocky mountains lily and al sat warmly in the luxurious passenger compartment separated from pitt by the divider window pitt did not pull out the transformable top that protected the chauffeurs seat but sat in the open bundled up in a heavy sheepskin coat savoring the cold air on his face for the moment his mind was on his driving scanning the instruments to make sure the sixtyyearold car was performing as it was designed to do he held to the right lane allowing most of the traffic to pass and gawk pitt felt exhilarated and content behind the wheel listening to the smooth purr of the eightcylinder engine and the mellow tone of the exhaust it was as though he had control over a living thing if he had had any inkling of the mess he was driving into he would have turned around and headed straight back to denver darkness had fallen over the continental divide when the cord rolled into the legendary colorado mining town turned ski resort pitt drove up the main street whose old buildings retained their historic western flavor the sidewalks were crowded with people coming from the slopes carrying their skis and poles over one shoulder pitt parked near the entrance of the hotel breckenridge he signed the register and took two phone messages from the desk clerk he read both slips of paper and slipped them into a pocket from dr rothberg asked lily yes hes invited us for dinner at his condo its just across the street from the hotel what time giordino queried seventhirty lily glanced at her watch only forty minutes to shower and do my hair id better get with it pitt gave her the room key youre in two twentyone al and i have rooms adjoining yours on each side as soon as lily disappeared with the porter into an elevator pitt motioned giordino into the cocktail lounge he waited until the barmaid took their drink order before passing the second message across the table giordino read it aloud softly your library project takes top priority most urgent you find a permanent address for alex in the next four days luck dad he looked up utterly confused do i read this right we have only four days to identify the location pitt nodded positively i read panic between the lines and smell something rumbling in washington power circles they might as well ask us to invent a common cure for herpes aids and acne giordino grumbled we can kiss off our skiing trip well stay said pitt resolutely nothing we can do until yaeger gets lucky pitt rose from his chair and speaking of yaeger id better give him a call he found a public telephone in the hotel lobby and made a call on his credit card after four rings a voice answered in what sounded like the middle of a yawn yaeger here hiram this is dirk hows your search going its going run onto anything my babies sifted through every piece of geological data in their little banks from casablanca around the horn to zanzibar they failed to find a hot spot along the coast of africa that matched your drawing there were three vague possibilities but when i programmed profiles on landmass transformations that might have occurred over the past sixteen hundred years none proved encouraging sorry whats your next step im already in the process of heading north this will take more time because of the extensive shoreline encompassing the british isles the baltic sea and the scandinavian countries as far as siberia can you cover it in four days only if you insist i put the hired help on a twentyfourhour schedule i insist said pitt sternly word has just come down that the project has become an urgent priority well hit it hard yaeger said his voice more jovial than serious im in breckenridge colorado if you strike on something call me at the breckenridge hotel pitt gave yaeger the hotel phone and his room number yaeger dutifully repeated the digits okay got it you sound like youre in a good mood said pitt why not we accomplished quite a lot like what you still dont know where our river lies true replied yaeger cheerfully but we sure as hell know where it aint snowflakes the size of cornflakes were falling as the three trudged across the street from the hotel to a twostory cedarsided condominium a floodlighted sign read skiqueen they climbed a stairway and knocked on the door to unit b bertram rothberg greeted them with a jolly smile beneath a splendid gray beard and sparkling blue eyes his ears rose in full sail through a swirling sea of gray hair a red plaid shirt and corduroy trousers clad his beefy body put an ax in one hand and a crosscut saw in the other and he could have reported for duty as a lumberjack he shook hands warmly and without introductions as if hed known everyone for years he led them up a narrow stairwell to a combination livingdining room beneath a highpeaked ceiling with skylights how does a gallon bottle of cheap burgundy sound before dinner he asked with a sly grin lily laughed im game giordino shrugged makes no difference as long as its wet and you dirk sounds good pitt didnt bother asking rothberg how he recognized each of them his father would have provided descriptions the performance was nearly flawless pitt suspected the historian had worked for one of the governments many intelligence agencies at some time in the past rothberg retired to the kitchen to pour the wine lily followed can i help you with anything she suddenly stopped and peered at the empty counters and the cold stove rothberg caught her curious look im a lousy cook so our dinner will be catered it should show up around eight he pointed at the sectional couch in the living room please get comfortable around the fire he passed the glasses and then lowered his rotund figure into a leather easy chair he raised his glass heres to a successful search hear hear said lily pitt got off the mark dad tells me youve made the alexandria library a life study thirtytwo years probably been better off to have taken a wife all that time instead of rummaging around dusty bookshelves and straining my eyes over old manuscripts the subject has been like a mistress to me never asking only giving ive never fallen out of love with her lily said i can understand your attraction rothberg smiled at her as an archaeologist you would he rose and jabbed in the fireplace with a poker satisfied that the logs were burning evenly he sat down again and continued yes the library was not only a glorious edifice of learning but it was the chief wonder of the ancient world containing vast accumulations of entire civilizations rothberg spoke almost as if he was in a trance his mind seeing shadows from the past the great art and literature of the greeks the egyptians the romans the sacred writings of the jews the wisdom and knowledge of the most gifted men the world has ever known the divine works of philosophy music of incredible beauty the ancient bestsellers the masterworks of medicine and science it was the finest storehouse of materials and knowledge ever assembled in antiquity was it open to the public asked giordino certainly not to every beggar off the street answered rothberg but researchers and scholars pretty much had the run of the place to examine catalog translate and edit and to publish their findings you see the library and its adjoining museum went far beyond being mere depositories their halls launched the true science of creative scholarship the library became the first true reference library as we think of today where books were systematically catalogued in fact the complex was known as the place of the muses rothberg paused and checked his guests glasses you look like you can use another shot of wine al giordino smiled i never turn down a free drink lily dirk ive hardly touched mine said lily pitt shook his head im fine rothberg refilled giordinos glass and poured his own before continuing later empires and nations owe a staggering debt to the alexandria library few institutions of knowledge have produced so much pliny a celebrated roman of the first century ad invented and wrote the worlds first encyclopedia aristophanes head of the library two hundred years before christ was the father of the dictionary callimachus a famous writer and authority on greek tragedy compiled the earliest whos who the great mathematician euclid devised the first known textbook on geometry dionysius organized grammar into a coherent system and published his art of grammar which became the model text for all languages written and spoken these men and thousands of others labored tutu piuduced their epoch achievements while working at the library youre describing a university said pitt quite right together the library and museum were considered the university of the hellenistic world the immense structures of white marble contained picwm galleries statuary halls theaters for poetry reading and lectures on everything from astronomy to geology there were also dormitories a dining hall cloisters along colonnades for contemplation and an animal park and botanical garden ten great halls housed different categories of manuscripts and books hundreds of thousands of them were handwritten on either papyrus or parchment and then rolled into scrolls and stored in bronze tubes whats the difference between the two asked giordino papyrus is a tropical plant the egyptians made a paperlike writing material out of its stems parchment also called vellum was produced from the skins of animals especially young calves kids or lambs is it possible they could have survived the centuries pitt asked parchment should last longer than papyrus answered rothberg then he looked at pitt their condition after sixteen hundred years would depend on where theyve been stored papyrus scrolls from egyptian tombs are still readable after three thousand years a hot and dry atmosphere yes suppose the scrolls were buried somewhere along the northern coast of sweden or russia rothberg bent his head thoughtfully i suppose the freeze would preserve them but during the summer thaw they would rot from the dampness pitt could smell defeat looming down the road this was one more nail in the coffin hope of finding the library manuscripts intact seemed farther than ever lily did not share pitts pessimism she had the glow of excitement on her face if you had been junius venator dr rothberg what books would you have saved hard question rothberg said winking at her i can only guess he might have attempted to save the complete works of sophocles euripides aristotle and plato for a start and of course homer he wrote twentyfour books but only a very few have come down to us i think venator would have saved as many of the fifty thousand volumes on greek etruscan roman and egyptian history as his fleet of ships could carry the latter would be extremely interesting since the librarys monumental store of egyptian literature and religious and scientific material has all been lost we know practically nothing about the etruscans yet claudius wrote an extensive history on them that must have sat on the librarys shelves id certainly have taken religious works on hebrew and christian laws and traditions the revelations of these scrolls would probably knock the socks off modern biblical scholars books of the sciences added giordino that goes without saying dont forget cookbooks said lily rothberg laughed venator was a shrewd operator hed have saved a general spread of knowledge and material including books on cooking and household hints something for everyone you might say especially the ancient geological data said pitt especially that rothberg agreed has anything come down on what kind of a man he was inquired lily venator yes he was the leading intellectual of his time a renowned scholar and teacher who was hired away from one of the great learning centers of athens to become the last of the alexandria librarys prominent curators he was the great chronicler of his agewe know he wrote over a hundred books of political and social commentary that covered the known world going back four thousand years none of which has survived archaeological researchers would have a field day with data compiled by someone who was two thousand years closer to our past said lily what else do we know about him pitt asked not much venator attracted a large number of pupils who went on to become recognized men of letters and science one student diocles of antioch mentioned him briefly in one of his essays he described venator as a daring innovator who struck out into areas other scholars feared to tread though a christian he saw religion more as a social science this was the main cause behind the friction that existed between venator and the christian zealot theophilos bishop of alexandria theophilos went after venator with a vengeance claiming the museum and library were hotbeds of paganism he finally persuaded the emperor theodosius a devout christian to burn the place in the uproar and riots that occurred between christians and nonchristians during the destruction it was supposed junius venator was murdered by fanaticw followers of theophilos but now we know he escaped with the pick of the collection said lily when senator pitt called with the news of your discovery in greenland said rothberg i felt as excited as a street sweeper whod won a milliondollar lottery can you give us any thoughts on where you think venator hid the artifacts asked pitt rothberg considered for a long moment finally he said quietly junius venator was not an ordinary man he followed his own path he had access to a mountain of knowledge his route would have been scientifically planned only the unknowns were left to chance he certainly did an efficient job when you consider the relics have remained hidden for sixteen hundred years rothberg threw up his hands in defeat i cant offer a clue venator is too tough a customer to secondguess you must have some idea pitt persisted rothberg looked long and deeply into the flames wavering in the fireplace all i can say is venators burial place must be where no man would think to look read ismails watch he flattened himself behind a small blue spruce and peered at the lodge wood smoke was curling from one of two chimneys while steam issued from the heater vents kamil he knew was an early riser and a good cook he rightly reasoned that she was up and making breakfast for her guards he was a man of the desert and not used to the icy cold that gripped him he wished he could stand flail his arms and stamp his feet his toes ached and his fingers were becoming numb inside the gloves the agony of the cold was filling his mind and slowing his reaction time a creeping fear fell over him a fear that he might botch the job and die for no purpose ismails inexperience was showing through at the initial stage of the mission he was coming unstrung he suddenly wondered if the hated americans somehow knew or suspected his presence nervous and afraid his mind began to lose its ability to make hardandfast decisions one quick glance at the van just above the entrance to the road shifts were alternated every four hours between the guards in the warm lodge and those huddled inside the van two relief men were due to make the hundredmeter walk from the lodge at any time he turned his attention to the guard walking a wellbeaten path through the snow around the grounds he was slowly approaching ismails tree his breath coming in clouds of vapor his gaze alert for any sign out of the ordinary the monotony and the bitter cold had not slackened the secret service agents vigilance his eyes swept back and forth over the area like radar less than a minute remained before he would see ismails trail in the snow ismail swore softly under his breath and pressed more deeply into the snow he was he knew exposed the pine needles shielding him from view would not stop bullets almost on the dot the front door of the lodge opened and two men stepped out they wore stocking caps and downfilled ski coats they automatically scanned the snowy landscape as they moved down the road in quiet conversation ismails plan was to wait until the relief party reached the van and then take out all four guards at the same time but he had misjudged and moved into position too early the two men had only walked fifty meters down the road when the guard circling the lodge spotted ismails footprints he stopped and raised the transmitter to his lips his words were cut off by a loud series of cracks from ismails heckler koch mp submachine gun ismails amateurish plan had gotten off to a bad start a pro would have snuffed the guard with a single shot between the eyes from a silenced semiautomatic ismail stitched the guards coat in the chest area with ten rounds a good twenty others sprayed the woods beyond one of the arabs frantically began lobbing grenades at the van while another pumped bullets through the sides sophisticated assault was beyond the scope of most terrorists finesse was as foreign to them as liquid soap their only salvation was luck one of the grenades found its way through the windshield bursting with a loud thud the explosion bore no similarity to motionpicture special effects the gas tank did not go up in a fiery ball the body of the van bulged and split as if a cherry bomb had gone off inside a tin can both occupants were killed instantly excited with blood lust the two assassins neither older than twenty kept up their attack on the mangled van until the magazines of their rifles were empty instead of concentrating on the secret service agents on the road who took cover behind trees and unleashed an accurate fire from their uzis that quickly cut them down correctly figuring their fellow agents inside the van were beyond help they began retreating toward the lodge running in a sideways motion back to back one of them exchanging fire with ismail who had found cover behind a large mossy rock ismafls strategy was blown away by the confusion the other ten men of the terrorist team were supposed to rush the rear door at the sound of ismads gunfire but they lost valuable time wading through kneedeep snow their assault came late and they were effectively pinned down by the agents inside one arab managed to gain temporary safety under the north wall of the lodge he pulled the pin on a grenade and flipped it at a large sliding window he misjudged the thickness of the double panes and the grenade bounced back his face had only time for an expression of horror before the blast blew him apart the two agents scrambled up the steps and leapt through the front door the arabs laid down a barrage of fire that caught one of the men in the back dropping him with only his feet showing across the threshold he was quickly dragged inside and the door slammed shut at the exact instant a dozen shots and a grenade blasted it into splinters the windows disintegrated in showers of glass but the heavy log walls easily withstood the onslaught the agents dropped two more of ismads men but the rest dodged in closer using the pines and rocks for cover when they had moved within twenty meters of the lodge they began hurling grenades through the windows inside the lodge an agent roughly shoved hala into a cold fireplace he was in the act of pushing a writing desk over the hearth to shield her when a hail of fire through a window ricocheted off the stone mantel of the bullets smashing into his neck and shoulder hala could not see but she heard his body thump as it made contact with the wood floor ibc grenades were taking deadly effect now at close range the shrapnel was far more damaging to human tissue than a rifle bullet the agents only defense was a sharp and precise fire but they had not counted on a heavy assault and theirsmall stockpile of ammunition was down to the last few clips a call for assistance had been transmitted immediately after ismails opening shots but the emergency plea went to the secret service office in denver and precious time was lost before the local sheriffs department was notified and their units organized a grenade exploded in a storeroom igniting a can of paint thinner a gas can used for filling the tank of a snowblower went next and one entire side of the lodge soon crawled with flames the gunfire died as the fire spread the arabs cautiously tightened the net they formed a loose circle around the lodge every automatic rifle was trained on the doors and windows they waited patiently for the survivors to be flushed out by the blaze only two secret service agents were still on their feet the rest were sprawled in bloody heaps among the mutilated pieces of furniturethe full fury of the fire raced into the kitchen and up a rear staircase spreading to the upstairs bedrooms already it was far beyond any hope of extinction the heat swiftly became unbearable to the defenders on the lower floor the sound of sirens echoed up the valley from the direction of town and drew closer one agent pushed away the desk protecting hala in the fireplace and led her on hands and knees to a low window the local sheriffs deputies are arriving he said quickly as soon as they draw off the terrorist fire well make a run for it before were barbecued to death hala could only nod she could hardly hear him her eardrums hurt from the roar of the grenades her eyes were filled with tears and she pressed a handkerchief tightly against her nose and mouth to filter out the thickening blanket of smoke outside ismail lay prone clutching his h k automatic torn by indecision the lodge had swiftly become a blazing inferno smoke and flame were rolling through the windows anyone still living had to escape in the next few seconds or die but ismail could not wait it out already he could see red and blue lights flashing through the trees as a sheriffs car sped up the highway of his original team of twelve men seven were left including himself any wounded were to be killed rather than left behind to be interrogated by american intelligence officials he shouted a comnand to his men and they pulled away from the lodge and hurried off toward the entrance road the first deputies to arrive slid to a stop and blocked the road to the lodge while one reported on the radio his partner cautiously eased open his door and studied the van and burning lodge holding his drawn revolver they were only to observe report and wait for backup it was a sound tactic when facing armed and dangerous criminals unfortunately it didnt work with a small army of unseen terrorists who suddenly opened fire with a storm of bullets that shredded the patrol car and killed the two deputies before they had a chance to react at a signal from one of the agents peering around the window hala was lifted and brusquely flung out onto the ground the secret service men followed and quickly took her by the arms and began running stumbling through the snow on an angle toward the highway they had covered only paces when one of ismails men spotted them and shouted the alarm shots struck the trees and branches fell around the fleeing survivors one of the agents suddenly threw up his hands clawing at the sky stumbled forward a few steps and then fell face downward in the snow theyre trying to cut us off from the highway the other agent snapped you try to make it ill make a stand and delay them hala started to say something but the agent spun her around and gave her a nottoogentle shove that sent her on her way run dammit run he yelled but he could see it was already too late any hope of escape was dealt a death blow they had taken the wrong angle away from the burning lodge and were headed on a direct line toward two mercedesbenz sedans parked in woods beside the road in dazed defeat he realized the cars belonged to the terrorists he had no alternative if he couldnt stop them he would at least slow them down long enough for hala to hail a passing car in a suicide gamble the agent ran at the arabs finger locked on the trigger of his uzi shouting every obscenity hed ever learned ismail and his men were momentarily stunned into immobility by what they saw as a charging demon for two incredulous seconds they hesitated then recovered and let loose a long burst at the courageous secret service agent cutting him down in midstride but not before he took out four of them hala saw the cars too she also saw the terrorists rushing for them behind her she heard the thunderous fusillade of shots choking and gasping for breath her clothes and hair singed she staggered into a small ditch and up the other side before sprawling on a hard surface she raised her head slightly and found herself staring at black asphalt she pushed herself to her feet and began running knowing she was only delaying the inevitable knowing with dread certainty she would be lying dead in the next few minutes the cord rolled majestically along the highway from breckenridge the morning sun gleaming on the bright chrome and new paint skiers wailing to the lifts waved as the elegant sixtyyearold classic swept past giordino dozed in the enclosed rear seat while lily sat up front in the open with pitt pitt had awakened in a stubborn mood that morning he saw no reason to ski on rental skis when his own american made olin s were in a closet only three miles up the road from the hotel besides he reasoned he could drive to the family lodge pick up his gear and be sitting on a chair lift in half the time it took waiting his turn to be fitted in a rental shop pitt shrugged off his fathers unexplained warning to stay clear of the lodge he simply wrote it off as bureaucratic overplay the senator would have made the same impression on hulk hogan by telling the wrestler to turn the other cheek after an opponent had kicked him in the groin whos shooting off fireworks so early in the morning lily wondered aloud not fireworks pitt said tuning in the sharp crack of gunfire and the explosive thump from grenades echoing off the mountainsides of the valley sounds like an infantry firefight its coming from the woods up ahead lily pointedto the right of the road the smile wrinkles around pitts eyes tightened he increased the cords speed and rapped on the divider window giordino came awake and cranked the glass down you woke me just as the orgy was getting started he said between yawns listen up ordered pitt giordino winched as the cold air flew into the passengers compartment he cupped his ears slowly an expression of bewilderment crossed his face have the russians landed look said lily excitedly a forest fire giordino made a quick study of the black smoke that abruptly billowed above the treetops chased by columns of flame fuel concentrated he stated briefly id say it was a burning structure probably a house or condominium pitt knew giordino was on target he swore and pounded the steering wheel knowing with sickening certainty it was his familys lodge that was feeding the growing mushroom of fire and smoke he said no sense asking for trouble by stopping well drive past and check out the action al you come up front lily climb in the rear and keep your head down i dont want you hurt what about me giordino asked in resigned indignation dont i rate a little concern give me one good reason why i should sit up there exposed with you to protect your trusty chauffeur from harm evil and unsavory felons definitely not a good reason pitt tried another tack of course theres that fifty bucks i borrowed from you in panama and never paid back plus interest plus interest pitt repeated what i wont go through to protect my meager assets giordinos weary despair sounded almost genuine as he scrambled through the open divider window and changed places with lily farther down the highway a halfmile before the entrance to the lodge people were stopping and crouching behind their parked cars gawking at the swirling smoke and listening to the rattle of automatic rifles pitt thought it odd that the sheriffs department hadnt put in an appearance and then he saw the bulletriddled patrol car barricading the road to the lodge his attention was focused to his right and the inferno beyond when suddenly at the very edge of his peripheral vision he caught a vague form running down the road on a collision course with the cord he stomped on the brakes hard and cramped the steering wheel to the right whipping the cord into a ninetydegrre angle and sending it on a broadside skid the high narrow tires shrieked from their treads friction against the pavement the cord ended up sideways blocking both lanes of the highway the drivers side not more than a meter from a woman standing stockstill pitts heart had doubled its beat he let out a deep breath and looked at the woman hed come within a hair of mashing like a bug he saw the fear and shock in her eyes slowly transform into an expression of incredulity you she gasped is it really you pitt stared at her blankly ms kamil i believe in deji vu giordino mumbled i do i do i do oh thank god she whispered please help me everyone is dead theyre coming to kill me pitt climbed from behind the wheel at the same time lily stepped from the passengers compartment they helped hala inside and lowered her on the rear seat whos they pitt asked yazids paid assassins they murdered the secret service men guarding me we must get away quickly theyll be here any second rest easy lily said soothingly noticing halas smokeblackened skin and singed hair for the first time well take you to a hospital no time hala gasped making a trembling gesture through the window please hurry or theyll kill all of you too pitt turned just in time to see two black mercedes sedans burst from the woods and veer onto the highway he studied them for no more than a second before jumping into the drivers seat he shifted into first gear and jammed the accelerator to the floor he twisted the wheel and turned the cord in the only direction open to himback toward downtown breckenridge he looked briefly into the mirror strapped to the side mount spare tire he estimated the distance between the cord and the terrorists cars at no more than three hundred meters that brief glimpse was all he had time for his rear view was suddenly cut off as a bullet drilled through the mirror and shattered the reflection down on the floor he yelled at the two women in back there was no drive shaft on the cord and the women were able to curl up and press themselves against the flat floor hala stared into lilys face and began trembling uncontrollably lily put an arm around her and forced a brave smile not to panic she said encouragingly once we make it to town well be safe no hala murmured as shock began to set in we wont be safe anywhere in the front seat giordino hunched low to get what shelter he could from the gunfire and higid wind whistling around the windshield how fast will this thing go he asked conversationally the best top speed ever recorded for an l was seventyseven answered pitt miles or kilometers miles i have a sinking feeling were outclassed giordino had to shout in pitts ear to be heard above the howl of the cords second gear what are we up against giordino swung around leaned over the door and cast a wary eye backward hard to tell what model a mercedes is from the front but id say the hounds are driving five hundred sdls diesels turbocharged diesels to be exact capable of kilometers per hour they gaining like tigers after a toed sloth giordino replied drily theyll chew our ass long before we reach the local sheriffs coffee hangout pitt jammed the clutch to the floor grasped the end of the gearshift arm that extended from the dashboard and shoved it into third better we save lives by staying away those killcrazy bastards are liable to slaughter a hundred innocent bystanders just to assassinate kamil giordino peered to the rear again i think i can see the whites of their eyes ismail screamed a dozen curses as his gun jammed in a rage he heaved it out of the mercedes onto the highway and snatched another from the hands of his follower in the backseat he reached out the window and squeezed off a burst at the cord only five shells spat from the muzzle before the armno clip emptied he cursed again as he fished in his pocket for another clip wrestled it free and pushed it in the slide do not excite yourself said the driver carefully well catch them in the next kilometer ill come around on the left while omar and his men in the other car take the right we can snare them in a cross fire at close range i want to kill the scum who interfered ismail snarled youll get your chance patience almost like a sullen child who cant have his way ismail slumped in the seat and stared vengefully through the windshield at the fleeing car ahead lsmail was the worst kind of killer he was utterly incapable of remorse he would have celebrated after blowing up a maternity ward firstclass hit men recorded their kills and studied ways to improve their craft he never bothered to react or count the bodies his planning was sloppy and on two occasions he had wiped out the wrong quarry which made a fanatic like ismail all the more dangerous unpredictable as a shark he struck indiscriminately and without mercy at any innocent victim who was unlucky enough to step in his way he justified his bloody deeds by killing for a religious cause but in another time another place hed have been a serial murderer leaving a trail of dead for the full of it ismail would have sickened john dillenger and bonnie and clyde he sat there moving his fingers over the rifle as if it were a sensual object waiting waiting to pump its lethal fire through the thin walls of the old car and into the flesh that had temporarily cheated him of his prey they must be saving their ammunition sadd giordino thankfully only until they box us in and cant miss pitt replied his eyes were on the road but his mind was desperately turning over escape schemes my kingdom for a rocket launcher which reminds me when i got in the car this morning i accidentally kicked something under the seat giordino bent down and probed the floorboard under pitt his hand touched a cold hard object he held it aloft only a socket wrench he announced sadly might as well be a hainbone for all the good itll do theres a jeep trail just ahead that leads up to the top of the ski runs maintenance vehicles sometimes use it to carry supplies and equipment to the peak might give us a slim chance to lose them in the woods or a ravine were dead if we stick to the highway how far around the next bend in the road can we make it you tell me giordino looked back for the third time seventyfive meters and hauling ass close too close said pitt well have to slow them down i could show my ugly face and make obscene gestures giordino said dryly only make them madder we have to go to plan one i missed the briefing giordino said sarcastically hows your throwing arm giordino nodded in understanding keep this old barge in a straight line and fireball giordino wig retire the opposing term the open town car made a perfect platform giordino planted his knees on the seat facing backward his head and shoulders exposed above the roof he took aim raised his arm and hurled the socket wrench in a high arc toward the leading mercedes for an instant his heart seized he thought he had underthrown as the wrench dropped low and landed on the hood of the car but it took a bounce and smashed neatly through the windshield the arab driver had spotted giordino in the act of heaving the wrench his reaction time was good but not good enough he hit the brakes and cramped the wheel to swerve out of the way just as the glass burst in a thousand tiny pieces and sprayed into his face the wrench caromed off the steering wheel and dropped into ismails lap the driver in the second mercedes was hanging close to the rear bumper of ismails car and he didnt see the socket wrench sailing through the air he was caught completely off guard when the taillights in front of his eyes suddenly flashed red he stared helplessly as he rammed the first mercedes sending it spinning out of control until it came to a halt facing in the opposite direction that what you had in mind asked giordino cheerfully right on the money hold on were approaching our turn pitt slowed and swung the cord onto a narrow snowpacked road leading in a series of switchbacks up the mountainside the straighteight engine with its horsepower strained to pull the heavy car over the slippery uneven surface the stiff chassis springs jolted everyone like tennis balls in a washing machine as the lighter rear end slewed back and forth pitt compensated with a deft touch on the accelerator and steering wheel using the pulling power of the frontwheel drive to keep the long hood pointed up the middle of a road that had all the qualifications of a vague hiking to lily and hala had picked themselves up off the floor and were sitting in the seat feet braced against the divider partition hanging onto the overhead straps for dear life six minutes later they left the trees behind and were climbing above timberline the road now ran between steep inclines carpeted with massive rocks and deep snow it had been pitts original idea to abandon the cord and make a run for it using the woods and craggy landscape for cover but the depth of colorados famous powdery snow sharply increased at the higher altitudes making any passage on foot nearly impossible he was left with no alternative but to reach the summit with enough time to take a chair lift down the mountain to the town and become lost in the crowds were boiling giordino observed pitt didnt need to see the steam starting to issue around the base of the radiator cap hed been watching the needle on the temperature gauge creep upward until it was pegged on hot the engine was rebuilt with close tolerances he explained weve given it too much of a beating before it had a chance to break in what do we do when the road ends asked giordino plan two answered pitt we take a leisurely ride down a chair lift to the nearest saloon i like your style but the wars not over giordino nodded over his shoulder our friends are back pitt had been too busy to keep track of his pursuers they had recovered from the accident and charged up the mountain after the cord before he could look behind bullets shattered the rear window between lilys and halas heads traversed the car and passed cleanly through the windshield leaving three small starred holes the women didnt have to be told to crouch on the floor again this time they tried to melt into it i think theyre mad about the wrench said giordino not half as mad as i am over the way theyre trashing my car pitt hauled the car around a steep switchback and when he straightened oirt again he turned and stole a quick look at the chasing cars the rearward view was not lacking in menace the twin mercedes were violently slewing all over the snowcovered road their superior speed was partially offset by the cords frontwheel traction pitt pulled away in the tight turns but the arabs narrowed the gap in the straightaways pitt caught a glimpse of the lead driver twisting and turning his wheel like a maniac ignoring caution and keeping the reardrive wheels in a constant state of spin at every switchback he came within a hair of sliding into heavy snow and becoming hopelessly stuck pitt was surprised that the mercedes showed no signs of wearing snow tires he couldnt have known the arabs had driven the cars over the border from mexico to muddy their trail registered to a nonexistent textile company in matamoros they were to be abandoned at the breckenridge airport after halas assassination was completed pitt didnt like what he saw the mercedes were moving relentlessly closer they were only fifty meters behind he also didnt like the sight of a man sticking an automatic rifle through the smashed windshield here comes the mail he shouted slipping under the wheel until his eyes barely peered over the top of the dashboard everyone down the words were barely out of his mouth when bullets began thumping into the cord one burst ripped the right fendermounted spare tire and wheel the next tore through the roof shredding the leather padding and mangling the metal skin underneath pitt tensed and tried to duck even lower as the left side of the car was cut open as if attacked by an army of can openers the hinges flew off a rear door and it fell open hanging grotesquely for a few moments until it was torn away as the cord brushed a tree glass fragments flew like rain one of the women screamed he didnt know which one he became aware of a fine spray of blood on the dashboard a bullet had ploughed a furrow through one of giordinos ears but the gritty little italian made no sound giordino probed the wound indifferently almost as though it belonged to someone else then he tilted his head and gave pitt a slanted grin i fear last nights wine is leaking out is it bad pitt asked nothing a plastic surgeon cant fix for two thousand dollars what about the women pitt shouted without turning lily are you and hala all right a few scratches from flying glass lily replied gamely otherwise were unhurt she was good and scared but not anywhere near the edge of panic the steam from the cords radiator was escaping like a highpressure jet now pitt could feel the engine lose revolutions as it slowly began to seize up like a jockey riding a tired old nag long overdue for the pasture he pushed the car as hard as he dared he worked coolly concentrating on hurling the cord around the last switchback before the summit he had gambled and failed to elude the assassins they clung to his rear bumper as if chained there the engine bearings began to rattle in protest from the excessive heat and strain another volley of bullets peppered the left rear fender and flattened the tire pitt fought the wheel to keep the rear end from careening off the side of the road and dragging the car down a percent grade filled with large jagged boulders the cord was dying ominous blue smoke filtered through the hood louvers beneath the engine oil seeped through a gouge torn in the oil pan by a rock pitt could not avoid the oil pressure gauge quickly registered zero any chance of making the temporary safety of the summit became more remote with each knock of the piston rods the lead mercedes charged around the switchback in a wild skid pitt clutched the wheel despairingly he could picture the look of triumph on his pursuers faces as they sensed they were seconds away from naming their prey to the ground he saw no place for a desperation escape on foot they were trapped on the narrow road between a steep drop on one side and a sharp rocky rise on the other there was nowhere to go but ahead until the cords engine gave up and froze pitt jammed the accelerator pedal against the floorboard with all the strength in his leg and uttered a fast prayer incredibly the battleweary old classic had something more to give as though a mechanical engine had a mind of its own it reached down into its iron and steel for one final magnificent effort the engine revolutions suddenly increased the front wheels dug in and the cord wiggled up the final grade to the sunmiit a minute later through clouds of blue smoke and white steam it broke out onto the open crest of a ski run not one hundred meters away stood the upper end of a triplechair ski lift at first pitt thought it strange that no one was skiing on the slope directly below the cord people were dropping off the chairs and turning toward the opposite side of the lift before starting down a parallel ski trail then he observed his section of the slope was roped off several signs hung on a line festooned with bright orange streamers warning skiers not to ski this run because of dangerous icy conditions the end of the trail giordino said solemnly pitt nodded in frustration we cant make a break for the lift theyd shoot us down before we ran ten meters its either fight them with snowballs or take our chances and surrender or we can try plan three giordino peered at pitt curiously cant be any worse than the first two then his eyes widened and he groaned youre notoh god no the two mercedes were almost within spitting distance they had pulled side by side to box in the cord when pitt twisted the wheel and sent the car plummeting down the ski run allah help us muttered lsmafls driver the crazy idiots we cant stop them keep after them ismail shouted hysterically dont let them escape theyll die anyway no one can survive a runaway car down a mountainside ismafl swung his gun barrel and roughly pushed the muzzle into his drivers ear catch those pigs he snarled viciously or youll see allah sooner than you planned the driver hesitated seeing death no matter which move he made then he gave in and turned the mercedes down the steep incline after the cord allah guide my actions he uttered in sudden fear ismail pulled the gun away and pointed through the broken windshield be still and mind your driving ismails henchmen in the second mercedes didnt pause dutifully they plunged after their leader the cord hurtled across the hardpacked snow like a runaway freight gaining speed at a terrifying rate there was no slowing the heavy car pitt steered with a light touch and feathered the brakes cautious not to lock them and send the cord into an uncontrollable spin a sideways slide down the steep incline would only result in the cars overturning and ending up at the base of the mountain in a scattered trail of metal and broken bodies is this a good time to raise the question of seat belts asked giordino with his feet raised and wedged against the dashboard pitt shook his head not optional equipment in this modelpitt sensed a tiny bit of luck as the bulletshredded rubber tore off the rear wheel free of the deflated tire the double edges of the rim gave him a small measure of control as they bit into the icy surface throwing up fanlike sheets of ice particles the speedometer was hovering at sixty when pitt saw a field of moguls coming up expert skiers found the rounded snow bumps a favorite obstacle course so did pitt when he schussed down a slope at that speed but not now not playing downhill racer with a weighty kilograms of automobile with a deft touch he gently nudged the car off to the side of the road where the path ran smooth he felt as though he were trying to thread a needle with an olympic bobsled subconsciously pitt tensed himself for the violent shock and crashing impact should he make the slightest wrong move and hurl the car into a tree smashing everyone to bloody pulp but there was no crushing impact the cord somehow shot through the narrow slot the moguls on one side and the trees on the other flashing by like blurred stage sets as soon as pitt was on a wide unobstructed run he snapped his head around to check the status of his pursuers the driver of the lead mercedes was savvy hed followed in the cords tire tracks around the moguls the second driver either didnt see them or didnt consider them dangerous he realized his mistake too late and compounded it by throwing the mercedes wildly from side to side in a desperate effort to dodge the meterhigh humps the arab actually slipped past three or four before he took one headon the front end dug in and the rear rose up and appeared to hang on a minetydegree angle the car stood poised there for an instant and then it flipped end over end as if a child had flipped a short stick it struck the hard snowpack again and again with the splitting sound of crashing metal and glass the occupants might have survived if theyd been thrown clear but the jarring series of impacts had jammed the doors the car began to disintegrate the engine tore from its mountings and tumbled crazily into the woods wheels front suspension reardrive train none of it was built to take this destructive tommit all wrenched away from the chassis bouncing in mad gyrations down the hill pitt could not spare the time to watch the mercedes cartwheel and crumple into an indistinguishable heap before finally grinding to a halt on its squashed roof in a small ravine would it sound gauche said giordino for the first time since they plunged off the crest if i said one down i wish you wouldnt use that term pitt muttered through gritted teeth the score is about to escalate he briefly took one hand from the wheel and motioned ahead giordino tensed as he observed the ski run fork and merge with another trail crowded with people in vividly colored ski suits he jerked himself to a standing position by grabbing the remains of the windshield frame shouting and waving frantically as pitt laid on the cords twill horns the startled skiers turned at the honking and saw the two speeding cars barreling down the ski trail with seconds to spare they traversed to the sides and gaped in astonishment as the cord with the mercedes right behind sped past a ski jump rose from the trail and dropped off a hundred meters away pitt hardly had time to distinguish the snowy ramp blending in with the hillside without hesitation he aimed the radiator ornament at the starting dropoff you wouldnt blurted giordino plan four pitt assured him brace yourself i may lose control i thought youve been doing that right along far smaller than the structures built for olympic competition the jump was used only for acrobatic and hotdog skiing exhibitions the ramp was wide enough to take the cord and then some it extended thirty meters into a concave dip before abruptly ending twenty meters above the ground pitt lined up on the starting gate using the cords wide body to hide the ski jump from the view of the mercedes the tricky part depended on exact timing and a nimble twist of the steering wheel at the last instant before the front wheels rolled across the starting line pitt flicked the steering wheel and spun the cords rear end whipping the car away from the ramp down the ski jump alert to the sudden antics of the cord ismails driver swung to avoid a collision and made a perfect entry through the starting gate as pitt wrestled the cord back on a straight path giordino looked back at the mercedes and stared into a face masked with a weird expression of frightened rage then it was gone as the car shot down the steep slant out of all control it should have soared into the sky like a fat bird with no wings but the rear end broke loose and it slipped on a slight angle dropping the right wheels off the ramps side a few meters before the final edge and sending the car spiraling through the air like a wellthrown football the mercedes must have been hitting close to kilometers when it lifted off impelled by tremendous momentum it twirled through sky for an incredible distance before curving earthward and striking the snowpack with a tremendous impact on its four wheels as if in slow motion it bounced and sailed into a tall ponderosa pine smashing against the thick trunk the grinding screech of mangled metal split the thin air as the chassis and body wrapped around the tree until the front and rear bumpers met like a pitched horseshoe against a steel stake glass exploded like confetti and the bodies inside were twisted and mashed like flies under a swatter giordino shook his head in wonder thats the danmedest sight ive ever seen more to come said pitt he had straightened out the cords wild slide but there was no slowing its velocity the brakes had burned out halfway down the slope and the steering tie rod was bent and hanging by a thread the cords path was un stakable it was heading toward the large ski facility and restaurant building at the base of the chair lifts all pitt could do was keep blowing the horns and struggle to avoid skiers too dumb to scramble out of the way the women had watched the destruction of the last mercedes with morbid curiosity and vast relief the relief was shortlived they turned and stared aghast at the rapidly approaching building cant we do something hala demanded im open for suggestions pitt fired back tie became quiet as he managed to dodge a ski class made up of young children by careening up a snowbank and curling around them the main mass of skiers had either heard or witnessed the crash of the mercedes and were galvanized into action at the sight and sound of the cord they quickly moved to the side of the i and stared in utter incomprehension as the cord rocketed by warnings of the runaway vehicles had been phoned from the upper end of the chair lift and ski instructors had cleared most of the crowd away itfrom the base area there was a shallow frozen pond to the right of the ski center pitt hoped to angle in that direction and run onto the ice until it cracked open sinking the car to the running boards and bringing it to an abrupt halt the only problem was the onlookers had unwittingly formed a corridor leading to the restaurant i dont suppose theres a plan five said giordino bracing himself for the collision sorry said pitt were all sold out lily and hala watched helpless and horrorstricken then they dived behind the division behind the chauffeurs seat closed their eyes and clutched each other pitt stiffened as they struck several long racks holding skis and poles the skis seemed to explode as they were sent flying through the air like toothpicks for an instant the cord seemed buried but then it burst clear and bored up the concrete stairway missing the restaurant but splintering through the wooden wall of the cocktail lounge the room had been emptied except for the piano player who sat paralyzed at his keyboard and a bartender who elected discretion and frantically took refuge behind the bar just as the cord exploded into the room and bulldozed its way through a sea of chairs and tables the cord almost broke ugh the far wall and down a twostory drop miraculously its momentum finally spent the mutilated car stopped short leaving only its badly distorted front bumper protruding through the wall the cocktail lounge looked like the recipient of an artillery barrage except for the hiss of the radiator and the crackling of the overheated engine an eerie silence filled the room pitt had banged his head against the windshield frame and blood was streaming down his face from a cut above the hairline he looked over at giordino who sat staring at the wall as if turned to stone pitt turned and stared down at the women behind they were wearing their best are we still alive look but seemed none the worse for wear the bartender was still huddled out of sight behind the bar so pitt turned to the piano player who sat in a daze on a threelegged stool he was wearing a derby hat and the cigarette that dangled from the side of his mouth hadnt even lost its ash his hands were poised above the keys his body rigid as if he was locked in suspended animation he stared shaken at the bloody apparition who insanely smiled back pardon me sir pitt asked politely can you play fly me to the moon october uxmal yucatdn the stonework on the massive structure reflected an unearthly glow under the battery of multicolored floodlights blue dyed the walls of the great pyramid while orange highlighted the temple of the magician on the top red spotlights swept up and down the wide staircase giving the effect of cascading blood above on the roof of the temple a slender figure stood haloed in white topiltzin spread his arms and open hands in a divine gesture and stared down at the hundred thousand upraised faces surrounding the templepyramid in the ancient mayan city of uxmal on the yucatan peninsula he ended his speech as he always did with a chant in the lilting aztec tongue the vast audience picked up the phrases and repeated them in unison the strength and courage of our nation lies in us who will never be great or wealthy we starve we toil for leaders who are less noble and honest than ourselves there can be no glory or greatness in mexico until the false government is dead no longer will we endure slavery the gods are gathering again to sacrifice the corrupt for the decent their gift is a new civilization we must accept it as the words died away the colored lights slowly dimmed until only topiltzin remained brightly lit then the white spotlights blinked out and he was gone great bonfires were lit and a truck caravan began handing out boxes of food to the grateful mass of people each container held the same amount of flour and canned goods and a cartoonue booklet heavy on illustrations light on captions president de lorenzo and his cabinet ministers were drawn to resemble demons being driven out of mexico and into the open arms of an evillooking uncle sam by topiltzin and four major aztec gods a list of instructions was also included describing peaceful but effective methods of eroding government influence during the food handout men and women worked the crowd recruiting new followers for topiltzin the event was staged and oiled with the professionalism of a rock concert organization uxmal was only one stop from toppling the campaign to subvert the government in mexico city he preached to the masses only at the great stone centers of the pastteotihuacdn monte albdn ula and chichdn ita he never appeared in mexicos modern cities the people cheered topiltzin and shouted his name but he no longer heard them the instant the spotlights went off his bodyguards hustled him down a ladder on the backside of the pyramid and into a large truck and semitrailer the engine was started and the truck led by one car and followed by another slowly wound its way through the crowd until it met the high way then it turned toward the yucatdn state capital of mdrida and picked up speed the interior of the trailer was expensively decorated and divided between a conference room and topiltzins private living quarters topiltzin briefly discussed the next days schedule with his close worshipers when the meeting broke up the truck was stopped and everyone bid him a good night the two cars collected the weary followers and drove them to hotels in marida once topiltzin closed the door and shut off one world he entered another he removed a feathered headdress and stripped off his white robe revealing a pair of expensive slacks and a sports shirt underneath he opened a hidden cabinet removed a chilled bottle of schramsberg blanc de blanc sparkling wine and swiftly extracted the cork the first glass was downed for thirst but the second was slowly savored relaxed topiltzin entered a small cubicle containing communications equipment punched in a numbered code on a holographic telephone and turned to face the center of the room he sipped at the california champagne and waited slowly an indistinct figure began to materialize in three dimensions at the same time topiltzin was visible thousands of miles away when the details cleared another man sat on an ottoman couch and stared back at topiltzin his complexion was dark and the thin brushedback hair gleamed with oil his eyes had a hardjeweled gleam the visitor was dressed in a silk paisley robe over pajamas he studied topiltzins shirt and slacks for a moment and frowned when he noticed the glass in one hand you live dangerously he said sternly in american english designer clothing champagnenext it will be women topiltzin laughed dont tempt me acting like the pope and wearing a bizane costume eighteen hours a day is bad enough without practicing celibacy i endure the same inconvenience we both have our own cross to bear topiltzin said in a bored tone do not get careless so close to success i dont intend to none of my people would dare disturb my privacy whenever im alone they think im communicating with the gods the other man smiled the routine sounds familiar shall we get down to business said topiltzin all right whats the status the arrangements are sealed everyone will be in his place at the right moment i paid out over ten million pesos in bribes to set up the rendezvous once the fools on the take did their job they were sacrificed not only to guarantee their silence but also as a warning to those who are waiting to carry out our instructions my congratulations youre very thorough i leave the cleverness to you there was a friendly silence after this remark which lasted several moments while both men rested on their thoughts at last the caller smiled craftily and produced a small brandy snifter from beneath a fold of his gown your health topiltzin gave a satiric laugh and raised his champagne glass to a successful venture the ethereal visitor paused a successful venture he repeated and then added with no snags after an even longer pause he said pensively it will be interesting to see how our efforts alter the fumm the roar of the engines lessened as the uinnarked beechcraft jet lifted away from buckley field outside denver and rose toward its crusing altitude the snowcapped rockies fell away behind as the aircraft set its nose across the great plains the president sends his best wishes for a speedy recovery said dale nichols he was quite angered when briefed on your ordeal madder than hell is a better description schiller cut in lets say he wasnt happy nichols continued he asked me to express his apologies for not providing stronger security measures and promised he will do everything within his power to ensure your safety while you remain in the united states tell him im grateful hala replied and please beg him for me to give every consideration to the families of the men who died saving my life theyll be well taken care of nichols assured her hala was lying propped in a bed wearing a white velour sweatsuit striped in jade with a knit polo collar her right ankle was in a plaster cast she looked at nichols then toward julius schiller and senator pitt who were all seated opposite her bed im honored that three such distinguished gentlemen took time from their busy schedules to fly to colorado and accompany me back to new york if we can do anything youve done much more than any foreigner on your soil could expect you have the lives of a cat said senator pitt her lips parted in a slight smile i owe two of them to your son he has a capacity for appearing in the right place when you least expect him i saw dirks old car its a miracle you all survived a truly beautiful machine hala sighed a pity it was destroyed nichols cleared his throat if we may touch on the subject of your address to the un tomorrow have your people turned up any solid data leading to the alexandria missing artifacts hala asked sharply nichols glanced at the senator and schiller with the look of a man who suddenly stepped in quicksand the senator threw him a rope and gave the reply we havent had time to launch a massive search he said honestly we know little more than we did four days ago nichols began hesitantly the president he hoped ill save you time mr nichols halas eyes turned to schiller you may rest easy juhus my speech will include a brief report on the inuninent discovery of the alexandria library antiquities im glad to hear youve changed your mind considering recent events i owe your government that much nichols was visibly relieved your announcement will give president hasan a sharp political advantage over akhmad yazid and a golden opportunity to boost egyptian nationalism over religious fulldamentalism dont expect too much said the senator were only filling cracks on a crumbling fort schillers lips parted in a cold smile id give a months salary to see yazids face when he realizes hes been had im afraid hell really come after hala with a vengeance said schiller i dont think so said nichols if the fbi can link a chain from the dead terrorists to yazid and then to the assassin responsible for the plane crash with the death of sixty people many moderate egyptians who do not condone terrorism will withdraw their support from his movement with an internationally publicized terrorist mission laid on his doorstep hed have to think twice before ordering another attempt on ms kainils life mr nichols is correct on one point said hala most egyptians are sunni moslems who do not follow the bloody revolutionary dnimbeat of the iranian shiites they prefer an evolutionary approach that slowly changes the peoples loyalty from a democratic government to a religious leadership they will not accept yazids bloodlust methods hala paused a moment i disagree on the second point yazid wont rest until im dead he is too fanatical to give up hes probably planning another attempt on my life this minute she may be right we must keep a sharp intelligence eye on yazid cautioned the senator what are your plans after your un address asked schiller this morning before we left the hospital i was given a letter from president hasan by an attache from our embassy in washington president hasan wishes me to meet with him once you leave our boundaries we cant guarantee your protection nichols warned her i understand she replied but there is little cause for concern since president sadats assassination egyptian security people have become quite efficient may i ask where this meeting will be held queried schiller or is it none of my business no secret in fact it will be covered by the world news media hala answered nonchalantly president hasan and i will confer during the coming economic meetings in punta del este uruguay the mangled and bulletholed cord sat forlornly in the middle of the shop floor benson slowly circled the car and shook his head sadly this is the first time ive ever had to restore a classic car two days after i finished it we had a bad day giordino explained he was wearing a neck brace one arm was in a sling and his nicked ear was heavily bandaged its a wonder any of you are standing here except for six stitches mostly hidden by his hair pitt was unmarked he patted the buckled chrome radiator shell as if the car was an injured pet lucky for us they used to build them to last he said quietly lily limped painfully from the shop office her left cheek was bruised and the opposite eye was blackened i have hiram yaeger on the phone she announced pitt nodded he put a hand on bensons shoulder make her even better than she was before were looking at six months and heavy bucks said benson time is no problem and neither is money pitt paused and broke into a grin the government is going to foot the bill this time around he turned walked into the office and picked up the phone hiram you got something for me just a status report yaeger replied from washington ive eliminated the baltic sea and the coastline of norway and nothing showed nothing worth celebrating no matching of geologic contours or geographic descriptions from the serapis log the barbarians rufinus mentioned dont come close to fitting the early vikings he wrote of people who resembled scydiians but with darker skins that bothered me too pitt agreed the scythians came from central asia not damned likely theyd have been fairskinned and blond i see no sense in continuing the computer search around norway into the northern waters of russia i agree what about iceland the vikings didnt settle there for another five hundred years maybe rufinus meant eskimos no go said yaeger i checked eskimos never migrated to iceland rufinus also threw in the mystery of the great sea of dwarflike pines he couldnt have found them on iceland and dont forget youre talking about a sixhundredmile voyage across some of the worst seas in the world historical marine records are quite precise roman ship captains rarely sailed out of sight of land for more than two days the voyage from the nearest european land mass would have taken at least four and a half days under ideal conditions so where do we go from here ill run the west african coast by again we might have missed something darkskinned africans and a warmer climate seem more logical than the cold northern countries especially to men from the mediterranean you still have to explain how the serapis came to be in greenland a projection of wind and currents could give us a clue im flying back to washington tonight said pitt ill look in on you tomorrow maybe ill have something said yaeger but his tone did not sound optimistic pitt hung up and stepped from the office lily looked at him with an expression of hope then she read the disappointment in his eyes no good news she asked he shrugged negatively seems we havent left square one she took his arm yaeger will come through she said encouragingly he cant work miracles giordino held up a watch on his good arm we dont have much time to make our flight wed better get rolling pitt walked over shook bensons hand and smiled make her well again she saved our lives benson looked at him only if you promise me youll keep her away from flying bullets and ski slopes done after they left for the airport benson opened a rear door of the cord the door handle came off in his hand god he said mournfully what a mess a loud roar of applause erupted in the public galleries and swept over the delegates on the main floor below as hala refused all assistance and slowly made her way to the podium on crutches she stood behind the podium poised and serene speaking in a strong convincing voice her theatrics were lowkey and subtle she moved the audience with an emotional appeal to stop the useless killing of innocent people in the name of religion only when she called for a censure of governments that turned a blind eye toward terrorist organizations did a few delegates shift in their seats and stare into space an undercurrent of murmurs trailed her news of the forthcoming alexandria library discovery as the immense potential took time to sink in then akhmad yazid came in for a scathing attack as she accused him directly of the attempts on her life hala concluded by firmly stating she would not be driven out of her position as secretarygeneral by threats of future harm but would remain until her fellow delegates asked for her resignation the response was a standing ovation that became thunder ous as she stood off to one side of the podium and displayed the cast on her ankle shes some lady said the president admiringiy what i wouldnt give to have her sit in my cabinet he pressed the off button on a remote control and the television screen went black an excellent speech said senator pitt she tore yazid apartand made a good pitch on the library search project the president nodded yes she came through for us on both counts you know of course shes leaving for uruguay to confer with president hasan dale nichols briefed me on the conversation you had with her on the plane the president acknowledged he was seated behind his desk in the oval office how do we stand on the search numas computer facility is working on a location answered the senator are they close the senator shook his head no closer now to a breakthrough than they were four days ago icant we speed up the process bring in a think tank university people other government agencies senator pitt looked doubtful numa has the finest computer library in the world on oceans lakes and rivers if they cant find the destination of the egyptian fleet no one can what about archaeological and historical records the president suggested maybe somethings been uncovered in the past that could offer a clue might be worth a try i know a good man at penn state university whos a triplea researcher he can have my people digging the archives here and in europe by this time tomorrow good give him a crack at it now that the news media and hala have spread the word said the senator half the governments and most of the fortune hunters of the world will be on the hunt for the library collection i considered that probability going in the president said but propping up president hasans government takes top priority if we make the discovery first and then pretend to back down after hasan makes a dramatic show of demanding the artifacts be returned to egypt his domestic popularity will take a big jump and make him a hero in the eyes of the egyptian people while stalling off the threat of a takeover by yazid and his followers added the senator the only problem is yazid himself the man is extremely unpredictable our best middle east experts cant read him hes liable to pull a rabbit out of the hat and steal the scene the president looked at him steadily i see no problem in cutting him out of the limelight when the artifacts are turned over to president hasan im on your side mr president but its dangerous to underestimate yazid hes far from perfect yes but unlike the ayatollah khomeini akhmad yazid is a brilliant intellect hes what the advertising agencies call a good concept man in political areas perhaps but hardly in assassinations the senator shrugged and ssighed knowingly his plans were no doubt screwed up by his henchmen as president you know better than anyone how easily an aide or adviser can botch a simple project the president smiled back without humor he leaned back in his chair and toyed with a pen we know damned little about yazid where he came from what makes him tick he claims to have spent the first thirty years of his life wandering the sinai desert talking to allah so hes lifted a page from jesus christ what else do we have on him you might ask dale nichols answered the senator i understand hes working with the cia on building a biographical and psychological profile lets see if theyve come up with anything the president pressed a button on his intercom dale can you come in for a minute be right there came nicholss voice over the speaker neither of the men in the oval office spoke during the fifteen seconds nichols took to walk from his office he knocked then opened the door and stepped in we were discussing akhmad yazid the president informed him have brogans people turned up any data on his background i talked to martin only an hour ago replied nichols he said his analysts should have a file put together in another day or two i want to see it the minute its completed said the president not to change the subject said senator pitt but shouldnt someone brief president hasan on what weve got in mind in case the library collection can be pinpointed in the next few weeks the president nodded definitely he stared directly at the senator think you could sneak off for fortyeight hours and do the honors george you want me to meet with hasan in uruguay it was more a statement than question do you mind this is really a matter for doug oates over at the state department he and joe arnold from treasury are already in kingston holding preliminary meetings with foreign economic leaders do you think it wise to go behind his back ordinarily no but youre better informed on the search project youve also met with president hasan on four different occasions and youre close to hala kamil simply put youre the best man for the job the senator lifted his hands in resignation no heavy votes coming up in the senate my staff can cover for me if you arrange for a government plane i can leave here early tuesday and arrive the following afternoon thank you george youre a good scout the president paused and then sprang the trap there is one other thing there always is the senator sighed id like you to inform president hasan m private under the strictest secrecy that i will fully cooperate with him in the event he decides to remove yazid the senators voice was shocked since when does the white house deal in political assassination i implore you mr president do not lower your office into the slime with yazid and other terrorists if someone had had the foresight to take khomeini for a ride twelve years ago the middle east would be a far more peaceful place king george might have said the same about george washington and the colonies in come now george we could spend all day making comparisons the final decision is up to hasan he has to give the goahead a bad idea saidd the senator resolutely i have grave doubts about such an offer if this leaked out it could shatter your presidency i respect your advice and honesty thats why youre the only man i can trust to deliver the message the senator caved in ill do as you ask and gladly brief hasan on the library proposal but dont expect me to sell him on yazids murder even if its deserved ill see that hasans staff is alerted to your arrival said nichols stepping in diplomatically the president rose from behind his desk signaling the end of the conference he shook hands with the senator im grateful old friend ill look forward to your report wednesday afternoon well have an early supper together see you then mr president have a good flight as senator pitt left the oval office he had a dire sense that the president might very well be dining alone wednesday evening the lady flamborough slipped smoothly into the tiny harbor of punta del este just minutes before the sun fell over the western interior of the mainland a soft breeze drifted in from the south that barely fluttered the union jack on her stern she was a beautiful cruise ship trim and handsomely designed with a streamlined superstructure she broke with the traditional british black hull and more common white on her upper works she was painted entirely in a soft slate blue with a sharply raked funnel banded in royal purple and burgundy one of the new breed of sleek small cruise ships the lady flamborough looked more like a posh motor yacht her trim meterlong hull contained the most sumptuous luxuries afloat with only fifty large suites she carried just one hundred passengers who were catered to by an equal number of crew members on this voyage however from her home port in san juan puerto rico she sailed without passengers two degrees port said the darkskinned pilot two degrees port acknowledged the helmsman the pilot stood in loose khaki shirt and shorts and kept a calculating eye on the finger of land that sheltered the bay until it slipped behind the lady flamboroughs stern begin coming around to starboard and hold steady at zero eight zero the helmsman dutifully repeated the command and the ship very slowly swung on its new course the harbor was crowded with yachts and other cruise ships riving flocks of colorful pointed and swallowtail pennants some vessels were chartered as floating hotels for the economic conference others were filled with their usual complement of vacationing passengers half a kilometer from the mooring site the pilot ordered the engines on dead stop the luxurious ship slipped through the calm water on her momentum eating up the distance and gradually easing to a halt satisfied the pilot spoke into a portable transmitter were in position slow aft and drop the hook the order was relayed to the bow and the anchor payed out as the ship very slightly moved astern when the flukes dug into the harbor silt the slack was taken up and the order was given to ring the engines to off captain oliver collins a slim man standing straight as a plumb line in an impeccably tailored white uniform nodded at the pilot in respect and offered his hand neatly done as always mr campos captain collins had known the pilot for almost twenty years yet he never referred to anyone even his closest friends by his christian name if her length stretched another thirty meters i couldnt squeeze her in harry campos smiled revealing an array of tobaccostained teeth his accent was more hish than spanish sorry we cant slip her into a berth captain but i was told to moor you in the harbor for security reasons i should imagine said collins campos lit the stub of a cigar the bigwig meetings have the whole island turned upside down youd think there was a sniper behind every palm the way security police are acting collins stared through the bridge windows at the popular playground of south america ill not complain this ship will be hosting the presidents of mexico and egypt during the conference that a fact muttered campos no wonder they wanted to keep your vessel offshore may i offer you a drink in my cabin or better yet considering the hour would you do the honor of dining with me campos shook his head my thanks for the invite captain he paused and motioned at the mass of ships filling the harbor but shes a busy time maybe a rain check for your next layover campos filled out his document for payment and handed it to captain collins who signed campos looked through the aft bridge windows at the immaculate decks of the ship one of these days ill take a holiday and sail with you as a passenger let me know said collins ill see the company covers all your expenses a mighty kind offer if i tell my wife shell never let up till i take advantage of it a pleasure mr campos any time you say the word the pilot boat came alongside and campos jumped onto the deck from the boarding ladder he gave a final wave as the boat pulled away and headed out to sea to pilot the next incoming vessel most enjoyable voyage i ever sailed this from collinss first officer nhchael finney a frill crew and no passengers for six days i thought id died and gone to heaven company orders required ships officers to spend almost as much time entertaining the passengers as sailing the ship a duty finney hated with a passion a fine seaman he stayed away from the main dining salon as much as possible preferring to eat with his fellow officers or making constant inspections of the ship finney didnt exactly look the part of a party mixer he was big with a barrel chest that fought to explode from the tight confines of his uniform i dont imagine you missed the joy of mingling and small talk said collins sarcastically finney made a disagreeable face wouldnt be so bad if they didnt ask the same stupid questions all the time courtesy and respect when dealing with passengers mr finney collins admonished it goes with the waters mind your manners in the next few days well be entertaining some rather important foreign leaders and statesmen finney did not reply he gazed at the modern highrise everytime i see the old town he said wistfully they ve added another hotel yes youre from uruguay born just west in montevideo my father was a sales rep for a belfast machinery company you must enjoy coming home said collins not really i signed aboard a panamanian ore carrier when i was sixteen mum and dad are gone nobody left i grew up with he paused and pointed through the bridge window at an approaching boat here come the bloody customs and immigration inspectors since we have no passengers and the crew wont be going ashore said collins the vessel should be cleared with a rubber stamp the health inspectors are the worst nuisance notify the purser mr finney then show them to my cabin begging your pardon sir but isnt that a bit much i mean greeting mere customs inspectors in the captains cabin perhaps but i want everything to run smoothly with the bureaucracy while were in harbor you never know when we might require a favor aye sir it was dusk as the customs and immigration officials brought their boat alongside the lady flamborough and mounted the boarding ladder the ships lights suddenly blazed on and illuminated her upper decks and superstructure moored amid the lights of the city and the other cruise ships she sparkled like a diamond in a jewelry box the uniguayan officials led by finney approached the open doorway to the captains cabin collins studied the five men including his first officer he was a man who missed very little and he quickly noticed something odd about one of them one man had on a widebrimmed straw hat pulled low over his eyes and was wearing a jumpsuit while the rest were dressed properly enough in the casual uniforms worn by most officials throughout the caribbean islands the fellow who stood out walked without looking up keeping his eyes on the feet of the man in front of him when they reached the dciorway finney politely stood aside and allowed them to enter first collins stepped forward good evening gentlemen welcome aboard the lady flamborough im captain oliver collins the visiting officials stood strangely silent and collins and finney exchanged curious glances then the man in the jumpsuit stepped forward and slowly peeled it off revealing a white uniform with gold braid that was an exact copy of the one collins wore next he removed the straw hat and replaced it with a cap that matched the uniform the normally calm collins was momentarily caught off balance he felt as though he was staring into a mirror the stranger could easily have passed for a twin brother who are you collins demanded whats going on here no name is necessary said suleiman aziz ammar with a disamiing smile i am taking command of your ship surprise is the key for any successful clandestine operation and the surprise takeover of the lady flamborough was total except for captain collins first officer finney and a stunned purser who were bound gagged and closely guarded in finneys cabin none of the other officers or crew had the vaguest idea their ship had been hijacked ammar cut his timing to a fine edge the bona fide uruguayan customs inspectors showed up only twelve minutes later he greeted them as if they were old acquaintances in his makeup and nearperfect disguise as collins the men he had handpicked to play the roles of finney and the purser kept to the shadows they were both experienced ships officers and bore a remarkable resemblance to their counterparts few crew members would have noticed the facial differences outside of three meters the uruguayan officials cleared the vessel and were soon on their way ammar called collinss second and third officers to the captains cabin this would be his first and most crucial test if he passed their inspection without arousing suspicion they would become invaluable to him as innocent accomplices to carry out the complicated plot in the next twentyfour hours making himself up to look like dale lemk the pilot of nebula flight was not a difficult process animar had easily casta plaster mold from lemks face after hed murdered him disguising himself to pass as the captain of the lady flamborough was another matter he was forced to work from only eight photographs of collins obtained on short notice by one of his agents in britain he also had to inject himself with a compound that raised his voice to an identical level with recordings of collinss voice he hired a skilled artist to sculpt a likeness of collinss face from the photos male and female molds were cast from the sculpture next a natural latex dyed to match captain collinss skin coloring was pressed between the molds and set aside until gelation occurred and then baked he trimmed and carefully fitted the latex mask using a resinwax mixture to match minor changes in facial structure then ammar applied foamed ear and nose prosthetics and added makeup finally a correctly dyed barbered and parted hairpiece contact lenses to match the color of collinss eyes tooth caps and animar became the spitting image of the cruise liners captain ammar did not have the time to study oliver collinss personality profile in depth or study the captains mannerisms he just managed to take a cram course on shipboard duties and memorize the names and faces of the ships officers he had no choice but to bluff it out relying correctly on the assumption the crew did not have the slightest reason to be skeptical as soon as the two officers stepped into the captains cabin ammar immediately acted to tip the scales in his favor pardon me gentlemen for sounding and looking a bit under the weather but ive picked up a case of the flu shall i send for the ships doctor asked second officer herbert parker physically fit suntanned with a smooth boyish face that seemed as if it saw a razor only on saturday evenings a nearstake thought ammar a doctor familiar with collins would have spotted the masquerade in a flash hes already given me enough pills to choke an elephant i feel fit enough to muddle through my duties the third officer a scot with the unlikely name of isaac jones pushed aside a shag of red hair from his high forehead anything we can do sir yes mr jones there is answered ammar our vip passengers will be arriving tomorrow afternoon you will be in charge of the welcoming party we dont often have the honor of entertaining two presidents and i should think the company will expect us to carry out a firstrate ceremony yes sir snapped jories depend on it w parker captain a landing craft will arrive within the hour to transship a cargo for the company you will be in charge of the loading operations a team of security people will also be coming aboard this evening please see they are provided with suitable quarters rather short notice isnt it sir taking on cargo and i thought the egyptian and mexican security agents werent due until early morning our company directors work in mysterious ways ammar said philosophically as to our armed guests company orders again they want their own security personnel on board in case of a problem a matter of one security team overseeing another something like that i believe lloyds demanded extra precautions or they threatened to raise our insurance rate to some astronomical height i understand any questions gentlemen there were none and the two officers turned to leave herbert there is one more thing said ammar please load the cargo as quietly and quickly as possible i will sir once they were out of earshot on the deck parker turned to jones did you hear that he called me by my first name dont you think that jolly queer jones shrugged indifferently he must be sicker than we thought the landing craft came alongside and a small cargo boom was run out the loading operation went smoothly the rest of ammars men dressed in business suits also came on board and were assigned to four empty suites by midnight the landing craft slipped into the darkness and was gone the lady flamboroughs cargo boom was pulled into the hold out of sight and the large double loading doors were closed ammar rapped five times on finneys door and waited the door was cracked slightly and the guard stood back arnniar took a quick look up and down the carpeted passageway and entered he nodded toward the captain the guard moved forward and stripped the tape from collinss mouth i regret the inconvenience captain but i suppose it would be a waste of words to ask you to give me your word you wont attempt to escape and warn your crew collins sat stiffly in a chair his arms and legs chained together and glared at ammar with murder in his eyes you sordid sewer filth you british have a literary quality to your insults that is quite amusing an american would have simply used a fourletter word meaning the same thing youll get no cooperation from me or my officers not even if i order my men to slit the throats of your female crew members one by one and throw their bodies to the sharks finney lunged at ammar but the guard swiftly swung the butt end of his automatic rifle into the first officers groin finney fell back into his chair with a muffled groan his eyes glazed in pain collinss eyes never left ammar id expect as much from a band of subhuman terrorists we are not ignorant juveniles out to butcher infidels ammar explained patiently we are topline professionals this is not a repeat of the unfortunate achille lauro episode of a few years back we do not intend to murder anyone our purpose is simply to hold presidents hasan and de lorenzo and their staffs for ransom if you do not stand in our way we shall make our deal with their respective governments and be on our way collins studied ammars mirrored face searching for the lie but the arabs eyes reflected genuine honesty he could not know ammar was a master at theatrical deception but you wouldnt hesitate to butcher my crew otherwise and you too of course what do you want from me you actually nothing mr parker and mr jones have accepted me as oliver collins its first officer finney whose services i require you will order him to obey my commands why finney asked collins i opened the desk file in your cabin and read the officers personal records finney knows these waters i dont see what youre getting at we cannot afford the risk of calling for a pilot explained animar tomorrow after dark finney will take the helm and steer the ship through the channel into the open sea collins considered that then he slowly shook his head once the port authorities get on to you theyll block the harbor entrance whether you threaten to kill everyone on board or not a darkened ship can slip out on a dark night ammar assured him how far do you expect to go every patrol boat within a hundred miles will have you boxed in by daylight they wont find us collins looked slightly dazed thats crazy you cant hide a ship like the lady flamborough quite true said ammar a cold knowing smile forming on his lips but i can make her invisible jones was bent over a desk in his cabin making notes for the mornings welcoming ceremonies when parker knocked on the door and entered he looked tired and his uniform was damp with sweat jones turned and looked at him loading duty finished yes thank god how about a nightcap a glass of your good scottish malt whiskey jones rose and lifted a bottle from a dresser drawer he poured two glasses and handed one to parker look at it this way he said you were relieved of standing earlymorning anchor watch id have preferred that to cargo loading said parker tiredly what about you just got off duty i wouldnt have bothered you if i hadnt seen a light through your port burning the midnight oil making sure everything runs ticktock smooth tomorrow finney isnt about and i felt i had to talk to someone for the first time jones noticed the confused expression in parkers eyes whats bothering you parker downed the scotch and stared at the empty glass weve just taken on the damnedest cargo ive ever seen come on board a cruise liner what did you load asked jones his curiosity aroused parker sat quite still shaking his head painting gear air compressors brushes rollers and fifty drums of what i assumed was paint jones couldnt resist asking what color parker shook his head cant say the drums were marked in spanish nothing odd about that the company must want them on hand when the lady flamborough goes in for a refit thats only the half of it we transshipped huge rolls of plastic plastic and great sheets of fiberboard parker continued we must have loaded kilometers of the stuff we barely squeezed it ugh the loading doors mucked around a good three hours just trying to stow it jones stared at his glass through halfopen eyes what do you suppose the company plans to do with it parker looked up at jones with a puzzled frown i havent the foggiest idea the egyptian and mexican security agents came on board soon after sunup and proceeded to inspect the ship for hidden explosives and make cursory checks of the crew members records for any hint of a possible assassin except for a sprinkling of indians and pakistanis the members of the crew were british and had no quarrel with the governments of either egypt or mexico animars terrorist team all spoke fluent english and acted very cooperative showing their counterfeit british passports and insurancesecurity documents when asked and offering their assistance in the ships inspection president de lorenzo came on board later in the morning he was a short man in his early sixties physically robust with windblown gray hair mournful dark eyes and the suffering look of an intellectual condemned to a mental institution he was welcomed by ammar impersonating captain collins in an awardwinning performance the ships orchestra played the mexican national anthem and then the mexican leader and his staff were escorted to their suites on the starboard side of the lady flamborough in the middle of the afternoon a yacht belonging to a wealthy egyptian exporter came alongside and president hasan climbed onto the ship the egyptian leader was the complete opposite of his mexican counterpart he was younger just past his fiftyfourth birthday with thinning black hair he stood slim and tall yet he moved with the halting movements of a man who was ill his dusky eyes were watery and seemed to stare through a filter of suspicion the ceremony was repeated and president hasan along with his staff were quartered in the suites running the length of the port side over fifty third world heads of state had arrived in punta del este for the economic summit some chose to stay in palatial estates owned by their nations citizens or at the exclusive cantegril country club others preferred the offshore quiet of the cruise ships visiting diplomats and journalists soon crowded the streets and restaurants uruguayan officials worried whether they could cope with the sudden mass of important foreigners combined with the routine influx of tourists the nations military force and police units did their best to control the situation but they were soon overwhelmed by the human tidal wave sweeping the streets and they gave up all attempts at traffic control concentrating their efforts on guarding the summit meeting leaders ammar stood on the starboard bridge wing and surveyed the teeming city through binoculars he lowered them for a moment and checked his watch for the fifth time his close friend studied him carefully are you counting the minutes until nightfall suleiman aziz sunset in fortythree minutes said ammar without turning the water is busy said ibn nodding at the fleet of small boats darting around the harbor their decks crowded with journalists demanding interviews and tourists hoping to spot international celebrities allow no one to board except egyptian and mexican delegates who belong on boarde lorenzo and hasans staffs and if any wish to go ashore before we leave poll permit them to do so said ammar ships routine must appear nominal the confusion in the city works to our advantage we wont be missed until its too late the port authorities are no fools when our lights fail to come on after dark they will investigate theyll be notified that our main generator is under repair ammar pointed toward another cruise liner that was anchored farther offshore between the lady flamborough and the encircling peninsula from shore her lights will seem like ours unless someone looks closely enough ammar shrugged one hour is all we need to make the open sea the uruguayan security will not consider a search outside the harbor before daylight if the egyptian and mexican security agents are to be removed in time said ibn we must begin now your weapons are heavily silenced our fire will sound no louder than the clap of hands animar gave ibn a piercing stare stealth and quiet my tend use whatever deception necessary to isolate and take them out one at a time notify me if any escape overboard and alert the security forces on shore we all die make sure your men understand well need every strong back and pair of hands we can muster for this nights work then its time to earn our fee and make yazid ruler of egypt the egyptian guards were the first to be eliminated having no reason to distrust ammars fake insurancesecurity agents they were easily lured into vacant passenger suites that quickly became killing grounds any ruse that rang with a grain of truth was used to decoy the security men the lie that worked best was deceiving them into believing one of their highranking officials was stricken with food poisoning and the ships captain required their presence once the egyptian agents crossed the threshold the door was closed and a hijacker coldly shot them pointblank in the heart while the blood was quickly cleaned away the bodies were stacked in an adjoining bedroom when the mexicans turn arrived two of de lorenzos guards became suspicious refusing to enter the suite but they were swiftly overpowered and knifed in an empty passageway before they could sound the alarm one by one the security agents went to their deaths twelve in all until only two egyptians and three mexicansstanding guard outside their leaders suites were left dusk was closing in from the east as animar shed his ships captains uniform and donned a black cotton jumpsuit next he peeled off the latex disguise and slipped a small jesters mask over his face he was in the act of tightening a heavy belt containing two automatic pistols and a portable radio around his waist when ibn knocked and entered the cabin five remain he reported they can only be taken by direct assault good work said ammar he gave ibn a steady stare were past the need for subterfuge rush them but warn your men to be cautious i dont want hasan and de lorenzo accidentally killed ibn nodded and gave the order to one of his men waiting outside the door then he turned and again faced animar with a confident smile consider the ship secure ammar motioned toward a large brass chronometer above captain collinss desk we shove off in thirtyseven minutes collect all passengers and crew members except the ships engineers see that the engineroom crew is prepared to get underway when i give the command assemble the rest in the main dining salon its time to reveal ourselves and deliver our demands ibn did not respond but stood without moving the smile spreading until every tooth showed allah has blessed us with great fortune he said at last ammar looked at him well know better whether hes blessed us five hes already sent a good omen she is here she who are you talking about hala kaniil at first ammar could not comprehend then he could not believe karnil shes here on this ship she stepped on board less than ten minutes ago announced ibn beaming ive placed her under guard in one of the female crew members quarters allah is indeed kind said ammar incredulously yes he has sent the fly to the spider ibn said darkly and given you a second chance to kill her in the name of akhmad yazid just as darkness was approaching a light tropical rain cleared the sky and passed northward lights were blinking to life along punta del estes streets and on board the ships in the harbor casting flickering reflections across the water senator pitt thought it strange that nothing showed of the lady flamborough except her outline against the brightly lit glow of the ship moored behind her she looked dark and deserted as the launch swung past her bow and came alongside the boarding stairs carrying only a briefcase the senator jumped lightly onto the narrow platform he had hardly climbed two steps before the launch turned away and headed back to the dock area he reached the deck and found himself standing alone something was terribly wrong his first thought was that hed boarded the wrong ship the only sounds the only sounds of life were a voice somewhere within the superstructure coming through a speaker system and the generators humming deep in the bowels of the hull he turned to hail the launch but it had already traveled too far for him to be heard above the exhaust of its tired old diesel engine then a figure in a black jumpsuit stepped out of the shadows holding an automatic rifle leveled at the senators stomach is this the lady flamborough the senator demanded who are you the voice came back in little more than a whisper what is your business here the guard stood there gun held rocksteady staring with his head cocked at an angle while the senator explained his presence senator george pitt you say an american you were not expected president hasan was informed of my arrival said the senator impatiently please lower your weapon and take me to his quarters the guards eyes glinted suspiciously from the glare of the lights on shore anyone else come with you no im quite alone you must return ashore the senator tilted his head at the retreating launch my transportation has left the guard seemed to be thinking it over finally he lowered the gun and silently walked a few steps down the deck and stopped beside a doorway he held out a frre hand and nodded toward the briefcase in here he said softly as though it was some kind of secret give me your case mese are official documents said the senator flatly he clutched his briefcase in both hands and brushed past the guard he walked into a heavy black curtain slapped it to one side and found himself standing in a squaremeter ballroom dining salon the vast room was paneled in oak and styled after an english manor a small army of people some standing some sitting wearing either business suits or crew uniforms turned and gazed at him in unison as though he were a ball in a tennis match there were nine men spread around the walls silent deadly serious men dressed alike in the black jumpsuits and matching jogging shoes each slowly swept the muzzle of a shoulderslung automatic weapon back and forth over their captive audience welcome came the amplified voice of a figure standing on a stage in front of a microphone a man indistinguishable from the others except for a comical mask covering his face but with that any sign of humor quickly came to a halt please state your identity senator pitt stared in confusion whats going on here you will please answer my question said ammar with icy politeness senator george pitt united states congress im here to confer with president hasan of egypt i was told he was staying on board this ship youll find president hasan seated in the front row why are these men holding guns on everyone ammar feigned weary patience why senator i thought it obvious youve blindly walked into the middle of a hijacking a growing incomprehension and the tentative beginnings of a dazed fear mushroomed inside senator pitt he moved forward as if hypnotized past captain collins and his officers and stared at the pale familiar faces of presidents hasan and de lorenzo he stopped short and looked down into the stricken eyes of hala kamil at that moment he realized people were going to die he silently put his arm around halas shoulder and was swept with sudden anger in gods name do you know what youre doing i know very well what im doing said ammar auah has worked with me every step of the way in your poker idiom he has sweetened the pot by raising the stakes with the unexpected arrivals of the secretarygeneral of the united nations and now a distinguished senator from the united states youve made a grave mistake the senator snarled defiantly youll never live to get away with this and brag about it but i can and i will impossible not impossible at all said ammar with an ominous finality in his voice as you shall soon see nichols had donned his overcoat and was stuffing papers inside his attached case before departing for home when his secretary leaned through his open door a gentleman from langley is here with a drop have him come in a cia agent whom nichols recognized entered carrying an oldfashioned leather accountantsstyle briefcase you caught me just in time keith said nichols i was on my way home keith farquar had a bushy mustache thick brown hair and wore hornedrimmed glasses a large nononsense type of man with contemplative eyes he was nichols thought the kind of agent who made up the solid bulwark of the central intelligence agency without an invitation farquar sat down in a chair placed the case on his lap and set the correct numbers on a combination lock that released the catch and switched off the circuit of a small incendiary explosive inside he lifted out a thin file and placed it on the desk in front of nichols mr brogan instructed me to tell you that hard data on akhmad yazid is extremely sparse biographical records regarding birth parents and ancestors schooling marriage children or any mention in legal proceedings either criminal or civil are virtually nonexistent most of what our middle east section was able to put together comes from descriptions of people who have known him unfortunately most of them for one reason or another became ene es of yazid so their accounts are somewhat biased did your psychological section make up a profile asked nichols they put together a rough projection yazid is as hard to penetrate as a desert sandstorm a shroud of security has covered him in mystery journalists interviews with people around him are met with ambiguity and vague shrugs which adds to the mirage commented nichols farquar smiled mr brogans exact description of yazid an elusive mirage thank you for bringing the file by said nichols and thank everyone involved with assembling the information for me anything for a client farquar snapped the catches closed on his briefcase and ambled toward the door have a nice evening you too nichols buzzed for his secretary she appeared wearing a coat and holding a purse anything i can do before i leave she asked apprehensively afraid she would be asked to work overtime for the third night in a row could you please call my wife on your way out asked nichols and tell her not to worry ill make the dinner party but will be delayed for about half an hour his secretary sighed thankfully yes sir ill tell her good night good night nichols slipped his pipe between his teeth but didnt pack or light the bowl he set his attache case off to the side of his desk and still wearing his overcoat he sat down and examined yazids file farquar had not exaggerated it was slim pickings although the last six years were heavily reported yazids life before his rapid rise from obscurity took up little more than a paragraph his debut in the news media began with his arrest by egyptian police during a sitin demonstration for cairos starving masses inside the lobby of a luxury tourist hotel he had distinguished himself by preaching in the worst slum areas of the country akhmad yazid stated he was born in squalid poverty in a mud hut among the decaying mausoleums of the city of the dead that spilled into the garbage dumps of cairo his family lived on the thin margin between survival and death until his two sisters and father died from disease brought on by hunger and filthy living conditions he had no formal schooling except what was given during his adolescent years by islamic holy men none of whom were found to back up this assertion yazid claimed muhammad the prophet spoke through him uttering divine revelations to the faiffiffil and urging them to return egypt to a utopian islamic state yazid possessed a resonant speaking voice he had the skilled mannerisms and delivery to enrapture a crowd of listenets slowly building them to a fever pitch at the finish he insisted western philosophy was incapable of resolving egypts socialeconomic problems he preached that all egyptians are members of a lost generation who must find themselves through his moral vision though he vehemently claimed otherwise evidence indicated he was not above using terrorism to achieve his goals five separate incidents including the murder of a highranking air force general a truck explosion outside the soviet embassy and the executionstyle killing of four university teachers who spoke out in favor of western ways were traced to yazids doorstep nothing was proven but through sketchy information gained from muslim infomiants cia analysts felt certain yazid was planning a masterstroke to eliminate president hasan and sweep into power on a rising wave of public acclaim nichols laid down the file and finally filled and lit his pipe a tiny indefinable thought tugged at him from the far reaches of his mind something about the report struck him as vaguely familiar he laid aside a glossy photo of yazid glaring malevolently at the camera the answer suddenly struck nichols it was simple and it was shocking he picked up his telephone and punched the coded number of a direct line impatiently drumming the desk top with his fingers until a voice answered on the other end this is brogan martin thank heavens youre working late this is dale nichols what can i do for you dale asked the director of the cia did you get the packet on akhmad yazid yes thank you replied nichols ive gone through it and found something you can help me with sure what is it i need two sets of blood types and fingerprints fingerprints thats right we use genetic codes and dna tracing nowadays brogan answered indulgently any particular reason in mind nichols paused to collect his thoughts if i tell you i swear to god youll think i should be fitted for a straitjacket yaeger pulled off his granny reading glasses tucked them into the pocket of a denim jacket shuffled and stacked a pile of computer reports then settled back in his chair and sipped from a can of diet soda zilch he said almost sadly a wasted effort up and down the line a yearold trail is too cold to follow without solid data a computer cant go back in time and tell you exactly how it was maybe dr gronquist can determine where the serapes made landfall after hes had a chance to study the artifacts lily said optimistically pitt sat two rows below and off to one side from the others in numas small amphitheater i talked to him by radio an hour ago hes found nothing that isnt mediterranean in origin a threedimensional projection of the atlantic ocean showing land folds and the irregular geology of the sea bottom filled a screen above the stage everyone seemed obsessed by it their eyes were drawn to the contoured imagery even as they spoke everyone that is except admiral james sandecker his eyes suspiciously observed al giordino particularly the large cigar sprouting from one side of the assistant project directors mouth as if it had grown from a seedling when did you start buying hoyo de monterrey excaliburs giordino looked at the admiral with an innocent expression you talking to me admiral since you and i are the only ones in the theater smoking excaliburs and im not in the habit of talking to myself yes great full flavor said giordino holding up the fat cigar and expelling a gush of blue smoke i commend your discriminating taste where did you get it a little shop in baltimore i forget the name sandecker wasnt fooled for an instant giordino had been stealing his expensive cigars for years what drove the admiral up the wall was that he never discovered how no matter how well he hid or locked them away his inventory count always showed two missing every week giordino kept the secret from pitt so his best friend would never have to lie if asked how it was done only giordino and an old buddy from the air force who was a professional burglar for an intelligence agency knew the technicalities of operation stogie ive a good notion to ask to see a receipt growled sandecker we ve been attacking this thing from the wrong angle pitt said steering the meeting back on course theres another angle asked yaeger we took the only logical approach open to us without any reference to direction it was an impossible job lily backed him a pity rufinus didnt log his daily positions and distance traveled mused sandecker he was under strict orders not to record anything could they determine a position back then asked giordino lily nodded by positions of earth landmarks by figuring their latitude and longitude a hundred and thirty years before christ sandecker laced his hands across his trim stomach and gazed at pitt over his reading glasses i know that lost look in your eyes somethings nagging at you pitt slouched in his seat weve been judging facts and using guesswork without considering the man who conceived the smuggling plan junius venator a brilliant guy pitt continued who was described by a contemporary as a daring innovator who struck out into areas other scholars feared to tread the question weve overlooked is if we were in venators shoes where would we have taken and hidden the great art and litemq treasures of our time i still say africa volunteered yaeger preferably around the cape somewhere up a river along the eastern coastline yet your computers couldnt make a marriage they never came close yaeger admitted but god only knows how land formations have changed since venators day could venator have taken the fleet northeast into the black sea lily queried rufinus was specific about a voyage of fiftyeight days said giordino sandecker puffing his cigar nodded yes but if the fleet was hit by foul weather or adverse winds they could have traveled less than a thousand miles in that time the admiral has a point yaeger conceded ancient ships of the period were constructed to run with the sea and before the wind their rigging was not efficient for willdward sailing heavyweather conditions could have cut their progress by eighty percent except pitt said hanging on the word venator loaded his ships with four times their normal supply of provisions he planned for an extended voyage said lily suddenly intrigued venator never intended to land every few days and resupply his fleet all that that proves to me said sandecker is that venator wanted to keep the entire voyage as secret as possible by never coming ashore and leaving a trail pitt shook his head as soon as the ships cleared the straits of gibraltar any need for secrecy evaporated venator was free and in the clear byzantine warships sent to stop him would be as much in the dark as we are of his next course heading so we put ourselves in yaeger looked quizzically at pitt venators shoes or sandals or whatever they wore then whats our plan dr rothberg unknowingly came up with the key to the mystery pitt explained he thought venator buried the artifacts where no one of his day would think to look yaeger looked at him blankly that could be anywhere in the ancient world or outside of the world as the romans knew it charted geography didnt extend very far below north africa or east of the black sea and persian gulf said lily nothing was explored beyond we dont know that pitt disagreed junius venator had access to four thousand years of mans knowledge he knew of the existence of the african continent and the great steppes of russia he must have known of trade with india which in turn imported and exported goods from china and hed have studied the records of voyages that sailed far beyond the usual romanbyzantine trade routes were certain the alexandria library had an entire section devoted to geographical records said lily venator could have worked from source maps compiled from much earlier times what do you think he discovered that influenced him asked sandecker a direction pitt answered all had focused their curiosity on pitt and he did not disappoint them he walked down to the stage and picked up a flashlight that shone a small arrow on the threedimensional projection the only question in my mind said giordino is whether the fleet turned north or south neither pitt moved the lighted arrow through the gibraltar straits and across the atlantic venator led his fleet west to the americas his statement was greeted with stunned disbelief there is no archaeological evidence supporting precolumbian contact in the americas lily stated firmly the serapes is a pretty good indicator they could have made such a voyage said sandecker its a heated controversy admitted pitt but there are too many similarities in mayan art and culture that cannot be ignored ancient america may not have been as isolated from european and asian influence as we once thought frankly i buy it said yaeger his enthusiasm restored id bet my willie nelson record collection the phoenicians the egyptians greeks romans and vikings all landed on north and south american soil before columbus no selfrespecting archaeologist would take you up on it said lily giordino grinned at her thats because they wont stake their precious reputations on it sandecker looked at yaeger lets give the project another try yaeger looked at pitt what shorelines do you want me to cover pitt scratched his chin he realized he badly needed a shave begin at the fjord in greenland and work south down to panama he paused to stare at the chart projection with thoughtful curiosity it has to be along there somewhere captain oliver collins rapped a knuckle against the bridge barometer he squinted at the needle barely visible from the lights on shore and cursed under his breath at the fairweather reading if only there was a storm he thought the ship could not have left the harbor captain collins was a firstrate seaman but a poor judge of human nature suleiman aziz ammar would have ordered the lady flamborough to sea in the middle of a hurricane with ninetyknot winds he sat tensely in the captains seat behind the bridge windows and wiped away the sweat from around his neck that had trickled from his chin the mask was a torture in the humid climate and so were the gloves he wore constantly he suffered the discomfort stoically if the hijacking failed and he escaped international intelligence services could never identify him with witnesses or fingerprints one of his men had taken the hetm and was looking at him expectantly across the darkened bridge two more were guarding the bridge doorways their guns aimed at collins and first officer finney who was standing next to ammars helmsman the tide had come in and swung the ship on her anchor until her bow was pointing toward the harbor entrance ammar made one final sweep of the harbor and dock area with a pair of binoculars and then motioned at finney with his hand while speaking into a small radio now he ordered get her underway and launch the labor crews finney his face twisted in anger looked at collins imploringly for a sign of defiance but the captain gave a subdued shrug and the first officer reluctantly gave the command to raise the anchor two minutes later dripping silt from the harbor bottom the anchor rose out of the black water and was pulled tight against the hawsehole the helmsman stood by the wheel but made no move to grasp the spokes on modern ships manual steering is used mostly during heavy weather and while under the command of pilots upon entering and departing port it was finney who steered the ship and regulated the speed from a panel tied through fiber optics to the ships automated control system he also kept a sharp eye on the radar screen once the ship was free of port the helm was placed on automatic pilot and ringing the chief engineer down below for slow ahead on the bridge telegraph was quickly becoming more of a tradition than a necessity moving wraithlike in the evening darkness her outline visible only when she blocked off lights from the opposite shore the lady flamborough slipped through the crowded harbor indistinct and unnoticed her diesels murmured faintly as the big bronze screws bit through the water like a ghost feeling its way through the tombstones of a cemetery the ship wove its way around the other moored ships and turned into the narrow channel for the open sea ammar picked up the bridge phone and called the communications room anything he asked tersely nothing yet answered his man who monitored the radio frequencies of the uruguayan navy patrol boats patch any signal through to the bridge speakers affirmative a small boat crossing our bow dead ahead announced finney we have to give way ammar placed the muzzle of an automatic pistol against the base of finneys skull maintain course and speed were on a collision course finney protested the flamborough has no lights they cant see us ammars only reply was to increase the pressure of the gun muzzle they could clearly see the approaching boat now she was a large customdesigned motor yacht collins guessed her dimensions at forty meters in length with a beam of eight meters she was beautiful and elegant and she blazed with lights there was a party on board and people were grouped in conversation or dancing on her spacious sun decks collins was stricken to see the radar antenna wasnt turning give them a blast of the horn he implored warn them while they still have a chance to give way anunar ignored him the seconds ticked away under a cloud of dread until the collision was inevitable the people partying on the yacht and the man at its helm were completely oblivious to the steel monster bearing down on them out of the dark inhuman collins gasped this is inhuman the lady flamborough bowon into the starboard side of the big yacht there was no heavy jar or shriek of metal against metal the men on the bridge of the cruise liner felt only a very slight tremor as the fourstory bow crushed the smaller boat nearly under the water before slicing its hull in two the destruction was as devastating as a sledgehammer smashing a childs toy collins fists were clenched on the forward bridge panel as he gazed m horror at the disaster he clearly heard the panicked screams of women as the yachts shattered bow and stern sections scraped along the sides of the lady flamborough before they sank less than fifty meters astern the dark surface of the flamboroughs wake was littered with wreckage and bodies a few of the unfortunate passengers were thrown clear and were trying to swim clear while the injured grasped anything that would keep them afloat then they were lost in the night the bitterness and rage welled up in finneys throat you murdering bastard he spat at ammar only ali knows the unforeseen said ammar his voice remote and indifferent he slowly pulled the automatic away from finneys skull as soon as we clear the channel bear on a heading of onefivefive degrees magnetic and engage the automatic pilot grayfaced beneath his tropic tan couins turned and faced ammar for gods sake radio the uruguayan searescue service and give them a chance to save those poor people no communications they dont have to know who sent the transmission ammar shook his head less than an hour after the local authorities are alerted to the accident an investigation will be underway by security forces our absence will quickly be discovered and a pursuit launched im sorry captain every nautical mile we put between our stern and punta del este is critical the answer is no collins stared into ammars eyes stared without speaking while his stunned mind fought to orient itself then he said what price must be paid before yourelease my ship if you and your crew do what i command no harm will come to any of you and the passengers presidents de lorenzo and hasan and their staffs what are your plans for them eventually they will be ransomed but for the next ten hours theyre all going to get their hands dirty bitter helplessness was sharp in collinss mouth but his voice was impassive you have no intention of holding them as hostages for money are you a mind reader as well as a sea captain asked ammar with detached interest it doesnt take an anthropologist to see your men were born in the middle east my guess is you intend to assassinate the egyptians ammar smiled emptily allah decides mans fate i only carry out my instructions instructions from what source before ammar could reply a voice broke over the bridge speakers rendezvous at approximately zero twothirty commander animar acknowledged on his portable transmitter then he looked at collins theres no more reason for conversation captain we have a great deal to accomplish before daylight what are your plans for my ship demanded collins you owe me the answer to that question yes of course i owe you that ammar muttered automatically his mind already training on another subject by this time tomorrow evening international news services will report that the lady flamborough has been posted missing and presumed lost with all passengers and crew in two hundred fathoms of water did you hear something carlos the old fisherman asked as he gripped the worn spokes on the wheel of an ancient fishing boat the younger man who was his son cupped his ears and peered into the darkness beyond the bow you have better ears than mine papa all i hear is our engine i thought i heard someone like a woman screaming for help the son paused listened again and then shrugged sorry i still hear nothing it was there luiz chavez rubbed his grizzled beard on a sleeve and then pulled the throttle on idle i wasnt dreaming chavez was in a hearty mood the fish catch had been good the holds were only halffull but the nets had pwiea in a quality and variety that would bring top prices from the chefs of the hotel and resort restaurants the six bottles of beer that were sloshing in his stomach didnt hurt his jolly disposition either papa i see something in the water where carlos pointed off the port bow looks like pieces of a boat the old fishermans eyes were not so sharp at night any more he squinted and gazed in the direction his son was pointing then the running lights began to pick out scattered bits of wreckage he recognized the bright white paint and varnished debris as coming from a yacht an explosion or perhaps a collision he thought he settled on a collision the nearest lights of the port were only two kilometers away an explosion would have been seen and heard he saw no sign of navigation lights from rescue boats converging in the channel the boat was entering the debris field when his ears caught it again what he had thought was a scream now sounded like sobbing and it came from close by get raul justino and manuel from the galley quickly tell them to make ready to go in the water after survivors the boy rushed off as chavez set the gear lever to stop he stepped out of the wheelhouse and snapped on a spotlight and slowly swept its beam across the water he spotted two huddled shapes lying half across a small splintered section of teak decking and half in the water less than twenty meters away one a man appeared inert the other a woman her face like chalk stared into the light and frantically waved then suddenly she began yelling hysterically and thrashing at the water hold on chavez shouted dont panic were coming for you chavez turned at the sound of running feet behind him his crew had rushed out of the deckhouse and quickly crowded around him can you make anything out asked luis two survivors floating on some wreckage get ready to pull them on board one of you might have to go in the water and give them a hand no one is going in the water tonight said one of the crew his face turning pale chavez turned back to the survivors just as the woman let out a terrified shriek his heart turned to ice as he saw the tall fin the ugly head with the inkspot eye whipping back and forth with its jaws locked around the womans lower legs adored mary mother of jesus muttered luis crossing himself as fast as his hand could move chavez shuddered but could not pull his eyes away as the shark draggtd the woman off farther into the water other sharks circled drawn by the blood bumping against the shattered deck until the body of the man rolled off one of the fishermen turned and vomited over the side as the scream turned to an ungodly gurgling noise then the night fell silent less than an hour later colonel jos rojas uruguayan chief coordinator for special security stood ramrod straight in front of a group of officers in battle dress he had trained with the british grenadier guards after graduating from his countrys military school and he had taken up their antiquated habit of carrying a swagger stick he stood over a table containing a model diorama of the punta del este waterfront and addressed the assembled men we will organize into three roving teams to patrol the docks on rotating eighthour shifts he began while dramatically slapping the stick in the palm of one hand our mission is to stand on constant alert as a backup force in the event of a terrorist attack i realize its difficult for you to look inconspicuous but try anyway stay in the shadows at night and off the main thoroughfares by day we dont want to frighten the tourists into thinking uruguay is an armed state any questions lieutenant eduardo vazquez raised a hand colonel vazquez if we see someone who looks suspicious what should we do you do nothing except report him hell probably turn out to be one of the international security agents what if he appears to be armed rojas sighed then youll know hes a security agent leave international incidents to the diplomats is everyone clear no hands went up rojas dismissed the men and walked to his temporary office in the harbor masters building he stopped at a coffee machine to pour a cup when his aide approached captain flores in naval affairs asked if you could meet him downstairs did he say why only that it was urgent rojas didnt want to spill his coffee so he took the elevator instead of the stairs flores impeccable in a white navy dress uniform greeted him on the first floor but offered no explanations as he escorted rojas across the street to a large shed that housed the coastal rescue boats inside a group of men were examining several mangled fragments that looked to the colonel as if they came from a boat captain flores introduced him to chavez and his son these fishermen have just brought in this wreckage which they discovered in the channel he explained they say it looked to them like a yacht had been crushed in a collision with a large ship why should a yachting accident concern special security asked rojas the harbor master a man with cropped hair and a bristling mustache spoke up it may well be a disaster that could cast a cloud on the economic summit he paused and added rescue craft are on the scene now so far no survivors have been found have you identified the yacht one of the scraps mr chavez and his crew fished out of the water bears a nameplate the craft was called the lola rojas shook his head im a soldier pleasure boats are not familiar is the name supposed to mean something to me the yacht was named for the wife of victor rivera answered flores you know him rojas stiffened i am acquainted with the speaker of our chamber of deputies the yacht was his registered in his name flores nodded weve already contacted his secretary at her home gave her no information of course merely inquired as to mr riveras whereabouts she said he was on board his yacht hosting a party for argentinean and brazilian diplomats how many rojas inquired a fear growing within him rivera and his wife twentythree guests and five crew members thirty in all names the secretary did not have the guest list in front of her ive taken the liberty of sending my aide to riveras headquarters for a copy i think it best if i take command of the investigation from this point stated rojas officially the navy stands ready to offer every assistance said flores happy to wash his hands of any authority rojas turned to the harbor master what ship was involved with the collision a mystery no ship has arrived or departed the harbor in the last ten hours is it possible for a ship to enter port without you knowing a captain would be stupid to try it without calling for a pilot is it possible rojas persisted no stated the harbor master firmly no oceangoing ship could dock or moor in the harbor without my being aware of it rojas accepted that suppose one sailed out the harbor master considered the question for a few moments then he gave a slight nod one could not cast off from a dock without my knowledge but if the vessel was anchored offshore if her skipper or his officers knew the channel and if she ran without lights she might make it out to sea unnoticed but i must say it would be close to a miracle can you furnish captain flores with a list of moored ships ill have a copy in his hands within ten minutes captain hores colonel since a missing ship is a naval operation id like you to take command of the search gladly colonel ill begin immediately rojas stared thoughtfully at the wreckage littering the concrete floor therell be hell to pay before this night is through he muttered shortly before midnight after captain flores had conducted a thorough search of the harbor and the waters outside the channel he notified rojas that the only ship he could not account for was the lady flamborough colonel rojas was stunned when he examined the cruise liners vip passenger list he demanded a followup investigation in the false hope that the egyptian and mexican presidents had disembarked for quarters on shore not until it was confirmed that they were missing along with the ship did the horrible specter of a terrorist hijacking become evident an extensive air search was launched at dawn every aircraft the combined air forces of uruguay argentina and brazil could put in the air scoured over square kilometers of the south atlantic no sign of the lady flamborough was found it was as though she had been swallowed by the sea two hands were running under his shirt and up his back he struggled to wake from a sound sleep dreaming he was deep in the water swimming upward toward the shimmering surface but never able to reach it he rubbed his eyes saw he was still on the couch in his office and rolled over his gaze blocked by a pair of shapely legs pitt moved to a sitting position and stared into lilys beguiling eyes he held up his wrist but he had taken his watch off and placed it on the desk with his keys change and wallet what time is it he asked fivethirty she replied sweetly moving her hands across his shoulders and massaging his neck night or day late afternoon you only dozed off for three hours dont you ever drop off i can get by with only four hours sleep out of every twentyfour he yawned your next husband has my deepest sympathy heres some coffee she set a cup on an end table near his head pitt slipped on his shoes and tucked in his shirttails yaeger found anything yes the river no not yet hiram is very mysterious about it but he claims you were right venator sailed across the atlantic before either the vikings or columbus he took a sip of the coffee and made a face this is almost solid sugar lily looked surprised al said you always take four spoon fuls al lied i prefer it pure black with grounds on the bottom of the cup im sorry she said with an unremorseful smile i guess i was taken in by a practical joker youre not the first he said staring out the door of his office giordino was seated with his feet on yaegers desk devouring the last slice of a pizza while he studied a detailed topographic map of a shoreline yaeger sat with bloodshot eyes aimed at a computer monitor while jotting notes on a pad he did not have to turn as pitt and lily entered the room he could see their reflections in the screen weve made a breakthrough he said with some satisfaction pitt asked what have you got instead of concentrating on every nook and cranny south from the serapiss grave in greenland i leapfrogged down to maine and began looking for a matchup of his landing description and it paid off pitt said in anticipation yes if yourecall rufinus wrote that after they deserted venator they were battered by storms from the south for thirtyone days before finding a safe bay where they could make repairs to the ship on the next leg of the voyage more storms blew away the sails and tore off the steering oars then the ship drifted for an unspecified number of days before ending up in the greenland fjord yaeger stopped and called up a chart of the american side of the north atlantic on the monitor next his fingers nimbly punched out a series of codes a small line formed and began traveling southward from the east coast of greentand south in a broken zigzagged path around newfoundland past nova scotia and new england ending at a point slightly above atlantic city new jersey muttered pitt puzzled bamegat bay to be exact said giordino he brought over the topographic map and laid it on a table then he circled a section of the coast with a red marker bamegat bay new jersey pitt repeated the shape of the land was quite different back in ninetyone yaeger lectured matteroffactly the beach strand was more broken and the bay was deeper and more sheltered how did you arrive at this exact spot asked pitt in describing the bay rufinus mentioned a great sea of dwarflike pines where fresh water seeped from the sand with the jab of a stick new jersey has a forest of dwarf pines that fits the description its called the pine barrens and it spreads across the southern center of the state bordering on the coast to the east the water level is just under the surface during spring runoff or after heavy rains you can literally poke a hole in the sandy soil and strike water looks promising said pitt but didnt rufinus also say they added ballast stone i admit that had me baffled so i put in a call to a geologist at the army corps of engineers he came up with a stone quarry that pinpointed almost the exact site where i believe the serapiss crew landed nice job said pitt gratefully youve put the show on the right track where do we go from here asked lily ill continue working south answered yaeger at the same time ill have my people compute an approximate trace of venators course west from spain with hindsight it seems obvious the islands that made up the fleets first landfall after leaving the mediterranean were the west indies by continuing the serapiss path from new jersey and projecting venators track to the americas we should arrive at an approximate intersect within five hundred miles of a liver that fits the bill lily looked skeptical i fail to see how you expect to trace venators track when he censored all accounts of heading currents winds and distances no great flash yaeger replied dryly ill lift the log data from the voyages of columbus to the new worldtaking his computed course and adjusting it for differences in hull design and water friction rigging and sail area between his ships and the byzantine fleet a thousand years earlier you make it sound simple believe me its not we may be homing in on the target but its going to take another solid four days of study to get us there the weariness and long hours of tedious study seemed forgotten yaegers reddened eyes blazed with determination lily appeared to be galvanized with excess energy they were poised for the starters gun do it said pitt find the library pitt thought sandecker sent for him for a status report on the search but the instant he saw the somber expression on the admirals face he knew there was a problem what really bothered pitt was the soft look in the admirals eyes they were usually as hard as flint then when sandecker came over and took him by the arm and led him to a couch and sat down alongside pitt knew there was a problem ive just received some disturbing news from the white house sandecker began the cruise ship that was hosting presidents de lorenzo and hasan at the economic summit in uruguay is suspected of being hijacked im sorry to hear it said pitt but how does that affect numa hala kamil was on board damn and so was the senator my father pitt muttered in surprise i talked to him by phone the night before last how did he come to be in uruguay he was on a mission for the president pitt stood up paced back and forth and then sat down again whats the situation chve cuss er the lady flamboroughthe name of the british cruise linerdisappeared from the port of punta del este last night where is the ship now an extensive air search has yet to turn up a trace of her the general consensus of the officials on the scene is that the lady flamborough lies at the bottom of the sea without absolute proof i cant accept that im with you weather conditions i gather from the report the area was fair with calm seas ships vanish in storms said pitt seldom in calm seas sandecker made an empty gesture with his hands until more details come in we can only speculate pitt could not believe his father was dead what he heard was too inconclusive what is the white house doing about it the presidents hands are tied thats ridiculous pitt said sharply he could order all naval units in the area to assist in the search thats the catch said sandecker except for an occasional training exercise none of which is occurring now there are no united states naval units on station in the south atlantic pitt stood again and stared out the window at the lights of washington then he fixed sandecker with a penetrating stare youre telling me the united states government is in no way involved with the search it looks that way whats to stop numa from searching nothing except we lack a fleet of coast guard vessels and an aircraft carrier we have the sounder sandecker stared back thoughtfully for a moment then his face took on a questioning expression one of our research vessels shes on a sonar mapping project of the continental slope off southern brazil sandecker nodded all right i get your drift but the sounder is too slow to be of any help on an extensive sea search what do you expect to accomplish with her if my fathers ship cant be found on the surface ill hunt for her below you could be looking at a thousand square miles maybe more the sounders sonar gear can cut a swath two miles wide and she carries a submersible all i need is your permission to take command of her youll need someone to back you up giordino and rudi gunn we make a good team rudi is on a deepsea mining operation off the canary islands he could be in uruguay in eighteen hours sandecker clasped his hands behind his head and stared at the ceiling deep down he felt pitt was chasing shadows but he never doubted for an instant what his answer would be write your own ticket he said in a level tone ill back you thank you admiral pitt said im grateful how does the alexandria library project stand yaeger and dr sharp are close to a solution they dont need al and me getting in the way sandecker rose and placed both his hands on pitts shoulders he may not be dead you know dad better not be dead pitt said with a grim smile id never forgive him dammit martin the president said abniptly didnt your middle east people smell a plot to hijack the lady flamborough martin brogan the cia director shrugged wearily he was well insulated for taking the blame for every terrorist act that killed americans or took them hostage the cias successes were rarely heralded but their mistakes were the stuff of congressional investigations and hype from the news mecha the ship along with its entire passenger list and crew was snatched from under the noses of the finest security agents in the world he replied whoever dreamed up the venture and executed it is one shrewd operator the mere scope is far beyond any terrorist activity weve seen in the past i find it hardly surprising our counterterrorist network was not tipped off in advance alan merger the national security adviser removed his glasses and idly wiped the lenses with a handkerchief my end struck out too he said backing up brogan analysis of our eavesdropping monitoring systems failed to reveal any hint of a potential cruiseliner hijacking and abduction of two foreign leaders by sending george pitt to meet with president hasan i sentenced an old friend to death the president said regretfully not your fault merger consoled him the president angrily pounded the desk with one fist the senator hala kamil de lorenzo and hasan i cant believe theyre all gone we dont know that for sure said merger the president stared at him you cant hide a cruise liner and all the people on board alan even a dumb politician like me knows that there is still a chance chance hell it was a suicide mission plain and simple all those poor people were probably locked up while the ship was scuttled the terrorists never meant to escape they went down too all the facts arent in yet merger argued just what do we know demanded the president our experts are already in punta del este working with the uruguayan security people explained brogan so far we only have preliminary conclusions first the hijacking has been tied to an arab group two witnesses came forward who were in a passing launch when they saw the lady flamborough taking on cargo from a landing barge they heard crewmen on both vessels speaking arabic the landing barge has not been found and is assumed to be scuttled somewhere in the harbor any idea on the cargo asked merger all the witnesses could recall seeing were some drums answered brogan second a phony report was given to the harbor masters office from the cruise liner saying its main generator had broken down and the vessel would only run navigation lights until repairs were carried out then as soon as it became dark the unlit ship pulled up its anchor and slipped out of the harbor colliding with a private yacht carrying important south american businessmen and diplomats the only fumble in an otherwise flawless execution then it disappeared hardly a slop job said merger unlike the botched second assassination attempt on hala kaniil a different group entirely brogan added dale nichols spoke up for the first time in the meeting which you linked directly to akhmad yazid yes the assassins were not very careful egyptian passports were found on tke bodies one the leader we identified as a mullah and fanatical follower of yazid do you think yazids responsible for the hijacking he certainly had the motive answered brogan with president hasan out of the way he has a clear shot at taking over the egyptian government the same goes for president de lorenzo topiltzin and mexico nichols stated flatly an interesting theory said merger what can we do besides send a few cia terrorist investigators to uruguay asked the president what are our options in helping with the search for the lady flamborough to answer the first part of your question said brogan very little the investigation is in good hands uruguayan police and security intelligence chiefs were trained here and in britain they know the score and are most cooperative in working with our experts he paused and avoided the presidents eyes as to the second again very little the navy department has no ships patrolling the ocean off south america the nearest vessel to the area is a nuclear sub on a training exercise off antarctica our latin friends are doing fine without us over eighty military and commercial aircraft and at least fourteen ships from argentina brazil and uruguay have been combing the sea off punta del este since dawn and they havent found a clue to the lady flamboroughs fate said the president what little optimism he had before was rapidly eroding into despondency they will said merger tersely wreckage and bodies most certainly will turn up said brogan candidly no ship that size can vanish without leaving some trace behind has the story broken in the press yet asked the president i was informed it came over the wire services an hour ago nichols answered the president folded his hands and clenched them tightly holy hell will cut loose in congress when they find out one of their members is a victim of a terrorist act no telling what kind of revenge theyll demand the purpose of the senators mission alone is enough to cause a major scandal if it leaks out said nichols swinge that terrorists can murder international leaders and diplomats with an army of innocent victims thrown in and get off with a few years in prison mused the president but if we play their gwne and go after them with guns blasting were branded immoral bloodthirsty avengers the news media get on our case and congress demands investigations it hurts being the good guys said brogan he was beginning to sound tired nichols stood up and stretched i dont think we have to worry nothing was put down on paper or recorded on tape and only the men in this room know why senator pitt flew down to punta del este to confer with president hasan dales right said merger we can come up with any number of excuses to explain away his mission the president unclasped his hands and rubbed his eyes tiredly george pitt hasnt been dead a day and already were trying to cover our asses that problem is minor compared to the political disasters were facing in egypt and mexico said nichols with hasan and de lorenzo dead too egypt will go the way of iran and be irretrievably lost for sure then with mexico he hesitated well have a time bomb ready to go off along our own border as my chief of staff and closest adviser what measures do you suggest we take nicholss stomach was attacked by a cramp and his heartbeat quickened the president and the two intelligence advisers seemed to be studying his eyes he wondered if the stress that was twisting his guts came from being put on the spot or the thought of a looming foreign catastrophe i propose we wait for proof the lady flamborough and everybody on her lies on the bottom of the ocean and if no evidence is forthcoming asked the president do we go on waiting until egypt and mexico their leaders missing and presumed dead arr taken over by topiltzin and akhmad yazid a pair of crazed megalomaniacs what then what course of action is left to stop them before its too late short of assassination none nicholss hand nervously massaged his aching stomach we can only prepare for the worst which is we write off egypt nichols said gravely and invade mexico a heavy rain soaked uruguays capital city of montevideo as the small jet dropped from the clouds and lined up on the runway soon after touchdown it swung away from the commercial terminal and rolled onto a taxi strip toward a cluster of hangars flanked by rows of fighter jets a ford sedan with military markings appeared and led the pilot to a parking area reserved for visiting vip aircraft colonel rojas stood inside a hangar office and peered out a waterstreaked window as the aircraft rolled closer he could see the letters numa across the aquamarine color scheme running down the fuselage the sound of the engines died away and a minute later three men climbed out they quickly piled into the ford to escape the deluge and were driven inside the hangar where rojas waited the colonel stepped to the office door and studied them as they were ushered across the vast concrete floor by a young lieutenant who was his aide the short one with a curly jungle of black hair and a battleship chest strutted with an easy vigor his hands and arms might have been grafted from a bear his eyes scowled but his lips showed white even teeth in a satirical smile the slim man with the hornrinnned glasses narrow hips and shoulders looked like an accountant who had come to audit the company ledgers he carried a briefcase and two books under one arm he also wore a smile but it seemed more mischievous than plain humorous rojas pegged him as a pleasant sort easily amused yet highly competent the tall man who brought up the rear had black wavy hair and heavy eyebrows his face craggy and tanned there was an air of indifference about him as though he would have enjoyed a prison sentence with the same expectation as a tahitian holiday rojas was not fooled the mans penetrating eyes gave him away while the other two gazed around the hangar as they walked this man fixed rojas with a burning stare like the sun through twill magnifying glasses rojas stepped forward and saluted welcome to uruguay gentlemen colonel jose rojas at your service then he addressed himself to the tall man speaking in perfect english with a slight trace of cockney hed picked up from the british ive looked forward to meeting you since our phone conversation mr pitt pitt stepped between his friends and shook rojass hand thank you for taking the time to see us he turned and introduced the man with the glasses this is rudi gunn and the criminal type on my right is al giordino rojas gave a slight bow of the head and idly tapped his swagger stick against a neatly pressed pants leg please forgive the spartan surroundings but an army of world journalists have invaded our country like the plague since the hijacking i thought it more convenient to confer away from the horde a sound idea pitt agreed would you care to relax a bit after your long flight and dine at our air force officers club thank you for the invitation colonel said pitt graciously but if you dont mind wed like to get to it then if youll step this way ill brief you on our search operations inside the office ro as introduced captain ignacio flores who had coordinated the airsea hunt then he motioned the three americans to gather around a large table covered with nautical charts and satelliteimagery photos before he launched the briefing rojas looked at pitt solemnly i am sorry to hear your father was a passenger on board the ship when we spoke on thephone you didnt mention your relationship youre well informed said pitt ive been in hourly communication with your presidents security adviser youll be happy to know that the intelligence people in washington who briefed me on the situation praised your efficiency rojass official bearing crumbled he had not expected such a compliment he began to loosen up i regret i cant give you encouraging news no new evidence has turned up since you departed the united states i can however offer you a drink of our fine uruguayan brandy sounds good to me giordino said without hesitation especially on a rainy day rojas nodded to his aide lieutenant if you will do us the honors then the colonel leaned over the table and pieced together several enlarged blackandwhite satellite images until he had a mosaic of the waters stretching three hundred kilometers off the coast i take it youre all familiar with satellite imagery rudi gunn nodded numa currently has three satellite oceanography programs in progress to study currents eddys surface winds and sea ice but none are focusing on this section of the south atlantic said rojas most geographic information systems are aimed north yes youre quite right gunn adjusted his glasses and examined the photo blowups on the table i see youve used the earth resources tech satellite yes the landsat and you used a powerful graphic system to show ships at sea we had a piece of luck rojas continued the polar orbit of the satellite takes it over the sea off uruguay only once every sixteen days it arrived at a most opportune time the landsats primary use is for geological survey said gunn the cameras are usually shut down when it orbits over the oceans to conserve energy how did you get the images immediately after the search was ordered explained rojas our meteorological defense section was alerted to provide weather forecasts for the patrol boats and aircraft one of the meteorologists had an inspiration and checked the landsats orbit and found it would pass over the search area he sent an urgent request to your government to turn it on the cameras were engaged with an hour to spare and the signals sent to a receiving station in buenos aires could a target the size of the lady flamborough show up on a landsat image asked giordino you wont see detail like you would in a highresolution photo from a defense intelligence satellite replied pitt but she should be as visible as a pinprick you described her perfectly said rojas see for yourselves he set a large magnified viewing lens with an interior light over a tiny section of the satellite photo mosaic then he stood back pitt was the first to look i can make out two no three vessels we have identified all three rojas turned and nodded to captain flores who began to read aloud from a sheet of paper struggling with his english as if reciting in front of a class the largest ship is a chilean ore carrier the cabo gallegos bound from punta arenas to dakar with a load of coal the northbound vessel just coming into view on the bottom edge of the image asked pitt yes flores agreed that is the cabo gallegos the one opposite on the top is southbound shes of mexican registry a container ship the general bravo carrying supplies and oildrilling equipment to san pablo wheres san pablo asked giordino a small port city on the tip of argentina replied rojas there was an oil strike there last year the vessel between them and closer toward shore is the lady flamborough flores spoke the cruise liners name as if he were giving a eulogy rojass aide appeared with the bottle of brandy and five glasses the colonel raised his and said saludos salute the americans acknowledged pitt took a large sip that he swore later incinerated his tonsils and resumed his study of the tiny dot for several seconds before giving up the viewing glass to gunn i cant make out her heading after sneaking out of punta del este she sailed due east without a course change youve been in contact with the other ships flores nodded neither one reported seeing her what time did the satellite pass over the exact time was hours the imagery was infrared yes the guy who thought of using the landsat ought to get a medal said giordino as he took his turn at the viewer a promotion is already in channels rojas said smiling pitt looked at the colonel what time did your aerial reconnaissance get off the ground our aircraft began searching at first light by noon we had received and analyzed the landsat imagery we then could calculate the speed and course of the lady flamborough and direct our ships and planes to an interception point but they found an empty sea quite right no wreckage captain flores spoke up our patrol boats did run on several pieces of debris was it identified some was pulled on board and examined but quickly discarded it appeared to have come from a cargo ship rather than a luxury cruise liner what sort of debris flores checked through a briefcase and removed a thin file i have a short inventory received from the captain of the search vessel he lists one worn overstaffed chair two faded lifejackets at least fifteen years old with operation instructions stenciled in almost illegible spanish several unmarked wooden crates a bunk mattress food containers three newspapers one from veracmz mexico the other two from recife brazil dates pitt interrupted flores looked questioningly at pitt for a moment and then he averted his gaze the captain did not give them an oversight that will be corrected said rojas sternly immediately picking up on pitts thoughts if it isnt already too late flores came back uneasily you must admit colonel the debris appears to be trash not ships wreckage could you plot the coordinates of the ships as theyre shown on the satellite photo asked pitt hores nodded and began plotting the positions on to a nautical chart another brandy gentlemen rojas offered its quite vibrant said gunn holding out his glass to the lieutenant i detect a very slight coffee flavor rojas smiled i can see youre a connoisseur mr gunn quite right my uncle distills it on his coffee plantation too sweet said giordino reminds me of licorice it also contains anisette rojas turned to pitt and you mr pitt how do you taste it pitt held up the glass and studied it under the light id say about two hundred proof north americans never ceased to amaze rojas all business one moment complete jesters the next he often wondered how they built such a superpower then pitt laughed his infectious laugh only kidding tell your uncle if he ever exports it to the us ill be the first in line to distribute it flores threw down his dividers and tapped a penciled box on the chart they were here at yesterday morning everyone moved back to the table and hovered over the chart all three were on converging courses all right observed gunn he took a small calculator from his pocket and began punching its buttons if i make a rough estimate of speeds say about thirty knots for the lady flamborough eighteen for the cabo gallegos and twentytwo for the general bravo his voice trailed off as he made notations on the edge of the chart after several moments he stood back and tapped the figures with a pencil not surprising the chilean coal carrier didnt make visual contact she would have crossed the cruise liners bow a good sixtyfour kilometers to the east pitt stared thoughtfully at the lines across the chart the mexican container ship on the other hand looks as if she missed the lady flamborough by no more than three or four kilometers not surprising said rojas when you consider the cruise liner was running without lights pitt looked at flores do yourecall the phase of the moon captain yes between new moon and first quarter a crescent giordino shook his head not bright enough if the bridge watch wasnt looking in the right direction i assume you launched the search from this point said pitt flores nodded yes the aircraft flew grids two hundred miles to the east north and south and found no sign of her only the container ship and the ore carrier she might have doubled back and then cut north or south suggested gunn we thought of that too said flores the aircraft cleared all western approaches toward land when they returned for fuel and went out again considering the facts said gunn ominously i fear the only place the lady flamborough could have gone is down take her last position rudi and figure how far she might have sailed before the search planes arrived rojas stared at pitt with interest may i ask what you intend to do further search would be useless the entire surface where she vanished has been swept pitt seemed to stare through rojas as though the colonel were transparent like the man just said the only place she could have gone is down and thats precisely where were going to look how can i be of service the sounder a numa deepwater research ship should arrive in the general search area sometime this evening wed be grateful if you could spare a helicopter to shuttle us out to her rojas nodded i will arrange to have one standing by then he added you realize you nlight as well be hunting one particular fish in ten thousand square kilometers of sea it could take you a lifetime no said pitt confidently twenty hours on the outside rojas was a pragmatic man wishful thinking was foreign to him he looked at giordino and gunn expecting to see skepticism mirrored in their eyes instead he saw only complete agreement surely you cant believe such a fanciful time schedule he asked giordino held up a hand and casually studied his fingernails if experience is any judge he replied placidly dirk has overestimated exactly fourteen hours and fortytwo minutes after the uruguayan army helicopter set them on the landing pad of the sounder they found a shipwreck matching the lady flamboroughs dimensions in meters of water on the discovery pass the target showed up as a tiny dark speck on a flat plain below the continental slope as the sounder moved in closer the sonar operator decreased the recording range until the shadowy image of a ship became a discernible shape the sounder did not carry the fivemilliondollar viewing system pitt and giordino had enjoyed on the polar explorer no color video cameras were mounted on the trailing sonar sensor the mission of her oceanographic scientists was purely to map large sections of the sea bottom her electronic gear was designed for distance and not closeup detail of manmade sunken objects same configuration all right said gunn pretty vague could be my imagination but she appears to have a sweptback funnel on her stern superstructure her sides look high and straight shes sitting upright no more than a tendegree list giordino held back well have to get cameras on her to make a positive id pitt said nothing he kept watching the sonar recording long after the target slipped behind the sounders stern any hope of finding his father alive was draining away he felt as though he was staring at a coffin as dirt was being thrown on the lid nice going pal giordino said to him you laid us right on the dime how did you know where to look asked frank stewart skipper of the sounder i gambled the lady flamborough didnt change her heading after crossing the inside path of the general bravo pitt explained and since she wasnt spotted by search aircraft beyond the outside course of the cabo gallegos i decided the best place to concentrate our search was on a track extending east from her lastknown heading as shown by the landsat in short a narrow corridor running between the general bravo and the cabo gallegos said giordino that about sums it up pitt acknowledged gunn looked at him im sorry its not an occasion to celebrate do you want to send down an rov asked stewart we can save time answered pitt by skipping a remote camera survey and going direct to a manned probe also the submersibles manipulator arms may be useful if we need to lift anything from the wreck the crew can have the deep rover ready to descend in half an hour said stewart you going to act as operator pitt nodded ill take her down at a thousand meters youll be right at the edge of its depth rating not to worry said rudi gunn the deep rover has a fourtoone safety factor at that depth id sooner go over niagara falls in a volkswagen said the captain than go down a thousand meters in a plastic bubble stewart narrowshouldered with slickeddown burnttoastbrown hair looked like a smalltown feedstore merchant and scoutmaster a seasoned seaman he could swim but was leery of the deep and refused to learn to dive he catered to the scientists requests and whims concerning their oceanographic projects as in any businessclient relation remote operated vehicle tetherrd underwater viewing system ship but the ship operation was his domain and any aca demic type who played long john silver with his crew was cut off at the knees in short order that plastic bubble said pitt is an acrylic sphere over twelve centimeters thick im happy to sit on deck in the sunshine and wave goodbye to anyone who takes the plunge in that contraption stewart muttered as he walked through the door i like him said giordino moodily utterly lacking in savoir faire but i like him you two have something in common pitt said grinning gunn froze an image of the wreck on videotape from the sonar recording and studied it thoughtfully he slid his glasses over his forehead and refocused his eyes the hull looks intact no sign of breakup why in hell did she sink better yet mused giordino why no flotsam pitt stared at the blurred image too remember the cyclops she was lost without a trace too how can we forget her giordino groaned we still carry the scars gunn looked up at him in all fairness you cant compare a poorly laden ship built around the turn of the century with a modern cruise liner carrying a thousand builtin safety features no storm put her down there said pitt maybe a rogue wave or maybe some sand kicker blew her bottom out said giordino well know soon enough pitt said quietly in another two hours well be sitting on her main deck the deep rover looked like shed be more at home orbiting space than cruising the depths of the ocean she had a shape only a martian could love the centimeter sphere was divided by a large oring and sat on rectangular pods that held the volt batteries all sorts of strange appendages sprouted from behind the sphere thrusters and motors oxygen cylinders carbon dioxide removal canisters docking mechanism camera systems scanning sonar unit but it was the manipulators that extended in the front that would have made any selfrespecting robot green with envy simply de bed vaey were mechanical arms and hands with a canny way of doing everything flesh and bone could do and then some a sensory feedback system made it possible to control the hand and arm movements to within thousandths of a centimeter while force feedback allowed the hands to delicately hold a cup and saucer or grab and lift an iron stove pitt and giordino patiently circled the deep rover while she was fussed over by a pair of engineers she sat on a cradle inside a cavernous chamber called the moon pool the platform holding her cradle was part of the sounders hull and could be lowered twenty feet into the sea one of the engineers finally nodded shes ready when you are pitt slapped giordino on the back after you okay ill handle the manipulators and cameras he said jovially you drive only mind the rushhour traffic you tell him yelled stewart from an overhead balcony his voice echoing inside the chamber bring it back in one piece and ill give you a great big kiss me too giordino yelled back going along with the joke you too can i take out my dentures take out anything you want you call that an incentive pitt said dryly he was grateful to the captain for trying to take his mind off what they might find i may make a beeline for africa rather than come back here youll need an extra truckload of oxygen said stewart gunn walked up oblivious to the goodnatured exchange a pair of earphones clamped to his head with the cable dangling at his leg he tried to keep his instructions businesslike but compassion crept into his voice ill be monitoring your audio locator beacon and communications soon as you see bottom make a threehundredandsixtydegree sweep until your sonar picks out the wreck then give me your heading i expect you to keep me informed every step of the way pitt shook gunns hand well stay in touch gunn stared up at his old friend bleakly you sure you wouldnt rather stay topside and let me go down ive got to see for myself good luck gunn murmured and then he quickly turned away and mounted a ladder leading from the moon pool pitt and giordino settled into the sidebyside aircraftstyle armchairs the engineers swung the top half of the sphere closed against the watertight oring and tightened the clamps giordino began going through the predive checklist power power on affirmed pitt raho are we coming in rudi loud and clear gunn answered oxygen twentyonepointfive percent when they finished giordino said ready when you are sounder youre cleared for takeoff deep rover stewart replied in his usual ironic tone bring back a lobster for dinner two divers stood by in full gear as the platform was slowly lowered into the sea the water surged around the deep rover and soon enveloped the sphere pitt looked up into the shimmering lights of the moon pool and saw the wavering figures leaning over the balconies the entire company of oceanographers and crew turned out for the dive hovering around gunn and listening to the reports from the sub pitt felt like a fish on display in an aquarium when they were fully submerged the divers moved in and unhitched the submersible from its cradle one of them held up a hand and gave an okay sign pitt smiled and answered with a thumbs up and then pointed ahead the handgrips on the end of the amirests guided the manipulators while the armrests themselves controlled the four sters pitt took a deep breath and controled the rover as if he were a helicopter pilot a slight pressure on his elbows and she rose off the cradle then he pushed his arms forward and the horizontal stablizers eased her ahead pitt moved the little craft off the platform about thirty meters and stopped to assess his compass bearing then he engaged the vertical thrusters and began the descent down down the deep rover fell through the dimensionless void the darkening water burying her in its depths the vibrant bluegreen of the surface soon turned to a soft gray a small onemeter blue shark swam effortlessly toward the sub circled once and finding nothing inviting continued its lonely journey into the fluid haze they felt no sense of movement the only sound came from the soft crackle of the radio and the pinging of the locator beacon the water became a curtain of black surrounding their small circle of light passing four hundred meters pitt reported as calnay as a pilot announcing his flight altitude four hundred meters gunn repeated ordinarily the wit and the sarcasm would have bounced off the interior of the submersible to pass the time but this trip pitt and giordino were strangely silent seldom during the descent did their conversation run more than a few words theres a real sweetheart said giordino pointing pitt saw it at the same time one of the ugliest of the deeps resident citizens long eelshaped body outlined by luminescence like a neon sign the frozen gaping jaws were never fully closed kept apart by long jagged teeth that were used more for entrapping prey than for chewing them one eye gleamed nastily while a tube that was attached to a luniinated beard dangled from its lower jaw to lure the next meal howd you like to stick your arm in that thing asked pitt before giordino could answer gunn broke in one of the scientists wants to know what you saw a dragonfish pitt replied he wants a description said giordino tell him well draw a picture when we come home pitt grunted ill pass the word passing eight hundred meters pitt reported mind you dont smack the bottom gunn warned him well keep an eye peeled neither of us is keen on making a oneway trip never hurts to have a worrywart on your side hows your oxygen on the money you should be getting close pitt slowed the deep rovers descent with a light touch of the sliding armrest giordino peered downward his eyes watchful for a sign of rocks pitt could have sworn his friend never blinked in the next eight minutes it took for the seabed to gradually materialize below were down giordino announced depth onethousand fifteen meters pitt applied extra power to the vertical sters bringing the submersible to a hovering stop three meters above the gray silt due to the water pressure the weight of the craft had increased during the descent pitt turned one of the ballast tank valves keeping an eye on the pressure gauge and filled it with just enough air to achieve neutral buoyancy making our sweep he notified gunn the wreck should bear approximately one one zero degrees gunns voice crackled back affirmative i read you said pitt we have a sonar target two hundred twenty meters bearing one one two degrees i copy deep rover pitt turned to giordino well let us see what we shall see he increased the power on the horizontal thrusters and executed a sweeping bank studying the barren seascape ahead as giordino kept him on track by reading off the compass heading come left a couple of points too much okay youve got it keep her straight there was not a flicker of emotion in pitts eyes his face was strangely still he wondered with a growing fear what he might find he recalled the haunting story of a diver salvaging a ferry that had sunk after a collision the diver was working the wreck at onehundred meters when he felt a tap on his shoulder he swung around and was confronted by the body of a beautiful girl who was staring at him through sightless eyes one arm extended and touching him as if asking to take her hand the diver had nightmares for years afterward pitt had seen bodies before frozen as the crew of the serapis bloated and grotesque as the crew of the presidential yacht eagle decayed and halfdissolved in sunken airplanes off iceland and a lake in the colorado rockies he could still close his eyes and visualize them all he hoped to god he wouldnt see his father as a floating corpse he shut his eyes for a few moments and almost ran the deep rover into the bottom pitt wanted to remember the senator as alive and vibrantnot as a ghostly thing in the sea or a ridiculously made up stiff in a casket object in the silt to the right giordino said jolting pitt from his morbid thoughts pitt leaned forward a twohundredliter drum three more off to the left theyre all over the place said giordino looks like a junkyard down here see any markings only some stenciled lettering in spanish probably weight and volume information ill move closer to the one dead ahead a trace of whatever was in them is still rising to the surface pitt edged the deep rovers sphere to within a few inches of the sunken drum the lights showed a dark substance curling from the drain hole oil said giordino pitt shook his head the color is more nistlike no wait its red by god its an oilbase red paint theres another cylindrical object next to it what do you make of it id say its a big roll of plastic sheeting id say youre right might not be a bad idea to take it aboard the sounder for examination hold position ill grab it with the manipulators pitt nodded silently and held the deep rover steady against the gentle bottom current giordino clutched the handgrip controls and curled the arm assemblies around the plastic roll much like a human would bend both elbows to embrace a friend next he positioned the fourfunction hands so they gripped the bottom edge shes secure he announced give us a little vertical thrust to pull it out of the sillt pitt complied and the deep rover slowly rose carrying the roll with her followed by a swirling cloud of fine silt for a few moments they couldnt see then pitt eased the submersible ahead until they broke into clear water again we should be coming up on her said giordino sonar shows a massive target in front and slightly to the right we show you to be practically on top of her said gunn like a ghostly image in a darkened mirror the ship rose out of the gloom magnified by the water distortion she seemed a staggering sight we have visual contact giordino reported pitt slowed the deep rover to a stop seven meters from the hull then he maneuvered the sub up and alongside the derelicts foredeck what the hell pitt broke off suddenly then rudi what colors were on the lady flamborough hold on no more than ten seconds elapsed before gunn answered light blue hull and superstructure this ship has a red hull with white upperworks gunn did not reply immediately when he did his voice sounded old and tired im sorry dirk we must have stumbled on a missing world war two ship that was torpedoed by a uboat cant be muttered giordino distantly this wreck is pristine no sign of growth or corrosion i can see oil and air bubbles escaping she cant be more than a week old negative stewarts voice came over the radio the only ship reported missing during the last six months in this part of the atlantic is your cruise liner this aint no cruise ship giordino shot back hold for a minute said pitt im going to come around the stern and see if we can make an identification he threw the deep rover into a steep bank and glided parali lel to the ships side when they reached the stern he spun sideways to a halt the sub hung there motionless only one meter from the name of the ship painted on beaded welding oh my god giordino whispered in incredulous awe weve been conned pitt did not sit there in stunned disbelief he grinned like a madman the puzzle was far from complete but the vital pieces had fallen into place the white raised letters on the red steel plates did not read lady flamborough they read general bravo from four hundred meters her designers and shipbuilders would not have recognized the lady flamborough her funnel had been reconstructed and every square inch of her repainted to complete the facade the hull was streaked with simulated rust her oncebeautiful superstructure stateroom windows and promenade deck were now hidden by great sheets of fiberboard assembled to look like cargo containers where the cruise liners modern rounded bridge featurrs were impossible to remove or hide they were squared with wooden frwnework and canvas and painted with fake hatches and portholes before the lights of punta del este had dropped astern every crew member and passenger was drafted into forced labor parties and driven to the point of exhaustion by ammars armed hijackers the ships officers cruise directors the stewards chefs and waiters and ordinary deckhandsthey all hammered and slaved at assembling the prefabricated containers through the night none of the vip guests was spared senator pitt and hala kamfl presidents hasan and de lorenzo along with their cabinet members and staff aides were all pressed into service as carpenters and painters by the time the cruise liner rendezvoused with the general bravo the counterfeit cargo containers were in place and the ship sported a nearly identical configuration and color scheme from the waterline up the newly disguised lady flamborough could have easily passed as the container ship an overhead inspection from the air would have revealed few discrepancies only a close examination from the sea might have detected obvious differences captain juu machado and eighteen crewmen from the general bravo transferred to the cruise liner after opening all seacocks and cargo doors and detonating strategically placed charges throughout the hull with a series of muffled explosions the container ship slipped beneath the sea with only a few faint gurgles of protest when the eastern sky began to brighten with a new sun the disguised lady flamborough was steaming south toward the advertised destination of the general bravo but when the port of san pablo argentina was forty kilometers off the starboard beam the liner bypassed the port and continued due south ammars ingenious scheme had worked three days had passed and the world was still fooled into believing the lady flamborough and her distinguished passengers were lying somewhere on the bottom of the sea ammar sat at a chart table and marked the ships latest position then he drew a straight line to his final destination and marked it with an x smugly complacent he dropped the pencil and lit a long dunhill cigarette exhaling the smoke across the chart like a bank of mist sixteen hours he reckoned sixteen more hours of sailing time without pursuit and the ship would be securely hidden without the slightest chance of detection captain machado stepped into the chart room from the bridge balancing a small tray on one hand would you like a cup of tea and a croissant he asked in fluent english thank you captain come to think of it i havent eaten since we departed punta del este machado set the tray on the table and poured the tea i know you havent slept since my crew and i came on board there is still much to do perhaps we should begin by formally introducing ourselves i know who you are or at least the name you go by said ammar indifferently im not interested in lengthy biographies thats how it is yes mind letting me in on your plans said machado i was informed of nothing beyond our transfer to your ship after scuttling the general bravo id be most interested in hearing about the next step of the mission especially the part on how our combined crews intend to abandon the ship and evade arrest by international military forces sorry ive been too busy to enlighten you now might be a good time machado pressed characteristically ammar calmly sipped at his tea and finished off the croissant beneath his mask before answering then he looked across the chart table at machado without expression i dont intend to abandon the ship just yet he said evenly my instructions from your leader and mine are to mark time and delay the final destruction of the lady flamborough until they both have time to assess the situation and turn it to their advantage slowly machado relaxed looked through the mask into the cold dark eyes of the egyptian and he knew this was a man solidly in control i have no problem with that he held up the pot more tea ammar passed his cup what do you do when youre not sinking ships i specialize in political assassinations said machado conversationally the same as you suleiman aziz ammar machado could not see the wary frown behind ammars mask but he knew it was there you were sent to kill me ammar asked casually flicking an ash from his cigarette while lining up a tiny automatic pistol that suddenly appeared in his palm like a magic trick machado smiled and crossed his arms keeping his hands in open view you can relax my orders were to work in total harmony with you animar replaced the gun in a springoperated device under his right sleeve how do you know me our leaders have few secrets between them damn yazid ammar thought angrily yazid had betrayed him by giving away his identity he wasnt taken in for an instant by machados lie once president hasan was out of the way the reincarnated muhammad had no further use for his hired killer ammar was not about to reveal his escape plans to the mexican hit man he clearly realized his counterpart had no option but to form an alliance of expediency ammar was quite comfortable in knowing he could kill machado at any time while the mexican had to wait until survival was assured ammar knew exactly where he stood he raised his teacup to akhmad yazid machado stiffly raised his to topiltzin hala and senator pitt had been locked in a suite along with president hasan they were grimy and splattered with paint too exhausted to sleep their hands were blistered and their muscles ached from physical labor none had been conditioned for and they were hungry after the frenzied remodeling of the cruise liners outer structure since leaving uruguay the hijackers had not allowed them any food their only liquid intake came from the faucet in the bathroom and to make their condition worse the temperature had been steadily dropping and no heat was coming through the ventilators president hasan was stretched out on one of the beds in abject misery he suffered from a chronic back problem and the strain from ten hours of uninterrupted bending and stretching had left him in a torrent of pain which he endured stoically for all the movement they made hala and the senator might have been carved from wood hala sat at a table with her head lowered in her hands even in her disheveled state she still looked serene and beautffid senator pitt reclined on a couch staring pensively at a light fixture in the ceiling only his eyes showed that he was alive finally hala raised her head and looked at him if only we could do something she said barely above a whisper the senator rose stiffly to a sitting position for his age he was still in good physical shape he was sore from neck to feet but his he was beat as soundly as if he was twenty years younger that devil with the mask doesnt miss a trick he said he wont feed us so well stay weak everyone is locked away separately so we cant communicate or cooperate in a countertakeover and he and his terrorists have not made any contact with us for two days all calculated to keep us on edge and in a state of helplessness cant we at least try to get out of here theres probably a guard at the end of the hallway waiting to blast the first body that breaks through a door and even if we somehow got past him where could we go maybe we could steal a lifeboat hala suggested wildly the senator shook his head and smiled too late for any attempt now not with the hijackers force doubled by the crew from that mexican cargo ship suppose we break out the window and leave a trail with furniture bed linen or whatever else we could throw out hala persisted might as well toss bottles with notes inside the currents would carry them a hundred kilometers from our wake by morning he paused to shake his head searchers would never find them in time you know as well as i senator no one is looking for us the outside world thinks our ship sank and everyone died search efforts would have been called off by now i know one man who will never give up she looked at him questioningly who my son dirk hala rose and iimped over to the window and stared vacantly at the outside fiberboard that hid her view of the sea you must be very proud of him hes a brave and resourceful man but only human hell never see through the deception she paused suddenly and peered down through a tiny crack that showed a brief span of water theres something drifting past the ship the senator came over and stood beside her he could just make out several white objects against the blue of the sea ice he said stunned that explains the cold we must be heading into the antarctic hala sagged against him and buried her face in his chest well never be rescued now she murmured in helpless resignation no one will think to look for us there no one knew the sounder could drive so hard her decks trembled with the straining throb of her engines and the hull shuddered as it pounded into the swells launched at a shipyard in boston during the summer of she had spent almost three decades chartering out to oceanographic schools for deepwater research projects in every sea of the world after her purchase by numa in she had been completely overhauled and refitted her new horsepower diesel engine was designed to push her at a maximum of fourteen knots but stewart and his engineers somehow coaxed seventeen out of her the sounder was the only ship on the trail of the lady flamborough and she stood as much chance of closing the gap as a basset hound after a leopard warships of the argentine navy and british naval units stationed in the falkjand islands might have intercepted the fleeing cruise ship but they were not alerted after pitts coded message to admiral sandecker announcing the astonishing discovery of the general bravo instead of the lady flamborough the joint chiefs of staff and the white house intelligence chiefs strongly advised the president to order a tight security lid on the revelation until us special operations forces could reach the area and coordinate a rescue so the old sounder surged through the sea alone and without any high official authority her crew of seamen d scientists caught up in the mad excitement of the chase pitt and giordino sat in the ships dining room studying a chart of the extreme south atlantic ocean that gunn had laid out on the table and pinned down with coffee cups youre convinced they headed south gunn said to pitt a uturn to the north would have put the liner back in the search grid explained pitt and theres no way they would have swung west toward the coastline of argentina they might have made a run for the open sea with a threeday lead they could be halfway to africa by now added giordino too risky said pitt whoever is running the show doesnt lack for gray matter turning east across the ocean would have laid the ship open to exposure by search aircraft and any passing vessels no his only option to avoid undue suspicion was to continue on the general bravos advertised course to san pablo on tierra del fuego but the port authorities would have blown the whistle when the container ship was overdue insisted giordino dont underestimate this guy what do you want to bet he signaled the san pablo harbor master and said the general bravo was running late due to engine breakdown a neat touch agreed giordino he could easily gain another fortyeight hours okay said gunn whats left where does he go there are a thousand uninhabited islands he could get lost in around the straits of magellan or giordino hung on the orhe might sail to the antarctic where he figures no one will search were all talking in the present tense said pitt for all we know hes already moored in some deserted cove were on to his tricks now said gunn the landsat cameras will be activated on its next pass over and the lady flamborough alias general bravo will be revealed in all her glory giordino looked at pitt for comment but his old friend was staring off into space he had picked up on pitts habit of tuning out and knew the signs all too well pitt was no longer on the sounder he was on the bridge of the lady flamborough attempting to get inside the head of his adversary it wasnt an easy chore the man who ramrodded the hijacking had to be the shrewdest customer pitt had ever come up against hes aware of that pitt said finally aware of what gunn asked curiously the fact he can be detected by satellite photographs then he knows he can run but he cant hide i think he can id like to know how pitt stood and stretched im going to take a little walk you didnt answer my question gunn was anxious now impatient pitt swayed and balanced his body with the rock of the ship and looked down at gunn with a half grin if i were him he said as if talking about a man he knew well id make the ship disappear a second time gunns mouth dropped open as giordino gave him an i told you so look but before he could probe further pitt had exited the dining room pitt made his way aft and dropped down a ladder to the moon pool he walked around the deep rover and stopped in front of the large roll of plastic sheeting they had pulled up from the bottom it stood on end nearly as tall as pitt and was secured by ropes against a stanchion he stared at it for nearly five minutes before he rose and patted it with one hand intuition an intuition that grew into a certainty put a look that could be best described as pure machiavellian in his eyes he spoke a single word uttered under his breath so softly that an engineer standing only a few meters away at a workbench didnt hear him gotcha a flood of information on what became known as the flamborough crisis poured through teletype and computer into the pentagons military command center the state departments seventh floor operations center and the war games room in the old executive office building from each of these strategy tanks the data were assembled and analyzed with almost lightning speed then the condensed version fused with recommendations was rushed to the situation room located in the white house basement for final assessment the president dressed casually in slacks and a woolen turtleneck entered the room and sat at one end of the long conference table after being updated on the situation he would ask for options from his advisers for appropriate action though final decisions were his alone he was heavily reinforced by crisismanagement veterans who labored in search of a policy consensus and stood ready to carry it out once he gave it his stamp of approval despite dissenting opinions the intelligence reports from egypt were mostly all bad a state of anarrhy was in full swing the situation was deteriorating by the hour the police and military forces remained in their barracks while thousands of akhmad yazids followers staged strikes and boycotts throughout the country the only shred of good news was that the demonstrations were not marked by violence secretary of state douglas oates briefly examined a report that was placed in front of him by an aide thats all we need he muttered the president looked at him expectantly in silence the muslim rebels have just stormed and taken cairos major tv station any appearance by yazid still a noshow cia chief brogan walked over from one of the computer monitors the latest intelligence says hes still holed up in his villa outside alexandria waiting to form a new government by acclamation shouldnt be long now the president sighed wearily what stance are the israeli ministers taking oates neatly stacked some papers as he spoke strictly a waitandsee attitude they dont picture yazid as an immediate threat theyll change their tune when he tears up the camp david peace accord the president turned and coldly stared into brogans eyes can we take him out yes brogans answer was flat emphatic how in the event it comes back to haunt your administration mr president i respectfully suggest you dont know the president bowed his head slightly in agreement youre probably right still you cant do the job unless i give the order i strongly urge you not to resort to assassination said oates doug oates is right said julius schiller it could boomerang if word leaked out youd be considered fair game by middle east terrorist leaders not to mention the uproar from congress added dale nichols who sat midway down the table and the press would murder you the president thoughtfully weighed the consequences then he finally nodded all right so long as yazid hates soviet premier antonov as much as he does me well put his demise on the back burner for now but bear this in mind gentlemen im not about to take half the crap from this nut that khomeini dished out to my predecessors brogan scowled but an expression of relief was exchanged between oates and schiller nichols merely puffed contentedly on his pipe the actors in the drama were strong men with definite and often conflicting viewpoints victory came easy but defeat smoldered the president shifted the agenda any late word on mexico the situation is uncomfortably quiet answered brogan no demonstrations no rioting topiltzin appears to be playing the same waiting game as his brother the president looked up puzzled did i hear you correctly you said brother brogan tilted his head toward nichols dale made a good call yazid and topiltzin are brothers who are neither egyptian nor mexican by birth youve definitely proven a family connection schiller interrupted in astonishment you have proof our operatives obtained and matched their genetic codes this is the first ive heard about it said a stunned president you should have informed me sooner the final documentation is still being evaluated and will be sent over from langley shortly im sorry mr president at the risk of sounding overly cautious i didnt want to throw out such a shocking discovery until we had gathered solid evidence how in hell did you get their genetic codes asked nichols both those guys are vain promoters explained brogan our forgery department sent a koran to yazid and a photograph to topiltzin showing him in full aztec regalia along with requests begging them in each to inscribe a short prayer on both items and return them actually it was a bit more complicated writing the requests in the handwriting of known adoring followersinfluential followers with financial and political clout i might add both fell for it the tricky part was intercepting the return mail before it reached the correct addresses the next problem was sifting out the several sets of fingerprints which accompanied each object aides secret agents whoever one thumbprint on the koran matched with a known set of yazids prints that were on file with egyptian police when he was arrested several years ago we then traced his dna from his fingerprint oils topiltzin was not so easy he had no record in mexico but the lab matched his code to his brothers from prints pulled from the photo then a chance find in the international criminal records at interpols pahs headquarters dealt us a straight flush it all came together what wed stumbled on was a family organization a crime dynasty that arose after world war two a billiondollar empire ruled by a mother and father five brothers and a sister who spearhead the operations and run by a network of uncles aunts cousins or whoever is related by blood or marriage this tight association has made it nearly impossible for international investigators to penetrate except for the click of the teletype machines and the hushed murmur of aides a stunned silence settled over the table brogan looked from nichols to schiller to oates to the president their name the president asked softly capesterre answered brogan roland and josephine capesterre are the father and mother their eldest son is robert or as we know him topiltzin the next brother in line is paul hes yazid yes i think wed be interested in hearing all you know said the president as ive stated said brogan i dont have all the facts at my fingertips such as the whereabouts of karl and marie the younger brother and sister or the names of associate relatives weve only scratched the surface from what i recall the capesterres are a traditionbound criminal family that began almost eighty years ago when the grandfather emigrated from france to the caribbean and launched a smuggling business moving stolen goods and bootleg booze to the us during prohibition at first he operated out of port of spain trinidad but as he prospered he bought a small nearby island and set up business there roland took over when the old man died and along with his wife josephinesome claim shes the brain behind the thronelost no time in expanding into drug trafficfirst they built their island into a legitimate banana plantation making a nice honest profit next they turned inventive and made a real killing by harvesting two crops the second marijuana was cultivated under the banana trees to avoid detection they also set up a refining lab on the island have i painted a clear picture yes the president said slowly we all see it clearly thank you martin they had it all worked out murmured schiller the capesterres produced manufactured and smuggled in one efficient operation and distributed brogan continued but interestingly not in the us they sold the dnigs only in europe and the far east are they still into narcotics asked nichols no brogan shook his head enough contacts they received a tip their private island was about to be raided by the joint west indies security forces the family burned the marijuana crop kept the banana plantation and began buying controlling interests in financially shaky corporations they became extremely successful in turning businesses around and showing staggering profits of course their unusual method of management might have had something to do with it nichols took the hook what was their system brogan grinned the capesterres relied on blackmail extortion and murder any time a competing company got in the way the corporate executive officers for some strange reason initiated merger negotiations with the capesteffe interests losing their collective asses on the deal naturally developers who hindered projects opposing lawyers with lawsuits unfriendly politicians they all came to know and love the capesterres or one sunny day their wives and kids had accidents their houses burned to the ground or they just up and vanished kind of like the mafia managing general motors or gulf and western said the president sardonically a fair comparison brogan nodded politely and continued now the family controls a vast worldwide conglomeration of financial and industrial enterprises worth an estimated twelve billion dollars billion as spelled with a b oates mumbled incredulously i may never attend church services again schiller shrugged wonderingly who said crime doesnt pay no wonder theyre pulling the strings in egypt and mexico said oates they must have bought blackmailed or strongarmed their way into every department of the government and military i begin to see how their scheme is coming together said the president but what i cant understand is how can the sons pass themselves off as nativeborn egyptians or mexicans no one can fool millions of people without somebody getting wise their mother was descended from black slaves which accounts for their dark skin brogan said in a patiently explaining tone we can only speculate about their past roland and josephine must have laid the groundwork forty or more years ago as their children were born they began a vigorous program of making over the boys into foreign nationals paul was no doubt tutored in arabic before he could walk while robert learned to speak in ancient aztec when the boys became older they probably attended private schools in both mexico and egypt under assumed names a grand plan muttered oates admiringly nothing so mundane as burying intelligence moles but infiltration at the very highest levels and with the image of a messiah thrown in for good measure sounds pretty diabolical to me said nichols i agree with doug said the president nodding at oates a grand plan training children from birth using untold wealth and power to set up a national takeover what were really looking at here is an incredible display of unbending doggedness and patience you have to give the bastards credit schiller admitted they stuck to their script until events swung in their favor now theyre within centimeters of ruling two of the third worlds leading countries we cant allow it to happen the president said bluntly if the brother in mexico becomes head of state and makes good his threat by driving two million of his countrymen across our borders i see no choice but to send in our armed forces i must caution against aggressive action said oates speaking like a secretary of state recent history has shown that invaders do not fare well assassinating yazid and topiltzin or whatever their names and launching an assault on mexico wont solve the longrange problem maybe not grunted the president but it will dam well give us time to ease the situation there may be another solution said nichols use the capesterres against themselves im listening said the president stress showing in the lines around his eyes please skip the riddles nichols looked at brogan for support these men were drug ckers they must be wanted criminals is that right yes on the first no on the second answered brogan theyre no petty street crooks the entire family has been under investigation for years no arrests no convictions theyve got a staff of corporate and criminal lawyers that would put washingtons biggest law office to shame theyve got friends and connections that go straight to the top of ten major governmentsyou want to pick up this bunch and put them on trial youd do better tearing down the pyramids with an ice pick then expose them to the world for the scum they are pursued nichols no good said the president any attempt will surely backlash as a lie and propaganda ploy nichols might have a direction said schiller quietly he was a man who listened more than he spoke all we need is a base that cant be cracked or shattered the president looked speculatively at schiller where are you leading julius the lady flamborough replied schiller his face carefully pensive come up with indisputable proof that yazid is behind the ships hijacking and we can crack the capesterre wall brogan nodded heavily the ensuing scandal would certainly be a step in stripping away yazids and topfltzins mystiques and opening the door to the familys countless criminal activities dont forget the world news media theyd have a shark feeding frenzy once they bit into the capestenes bloody past nichols belatedly winced at his unthinking pun youre all overlooking one important fact schiller said with a long sigh at the moment any tie between the ships disappearance and the capesterres is strictly circumstantial nichols frowned who else has motives for getting rid of presidents de lorenzo and hasan and hala kamil no one brogan said heatedly wait up the president said patiently julius has a sound point the hijackers are not acting like typical middle east terrorists they have yet to identify themselves theyve made no demands or threats nor have they used the crew and passengers as hostages for international blackmail im not ashamed to admit i find the silence nightmarish were faced with a different breed this time admitted brogan the capestenes are playing a waiting game hoping de lorenzos and hasans governments will fall in their absence any word on the cruise ship since george pitts son discovered the switch asked oates coolly steering the discussion clear of an impending confrontation somewhere off the east coast of tierra del fuego replied schiller sailing like hell to the south were tracking by satellite and should have her cornered by this time tomorrow the president didnt look happy the hijackers could have murdered everyone on board by then if they havent already said brogan what forces do we have in the area virtually none mr president answered nichols we have no call to maintain a presence that far south except for a few air force transport planes ferrying supplies to polar research stations the only us vessel anywhere near the lady flamborough is the sounder a numa deepwater survey ship the one carrying dirk pitt yes sir what about our special forces people i was on the phone with general keith at the pentagon twenty minutes ago schiller volunteered an elite team along with their equipment boarded c cargo jets and took off about an hour ago they were accompanied by a wing of osprey as ult aircraft the president sat back in the chair and folded his hands where will they set up their command post brogan called up a map displaying the tip of south america on a giant wall monitor he used a flashlight arrow to indicate a particular spot unless we receive new information that will alter the tentative plan he explained theyll land at an airport outside the small chilean city of punta arenas on the brunswick peninsula and use it as a base for operations a long flight said the president quietly when will they arrive inside fifteen hours the president looked at oates doug i leave it to you to handle any sovereignty issues with the chilean and argentine governments ill see to it the lady flamborough will have to be found before the special forces can launch a rescue attempt said schiller with remorseless logic were up the creek on this one there was a curious acceptance in brogans voice the closest carrier fleet is almost five thousand miles away no way a fullscale air and sea search can be mounted schiller stared at the table thoughtfully any rescue attempt could take weeks if the hijackers slip the lady flamborough in among the barren bays and coves along the antarctic coast line fog mist and low overcast wouldnt help matters either satellite surveillance is our only tool said nichols the predicament is that we have no spy satellites eyeballing that region of the earth dale is right schiller agreed the far southern seas are not high on the strategic surveillance list if we were turn northern hemisphere we could focus a whole array of listening and imagery gear to tune in conversations on board the ship and read a newspaper on deck whats available the president asked the landsat answered brogan a few defense meteorological satellites and a seasat used by numa for antarctic ice and sea current surveys but our best bet is the sr casper do we have sr reconnaissance aircraft in latin america a tight security airfield in texas is as close as we come how long to fly one down and back a casper is capable of reaching mach five or just under five thousand kilometers per hour one can fly to the tip of antarctica make a photo run and have the film back in five hours the president slowly shook his head in dismay will someone please tell me why the united states government is always caught with our pants down i swear to god nobody screws up like we do we build the most sophisticated detection systems the world has ever known and when we need them theyre all concentrated in the wrong place at the wrong time nobody spoke nobody moved the presidents men avoided his eyes and stared uncomfortably at the table papers wall anything but one anothers face at last nichols spoke in a quiet confident voice well find the ship mr president if anyone can get them out alive the special forces will yes the president drawled softly theyre highly trained for such a mission the only question in my mind is whether the crew and passengers will be there to be rescued or will the special forces find a silent ship filled with corpses colonel morton hollis wasnt overjoyed at leaving his family in the middle of his wifes birthday party the understanding look in her eyes wrenched his gut the cost would hit him dearly he knew the red coral necklace was about to be enhanced by the fiveday cruise to the bahamas shed always pestered him about he sat at a desk in a specially designed office compartment inside the c transport flying south over venezuela he puffed away deeply on a large havana cigar he had purchased at the base store now that the embargo on cuban imports had been lifted hollis studied the latest weather reports on the antarctic peninsula and peered at photographs showing the rugged icy coastline hed already been over the difficulfies in his mind a dozen times since takeoff during their brief history the newly formed special operations forces had already achieved a notable record but they had yet to tackle a major rescue of the magnitude of the lady flamborough hijacking the orphan child of the pentagon the special operations forces were not molded into a single command until the fall of at that time the armys delta force whose fighters were drawn from the elite ranger and green beret units and a secret aviation unit known as task force merged with the topoftheline navy seal team six and the air forces special operations wing the unified forces cut across service lines and boundaries and became a separate command numbering twelve thousand men headquartered at a tightly restricted base in southeast virginia the crack fighters were heavily trained in guerrilla tactics parachuting wilderness survival and scuba diving with special emphasis on storming buildings ships and aircraft for rescue missions hollis was shorthed barely met the height requirements of the special forcesand almost as wide in the shoulders as he was tall forty years old but immensely tough he had survived a rigorous simulated guerrilla war in the swamps of florida for three weeks and parachuted right back in for another exercise his closely cropped brown hair was dun and graying early his eyes were a bluegreen the whites slightly yellowed from too much time in the sun without proper glasses an astute man who always looked over the next hill and planned accordingly he left very little to chance he blew a smoke ring from the cigar with a degree of elation he couldnt be leading a better team if hed picked the medal winners of a military olympics they were the elite of the elite for fighting lowintensity conflicts the eighty men of his team who called themselves the demon stalkers were selected for the lady flamborough rescue because they actually had engaged in assault exercises against mock terrorists who had held a ship and crew hostages off the coast of norway forty were shooters while the other half acted as logistical and support fighters his second in command major john dillenger rapped on the door and stuck his head in you busy mort he asked in a decided texas twang hollis waved a casual hand my office is your office he assured dillenger jovially squeeze in and sit yourself in my new french leather designer couch dillenger a lean stringy man with a pinched face but hard as an anvil stared dubiously at the canvas seat bolted to the floor and sat down forever kidded about being saddled with the same name as the famous bank robber he was a master of the art of tactical planning and the penetration of almost impossible defenses covering the bases he asked hollis going over meteorological forecasts ice and terrain conditions see any jazz in your crystal ball too early hollis raised an eyebrow what plans are forming in your perverted mind i can recite and draw pictures of six different ways to board a ship by stealth ive already familiarized myself with the design and deck layout of the lady flamborough but until we learn whether were coming in by parachute by scuba or by foot from hard beach or ice i can only plot an outline hollis nodded solemnly over a hundred innocent people are on that ship two presidents and the secretarygeneral of the united nations god help us if one steps in our line of fire we cant go in with blanks dillenger said caustically no and we cant drop from noisy helicopters with all weapons blasting weve got to infiltrate before the hijackers know were there complete surprise is crucial then we hit em by stealth parachute at night could be hollis acknowledged tersely dillenger shifted uncomfortably in the canvas seat a night landing is dangerous enough but dropping blindly on a darkened ship can mean slaughter you know it and i know it mort out of forty men fifteen will miss the target and fall in the sea twenty will sustain injuries impacting on hard protruding surfaces of the ship ill be lucky to have five men in fighting trim we cant rule it out lets wait until more info comes in suggested dillenger everything hinges on where the ship is found whether shes moored or sailing across the sea makes all the difference in the world as soon as we receive word on her final status ill formulate a tight assault plan and lay it in your hands for final approval fair enough said hollis agreeably how are the men doing their homework by the time we land at punta arenas theyll have memorized the lady flamborough well enough to run around her decks blindfolded a lot is riding on them this time out theyll do the job the trick is to get them on board in one piece there is one thing hollis said a deep apprehension on his face the latest estimate from intelligence sources on the strength of the hijackers it just came in from the pentagon how many are we talking about five ten maybe twelve hollis hesitated assuming the crew of the mexican ore camer that boarded the cruise ship are also armed we could be looking at a total of forty dillenger gaped oh my gawd were going up against an equal number of terrorists looks that way hollis nodded grimly dillenger shook his head in shocked disapproval and drew a hand across his forehead then his eyes burned into holliss some people he said disgustedly are going to get their butts stomped before this caper is over deep in a concrete bunker tunneled into a hill outside washington dc lieutenant samuel t jones came rushing into a large office panting as though hed just run a twohundredmeter dash which indeed he hadonly two steps shy of the exact distance from the communications room to the photoanalysis office his face was flushed with excitement and he held a huge photograph spread between his upraised hands jones had often rushed along the corridors during crisis exercise drills but he and the other three hundred men and women who worked in the special operations forces readiness command hadnt really put their hearts into it until now practice did not make the adrenaline pump like the real thing after waiting like hibernating groundhogs they had erupted into life when the alert on the lady flamborough hijacking came in from the pentagon major general frank dodge headed up the sof he and several members of his staff were tensely awaiting the arrival of the latest satellite image depicting the waters south of tierra del fuego when jones burst into the room got it dodge gave the young officer a stern look for unmilitary enthusiasm should have been here eight minutes ago he grunted my fault general i took the liberty of trimming the outer perimeters and enlarging the immediate search area before having it computerenhanced dodges stern expression softened and he nodded approvingly good thinking lieutenant jones gave a short sigh and quickly clipped the newest satellite image on a long wallboard under a row of hooded spotlights an earlier image hung nearby showing the lady flamboroughs last known position circled in red her previous course marked in green and predicted course in orange jones stepped back as general dodge and his officers crowded around the image peering anxiously for the tiny dot indicating the cruise ship the last satellite sighting put the ship about one hundred kilometers south of cape horn said a major tracing the course from the previous chart she should be well out into drakes passage by now approaching the islands off the antarctic peninsula after nearly a full minute of appraisal general dodge turned to jones did you study the photo lieutenant no sir i didnt take the time i rushed it over as quickly as possible youre certain this is the latest transmission jones looked puzzled yes sir no mistake none jones replied unhesitatingly the numa seasat satellite recorded the area with digital electronic impulses that were sent to ground stations instantaneously youre seeing an image no more than six minutes old when will the next photo come in the landsat should orbit the region in forty minutes and the casper jones glanced at his watch if she returns on schedule we should be looking at film in four hours get it to me the instant it arrives yes sir dodge turned to his subordinates well gentlemen the white house aint going to like this he went over and picked up a phone put me through to alan merger the national security advisers voice came over the line within twenty seconds i hope youve got some good news frarik sorry no dodge answered flatly it appears the cruise ship she sank mercier cut him off we cant say with any certainty what are you saying dodge took a breath please inform the president the lady flamborough has vanished again by the early s equipment for sending photographs or graphics around the world by nucrowave via satellite or across town by fiber optics became as common in business and government offices as copy machines scanned by laser and then transmitted to a laser receiver the image could be reproduced almost instantly in living color with extraordinary detail so it was that within ten minutes of general dodges call the president and dale nichols were hunched over the desk in the oval office scrutinizing the seasat image of waters off the tip of south america she may really be on the bottom this time said nichols he felt tired and confused i dont believe it the president said his face a mask of repressed fury the hijackers had their chance to destroy the ship off punta del este and make a clean getaway on the general bravo why sink her now escape by submarine is a possibility the president seemed not to hear our inability to deal with this crisis is frightening our whole response seems mired in inertia we were caught unprepared and unequipped nichols offered lamely an event that occurs too frequently around here the president muttered he looked up fire in his eyes i refuse to write those people off i owe george pitt without his support i wouldnt be sitting in the oval office he paused for effect were not going to snap at a red herring again sid green was scrutinizing the satellite images too a photointelligence specialist with the national security agency at its headquarters in fort meyer he had projected the last two satellite pictures on one screen intrigued he ignored the most recent photo the one that failed to reveal the ship and concentrated on the earlier one he zoomed in on the tiny blip that represented the lady flamborough with a computerized lens the outline was fuzzy too indistinct to make out little more than the ships profile he turned to the computer at his left and entered a series of instructions a few details that were hidden to his eye became apparent now he could discern the funnel and shape of the superstructure and blurred sections of the upper decks he played with the computer keyboard trying to sharpen the cruise ships features he spent nearly an hour at it before he finally sat back put his arms behind his head and rested his eyes the door to the darkened room opened and greens supervisor vic patton entered he stood behind green for a moment looking at the projections its like trying to read a newspaper on the street from the roof of the world trade center he observed green spoke without turning a by kilometer swath doesnt offer us much resolution even after enlarged enhancement any sign of the ship on the last linage not a hint too bad we cant drop our kh spy birds that low a kh might get a picture the situation in the middle east is heating up again i cant pull one out of orbit until the dust settles then send in a casper one is on the way said patton you should be reading the color of the hijackers eyes by lunch green motioned at the computer lens take a look and tell me if something looks out of place patton pressed his face against the rubber eyepiece and peered at the speck that was the lady flamborough too damned blurred to discern incidentals what am i missing check the bow section how can you tell the back from the front by the wake behind the stern green answered patiently okay ive got it the deck behind the bow looks obscured almost as if it was covered you will first prize at the fair said green what are they up to patton mused well know when the film from the casper comes in on board the c now cruising over bolivia there was an atmosphere of bitter disappointment the photo minus the cruise ship came over the aircrafts laser receiver and caused as much agitation inside the cramped command center as in washingtons power circles where in hell did it go hollis demanded dillenger could only mutter blankly she cant be gone well she sure is see for yourself i did i cant spot her any more than you can this makes three times in a row weve been shut out at the gate by bad information lousy weather or equipment breakdown now our target ups and plays hideandseek she must have sunk munfoled dillenger i dont see any other explanation i cant see forty hijackers all agreeing on a suicide pact what now beyond requesting instructions from readiness command i see little else i can do shall we abort the misssion asked dillenger not unless were ordered to turn back so we keep going hollis nodded dejectedly we fly south until ordered otherwise the last to know was pitt he was sleeping like the dead when rudi gunn entered his cabin and shook him awake come alive said gunn briskly weve got a big problem pitt popped his eyes open and checked the dial of his watch did we get a speeding ticket coming into punta arenas gunn looked at pitt in weary despair anyone who awoke from a sound sleep in a cheerful mood and instantly made bad jokes had to have come from a broken branch of evolution the ship wont enter the harbor for another hour yet good i can doze a while longer get serious gunn said bluntly the latest satellite photo just rolled out of the ships receiver the lady flamborough has gone missing for the second time shes really dropped out enhanced magnification cant find a sign of her ive just talked to admiral sandecker the white house and pentagon are spitting out orders like slot machines gone mad a special operations force rescue team is on the way steamed and primed for action but with no place to go theyre also sending a spy plane to produce some decent aerial pictures ask the admiral if he can arrange a meeting between the sof team leader and me as soon as they land why dont you tell him because im going back to sleep pitt replied with a loud yawn gunn was at a loss your fathers on that boat dont you give a damn yes said pitt his eyes flashing a caution light i give a damn but i dont see what i can do about it at the moment gunn backed off anything else the admiral should know pitt pulled the blanket under his armpits rolled over and faced the bulkhead yes as a matter of fact you can tell him i know how the lady flamborough vanished and i can make a pretty good guess as to where she hides if any other man had spoken those words gunn would have called him a liar but pitt he didnt doubt for a second mind giving me a clue pitt halfturned youre an art collector of sorts arent you rudy my small collection of abstracts wont match the new york museum of modern art but its respectable he looked at pitt in uncomprehending curiosity what has this got to do with anything if im right we may be getting into art in a big way are we on the same frequency christo said pitt as he turned and refaced the bulkhead were about to review a christoinspired sculpture a light snow had turned to a miserable winddriven sleet over the southernmost large city in the world punta arenas had flourished as a port of call before the panama canal was built and died afterward the city gradually returned as a sheepraising center and was now booming after productive oil fields were discovered close by hollis and dillenger stood on a harbor pier waiting anxiously to board the sounder the temperature had dropped several degrees below freezing it was a damp harsh cold that bit at their exposed faces they felt like cornels in the arctic through the cooperation of chilean authorities they had gone undercover and exchanged their battle dress for the uniforms of immigration officials as scheduled their aircraft had landed at a nearby military airport while it was still dark the storm came as an added bonus holding visibility to a few hundred meters and keeping their arrival unobserved the chilean military command was most generous in their hospitality and provided hangar space for holliss small flight of cs and ospreys to park out of sight they moved from the shelter of a warehouse as the research ships mooring lines were dropped over the dock bollards and the gangway lowered both men flinched as the full force of the icy wind struck them a tall man with a craggy face and a friendly grin wearing a ski jacket appeared on the bridge wing he cupped his hands around his mouth senor lpez he shouted through the sleet si hollis yelled back whos your friend mi amigo es sefior jones hollis answered nodding at dillenger ive heard better spanish in a chinese restaurant dillenger muttered please come on board after youreach the main deck take the ladder to your right and come up to the bridge gracias the two leaders of americas elite fighting force dutifully walked up the slanted gangway and climbed the ladder as directed holliss curiosity was eating him up an hour before reaching punta arenas hed received an urgent coded communication from general dodge ordering him to covertly meet the sounder when she docked in port no explanation no further instructions he knew only from a hurried briefing in virginia that the survey ship and its crew were responsible for discovering the deception between the mexican container ship and the lady flamborough nothing else he was most interested in learning why she suddenly appeared in punta arenas at almost the same time as his sof team hollis did not like being left in the dark and he was in an intensely testy mood the man who hailed him was still standing on the bridge wing hollis looked into mesmeric green eyesvery opaque green indeed they belonged to a lean broadshouldered man whose uncovered black hair was speckled with white flakes of ice he stared at the two officers for all of five seconds time enough to complete a survey then he removed his right hand slowly from a coat pocket and stuck it out colonel hollis major dillenger my name is dirk pitt seems you know more about us than we do you mr pitt a situation that will be quickly rectified pitt said cheerfully please follow me to the captains cabin the coffees on and we can talk where its warm and private they gratefully stepped out of the cold and trailed pitt down one deck to stewarts quarters once inside pitt introduced gunn giordino and captain stewart the sof officers shook hands all around and gratefully accepted the coffee please sit down said stewart offering chairs dillenger sank into a chair but hollis shook his head thank you id rather stand he cast a questioning look at the four men from numa if i can speak frankly would you mind telling me what in hell is going on obviously it concerns the lady flamborough said pitt whats there to discuss the terrorists have destroyed her shes still very much afloat pitt assured him ive received no word to that effect said hollis the last satellite photo shows no trace of her take my word for it show me your evidence you dont screw around do you my men and i flew here to save lives hollis said roughly no one not even my superiors has demonstrated to me that people on board that ship can still be saved you have to understand colonel said pitt his voice abruptly cutting like a whip were not dealing with your usual gunhappy terrorists their leader is extremely resourceful until now hes outwitted the best security brains in the business and he keeps right on doing it saw through the disguise said hollis throwing a lefthanded compliment we were lucky if the sounder hadnt been surveying in that part of the sea our discovery of the general bravo might have taken a month as it is weve cut the hijackers lead time down to one or two days holliss pessimism began to melt away this man wasnt giving an inch he wondered if the rescue operation might take place after all where is the proof he asked bluntly we dont know answered gunn not so much as an approximate position the best we can offer is an educated guess said giordino based on what gunn looked expectantly at pitt who smiled and carried the ball again intuition holliss hopes began to crumble are you using tarot cards or a crystal ball he asked sardonically actually i favor tea leaves replied pitt tit for tat there was a brief silence long and cold hollis rightly figured aggression wasnt going to get him anywhere he finished his coffee and turned the cup round and round all right gentlemen i regret coming on a little too strong im not used to dealing with civilians there was no malice in pitts face just a look of amusement if it will make you feel more comfortable i carry the rank of major in the air force hollis frowned may i ask what youre doing on a numa vessel call it a permanent assignmenta long story we dont have time to get into dillenger caught it first hollis should have caught it the minute they were introduced but his mind was saturated with questions are you by chance related to senator george pitt asked dillenger father and son a small piece of the curtain lifted atld the two officers saw a shaft of light beneath hollis pulled up a chair and settled in okay mr pitt please tell me what youve got dillenger cut in the last report showed the lady flamborough heading for the antarctic you say shes still on the surface new photos will easily pick her out amid the ice floes if youre betting on the srninety casper said pitt save your money dillenger gave hollis a bleak look they were outdistanced this oddball group of ocean engineers had as much information in hand as they did from a hundred thousand kilometers an srninety can reveal threedimensional images so sharp that you can distinguish the stitching on a soccer ball stated hollis no question but suppose the ball is camouflaged to look like a rock i still dont know youd see more clearly if we showed you said pitt the crew has set up a demonstration on deck the open deck on the stern had been covered over with a large opaque blanket of white plastic firmly secured to keep it taut and prevent it from billowing under the constant breeze captain stewart stood by with two crew members who manned a fire hose during our survey of the area around the general bravo we recovered a roll of this plastic pitt lectured i believe it accidentally fell off the lady flamborough when the two vessels rendezvoused it was sitting on the seabed among empty barrels of paint the hijackers used to remodel the cruise liner to resemble the mexican container ship granted the evidence is inconclusive youll have to take my word for that but it all points to another makeup job nothing showed on the last satellite photo because all eyes were searching for a ship the lady flamborough no longer looks like one the hijack leader must be into art appreciation he took a page from the controversial sculptor christo whos famous for his outdoor sculptures in plastic he wraps the stuff around buildings coastlines and islands he hung a monstrous curtain in rifle gap colorado and made a fence running for miles in mwill county california the chief hijacker went one better and wrapped the entire cruise liner the liner is not a huge ship the basic outline of her hull could have been altered by props and scaffolding with the sheets all cut and numbered as to position a hundred hostages and hijackers might have done the job in ten hours flat they were working at it when the landsat orbited overhead the enhanced blowup was not clear enough to reveal details of the activity when the seasat followed half a day later there was nothing to identify no features conforming to a ship any ship am i going too fast no hollis said slowly but none of it makes a hell of a lot of sense he must be from missouri giordino said wryly shall we show him pitt gave a brief nod to captain stewart okay boys said stewart to his crewmen once over lightly one man turned the valve while the other aimed the nozzle a fine spray was turned on the plastic sheeting at first the wind carried half the mist over the side the crewman had ajusted the angle and soon the plastic was coated with a watery film before a full minute passed the frigid atmosphere turned the water to ice hollis observed the transformation pensively then he walked up to pitt and held out his hand my respects sir you made a sound call dillenger stared like a rube whod been suckered at a traveling carnival an iceberg he muttered angrily the sons of bitches made the ship into an iceberg hala awoke cold and stiff it was midmorning yet there was still a level of darkness the cargo container facade combined with the icecoated plastic shrouding the cruise liner shut out most of the light what little penetrated into the vip suites was just sufficient to reveal the figures of presidents hasan and de lorenzo on the bed next to her under one pitifully inadequate blanket they huddled against one another for warmth their frozen breaths hanging in vaporlike clouds above their heads before condensing and freezing on the walls the cold itself might have been tolerated no matter how miserable but the high humidity made the freezing temperatures unbearable their condition was further aggravated by not having had anything to eat since leaving punta del este the hijackers made no effort to provide food for the passengers and crew ammars inhuman callousness took its toll as and fear of the unknown the cold sapped their strength drugged their minds for the first part of the voyage the prisoners had survived on nothing but water out of the faucets in the bathroom showers and washbasins but the pipes had frozen and the torment of thirst was added to the ache of hunger the lady flamborough had been refitted to sail tropical seas and carried only a minimum supply of blankets everyone who came on board in puerto rico or punta del este had packed for a temperate climate and had left all winter clothing in closets at home the prisoners bundled up as best they could wearing several layers of lightweight shirts pants and socks they wrapped their heads in towels to retain body heat the coldweather gear they sorely missed most was gloves there was no warmth anywhere animar had refused all pleas to circulate heat throughout the ship he could not afford the luxury interior heat would have melted the ice film on the plastic sheeting and sabotaged the deception hala was not the only prisoner awake most had found it impossible to drop off into a sound sleep they lay as if in a hypnotic trance aware of their surroundings but unable to make any kind of physical effort any thoughts of resistance had rapidly drained away under the onslaught instead of fighting the hijackers captain collins and his crew were reduced to stru gling to stay alive against the numbing cold hala raised to her elbows as senator pitt came into the room he made a strange appearance wearing a gray business suit over a blue pinstripe he gave hala a smile of encouragement but it was a pathetic effort the fatigue of the past five days had taken away his youthful look and he looked closer to his true age how you holding up he asked id give my right arm for a cup of hot tea she said gamely for my part id give more than that president de lorenzo sat up and dropped his feet on the deck did someone say hot tea just fantasizing mr president replied the senator i never thought id find myself starving and freezing to death on a luxurious cruise ship nor i said hala president hasan gave a slight moan as he changed position and lifted his head is your back bothering you asked president de lorenzo his face reflecting concern im too cold to hurt hasan said with a tight smile can i help you up no thank you i think ill just remain here in bed and conserve whatever strength i have left hasan looked at de lorenzo and smiled thinly i wish we had met and become friends under more comfortable circumstances ive heard the americans say politics makes strange bedfellows we seem to be a literal example when we get out of this you must be my guest in egypt de lorenzo nodded a reciprocal agreement you must also visit mexico an honor i gladly accept the two presidents solemnly shook hands on itno longer pampered heads of state but two men whose lives shared a fate they could not control and were determined to end with dignity the engines have stopped said hala suddenly senator pitt nodded the anchors were just dropped were moored and theyve shut down the engines we must be near land no way of telling with the port windows hidden too bad were blind said hasan if one of you will guard the door ill make a try at forcing the window said pitt once i make a break in the glass without alerting a guard ill carve a hole in the fiberboard with luck we might be able to see where we are ill listen at the door hala volunteered the cold is bad enough without letting more in said de lorenzo dispiritedly the temperature is the same outside as in here the senator replied bluntly he was not about to waste time in debate he went immediately to the large glass viewing window in the sitting room the port measured two meters high by one wide there was no promenade deck running along outside the staterooms and suite entrances faced the center of the ship the windowed outer walls rose flush from the hull the only open areas patrolled by the hijackers were the pool and lounge decks above and the observation decks fore and aft the senator rapped the glass with his knuckles the return sound came like a dull thump the glass was thick it had to be to withstand the crushing impact of huge waves and hurricaneforce winds anyone wear a diamond ring he asked hala slipped her hands out of the pockets of a light raincoat held them up and wiggled her fingers displaying two small rings mounted with opals and turquoise muslim suitors are not in the habit of spoiling their women with lavish gifts i could use a full carat president hasan pulled a large ring from one of his pinky fingers here is a threecarat the senator eyeballed the stone in the dim light this should do nicely thank you he worked quickly but carefully making little noise cutting an opening just large enough to slip a finger through he stopped every so often to blow on his hands when his fingers began to go numb he held them under his armpits until they limbered up again he did not care to contemplate what the hijackers would do to him if they caught him he could almost envision his bulletriddled corpse floating in the current he cut a circular line around the small center hole retracing the line until the gouge went deeper and deeper the tricky thing was to prevent a piece of the glass from falling down the side of the steel hull and tinkling as it fell he curled a finger into the hole and pulled the circle of glass gave way he slowly eased it backward and set it on the carpet not a bad job now he had an opening large enough to stick his head through the fiberboard making up the false cargo containers stood half an arms length from the window and covered the entire length of the midships superstructure the senator cautiously slipped his head past the opening careful not to slice his ears on its razorsharp edges he peered from side to side but saw only the narrow slot between the fake containers and the steel sides of the ship upward he viewed the crack of light that was the sky but it appeared dimmed as if socked in by fog he should have seen a thin band of moving water below instead his eyes took in an immense sheet of plastic that was attached by bracing along the waterline he stared at it in amazement not having the faintest idea of its purpose the senator felt secure if he couldnt see the hijackers guarding the decks they couldnt see him he returned to the bedroom and rummaged through his suitcase what do you need asked hala he held up a swiss army knife i always carry one of these in my shaving kit he grinned the corkscrew comes in handy for impromptu parties senator pitt took his time and warmed his hands before going back to work he grasped the red handle eased his arm through the opening in the glass and began to twist using the small blade as a drill and then the large blade to carve away the sides and increase the circumference the process went agonizingly slowly he dared not run the blade more than a scant millimeter past the outer wau of the fiberboard there was the nagging fear an alert guard might peer over the side and glimpse the tiny metallic movement he carved very carefully removing each layer of the fiberboard before attacking the next all feeling went out of his hand but he did not warm it his fist was frozen stiffly around the red handle the small knife felt like an extension of his hand at last the senator scraped away enough wood shavings for a hole large enough to observe a fairly large area of sea he leaned his head through the glass and pressed his cheek against the cold surface of the board something shut off his view he poked his finger in the eyehole and felt it touch the plastic sheeting he was more confounded than ever to learn it covered the hollow containers as well as the lower hull he cursed under his breath he neednt have been so afraid of penetrating the wood no one would have seen his knife blade under the plastic anyway he threw off caution and quickly cut a slot in the opaque material then the senator looked again he did not see the open sea nor did he find himself viewing a shoreline what he saw was a towering cliff of ice that extended far beyond his limited line of sight the glistening wall was so close he could have touched it with an extended umbrella as he stared he heard a deadened bass drumlike sound it reminded the senator of the rumble from a minor earthquake he stepped back abruptly reeling at the implication of what hed discovered hala saw him stiffen what is it she asked anxiously what did you see he turned and looked at her blankly his mouth working until words finally formed theyve anchored us against a huge glacier he said finally the ice wall can break away at any time and crush the ship like paper twenty thousand meters above the antarctic peninsula the deltawing reconnaissance plane slipped through the rarefied air at kilometers per hour she was designed to fly twice that altitude at twice the speed but her pilot held her at percent throttle to conserve fuel and give the cameras a chance to sharpen earth images under the slower speed unlike her ancestor the sr blackbird whose natural titanium wings and fuselage wore the color of deep indigo the stealth technology of the more advanced sr created an incredibly tough lightweight plastic skin that was tinted graywhite nicknamed the casper after the cartoon ghost she was almost as impossible to detect by eye as she was by radar her five cameras could capture half the length of the united states in one hour with only one pass her photographic package filmed in blackandwhite color infrared threedimensional and a few imagery techniques that were highly classified and totally unknown to commercial photographers lieutenant colonel james slade had little to do it was a long boring reconnaissance from his base in californias mojave desert the only time he took manual control in flight was during refueling operations the caspers engines had a heavy thirst she had to be refueled twice on each leg of the flight by aerial tankers slade examined the instruments with a critical eye the casper was a new plane and she had yet to reveal all her bugs thankful to find normal readings across the board he sighed and pulled a miniature electronic game from a pocket of his flight suit he began pressing the buttons below a small viewing window trying to get a tiny diver past a giant octopus to reach a treasure chest after a few minutes he tired of the game and gazed ahead and down at the frozen isolation that was antarctica far below the curved beckoning finger of the northern peninsula and its adjoining islands sparkled under a diamondclear sky the ice and rock and sea created a beautiful vastness awesome to the eye intimidating to the soul the sight may have looked appealing from twenty kilometers overhead but slade knew better hed once flown supplies to a scientific station at the south pole and quickly learned the beauty and the hostility in the permanent domain of cold went hand in hand he well remembered the chilling temperatures he didnt believe it possible to spit and see the saliva freeze before it hit the ground and he never forgot the ferocious winds that scourge the coldest of all continents the kilometer gusts were unimaginable until he experienced them for the first time slade could never fathom why some men were so attracted to that frozen hell he had a facetious urge to call a travel agent after he returned to base and inquire about reservations at a good resort hotel close to the polar center suddenly a female voice spoke over one of the three cockpit speakers attention please you are about to cross the outer limit of your flight path where seventy degrees longitude and seventy degrees latitude intersect disengage auto pilot and come around a hundred and eighty degrees beginning now the new heading for your return is programmed into the computer please enter the appropriate code have a good trip home slade followed the instructions and made a lazy turn as soon as the computer locked on the return heading he went back on auto pilot and shifted to a more comfortable position in his cramped seat like so many other men who flew reconnaissance missions he fantasized about the face and body that went with the embodied voice rumor had it she weighed twohundred pounds was sixty years old and a grandmother twelve times no pilot with a sound imagination could believe such a mytshattering thought she had to look like sigourney weaver maybe it was sigoumey weaver he decided to explore the tantalizing possibility on his return home that delicate problem solved slade rechecked his instrument panel and then relaxed while the icebound land drifted away behind his tail over the sea again he returned to his little electronic treasure game he saw little purpose in continuing to watch the world roll by especially since tierra del fuego was covered by thick blankets of charcoal clouds hed studied enough geography to know it was a wretched land of constant wind rain and snow slade was almost thankful he couldnt see the monotonous landscape he left it to caspers infrared camera to penetrate the dark overcast and record the desolate dead end of the continent captain collins stared into ammars mask and had to force himself not to avert his gaze there was something evil something inhuman in the eyes of the urbane leader of the hijackers collins could sense a chilling unconcern for mere human life about the man i demand to know when youre going to release my ship said collins in a precise tone arnmar set a cup of tea on a saucer patted his lips with a table napkin and looked at collins detachedly can i offer you some tea not unless you offer it to my passengers and crew as well collins replied dryily he stood erect in his summer white uniform bitterly cold and shivering the very answer i expected ammar turned the empty cup upside down and leaned back youll be happy to know my men and i expect to leave sometime tomorrow evening if you give me your word there will be no foolish attempt to retake the ship or escape to the nearby shore before we depart no one will be harmed and you can resume command id rather you heat the ship and feed everyone now were desperately short of warm clothing and blankets to ward off the cold no one has eaten in days the pipes have frozen blocking all water and i dont have to mention the sanitation problems suffering is good for the soul animar said philosophically collins glared at him at utter tripe ammar shrugged wearily if you say so good god man there are people sick and dying on this ship i doubt seriously whether any of your crew and passengers will die of exposure or from starvation before my departure said ammar curtly theyll simply have to survive some discomfort for the next hours or so until you can restart the engines and heat the ship that may be too late for any of us if the wall of the glacier breaks off it looks solid enough you dont realize the danger a massive ice slab might fall any moment the weight could smash the flamborough like a tenstory building collapsing on an automobile you must move the ship a risk i cannot avoid the ice film on the plastic would melt giving away our location and satellite infrared cameras could detect our radiated heat collinss face was ed with helpless rage youre either a fool or youre insane what good has any of this proven what profit will you get out of it are we being held for ransom or as hostages in return for freeing your fellow terrorists behind bars somewhere if youre simply walking off and leaving us i fail to see the purpose you have an irritating degree of curiosity captain but a dedication of purpose after my own heart you will learn the reasons behind our capture of your ship soon enough ammar rose and nodded at the guard who stood behind collins return the captain to confinement collins refused to move why cant you provide hot tea coffee soup anything that will alleviate the suffering ammar did not bother to turn as he walked from the dining salon goodbye captain we wont meet again animar went directly to the communications room ibn was standing watching a teletype hum out the latest wireservice news his electronics man was seated at the radio listening to an incoming transmission while a voice recorder copied it on paper the radio and teletype were powered by a portable generator ibn turned at ammars approach gave a brief nod in recognition and tore a long sheet of paper from the teletype the international news media are still reporting the lady flamborough as lost he reported salvage ships are only now arriving off uruguay to conduct an underwater search my compliments suleiman you fooled the world well be safely back in cairo before the west learns the truth what news of egypt asked ammar nothing worth celebrating yet hasans cabinet ministers still control the government they stubbornly hold on to power theyve played it smart by not sending in security forces to smash the demonstrations the only bloodshed was caused by our fundamentalist brothers who mistakenly blew up a busload of algerian firemen attending a convention in cairo it was thought the bus was part of a government police convoy the cairo news network is claiming akhmad yazids movement is a front for iranian fanatics many supporters are wavering in their loyalty and there has been no mass demand for hasans cabinet to dissolve the government that idiot khaled fawzy was behind the bus explosion snarled ammar the military where do the armed forces stand defense minister abu haniid will not commit himself until he views the bodies of president hasan and hala kamil to confirm their deaths so yazid has yet to make a triumphal takeover ibn nodded and his expression turned grave there is another news item yazid has announced that the cruise ships crew and passengers still live and he will personally negotiate with the terrorists and arrange for the release of everyone he has gone so far as to offer his life in exchange for senator george pitt to impress the americans a numbing paralyzing rage swelled within ammar sharpening his senses and opening his thoughts like envelopes inside his mind after a few moments he looked at ibn by allah the judas goat has led us to slaughter he said incredulously yazid has sold out the mission ibn nodded in agreement yazid has used and betrayed you that explains why he stalled off ordering me to kill hasan kamil and the rest he wanted them unharmed until machado and his scum could remove you and me and our people what do yazid and topiltzin gain by keeping the hostages alive asked ibn by playing the saviors of two presidents the secretarygeneral of the united nations and an important united states politician yazid and topiltzin will gain the admiration of international leaders they automatically become stronger while their opponents lose ground they are then free to assume the reigns of their governments in peaceful takeovers widening their power base and increasing their benevolent images in the eyes of the world ibn bent his head in resignation so weve been thrown to the vultures ammar nodded yazid meant for us to die from the beginning to guarantee our silence on this and other missions weve performed for him what of captain machado and his mexican crew what happens to them after theyve eliminated us topiltzin would see to it they vanished after their return to mexico they would have to escape the ship and island first yes annnar replied thoughtfully he paced the communications room angrily it seems i badly underestimated yazids cunning i was smug in thinking machado was impotent because he knew nothing of our arrangements for escaping to a safe airfield in argentina but thanks to yazid our mexican comrade has implemented his own departure plans then why hasnt he murdered us by now because yazid and topiltzin wont give him the order until theyre ready to act out their sham negotiations for the hostage release suddenly ammar turned and gripped the shoulder of the radio man who quickly removed his headphones have youreceived any unusual messages directed to the ship the egyptian communications expert looked curious strange you should ask our latin friends have been in and out of here every ten minutes asking the same question i thought they must be stupid any acknowledgment to a direct transmission would be intercepted by americaneuropean intelligence listening facilities theyd fix our position within seconds so youve intercepted nothing suspicious the arab communications man shook his head even if i did any message would certainly be in code shut down the equipment make the mexicans think youre still listening for something whenever they ask about an incoming message play dumb and keep saying youve heard nothing ibn stared at him expectantly my instructions sideiman keep a sharp watch on machados crew get them off balance by acting friendly open the lounge bar and invite them to drink give the worst guard duty to our men so the latins can relax this will lower their defenses shall we kill them before they kill us no said ammar a flicker of sadistic pleasure in his eyes well leave that job to the glacier cant be less than a million icebergs down there said gior dino bleakly be easier picking a midget headwaiter out of a colony of penguins this could take days colonel hollis was in the same mood there has to be one matching the lady flamboroughs contour and dimensions keep looking bear in mind said gunn antarctic bergs tend to be flat the superstructure under the plastic shroud will give the ship a multipinnacle shape dillengers eye was enlarged four times its size through a magnifying glass the definition is amazing he muttered be even better when we see whats on the other side of those clouds they were all grouped around a small table in the communications compartment of the sounder examining a huge color photo from the casper the aerial reconnaissance film had been processed and sent through the survey ships laser receiver less than forty minutes after the aircraft landed the welldefined detail showed a sea of bergs broken away from the larsen ice shelf on the eastern side of the peninsula while hundreds more could be distinguished near glaciers off graham land to the west pitts concentration was aimed elsewhere he sat off to one side studying a large nautical chart draped across his lap once in a while he looked up listening but did not contribute to the conversation hollis turned to captain stewart who stood next to the receiver wearing a headset with attached microphone when can we expect the caspers infrared photo stewart raised a hand as a signal not to interrupt he pressed the headset against his ears listening to a voice at cia headquarters in washington then he nodded toward hollis the photo lab at langley says theyll begin transmitting in half a minute hollis paced the small compartment like a cat listening for the sound of a can opener he paused and stared curiously at pitt who was unconcernedly measuring distances with a pair of dividers the colonel had learned a great deal about the man from numa in the past few hours not from pitt himself but from the men on the ship they talked of him as though he were some kind of walking legend coming through now announced stewart he removed the headset and waited patiently for the newspapersize photo to emerge from the receiver as soon as it rolled free he carried it over and placed it on the table then everyone began scrutinizing the shoreline around the upper end of the peninsula the technicians at the cia photo lab have computerconverted the specially sensitive film to a thermogram explained stewart the differences of infrared radiation are revealed in various colors black represents the coldest temperatures dark blue light blue green yellow and red form an increasingly warmer scale to white the hottest what reading can we expect from the lady flamborough asked dillenger somewhere in the upper end between yellow and red closer to a dark blue pitt broke in everyone turned and glared at him as though hed sneezed during a chess match that being the case she wont stand out hollis protested wed never find her heat radiation from the engines and generators will show as plain as a golf ball on a green gunn argued not if the engineering room was shut down you cant mean a dead ship dillenger asked in disbelief pitt nodded he stared at the others with a passing casual gaze that was more disturbing than if he had thrown a wet blanket over the enthusiasm of a breakthrough he smiled and said what we have here is a persistent urge to underrate the coach on the other team the five men looked at each other and then back at pitt waiting for some kind of explanation pitt laid his nautical charts aside and rose from his chair he walked to the table picked up the infrared photo and folded it in half revealing only the lower tip of chile now then pitt continued havent you noticed that every time the ship went through a change of appearance or altered course it came immediately after one of our satellites passed overhead another example of precise planning said gunn the orbits of scientific datagathering satellites are tracked by half the countries of the world the information is as readily attainable as phases of the moon okay so the hijack leader knew the orbiting schedules and guessed when the satellite cameras were aimed in his direction said hollis so what so he covered all avenues and shut down power to prevent detection by infrared photography and most important to keep the warmth from melting the thin layer of ice coating the plastic shroud four out of five found pitts theory quite plausible the holdout was gunn he was the fastest intellect in the bunch he saw the flaw before anyone else youre forgetting the subzero temperatures around the peninsula said gunn no power no heat everyone on the ship would freeze to death in a few hours you might say the hijackers were committing suicide at the same time they murdered their prisoners rudi makes good sense giordino said they couldnt survive without some degree of warmth and protective clothing pitt smiled like a lottery winner i agree with rudi one hundred percent youre driving in circles said hollis in aggravation make sense nothing complicated the lady flamborough didnt enter the antarctic didnt enter the antarctic repeated hollis mechanically face the facts man the last satellite photo of the ship showed her halfway between cape horn and the tip of the peninsula steaming hellbent to the south she had no place else to go protested dillenger pitt tapped a finger on the ragged mass of islands scattered around the straits of magellan want to bet hollis stood frowning baffled for a moment and then he caught on his confusion vanished and total understanding beamed in his eyes she doubled back he said flatly rudi had the key pitt acknowledged the hijackers werent about to commit suicide nor were they going to risk detection by infrared photos they never had any intention of heading into the ice pack instead they cut northwest and skirted the barren islands above cape horn gunn looked relieved the temperatures are not nearly as severe around tierra del fuego everyone on board would be damned uncomfortable without warmth but theyd survive then why the iceberg scam queried giordino to appear as if they calved from a glacier calved like in cow calving is the breaking away of an ice mass from an ice front or wall gunn clarified giordino stared down at the infrared photo glaciers this far north several flow down the mountains and meet the sea within eight hundred kilometers from where were docked here in punta arenas replied pitt where do youreckon she is hollis asked pitt took a chart showing the desolate fringe islands west of tierra del fuego two possibilities within the lady flamboroughs sailing range since she was last spotted by satellite he paused to place an x beside two names on the chart directly south of here glaciers flow from mounts italia and s ento hollis said theyre off the beaten track all right but too close to the oil fields said pitt a lowflying oilcompany survey plane might notice the phony ice cover me if i was calling the plays for the hijackers id head another hundred and sixty kilometers northwest which would put them near a glacier on santa inez island dillenger studied the small islands irregular shoreline on the chart for a moment he glanced at the colored photograph but the southern foot of chile was blotted by clouds he pushed it aside and peered through the magnifying glass at the upper half of the infrared image pitt had folded to condense the search region after a few seconds he looked up in wonder and delight unless mother nature makes icebergs with a pointed bow and a rounded stern i think weve found our phantom ship hollis took the glass from his subordinate and examined the tiny oblong shape its the right contour all right and as pitt said theres no sign of heat radiation shes reading almost as cold as the glacier not quite pure black but a very dark blue gunn leaned in yes i see the glacier flows into a fjord that empties in a bay crowded with small islands one or two mediumsize bergs broken from the glacial wall no more the water is reasonably free of ice he paused a curious expression in the eyes behind the glasses i wonder how they moored the lady flamborough directly under the glaciers forward wall pitts eyes narrowed let me have a look he squeezed between dillenger and gunn bent over and gazed through the powerful glass after a time he straightened his face clouded with a rising anger what do you see asked captain stewart they mean for every one to die stewart looked at the others puzzled how does he know when an ice slab fractures off the glacier and falls on the ship giordino said stonily shell be shoved under the water and mashed into the bottom no trace of her would ever be found dillenger gave pitt a hard look after all the lost opportunities do you think they finally intend to murder the crew and passengers i do why not before now the myriad of deceptions was a stall for time whoever ordered the hijacking had reasons for keeping presidents hasan and de lorenzo alive i cant tell you why i can said hollis akhmad yazid is the instigator he planned to take control of egypt soon after it was announced that president hasan and un secretarygeneral hala kamil were abducted and presumed killed by unknown terrorists at sea after he and his close supporters established a solid power base he would claim his agents had found the ship and then act the benevolent man of god and negotiate the hostages release crafty bastard murmured giordino a nobel peace prize candidate for sure if he saved president de lorenzo and senator pitt as a bonus naturally yazid would see that hasan and kamil met with an unfortunate accident on their return to egypt and hed still come out pure as the driven snow giordino grunted a grand sting admitted pitt yet according to the latest news reports the military has remained neutral and hasans cabinet has refused to resign and fold the present government hollis nodded yes throwing yazids carefully calculated schedule out the window so hes plotted himself into a corner said pitt end of stalling tactics end of masquerades this time around he has to send the lady flamborough into oblivion or face the very real threat of intelligence sources ferreting out his role in the operation a theory with no leaks agreed hollis so while we stand here the hijack leader is playing russian roulette with the glacier said gunn in a low voice he and his terrorist tewn may have already abandoned the ship and escaped by boat or helicopter leaving the crew and passengers confined below helpless could be weve missed the boat dillenger speculated somberly hollis didnt see it that way he scribbled a number on a slip of paper and handed it to stewart captain please signal my communications officer on this frequency tell him the major and i are returning to the airfield and to assemble the men for an immediate briefing wed like to go along said pitt with quiet determination hollis shook his head no way youre civilians youve had no assault training your request is out of line my father is on that ship im sorry he said but didnt sound it wmark it off to tough luck pitt looked at hollis and his eyes were very cold one call to washington and i could queer your entire service career holliss mouth tightened you get your kicks making threats mr pitt he took a step forward were not playing touch football here a lot of bodies are going to mess the decks of that ship in the next twelve hours if my men and i do our jobs the way weve been trained a thousand phone calls to the white house and congress wont make a damn he took another step toward pitt i know more rotten tricks than youd learn in a lifetime i could tear you to shreds with my bare hands no one in the room saw the movement saw where it came from one instant pitt was standing casually with his arms at his sides the next he was pressing the muzzle of a colt fortyfivecaliber automatic into holliss groin dillenger crouched as if ready to spring that was as far as he got giordino came from behind and pinned the majors arms to his sides in a bear hug that clamped like a steel trap i wont bore you with our credentials pitt said calmly take my word rudi al and i have enough experience to hold our own in a shooting war i promise we wont interfere i presume youll lead your special operations forces against the lady flamborough in a combined air and sea assault well stay out of your way and follow from the land side hollis was far from frightened but he was dazed he couldnt begin to imagine how pitt produced a largecaliber weapon with such lightning speed dirk is asking little of you colonel said gunn in a patient tone i suggest you demonstrate a small degree of mature logic and go along i dont believe for a second youd murder me growled hollis at pitt no but i can guarantee you wont have a very productive sex life who are you people are you with the company the cia said giordino no we didnt qualify so we enlisted with numa instead hollis shook his head i dont understand any of this you dont have to said pitt is it a deal hollis considered for half a second then he leaned forward until his nose was only a few millimeters from pitts and spoke as would a drill instructor to a raw recruit ill see you weirdos are airlifted by an osprey to within ten kilometers of the ship no closer or well lose the element of surprise from there you can damn well hike in if im lucky you wont arrive until its all over fair enough pitt agreed hollis backed off then he looked at giordino and snapped id be grateful if youd release my second in command then he refaced pitt were shoving off now in fact if you dont leave with major dillenger and me you aint going because five minutes after boarding my command aircraft our entire assault team will be airborne pitt eased the automatic from holliss groin well be right behind you ill tag along with the major said giordino giving dillenger a friendly pat on the back great minds run in the same channels dillenger gave him a sour look indeed yours might run in a gutter but mine dont the room cleared out in fifteen seconds pitt hurried to his cabin and snatched up a tote bag he made a quick trip to the bridge and conversed with captain stewart how long for the sounder to reach santa inez stewart stepped into the chart room and made a quick calculation pushing throttles to the stops our diesels should put us off the glacier in nine or ten hours do it pitt ordered well look for you around dawn stewart shook pitts hand you take care you hear ill try not to get my feet wet one of the ships scientists stepped over from the bridge counter he was black medium height and wore a stern expression that looked as if it was chiseled there his name clayton findley and he spoke in a deep rich bass voice excuse me for eavesdropping gentlemen but i could have sworn you mentioned santa inez island pitt nodded yes thats right theres an old zinc mine near the glacier closed down when chile halted governmentsubsidized production youre familiar with the island pitt asked in surprise findley nodded i was chief geologist of an arizona mining company who thought they might make the army pay through efficient costcutting operations they sent me down along with a couple of engineers to make a survey spent three months in that hell hole we found the ore grade about played out soon after the mine was shuttered and the equipment abandoned how are you with a rifle ive hunted some pitt took him by the arm clayton my friend you are a gift from the gods clayton findley did indeed prove to be a godsend while hollis bnefed his men inside an unused warehouse pitt gunn and giordino helped findley sculpt a diorama of santa inez island from mud scooped beside the airports runway on an old pingpong table he refreshed his memory of what hed forgottened from pitts nautical chart he hardened the miniature landscape with a portable heater and highlighted the features with cans of spray paint scrounged by one of holliss men gray for the rocky terrain white for the snow and ice of the glacier he even molded a scale model of the lady flamborough and set it at the foot of the glacier at last he stood back and admired his handiwork that he said confidently is santa inez hollis interrupted his briefing and gathered his men around the table everyone stared at the diorama in thoughtful silence for a few moments the island was shaped like the center piece of a jigsaw puzzle produced by a drunken cutter the ragged shoreline was a mine of spurs and hooks gashed by barbed fjords and gnarled bays it backed on the straits of mageuan to the east and faced the pacific ocean to the west it was dead ground not fit for a graveyard kilometers wide by kilometers in length and peaked by mount wharton meters high beaches and flat ground were virtually nonexistent the lowlying mountains rose like rockbound ships their steep slopes falling in forlorn agony to meet the cold sea the ancient glacier sat like a saddle on the island it was the result of cold and overcast summers that did not melt the ice barren escarpments of solid rock flanked the frigid mass standing in sullen silence as the glacier gouged its irresistible passage toward the water where it calved section after section the way a butcher slices sausage few areas of the world were more hostile to man the entire island chain of the magellans was uninhabited by permanent settlers through the centuries men had come and gone leaving behind wrathful names like break neck peninsula deceit island calamity bay desolation isle and port famine it was a hard place the only vegetation that survived was stunted twisted evergreens that merged with kind of a scrubby heath findley swept a hand over the model imagine a barren landscape with snow at the higher altitudes and you pretty much get a picture of the real thing hollis nodded thank you mr findley were much obliged glad to help all right lets get down to the hard facts major dillenger will lead the airdrop force while ill be in command of the dive team hollis paused briefly to scan the faces of his men they were lean hard purposefullooking men dressed entirely in black they were a tough breed of fighters who had survived torturous survival training to earn the distinction of serving with the elite special operations force a hell of a team hollis thought proudly to himself the best in the world weve trained long and hard for ship seizures at night he continued but none where weve given away so many advantages to the enemy we lack critical intelligence information the weather conditions are miserable and were faced with a glacier that can shatter at any minute perplexing problems tough problems that stand in the way of success before we launch our assault in a few hours we want as many answers as possible if you see a grave flaw in the operation sing out so lets begin island inhabitants dillenger asked findley straight away none after we closed the mine weather conditions rains almost constantly its one of the most heavily watered regions on the continent you rarely see the sun temperatures this time of year run a few degrees below freezing winds are constant and can get violent at times the willdchill factor is a bitch and its almost certain to be raining dillenger gave hollis a grave look we dont stand a prayer of a pinpoint air drop at night hollis appeared grim well have to go in with the minichoppers and scale down with ropes you brought helicopters asked gunn incredulously i didnt think they had the speed and range to fly this far so fast hollis finished their military designation has too many letters and digits to memorize we call them carrier pigeons small compact they carry a pilot in an enclosed cockpit and two men on the outside comes equipped with an infrared dome and silenced tail rotors they can be broken down or assembled in fifteen minutes one of our cs can transport six of them you have another problem said pitt go ahead the lady flamboroughs navigation radar can be tuned for aircraft your carrier pigeons may have low profiles but they can be read on a screen in time for the hijackers to prepare a nasty reception party so much for surprise from the air said dillenger morosely hollis looked at findley any adverse conditions we should know about for an assault from the fjord findley smiled faintly you should have an easier time than the major youll enjoy the advantage of frost smoke frost smoke foglike clouds formed from the contact of cold air with warmer water near the glacial wall it can rise anywhere from two to ten meters combined with the certain rain your dive team should be cloaked from the time they begin their approach until they climb onto the decks one of us gets a bit of luck after all said dillenger hollis nabbed his chin thoughtfully were not dealing with a textbook operation here it could turn real messy if the air drop is a foulup all surprise would be lost and without it the twentyman dive team isnt strong enough to engage forty armed hijackers without support since its suicidal for your men to parachute onto the ship said pitt why not drop them farther up the glacier from there they can make their way to the edge and then rappel down ropes onto the main deck wed be looking at an easy descent agreed dillenger the ice wall is above the ships superstructure and near enough for us to clear the gap hollis nodded and said the thought crossed my mind any one see an obstacle with this tactict your biggest danger as i see it said gunn is the glacier itself it can have an endless labyrinth of crevasses and treacherous snow crusts that give way under a mans weight youll have to take it slow and damned careful crossing it any other comment there was none hollis gave a side glance to dillenger how much time will yourequire from air drop to attack readiness it would help if i knew wind velocity and direction nine days out of ten it blows from the southeast answered findley average velocity is about ten kilometers an hour but it can easily gust to a hundred dillenger stared pensively for a few moments at the small mountains rising behind the glacier he tried to visualize the scene at night sense the severity of the wind he ticked off the time inside his head then he looked up forty to fortyfive minutes from air drop to ship assault pardon me for telling you your job major said pitt but youre cutting it too fine findley nodded i agree ive hiked the glacier on many occasions the ice ridges make it slow going in a smooth greased movement dillenger pulled a long wickedlooking bowie knife angled between hilt and blade from a sheath behind his back and used the spiked tip as a pointer the way i see it well make our jump on the backside of the mountain to the right of the glacier this should hide our c transport from the ships radar using the preveiling winds which hopefully will run true to pattern well glide our stealth parachutes around the mountain for seven kilometers landing within one kilometer from the glaciers forward wall time from jump until we regroup on the ice id judge eighteen minutes time to walk to glaciers edge another twenty minutes six more minutes to prepare repel operation total time fortyfour minutes id double it if i were you said giordino disapprovingly youll have a hell of a time meeting a deadline if some of your men fall in a crevasse the dive team wont be aware of the delay hollis shot al a look he usually reserved for war protesters this isnt world war one mr giordino we dont have to synchronize watches before we go over the top each man is customfitted with a miniaturized radio receiver in his ear and a microphone inside his ski mask no matter whether major dillenger and his team are late or mine is early so long as we are in constant communication we can coordinate a joint assault one other thing pitt broke in i assume your weapons are silenced they are hollis assured him why one burst from an unsilenced machine gun could bring down the wall of the glacier i cant speak for the hijackers then you better kill them quick muttered giordino we dont train to take terrorists as prisoners hollis said with a cold ominous grin now then if our visitors can restrain their criticisms are there any questions diveteam leader richard banning raised his hand sir henning will we be approaching the ship underwater or on the surface hollis simply used a ballpoint pen as a pointer he tapped it on a small island in the fjord that was behind a point of land and out of sight from the ship our team will be ferried by pigeon carrier to this island distance to the lady flamborough is about three kilometers the water is too cold for a swim that far so well stay dry and move in by rubber boats if mr findley is correct about the frost smoke we should be able to approach without detection if its dissipated well enter the water two hundred meters away and dive until we reach the hull a lot of balls will be iced if we have to wait very long for major dillengers team to get in place a small wave of laughter echoed from the eighty men gathered around the table hollis sighed and gave a broad smile i dont intend to freeze mine well give the major an ample head start gunn raised his hand yes mr gunn hollis said wearily whats on your mind now did i forget something just curiosity colonel how will you know if the hijackers somehow get wind of the assault and lay a trap one of our aircraft is filled with advanced electronicsurveillance equipment it will fly a circular pattern seven miles above the lady flamborough detecting any radio transmissions sent by the hijackers to their collaborators outside the region theyd scream like madmen if they thought a special operations force was closing the net around them the communications men and translators can intercept all transmissions and alert us in plenty of time pitt made a casual motion with one hand yes mr pitt i hope you havent forgotten the numa party hollis lifted an eyebrow no i havent forgotten he turned to the geologist mr findley where did you say the old abandoned mine was located i neglected to place it replied findley matteroffactly but since youre interested he paused and placed a match cover on the side of a small mount overlooking the glacier and the fjord she sits here about two and a half kilometers from the forward edge of the glacier and the ship hollis turned to pitt thats where youll be you can serve as an observation post some observation post grumbled giordino in the dark and rain and sleet wed be lucky to see our own shoelaces cozy and safe and out of harms way pitt said pontifically we may light a fire in the stove and have ourselves a picnic you do that hollis said with some satisfaction he looked around at the assembled men well gentlemen i wont bore you with a gung ho pep talk lets just do our jobs and save some lives and will just one for the gipper giordino muttered what did you say al was saying what an honor it was to be part of an elite fighting force said pitt hollis gave giordino a stare that would cut glass special operations forces do not give out honorary memberships you civilians will stay back out of the way hollis turned to dillenger if any of these numa people attempt to set foot on the ship before i give permission shoot them thats an order a pleasure dillenger grinned sharkishly giordino shrugged they certainily know how to vent wrath around here pitt did not share giordinos caustic mood he understood perfectly holliss position his men were professional a team he gazed around at them big quiet men ranged in a mugh circle around the model none was over twentyfive as he stared into their faces he couldnt help wondering which ones were going to die in a few short hours how much longer machado asked ammar as he sprawled on captain collinss settee with no ships power the captains cabin was dimly lit by four flashlights strategically hung from the ceiling ammar shrugged indifferently while he read from the koran you spend more time in the communications room than i do you tell me machado made a spitting gesture at the deck i am sick of waiting around like a pregnant duck i say shoot the lot of them and get the hell away from this barren purgatory ammar looked at his peer in the business of murder machado was sloppy in his habits his hair was oily and his fingernails wedged with dirt one whiff at two paces was enough to recognize he seldom bathed ammar respected machado as a dangerous threat but beyond that there was only disgust machado rolled off the settee to his feet and restlessly roamed the cabin before settling in a chair we should have received instructions twentyfour hours ago he said topiltzin is not one to hesitate neither is akhmad yazid said ammar while keeping his eyes focused on the koran he and allah will provide provide what helicopters a ship a submarine before were discovered you know the answer my egyptian friend yet you sit like your sphinx ammar turned a page without looking up tomorrow at this time you and your men will be safely back in mexico what guarantee can you give we wont all be sacrificed for the good of the cause yazid and topiltzin cannot risk our capture by international commando forces ammar said wearily for fear we might talk under torture their blossoming empires would be chipped to pieces if one of us revealed their involvement trust me arrangements have been made for our escape you must be patient what arrangements youll learn that part of the plan as soon as instructions arrive concerning the fate of our hostages the deepdyed falsehood was beginning to fray at the edges machado might see the light at any time as long as one of ammars men operated the ships communications network no signals were received while the radio was set on the wrong frequency yazid and probably topiltzin too ammar thought must be sweating if they thought he had ignored the original plan and murdered everyone on board instead of keeping them alive for propaganda purposes why not act on our own lock them all below sink the ship and be done with it machados voice came thick with exasperation killing the entire british crew the american senator and other nonmexican or egyptian nationals would not be wise you may enjoy the excitement and constant intrigue of being the object of an international manhunt captain me id prefer to live out my life in comfortable convenience stupid to leave witnesses the fool had no idea how right he was ammar thought he sighed and laid down the koran your only concern is president de lorenzo mine is president hasan and hala kamil our relationship ends there machado stood and crossed the cabin jerking open the door we better hear something damned quick he grumbled nastily i cant keep my men in check much longer they have this growing urge to place me in charge of the mission ammar smiled agreeably noon if we havent heard from our leaders by noon i will turn over command to you machados eyes widened for an instant in suspicion youd agree to step down and place me in charge why not ive accomplished what i set out to do except for the disposition of president hasan and miss kamil my job is finished ill gladly hand the final headaches to you machado suddenly grinned the devils own grin im going to hold you to that promise egyptian then maybe ill see the face behind the mask then he stepped outside the door latch had hardly clicked after machados depamm when ammar removed the miniature radio from under his coat and pressed the transmit switch ibn yes suleiinan aziz your location on the stern how many on shore six have been ferried to the old mine pier there are fifteen of us left on board including you the going is slow we only have one man boat the large eightman inflatable was slashed beyond repair sabotage it could only be the handiwork of machados men have they caused any more problems not yet the cold keeps them off the outside decks most are sitting in the lounge drinking tequila from the bar the rest are sleeping you were wise to instruct our men to become friendly with them their discipline has loosened considerably the charges all explosives have been placed in a line running parallel with the glaciers face the detonation should bring down the entire frontal wall on the ship how soon before our withdrawal can be completed the use of paddles makes for slow going under a heavy ebb tide we cant use the boats motor for fear of alerting machados men id estimate another fortyfive minutes to clear everyone off the ship we must be safely away before daylight everyone will do their utmost suiek aziz can they run the ferry operation without you yes bring one man and meet me at hasans cabin were going to execute them no replied anunar were taking them with us ammar switched off the radio and slipped the koran into a pocket of his coat his betrayal by akhmad yazid would be revenged he was going to enjoy seeing his magnificent plan turn to shambles ammar had no intention of carrying through with the original operation knowing machado had been hired to kill him and his hijack team he was angered more by the loss of his fee than by being stabbed in the back therefore he reasoned he would keep hasan and kamfl alive and yes de lorenzo too at least temporarily as bargaining chips he might recoup after all by turning the tables and throwing all guilt on yazid and topiltzin he needed time to think and create a new plan but first things first he had to sneak his hostages off the ship before machado and his motley crew caught on to his sleight of hand halas heart sank when the door opened and the hijackers leader stepped into the cabin suite she stared at him for a moment seeing only the eyes behind the ridiculous mask and the machine gun casually held in one hand and wondered with female curiosity what kind of man he might be under different circumstances he entered and spoke in a quiet but fearsome voice you will all come with me hala trembled and lowered her gaze to the floor angry at herself for showing fear senator pitt was not intimidated he jumped to his feet and crossed the cabin in long strides stopping only when the toes of his shoes nearly touched ammars where are you taking us and for what purpose the senator demanded i am not sitting in front of one of your camelwittd senate investigation committees said ammar icily do not cross examine me we have a right to know the senator insisted firmly you have no rights snapped amnw he roughly pushed the senator aside and moved into the room his gaze taking in the pale apprehensive faces youre going for a little boat ride followed by a short journey by train my men will pass out blankets to ward off the damp chill they all looked at him as if he was crazy but none argued with a dreadful feeling of hopelessness hala slowly helped president hasan to his feet she was tired of living under the constant threat of death she felt as though she no longer cared and yet something within her a spark a will to defy still smoldered the fearlessness of a soldier going into battle who knows he is going to die and has nothing to lose by fighting to the end slowly crept over her she was determined to survive captain machado entered the communication room and found it empty at first he thought ammars radio operator had taken a brief break for a call of nawm but he looked m the head and found it empty too machado stared at the radio panel for a long moment his eyes strained and red from lack of sleep his face showing a puzzled expression he stepped onto the bridge and approached one of his own crewmen who was peering into the radarscope where is the radio operator he asked the radar observer turned and shrugged i havent seen him captain isnt he in the communications room no the place is deserted would you like me to check with the arab leader machado shook his head slowly not quite able to get a grip on the egyptian radio operators disappearance find jorge delgado and bring him here he knows radios better us than the stupid arabs to oversee the communications while they were talking neither man noticed the strong blip that appeared on the radarscope indicating a lowflying aircraft passing over the center of the island even if they had been alert there was no detecting the radarinvisible stealth parachutes of dillengers special forces team as they opened them and began gliding toward the glacier pitt sat in the spartan confines of the tiltrotor osprey the bulletshaped craft lifted off the ground like a helicopter but flew like a plane at speeds in excess of six hundred kilo meters per hour he was wideawake only a dead man could sleep in those aluminum seats with ultrathin pads for cushions the weather turbulence and the engine noise that roared through the barest of soundproofing only a dead man that is except giordino he was deflated like a lifesize balloon figurethere was no other description for itwith just enough air to give it form every few minutes as if his brain was set on an automatic timer he changed position without cracking an eye or missing a breath how does he do it asked findley in frank amazement its in the genes pitt answered gunn shook his head admiringly ive seen him sleep in the damdest contortions in the darndest places and i still cant believe it when i see it the young copilot turned and peered around the back of his seat doesnt exactly suffer from stress syndrome does he pitt and the others laughed and then became quiet all wishing they didnt have to leave the cozy warmth of the aircraft for the icy nightmare outside pitt relaxed as best he could he felt some measure of satisfaction though he was not included in the assaultbetter to leave that to trained professionals in the art of hostage rescuehe was positioned close enough to tag along on the heels of hollis and his sof teams and he had every intention of following dillengers men down the scaling ropes after the attack was launched pitt sensed no foreboding premonition nor imagined any omen of death he did not doubt for an instant his father was alive he couldnt explain it even to himself but he felt the senators presence the two had a tight bond over the years they could almost read each others minds well be at your landing point in six minutes announced the pilot with a cheerfulness that made pitt cringe the pilot seemed blissfully unconcerned at flying over jagged snowcapped peaks he couldnt see all that was visible through the windshield was the flash of sleet slamming the glass and the darkness beyond how do you know where we are asked pitt the pilot a laidback burt reynolds type shrugged lazily all in the wrists he quipped pitt leaned forward and peered over the pilots shoulder no hands were on the controls the pilot was sitting with his arms folded staring at a small screen that looked like a video game only the ospreys nose showed at the bottom of the graphic display while the flashing picture was rifled with mountains and valleys that hurtled past under the simulated aircraft in a splitscreen panel in an upper corner distances and altitudes appeared in red digital numbers untouched by human hands said pitt the computer is replacing everyone lucky for us they havent developed a knack for sex the pilot laughed he reached out and made a slight adjustment with a tuning knob and radar scanners read the ground and the computer converts it to threedemensional display i plug in the auto pilot and while the aircraft darts around the terrain like a los angeles raiders running back i think about such wondrous subjects as the congressional budget and our state departments foreign policy thats news to me muttered the copilot wryly without our little electronic guide here the pilot continued undaunted wed still be sitting on the ground at punta arenas waiting for daylight and clearing weather a chime sound issued from the display screen and the pilot stiffened were coming up on our programmed landing site you better get your people ready to disembark what were your instructions from colonel hollis for dropping us off just to set you down behind the mountain summit above the mine to hide from the cruise ships radar youll have to hoof it the rest of the way pitt turned to findley any problem on your end findley smiled i know that mountain like my wifes bottom every nook and crack the summit is only two kilometers from the mine entrance an easy walk down the slope i could do it blindfolded from what i see of this rotten weather pitt muttered darkly thats exactly what youll have to do the howl of the wind replaced the whine from the ospreys turbines as the numa crew quickly exited through the cargo hatch there was no time wasted no words spoken only a silent farewell wave to the pilots within a minute the four men carrying only two tote bags were bent into the sleet and trudging up the rocky slope toward the mountains summit findley silently took the lead visibility was almost as bad on the ground as it was in the air the flashlight in findleys hand was one degree above useless the flaying sleet reflected the flashlights beam revealing the broken terrain no more than one or two meters ahead in no way did they remotely resemble an elite assault team they carried no visible weapons no two wore the same type of clothing to ward off the cold pitt had on gray ski togs giordino wore dark blue gunn was lost in an orange survival suit that looked two sizes too large findley was outfitted like a canadian lumbe ack complete with a woolly basque stocking cap pulled low over his ears the only items they had in common were yellowlensed ski goggles the wind was blowing at about twenty kilometers per hour pitt estimatedbitter but bearable the rocky uneven surface was slippery from the wet and they slid and stumbled frequently losing their balance and falling heavily every few minutes they had to wipe the buildup of sleet from their goggles soon from the front they looked like snowmen while their backs were quite dry findley raked the ground ahead with his flashlight dodging large boulders and sparse grotesque shrubs he knew he had reached the summit when he stepped onto an outcrop of bare rock and was struck by the full force of the wind not much further he said over the howl of the wind downhill all the way too bad we cant rent a toboggan said giordino gloomily pitt pulled back his glove and peered at the luminous hands of his old doxa dive watch the assault was set for five hundred twentyeight minutes away they were running late lets make time he shouted i dont want to miss the party they made good time for the next fifteen minutes the mountains slope became more gradual and findley found a narrow winding track that led to the mine farther downhill the stunted pines became thicker the rock became smaller looser and their boots were able to get a better grip thankfully the driving wind and sleet began to ease up holes in the clouds appeared and stars became visible they were able to see now without the hindrance of the goggles findley grew more confident of his surroundings as a high ore talking materialized in the blackness he skirted the pile and swung onto a small narrowgauge railroad track and began following it into the dark he was about to turn and shout were here but was cut off pitt suddenly and unexpectedly reached out grabbed the back of findleys collar and jerked him to a halt so abruptly his feet flew out from under him and he crashed on his buttocks as he fell pitt snatched the flashlight and switched it off what in hell quiet pitt rasped sharply you hear something asked gunn softly no i smell a familiar odor odor lamb somebody is barbecuing a leg of lamb they all leaned their heads back and sniffed the air by god youre right murmured giordino i do smell lamb on a grill pitt helped findley to his feet appears that someone has jumped your claim they must be dumber than a toad if they think theres any ore worth processing around here i doubt theyre excavating for zinc giordino moved off to one side before you doused the light i saw a glint over here somewhere he moved one foot around in a semicircle it struck an object that clinked and he picked it up he turned so he was facing away from the mine and flicked on a tiny penlight a bottle of chateau margaux for hardrock miners these guys have real style odd goingson here said findley whoever moved in isnt getting their hands dirty lamb and vintage bordeaux must have come from the lady flamborough gunn concluded how far away are we from where the glacier meets the fjord pitt asked findley the glacier itself is only about five hundred meters to the north the wall facing the fjord is slightly less than two kilometers west how was the ore transireported findley gestured in the direction of the fjord by this narrowgauge railroadthe tracks run from the mine entrance to the ore crusher then down to the dock where the ore was loaded on ships you never said anythipg about a dock nobody asked findley shrugged a small loading pier the pilings extend into a cove slightly off to one side of the glacier approximate distance from the ship a baseball outfielder with a good arm could lob a ball from the dock against the hull i should have seen it pitt murmured bitterly i missed it everyone missed it what are you talking about demanded findley the terrorists support team answered pitt the hijackers on the ship need an advance base for their escape they couldnt disembark at sea without detection and capture unless they had a submarine which is impossible to find without legitimate government backing the abandoned mine site makes a perfect hiding place for helicopters and they can use the narrowgauge railroad for commuting back and forth from the fjord hollis said gunn briefly wed better inform him cant said giordino our friendly neighborhood colonel refused to provide us with a radio so how do we warn hollis gunn put in no way pitt shrugged but we might help by finding and disabling their helicopters while pinning down any terrorist force in the mine camp to keep them from catching hollis and his assault teams in a vise there could be fifty of them protested findley were only four their security is lax gunn pointed out they dont expect anyone to drop in from the interior of a deserted island in the middle of a storm rudis right said giordino if they were alert theyd have been onto us by now i vote we evict the bastards we have surprise on our side pitt continued as long as we stay careful and keep undercover in the dark we can keep them off balance if they come after us asked findley do we throw rocks my life is guided by the boy scout motto replied pitt he and giordino knelt in unison and unzipped the tote bags giordino began passing around bulletproof vests while pitt handed out the weapons he held up a semiautomatic shotgun for findley you said you hunted some clayton heres an early christmas present a twelvegauge benelli super ninety findleys eyes gleamed i like it he ran his hands over the stock as lightly as though it were a womans thigh yes i like it then he noticed that gunn and giordino carried hecklerkoch machine guns modified with silencers you cant buy this stuff at a corner hardware store where did you get it special operations forces issue giordino said nonchalantly borrowed when when hollis and dillenger werent looking findley was further amazed when pitt shoved a round drum in an ancientmompson submachine gun you must like antiques theres something to be said for oldfashioned craftsman ship said pitt he looked at his watch again only six minutes remained before hollis and dillenger attacked the ship no shooting until i give the word we dont want to screw up the special forces assault they have precious little chance of surprise as it is what about the glacier findley asked wont our gunfire send out shock waves that could fracture the forward wall of ice not from this range gunn assured him our concentrated fire will seem more like the distant bang of firecrackers remember ordered pitt we want to stall off a gun battle as long as we can our first priority is to find the helicopters a pity we dont have any explosives mumbled giordino nothing ever comes easy pitt gave findley a few seconds to get his bearings then the geologist nodded and they moved out skirting the backs of the old weathered buildings keeping to the shadows stepping as quietly as possible the crunch of their soles against the loose gravel muffled by the stiff breeze that reversed and now came sweeping down the mountainside the buildings around the mine were mostly built of wooden support beams covered by corrugated metal sheeting that showed signs of corrosion and rust some were small sheds others rose two to four stories into the sky their walls trailing off into the gloom except for the smell of the roasting lamb it looked like an old american west ghost town abruptly findley stopped behind a long shed and held up a hand waiting for the other to close around him he peered around the corner once twice and then turned to pitt the recreation and dininghall building is only a few paces to my right he whispered i can make out cracks of light spilling out from under the door giordino tested the air with his nose they must like their meat well done any sign of guards asked pitt the area looks deserted where could they hide the helicopters the main mine is a vertical shaft dropping to six levels so thats out as a parking garage where then findley gestured into the earlymorning blackness the orecrushing mill has the largest open space theres also a sliding door used for storing heavy equipment if the copters rotor blades were folded they could easily squeeze three of them inside the crushing mill it is said pitt softly there was no more time to waste hollis and dillengers joint attack would begin at any minute they were halfway past the dining hall when the door suddenly opened and a shaft of light filtered through the rain cutting them off below the knees and illuminating their feet they froze guns in firing position a figure was silhouetted by the interior light for a few seconds he stepped over the threshold briefly and scraped a few morsels from a dish onto the ground then he turned and closed the door moments later pitt and the others flattened their backs against the crushingmills wall pitt turned and put his mouth to findleys ear how can we sneak in conveyor belts run through openings in the building that carried the bulk ore to the crusher and back to the train after it became slurry the only problem is theyre way over our heads lower access doors the big equipmentstorage door findley answered his murmur as soft as pitts and the main front entrance if i remember correctly theres also a stairway that leads into a side office no doubt locked said giordino morosely a bright thought pitt conceded okay the front door it is no one inside will be expecting total strangers coming to call well go in clean and quiet like we belong no surprises just one of their buddies strolling from the dining hall i bet the door squeaks giordino muttered they walked unhurriedly around a corner of the crushing nial and entered unchallenged through a high weathered door that swung on its hinges noiselessly curses giordino whispered ugh clenched teeth the interior of the building was enormous it had to be a giant mechanical machine sat in the center like a giant octopus with conveyor belts water hoses and electrical wiring for tenfacies the ore crusher consisted of a massive horizontal cylinder containing varioussized steel balls that pulverized the ore huge flotation tanks sat along one wall that had received the slurry after crushing overhead maintenance catwalks reached by steel ladders crisscrossed above the massive equipment a cord of lights hung from the catwalk railings their power produced by a portable generator whose exhaust popped away in one corner pitt had guessed wrong he had figured at least two perhaps even three helicopters to evacuate the hijackers there was only onea large british westiand commando an older but reliable craft designed for logistic support it could carry eight or more passengers if they were tightly crammed in two men in ordinary combat fatigues were standing on a high mechanics stand peering through an access panel beside the engine they were engrossed in their work and paid no notice to their predawn visitors slowly cautiously pitt advanced into the great open crushing room findley on his right giordino covering the left gunn and findley together the helicopters two crewmen did not turn from their work only then did he see an uncaring guard sitting on an overturned box behind a support beam with his back to the door pitt gestured to giordino and findley to circle around the helicopter in the shadows and search for other hijackers the guard having felt the rush of cold air from the openingandclosing door half turned to see who had entered the building pitt walked slowly toward the guard who was dressed in black combat fatigues with a ski mask over his head pitt was only two meters away when he smiled and lifted a hand in a vague greeting the guard gave him a quizzical look and said something in arabic pitt gave a friendly shrug and replied in gibberish that was lost under the sound of the generators exhaust then the guard focused his eyes on the old thompson machine gun the two seconds between puzzlement and alarm followed by physical reaction cost him painfully before he could bring up his weapon and whip sideways pitt had chopped the butt of the thompson against his skull under the black ski mask pitt caught the guard as he slumped and propped him back against the beam as though he were dozing next he ducked under the forward fuselage of the helicopter and approached the two mechanics working on the engine reaching the stand he grasped the rungs of its ladder and gave it a great heave tipping it backwards the mechanics flew through the air so startled they didnt shout their only reaction was to throw up their hands in a futile attempt to claw the air before thumping onto the hard wooden plank floor one struck his head and blacked out immediately the other landed on his side his tight arm breaking with an audible snap a painful gasp burst from his lips only to be silenced by the sudden impact of the thompson butt against his temple nice work said findley dispensing with silence every move a picture pitt muttered loftily i hope thats the lot not quite al has four more behind the chopper findley cautiously stepped under the aircraft and was astounded to see giordino sitting comfortably in a folding chair staring fiercely at four scowling captives entirely encased up to their chins in sleeping bags you always had a fetish for neat packages said pitt giordinos eyes never left his prisoners and you were always too loud what was all the noise the mechanics took a nasty fall off the maintenance stand how many did we bag seven all told four must be part of the flight crew a backup pilot and copilot plus two mechanics they werent taking any chances findley motioned to one of the mechanics one of them is coming around pitt slung his thompson over a shoulder i think well fix it so they cant go anywhere for a while you do the honors clayton bind and gag them you should find some straps inside the chopper al keep a sharp eye on them rudi and i are going to look around outside well ensure their complete immobilization said giordino speaking like a bureaucrat you better theyll kill you if you dont pitt motioned to gunn and they stripped off the upper clothing from two of their prisoners pitt snatched the ski mask and pulled the black sweater from the unconscious guard he wrinkled his nose from the smell of the unwashed sweater and slipped it over his own head then they walked out the door making no effort to appear inconspicuous they strode briskly confidently staying in the center of the road that ran between the buildings at the dining hall they cut into the shadows and peered around the edge of a window through a crack in the curtains theres got to be a dozen of them in there gunn whispered all armed to their molars looks like theyre ready to vacate the premises damn hollis pitt grunted softly if only hed given us some means of communicating with him too late now late its answered gunn if the assault had gone according to schedule holliss support forces and medics would be flying over toward the ship by now gunn was right there was no sound of the special operations forces helicopters lets find the ore train ordered pitt wed be smart to put it out of commission and cut all transportation between the mine and the ship gunn nodded and they moved silently along the wall of the dining hall ducking under the windows and halting at a corner where they paused to cautiously scan the immediate neighborhood then they swung across an open space until they reached the railroad track stepped across the rails and began sprinting between the ties a chill crept up pitts back as he tailed gunn and he clenched his fists around the stock and forward grip of the thompson with a growing sense of despair the wind and rain had stopped and the stars were quickly fading in the eastern sky something had gone terribly wrong to hollis it seemed hours since they had launched the boats the compact carrier pigeon helicopters had flown low along the rugged coastline and deposited holliss team on a small island at the mouth of the fjord without a hitch the launching was executed smoothly with effortless efficiency but the swift fourknot tidal current was far stronger than anyone had anticipated then the silent electric motor on the lead fiveman tow boat had mysteriously quit after the first ten minutes precious time was lost as the special forces men broke out the paddles and put their backs into a desperate race to close on the lady flamborough before first light matters had been worsened by the breakdown in communications to his dismay hollis was unable to notify dillenger or any of the land team he had no way of knowing whether dillenger had boarded the ship or was lost on the glacier hollis paddled and cursed the deceased motor the current at every stroke his carefully calculated timetable was down the drain the attack was far behind schedule and he couldnt risk calling it off his only salvation was the fog smoke findley had described it swirled around the small boats and the fiercely determined men cloaking them like a protecting blanket the mist and the darkness made it impossible for hollis to see more than a few meters ahead he navigated and watched over his tiny fleet through an infrared scope he kept them tightly grouped within a threemeter radius quietly giving directions over his miniature radio whenever one began to stray he turned the scope on the lady flamborough her beautiful lines now looked like a grotesque ice carving floating in front of the cracked porcelain wall of an antique bathtub hollis judged her to still be a good kilometer away after exacting its toll the tide suddenly began to slacken and their speed soon picked up almost a knot the welcome relief came almost too late hollis could see his men were wearing down under the constant arduous paddling they were men hardened by rigid training and all lifted weights on a regular basis they dug the paddles into the water noiselessly and heaved against the merciless tide but their muscles were beginning to stiffen and each stroke became an effort the protective mist was beginning to lift in his mind was the fear that they would become sitting ducks in the water hollis looked upward his confidence ebbing with the tide through the mists open patches he could see a sky that was turning from black to an ever lighter blue his boats were in the middle of the fjord and the nearest shore that offered any degree of cover was half a kilometer farther away than the lady flamborough put your backs into it men he urged were in the home stretch go for it the weary fighters reached deep for their reserve strength and increased the length and speed of their strokes it felt to hollis as if the inflatable boats were spurting through the water he put aside the scope and paddled furiously they might make it just might make it he thought hopefuly as they began to rapidly close on the ship but where was dillenger he wondered bitterly what in hell had happened to the assault team on the glacier dillenger was having no picnic himself he was even more vague on the situation immediately after jumping from the c wmsport he and his men had been immediately hurle all over the sky by the heavy blowing winds tightfaced dillenger looked up and around to see how his team was managing each man carried a small blue light but the driving sleet made it impossible for him to see them he lost them almost the instant his chute opened he reached down and pressed the switch of a little black box strapped to his leg then he spoke into his tiny transmitter this is major dillengeri have turned on my marker beacon have a sevenkilometer glide so try and stay close to me and home in on my position after you land in this crap well be lucky to come down on the island some malcontent muttered radio silence except for emergency dillenger ordered he looked down and saw nothing beyond his survivalandweapons pack that dangled on a twometer line beneath his harnesshe took his bearings from the luminous dial of a combination compass and altimeter that extended in front of his forehead like the mirror worn by ear nose and throat physicians without reference points or a homing beacon dropped on the landing zone in advancea luxury too great to risk alerttng the hijackersdillenger had to try and fly by the seat of his pants and mentally judge glide angle and distance his primary concern was overshooting the edge of the glacier and landing m the fjord he hedged his bet and came down shortnearly a full kilometer too short the glacier materialized through the darkness and dillenger saw he was descending directly over a crevasse a sudden side gust caught his rectangular canopy and it began to oscillate he jockeyed the shrouds to compensate and twisted into a landing attitude just as his dangling pack struck the inner wall of the crevasse and bounced over the lip a layer of snow cushioned his impact and he made a perfect landing on his feet only two meters from the ice fracture he popped his release and the parachute collapsed before it could be caught by the wind he didnt bother to roll it up and hide it in the ice for later retrieval there was no time to waste the taxpayers would have to eat the lost chute this is dillenger im down home in on my position he pulled a plastic whistle from a pocket of his coat and blew through it once every ten seconds while facing in a different direction for the first few minutes there was nobody to be seen then slowly the first of his men appeared and jogged toward him they had been widely scattered their progress across the uneven surface of the glacier took them far longer than dillenger had anticipated soon the others straggled in one man had suffered a broken shoulder another had cracked an ankle his sergeant favored a wrist dillenger suspected was broken but the man carried on as though it was little more than a slight sprain and dillenger needed him too badly to write him off he turned to the two injured men you wont be able to keep up with the rest of us but follow along in our tracks as best you can just make sure your lights are hooded then dillenger nodded at his sergeant jack foster lets rope together and move out sergeant ill take the lead foster gave a brief salute and began checking the team the going was treacherous across the broken ice surface yet they moved along at an easy dogtrot dillenger had no fear of falling into an open lead the line around his waist was anchored to enough beef and brawn to lift a truck off the ground twice he called for a brief stop to catch his bearings and then they were off again they crawled over jagged ice ridges and one open lead that all but defeated them they wasted seven minutes before an ice grapnel bit in the opposite side and the lightest man on the team crossed hand over hand to secure the grip another ten minutes was gone before the last man made it over a sense of urgency mushroomed inside dillenger his team was down two seven men and they were falling farther and farther behind the timetable he sullenly regretted not taking giordinos unsolicited advice and doubling his estimated time from air drop to attack he prayed the dive team wasnt waiting freezing to death in the water beneath the flamboroughs hull he tried repeatedly to signal hollis and apprise the colonel of his tardy situation but there was no reply the first faint traces of dawn were breaking behind him revealing the surface of the glacier there was a numbing desolation about it a terrifying strangeness he could also see the faint glimmering of the fjordand suddenly he realized why there was a communications breakdown hollis could see the ship clearly now without the infrared scope and if a hijacker with a keen eye had looked in the right direction hed have spied the shadows of the inflatable boats outlined against the dark gray water hollis hardly dared breathe as the distance narrowed hoping against hope hollis never let up on his plea for radio communications with dillenger shark to falcon please respond he was about to try for the hundredth time when dillengers voice abruptly boomed through his earpiece this is falcon go ahead youre late hollis hissed quietly why didnt you respond to my calls just now came within range we were out of horizontal sight of you our signals couldnt penetrate the ice wall are you in position negative dillenger said flatly weve stumbled on a delicate situation which will take a while to correct what do you call delicate a string of explosives in an ice fracture behind the glacial front armed and ready to be detonated by radio signal how long to disarm could take an hour just to find them all youve got five minutes hollis said quickly we cant wait any longer or well be dead well all be dead if the charges go off and the ice wall falls on the ship well gamble on surprise to stop the terrorists from detonating make it fast my boats can be discovered at any moment i can just make out your shadows from the glacial rim your temn goes in first hollis ordered without total darkness to cover our ascent up the hull we badly need the distraction ill meet you on the sun deck for cocktails dillenger said the tab will be on me hollis replied suddenly buoyant with expectation good luck ibn saw them he stood on the old oreloading pier along with ammar their four hostages and twenty men of the egyptian hijacking force he peered through binoculars at the figures in allblack gear who were poised on the brink of the glacier he watched as they slid down ropes slashed their way through the plastic sheet and vanished inside he lowered the glasses slightly and focused on the men in the boats clustered below the hull he observed them shoot grappling hooks from small launchers and then climb the attached lines to the maindeck level who are they asked ammar standing next to him also gazing through binoculars i cannot say suleiman aziz they appear to be an elite force i hear no battle sounds their weapons must be heavily silenced their assault operation was most efficient too efficient for any rabble yazid or topiltzin could have scraped up on short notice i believe they may be an american special operations force ammar nodded in the brightening light you may be right but how in allahs name did they find us so quickly we must leave before their support forces arrive have you signaled for the chopper it should be here shortly wat is it asked president de lorenzo what is happening ammar brushed off de lorenzo for the first time a flicker of foreboding came through in his voice it seems we left the ship at a most appropriate moment allah smiles the intruders are not aware of our presence here in another thirty minutes this island will be crawling with united states fighting men said senator pitt calmly turning the screw you might be well advised to surrender ammar suddenly turned and stared savagely at the politician not necessary senator dont look for your famed cavalry to charge to the rescue if and when they arrive there will be no one left to save why didnt you kill us on the ship hala asked bravely ammars teeth showed under the mask in a hideous smile and he did not give her the courtesy of an answer he nodded at ibn detonate the charges as you wish suleiman aziz ibn replied dutifully what charges demanded the senator what are you talking about why the explosives we placed behind the glacial wall ammar said as if it was common knowledge he gestured toward the lady flamboroughibn if you please totally expressionless ibn took a small transmitter from a coat pocket and held it out in front of him so the forward end pointed at the glacier in the name of god man pleaded senator pitt dont do it ibn hesitated staring at ammar there are hundreds of people on that ship said president hasan shock showing in every line of his face you have no reason to murder them i do not have to justify my actions to anyone here yazid will be punished for your atrocity hala murmured in a tone edged with fury thank you for making it easier ammar said smiling at hala whose face became a study in bewildered incomprehension enough of these maudlin delays quickly ibn get on with it before the stunned hostages could utter further protests fbn flicked the power switch of the transmitting unit to on and pressed the button that activated the detonators the explosion came like a curiously muffled clap of thunder the forward mass of the glacier creaked and groaned ominously then nothing appeared to happen the ice cliff remained firm and upright detonations should have occurred at eight different locations inside the fracture but major dillenger and his men had discovered and disarmed all but one charge before their search was cut off the distant thump came just as pitt and gunn were closing in on the two hijackers who were busily firing up the old mine locomotive the hijackers paused listening for a few moments exchanging words in arabic then they laughed between themselves and turned back to their work whatever caused the boom whispered gunn came as no surprise to those guys they act as if they expected it sounded like a small explosion pitt replied sourily definitely not the glacier breaking away wed have felt tremors in the ground pitt stared at the small narrowgauge locomotive which was coupled to a coal tender and five ore cars it was a type used around plantations industrial plants and mining operations quaint stout and sturdy with a tall stovepipe smokestack and round porthole windows in the cab it looked like the little engine that could standing there puffing wisps of steam around its running gear a railroad man would have classed the wheel arrangement as an indicating no leading truck wheels followed by four drive wheels with no trailing truck beneath the cab lets give the engineer and his fireman a warm sendoff pitt murmured wryly its the friendly thing to do gunn looked at pitt queerly and shook his head in bewilderment before crouching and running toward the end of the train they split up and approached from opposite sides taking cover under the ore cars the cab was brightly illuminated i by the open firebox and pitt gestured with an upturned palm signaling gunn to wait the arab who acted as engineer was busy turning valves and watching the steampressure gauges the other shoveled coal from the tender across the platform into the flames he fed a load of the black lumps onto the fiercely burning firebox paused to mop his sweating face and then slammed the door to the firebox shut with his shovel sending the cab into a state of semidarkness pitt pointed at gunn and then at the engineer gunn waved an acknowledgment grasped the grab irons and leaped up the steps into the cab pitt arrived first he calmly approached the fireman headon and said pleasantly have a nice day before the confused and astonished fireman could respond pitt had swiftly snatched the shovel out of the arabs hands and beat him over the head with it the engineer was in the act of turning around when gunn whipped him across the jaw with the heavy silencer joined to the heckler kochs stubby muzzle the arab dropped like a bag of cement while gunn guarded against intruders pitt propped both hijackers so they hung half out of the cabs side windows next he thoughtfully studied the maze of pipes levers and valves youll never do it gunn said shaking his head i know how to start and drive a stanley steamer pitt said indignantly a what an antique automobile pitt answered pull open the door to the firebox i need some light to read the gauges gunn did as he was asked and held out his hands to warm them from the flames leaping through the opening you better figure it out quick he said impatiently were lit up like a las vegas chorus line pitt pulled down a long lever and the little engine slipped forward a scant centimeter okay thats the brake i think ive figured what handle does what now when we roll past the crushing mill jump and hustle inside what about the train the cannonball express pitt replied with a wide grin does not make stops pitt released the ratchet on the forwardreverse lever and pushed it away from him next he squeezed the ratchet on the throttle bar and eased it open the locomotive crept slowly ahead accompanied by the clanging jerk of the coupled ore cars he shoved the throttle to its stop the drive wheels whirled full circle several times before they bit the rusty rails the train lurched forward and got underway the labored puffing came in faster spurts as the little engine picked up speed and chugged by the front of the dining hall the door opened and a hijacker leaned out and raised a hand as if to wave he snapped it back down when he saw the two bodies leaning from the cabs side windows he disappeared into the building as if jerked by an immense nibber band wildly shouting a warning pitt and gunn both unleashed a blast of gunfire through the windows and door of the building then the engine was past and heading toward the crushing mill pitt glanced at the ground and judged the speed to be somewhere between fifteen and twenty kilometers pitt pulled the overhead whistle lever and tied it down with a drawstring from inside his ski jacket the spurt of steam through the brass whistle cut the air like a razor get ready to jump he yelled at gunn above the earsplitting scream gunn didnt reply he stared at the rough gravel flashing past as though it were hurtling by at jet speed a thousand meters below now shouted pitt they hit the ground on the run skidding and sliding but somehow managing to keep their footing there was no hesitation no pause to catch their breath they ran alongside the train and straight up the steps of the crushingmills stairs and didnt stop until they both stumbled then tripped over the threshold and crashed to the floor inside the first thing pitt saw was giordino standing above him unconcernedly holding his machine gun in a muzzleup position ive seen you kicked out of some pretty raunchy pubs giordino said in a dour voice but this is the first time ive ever seen you tossed off a train no great loss said pitt coming to his feet it didnt have a club car the gunfire yours or theirs ours company on the way like mad hornets out of a vandalized nest replied pitt we dont have much time to prepare for a siege theyd better be careful where they aim or their helicopter might get broken an advantage well play to the hilt findley had finished tying the guard and the two mechanics together in the center of the floor and he stood up where do you want them theyre as safe as anywhere there on the floor answered pitt he looked swiftly around at the cavernous interior of the building with the crushing mill squatting in the center al you and findley grab whatever equipment or furniture you can lift and convert the ore crusher into a fort rudi and i will delay them as long as we can a fort within a fort said findley it would take twenty men to defend a building this big pitt explained the hijackers only hope of capturing their helicopter intact is to blow the main door and rush us en masse well pick off as many as we can from the windows and then retreat to the mill for a lastditch defense now i can sympathize with davy crockett at the alamo moaned giordino findley and giordino began fortifying the huge building while pitt and gunn set up shop at windows on opposite corners of the building the sun was beginning to cast its rays over the slopes on the other side of the mountain darkness was almost gone pitt could feel the wave of anxiety that washed through his mind they might prevent the arabs who were rapidly surrounding the crushing null from escaping but if the hijackers on the ship eluded the special forces teams and made a run for the mine he and his pitiful little force would be overwhelmed he looked darkly out the window at the little engine as it roared down the track on its final run picking up momentum with every turn of its drive wheels sparks belched from the stack as a long plume of smoke trailed sideways driven by a flanking wind the ore cars rattled and swayed on the narrow rails the sound of the whistle turned from a shrill shriek to the mournful wail of a lost soul in hell as the train hurtled into the distance the shock and disappointment showed clearly in ammars eyes when he realized the glacial front was not about to fall he whirled to face ibn what went wrong he demanded his voice ragged with growing anger there should have been a chain of explosions ibns face was like stone you know me well suleiman azizi do not make mistakes the explosives should have detonated the commando team we saw drop from the glacier to the ship must have found and disarmed most of them ammar stared briefly at the sky threw up his hands and let them drop again allah weaves strange patterns into our lives he said philosophically then a slow smile spread across his lips the glacier may fall yet once our helicopter is airborne we can make a pass and drop grenades into the ice fracture ibn matched ammars smile allah has not deserted us he said reverently do not forget we are safe here on sho while the mexicans have inherited the job of fighting the americans yes youre right old friend were in allahs debt for our welltimed deliverance ammar stared contemptuously at the ship well soon see if captain machados aztec gods can protect him he was a maggot that one suddenly ibn stopped and cocked an ear then gazed up the mountain slope gunfire coming from the mine ammar listened but he heard something elsethe distant cry of the locomotives whistle the sound was continuous and grew louder then he saw the plume of smoke and watched in sudden puzzlement as the train shot down the mountainside careening wildly on the curving switchbacks before barreling across a long straight stretch toward the pier what are those fools doing ammar gasped as he saw the train thundering wildly down the track heard the whistle filling the predawn with its highpitched scream the hijackers and their hostages were not prepared for the incredible spectacle now avalanching upon them like a monster on a rampage they stood petrified in disbelieving fascination allah save us a man uttered in a hoarse voice save yourself ibn snapped he was the first to recover and he began shouting for everyone to clear the tracks there was bedlam as everyone scattered away from the rails just as the ore cars pulled by the outofcontrol little engine her drive rods whipping in blurred motion shot onto the pier the wooden pilings and flooring shuddered at the sudden onslaught the tailend ore car bounced off the tracks but held by its coupling was dragged like a screaming unruly child by his ear across the tarred planking clouds of sparks sprayed as the steel wheels clattered against the rails then the engine ran out of track and soared off the end of the pier the train seemed to arc through the air for an instant in slow motion before the engine finally dropped and dived into the fiord miraculously the boiler failed to explode when its heated walls met the icy water the engine vanished with a great hiss and a cloud of steam followed by a loud grinding of to metal as the ore cars piled in on top of each other anunar and ibn dashed to the piers end and stared helplessly at the bubbles and steam rising from the water the bodies of our men were hanging from the cab said ammar did you see them i did suleiman aziz the sound of gunfire you heard a minute ago ammar said in a white rage our men must be under attack at the mine there is still a chance to escape if we hurry and help them before the helicopter is damaged ammar paused only long enough to give orders for one of his men to bring up the rear with the prisoners he set off up the narrowgauge tracks at a halfrun the other members of his hijacking force trailing behind in single file growing fear and uncertainty swelled inside ammars mind if the helicopter was destroyed there could be no escape no place to hide on the barren island the american special forces would hunt them down one by one or leave them either to freeze or starve to death ammar was determined to survive if for no other reason than to kill yazid and find the devil who was responsible for hounding him to santa inez island and devastating his intricate plans the sounds of the battle increased and reverberated down the mountain he was panting heavily from the exertion of running uphill but he gritted his teeth and increased his pace captain machado was standing in the wheelhouse when he heard felt really the muted detonation on the glacier he stiffened for a moment listening but the only sound was the light tick of a large eightday clock above the bridge windows then his face suddenly paled the glacier he thought it must be ready to break off machado hurried to the communications room and found one of his men staring dumbly at the teletype he looked up blankly at machados entr heard an explosion ance i thought i suspicion unfolded inside machados gut have you seen the radioman or the egyptian leader ive seen no one no arabs at all not in the past hour the radar operator paused i havent seen any of them since i left the dining salon and came on duty they should be guarding the prisoners and patrolling the outside decks since those are the jobs they stupidly volunteered for machado studied the empty chair at the radio thoughtfully maybe they werent so stupid he stepped to the counter in front of the helm and looked through the narrow view culs in the plastic sheeting directly in front of the bridge windows there was enough daylight now to clearly see the forward part of the ship his eyes found several wide tears in the plastic too late he saw the ropes running from the top of the glacier down through the openings too late he swung around to voice an alarm over the ships communication system he came to a dead stop before he uttered a sound there was a man standing in the doorway a man who wore allblack dress hands and what little face that showed through the ski mask were also blackened nightvision goggles hung around his neck he wore a large bulletproof chest piece with several pockets and clips holding both fragmentation and stun grenades three murderouslooking knives and a number of other killing devices machados eyes suddenly squinted who are you he demanded knowing full well he was staring at death as he spoke he made a lightning snatch of a ninemillimeter automatic pistol from a shoulder holster and snapped off a shot machado was good wyatt earp doc holiday and bat masterson would have been proud of him his shot struck the intruder square in the center of the chest with older bulletproof vests the pure force behind the blow could snap a rib or stop a heart the vests worn by the sof men however were the latest state of the art they could even stop a nato round and distribute the impact so it left only a bruse dillenger shuddered slightly from the bullet took one step back and pulled the trigger of his heckler koch all in the same motion machado wore a vest too but the older model dillengers burst tore through and riddled his chest his spine arched like a tightly strung bow and he staggered backward falling against the captains chair before dropping to the deck the mexican guard raised his arms and shouted dont fire i am unarmed dillengers short burst into the throat cut off the mexicans plea knocking him into the ships compass binnacle where he hung suspended like a limp rag doll dont move or ill shoot dillenger said belatedly sergeant foster stepped around the major and looked down at the dead terrorist hes dead sir i warned him dillenger said casually as he slipped another clip into his weapon foster kicked the body over on its stomach with his boot a long bayonet knife slipped out of a sheath below the collar and rattled on the deck intuition major asked foster i never trust a man who says hes unarmed suddenly dillenger stopped and listened both men heard it at the same time and looked at each other puzzled what in hell is that asked foster they were a good thirty years before my time but id swear thats a whistle from an old steam locomotive sounds like its coming down the mountain from the old mine i thought it was abandoned the numa people were to wait there until the ship was secure why would they stoke up an old locomotive i dont know dillenger paused and stared distantly a sudden certainty growing within him unless theyre trying to tell us something the detonation on the glacier caught hollis and the team by surprise his team entered the dining salon immediately after a wild shootout his dive team had sliced their way through the plastic and found a tight passage between the fake cargo containers they had passed wanly through a doorway into an empty bar and lounge outside the dining salon fanned out dodging pillars and four men covering the stairs and two elevators and surprised machados mexican terrorist team all but one terrorist was down he still stood where hed been hit hate and vague astonishment reflected in his dying eyes then his body collapsed and he fell to the carpet staining its rich thick pile a deep crimson hollis and his team advanced warily stepping over and around the bodies a bloodchilling of the ice wall sounded throughout the ship rattling the few undamaged bottles and glasses behind an ornate bar the special operations men stared uneasily at one another and at their colonel but they stood firm and ready major dillengers team must have missed one hollis mused calmly no hostages here sir said one of his men all appear to be terrorists hollis studied several of the lifeless faces none of them looked like they came from the middle east must be the crew from the general bravo he thought he turned away and pulled a copy of the ships deck layout from a pocket and studied it briefly while he talked into his radio major report your status met light resistance so far replied dillenger have only accounted for four hijackers the bridge is secure and weve released over a hundred crew members who were locked in the baggage hold sorry we didnt find all the charges good work you did well to disarm enough to keep the glacier from collapsing im heading for the master staterooms to free the passengers request the engineroom crew return to their station and restore power we dont dare hang around under the ice cliff a minute longer than we have to watch yourselves we took out another sixteen hijackers all latins there must be another twenty arabs still on the ship they may be on shore sir why do you say that we heard a whistle from a locomotive a couple of minutes ago i ordered one of my men to climb the radar mast and check it out he reported a train rolling down the mountain like a bowling ball he also observed it run off a nearby pier that was crowded with two dozen terrorists forget it for now lets rescue the hostages first and see to the shore when weve secured the ship acknowledged hollis led his men up the grand staircase and moved quiet as a whisper into the hallway separating the staterooms suddenly they froze in position as one of the elevators hummed and rose from the deck below the door opened and a hijacker stepped out unaware of the assault he opened his mouth the only movement he was able to make before one of holliss men tapped him heavily on the head with the silenced muzzle of his gun incredibly there were no guards outside the staterooms the men began kicking in the doors and upon entering found the egyptian and mexican advisers and presidential staff aides but no sign of hasan and de lorenzo hollis broke open the last door at the hallway burst inside and confronted five men in ships uniforms one of them stepped forward and gazed at hollis in contempt you might have used the door latch he said regarding hollis with suspicion you must be captain oliver collins yes im collins as if you didnt know sorry about the door im colonel morton hollis special operations forces by jesus an american gasped first officer finney collinss face lit up as he rushed forward to pump holliss hand forgive me colonel i thought you might be one of them are we ever glad to see you how many hijackers asked hollis after the mexicans came on board from the geeral bravo i should judge about forty weve only accounted for twenty collinss face reflected the ordeal he looked haggard but still stood tall youve freed the two presidents and senator pitt and miss kamil im afraid we havent found them yet collins rushed past him through the doorway they were held in the master suite just across the passageway hollis stood aside in surprise no one in there he said flatly weve already searched this deck the captain ran into the empty suite but saw only the rumpled bedclothes the usual light mess left by passengers his stiffbacked composure fell away and he looked positively stunned my god theyve taken them hollis spoke into his crophone major dillenger dillenger took five seconds to respond i read you colonel go ahead any contact with the enemy none i think weve pretty well rounded them up at least twenty hijackers and the vip passengers are missing you see a sign of them negative not so much as a stray hair okay finish securing the ship and have her crew move her out into the fjord no can do said dillenger solemnly problems the murdering bastards really did a number on the engine room they smashed up everything itll take a week to put the ship back in operation weve got no power at all sorry colonel here we are and here we sit these engines arent taking us anywhere they also wrecked the generators including the auxiliaries then well have to take the crew and passengers off by lifeboat using the manual winches no go colonel were dealing with genuine sadists they also trashed the lifeboats bashed the bottoms out dillengers dire report was punctuated by a deep growling noise that emanated from the glacier and traveled through the ship like a drum there was no vibration this time only the growl that turned into a heartstopping rumble it lasted nearly a minute before it finally faded and died hollis and collins were both brave menno one would ever doubt itbut each read fear in the others eyes the glacier is ready to calve said collins grimly our only hope is to cut away the anchor chains and pray the tide carries us out into the fjord believe me you wont see ebb tide for another eight hours said hollis youre talking to a man who knows youre just full of cheery news arent you colonel doesnt look encouraging does it doesnt look encouraging collins repeated is that all you have to say there are nearly two hundred people on board the lady flamborough they must be evacuated immediately i cant wave a wand and make the glacier go away hollis explained calmly i can take a few out in inflatable boats and call in our helicopters to airlift the rest but were talking a good hour collinss voice came edged with impatience then i suggest you get on with it while were all still alive he halted as hollis abruptly swung up a hand for silence holliss eyes narrowed in bewilderment as a strange voice suddenly burst over his earphone colonel hollis am i on your frequency over who the hell is this hollis snapped captain frank stewart of the numa ship sounder at your service can i give you a lift somewhere stewart the colonel burst out where are you if you could see through all that crap hanging on your superstructure youd find me cruising up the fjord about half a kilometer off your port side hollis exhaled a great sigh and nodded at collins a ship is bearing down on us any instructions collins stared at him numb with disbelief then he blurted good god yes man tell him to take us under tow working feverishly collinss crew slipped the bow and stern anchor chains and made ready with the mooring hawsers in a feat of superb seamanship stewart swung the sounders stern under the lady flamboroughs bow in one pass two heavy rope mooring lines were dropped by the crewmen of the cruise ship and immediately made fast to the survey ships deck bitts it was not the most perfect tow arrangement but the ships were not going for distance across stormy seas and the temporary expedient was accomplished in a matter of minutes stewart gave the command for slow ahead until the slack was taken up from the tow lines then he slowly increased speed to full ahead while he looked over his shoulder one eye on the glacier one on the cruise liner the sounders two cycloidal propellers one forward and one aft thrashed the water as her great diesel engine strained under the load she was half the lady flamboroughs tonnage and never meant for tug duty but she dug in and drove like a draft horse in a pulling contest black exhaust pouring from her stack at first nothing seemed to happen and then slowly imperceptibly a small bit of froth appeared around the sounders bow she was moving hauling the reluctant cruise liner from under the shadow of the glacier despite the danger the passengers crew and special forces fighters all tore away the plastic sheeting and stood on the decks watching and willing the struggling sounder forward ten meters then twenty a hundred the gap between ship and ice widened with agonizing slowness then at last the lady was clear everyone on both ships gave a rousing cheer that echoed up and down the fiord later captain collins would humorously call it the cheer that broke the camels back a loud cracking sound shattered the celebrating voices and grew into a great booming rumble to those watching it seemed as if the air was electrified then the whole forward face of the ice cliff toppled forward and pounded into the fjord like a huge oil tanker being launched on its side the water seethed and boiled and rose in a tenfoot wave that surged down the fjord and lifted the two ships like corks before heading out toward the open sea the monstrous newly calved iceberg settled into the deeply carved channel of the fjord its ice glinting like a field of orange diamonds under the new sun then the rumble rolled down from the mountainside and echoed in the ears of the stunned onlookers who couldnt believe they were somehow alive at first there was complete confusion with much shouting and wild shooting the egyptians had no idea of the size of the force that fired on them in the dining hall during the passage of the they snuffed the lights and shot at the earlymoming shadows until they realized the shadows werent shooting back the dirt roads between the wooden buildings took on an eerie silence for several minutes the egyptian hijackers made no effort to leave the dining hall then suddenly a halfdozen mentwo from the front and four at the rear of the buildingbroke from the doors scrambling crouching and diving headlong behind predetermined shelter once in position they laid down a circle of fire to cover the rest of the men who then followed on their heels their leader a tall man wearing a black turban directed the mens movements by blowing sharp biceps on a whistle after a rocky start the egyptian terrorist team was everything pitt was afraid ofhighly ed practiced and tough when it came to housetohouse street fighting they were the best in the world they were even well led the leader in the black turban was competent and methodical they searched building by building working toward the crushing mill until they halfcircled it like a crescent no haphazard assault by animars handpicked killers they moved with stealth and purpose their leader caned out in arabic when there was no reply another terrorist shouted from a different location they were hailing the guard and mechanics inside the crushing mill pitt guessed correctly they were too close now for pitt to risk revealing himself at the window he removed the terrorists ski mask and clothing and threw it in a pile on the floor then rummaged through a pocket of his ski jacket and retrieved a small mirror attached to a narrow stretch handle he eased the mirror above the window sill and extended the handle twisting it like a periscope he found the target he was looking for percent concealed but enough showing for a killing shot pitt turned the fireselect lever from full auto to single then he swiftly raised up aimed and squeezed the trigger the deadly old thompson spat black turban took two or three steps his face blank and uncomprehending then he sagged fell forward and pitched to the ground pitt dropped down lowered his gun and peered into the mirror again the terrorists had disappeared to a man they had dodged behind buildings or crawled furiously under abandoned and rusting mining equipment pitt knew they werent about to quit they were still out there dangerous as ever waiting for instructions from their secondmcommand gunn took his cue and pumped a tenround burst through a wooden door on a shed across the road very slowly the door swung open pushed by a body that twisted and dropped still there was no return fire they were nobodys fools thought pitt now that they realized they were not up against a superior force but by a small group they took their time to regroup and consider options they also realized now that their unknown oponents had captured their helicopter and were holed up in the crushing mill pitt ducked scurried over and crouched beside gunn hows it look on your side quiet theyre playing it nice and easy they dont want to dent their helicopter i think theyre going to create a diversion at the front door and then make a rush through the side office gunn nodded sounds logical about time we found better cover away from these windows anyway where do you want me pitt looked up at the catwalk above he pointed at a row of small skylights encircling a small winch tower climb up and keep watch yell when they launch the attack and welcome them with a concentrated burst through the front door then get your ass back down here they wont have any scruples about peppering the walls above the chopper on my way pitt moved around to the side office paused at the threshold and turned to giordino and findley hows it coming he asked giordino looked up from shoveling a pile of leftover ore for a barricade fort giordino will be finished on schedule findley stopped work and stared at him f before g fort findley giordino looked at findley morosely for a second before returning to his work fort findley if we lose giordino if we win shaking his head in awe pitt wondered why he was blessed with such incredible friends he wanted to say something to them express his feelings of gratitude for risking their lives to stop a band of scum when they could have bolted for the boondocks and hid out until hollis and his team arrived but they knew men like this needed no words of appreciation or encouragement there theyd stay and there theyd fight it out pitt hoped to god none would die uselessly argue about it later he ordered and ready a reception committee if they get past me he turned and entered the damp and mustysmelling office he checked his thompson and set it aside after quickly building a barrier with two overturned desks a steel filing cabinet and a heavy iron potbellied stove he lay down on the floor and waited he didnt wait long one minute later he came to unmoving attention as he thought he heard the faint crunch of gravel outside the sound stopped and then came again soft but unmistakable he raised the thompson and propped the grips on the filing cabinet too late gunn gave a yell of warning when suddenly an object crashed through the window above the door and fell rolling across the floor a second came right behind pitt dropped low and tried to burrow into the steel cabinet cursing his lack of forethought both grenades went off with an earbursting blast the office erupted in a great roar of shattered furniture and flying wood and yellowed paper the outer wall was blown outward and most of the ceiling caved in pitt was dazed by the concussion and the deafening clap of the twill blast hed never experienced an explosion in a close proximity before and he was stunned right down to his toes the potbellied stove had taken the main force of the shrapnel yet held its shape the rounded sides perforated with jagged holes the file cabinet was bent and twisted and the desks badly mutilated but the only apparent injuries pitt could find on himself were a thin but deep cut in his left thigh and a fivecentimeter gash on his cheek the office had vanished and left in its place a pile of smoldering debris and for one apprehensive moment pitt had a vision of being trapped in a blazing fire but only for a momentthe rainsoaked old wood of the building sizzled a bit in several places but refused to ignite with a conscious effort of will pitt switched the thompson to full auto and aimed the barrel at the splintered remains of the front door blood was streaming down the side of his face and under his collar his eyes never flickered as a barrage of automatic fire came pouring over his head from the guns of four men who charged through the shattered openings in the outer wall pitt felt neither remorse nor fear as he fired a long burst that blew away his attackers like trees before a tornado they threw up their weapons arms flailing in the manner of ftenzied dancers on a stage and spun crazily to the debrispiled floor three more terrorist fighters followed the first wave and were as ruthlessly stopped by pittall except one who reacted with incredible swiftness and flung himself behind a smoking shredded leather sofa cannonlike blasts went off in pins ear as findley dropped to his knees behind him and pumped loads from his shotgun into the lower base of the sofa leather burlap padding and wood sprayed the air a moment of quiet and then one of the terrorists arms flopped lifelessly beyond the sofas carved feet giordino appeared through the smoke and gunpowder fumes grasping pitt under the arms and dragging him back must you always make a mess he said grinning then into the crushingmill area and behind an old ore car his face softened with concern you hurt bad pitt wiped the blood away from his cheek and stared down at the crimson stain spreading through the fabric covering his leg damn a perfectly good pair of pants now that really pisses me off findley knelt down cut away the pants leg and began bandaging the wound you were lucky to survive the blast with only a couple of cuts dumb of me not to figure on grenades pitt said bitterly i should have guessed no sense in blaming yourself giordino shrugged this isnt our line of work pitt looked up we better get smart real fast if we want to be around when the sof guys arrive they wont try another assault from this direction findley said the blast knocked down the stairway outside theyd be sitting ducks if they tried scrambling up ten feet of broken timber now might be a ripe oportunity to burn the helicopter and get the hell out of here findley said unhappily the news gets worse and it gets better gunn said dropping from a ladder to the floor i saw another twenty of them charging up the railroad track like a prairie fire they should be here in another seven or eight minutes giordino looked at gunn suspiciously how many i stopped counting at fifteen the opportunity to flee the coop gets even riper muttered findley hollis and his men asked pitt gunn shook his head wearily no sign of them he paused to draw a deep breath and turned to stare at pitt terrorist reinforcements they were ed by four hostages with two guards i could just recognize them through my binoculars one was your dad he and a woman were helping two other men along the tracks hala kamil bless her pitt said with vast relief thank god the old man is alive the other two asked giordino most likely presidents hasan and de lorenzo so much for early retirement said findley gloomily as he placed the final piece of tape over pitts bandage the terrorists are only keeping the senator and the others alive to ensure a safe escape said pitt and wont hesitate to murder them one by one until we hand over their helicopter predicted gunn pitt nodded without a doubt but if we surrendered theres no guarantee they wouldnt murder them anywaytheyve already tried to assassinate hala twice and most certainly want hasan dead too theyll call a truce and negotiate pitt looked at his watch they wont haggle for very long they know their time is running out but we might gain a few extra minutes so whats the plan asked giordino we stall and fight for as long as it takes pitt looked at gunn were the hostages surrounded by the hijackers no they were a good two hundred meters in the rear trailing the main party up the railbed gunn replied they were herded by only two terrorists he stared back into pitts green eyes and then nodded in slow understanding you want me to take out the guards and protect the senator and the rest until hollis shows youre the smallest and the fastest rudi if anybody can get clear of the building undetected and circle around behind those two guards while we distract them you can gunn threw out his hands and dropped them to his sides im grateful for the trust i only hope i can pull it off you can that leaves only three of you to hold the fort well have to make do pitt awkwardly rose to his feet and limped over to the pile of terrorists clothing hed tossed on the floor he returned and held it out to gunn wear this theyll think youre one of them gunn stood there rooted reluctant to desert his friends giordino came to his rescue by laying a beefy hand on the smaller mans shoulder and steering him to a maintenance passage that dropped beneath the floor and ran around the giant crushing mill you can get out through here he said smiling wait until things heat up before you make your break gunn found himself half under the floor in the passage before he could protest he took one last look at pitt the incredibly durable indestructible dirk pitt who gave him a jaunty wave peerrd at giordino old steady and reliable whose concern was masked by a lighthearted expression and finally findley who flashed a sparkling smile and held up both thumbs they were all part of him and he was heartsick at leaving not knowing if he would see any of them alive again you guys be here when i get back he said you hear then he ducked under the flooring and was gone hollis paced beside the postagestampsized landing pad that the lady flamboroughs crew had hurriedly fabricated over the swimming pool a carrier pigeon helicopter settled onto the pad as a small team of men waited to board hollis stopped when he heard a fresh outburst of gunfire from the direction of the mine his face reflecting concern load and get em airborne he shouted impatiently to dillenger somebodys alive up there and fighting our battle the mine must have been the hijackers escape point said captain collins who paced at holliss side and thanks to me dirk pitt and his friends stumbled right into them snapped hollis any way you can get there in time to save them and the hostages asked collins hollis shook his head in grim despair not one chance in hell rudi gunn was thankful for the sudden downpour of heavy rain it effectively shielded him as he crawled away from the crushing mill under a string of empty ore cars once clear of the buildings he dropped down the mountain below the mine for a few hundred meters and then circled back he found the narrowgauge tracks and began walking silently on the crossties he could see only a short distance around him but within a few minutes of escaping the terrorists assault on the crushing mill he froze in position when his eyes distinguished several vague figures through the rain ahead he counted four sitting and two standing gunn faced a dilemma he assumed the hostages were resting while the guards stood but he couldnt shoot and check his assumption later he would have to rely on his borrowed terrorist clothing to bluff his way close enough to tell mend from foe his only drawback and a vital one was he only knew two or three words of arabic gunn took a breath and walked forward he said sa repeating the word two more times in a calm controlled voice the two figures who were standing took on more detail as he approached and he saw they held machine guns lowered and pointed his way one of them replied with words gunn couldnt interpret he mentally crossed his fingers and hoped they had asked the arabic equivalent of who goes there muhammad he mumbled relying on the prophets name to carry him through while lazily holding the heckler koch across his chest with the muzzle aimed off to the side gunns heartbeat calmed considerably as the two terrorists lowered their guns in unison and turned their attention back to their guard duty he moved casually until he was standing alongside them so his line of fire would not strike the hostages then while keeping his eyes aimed at the miserable people sitting on the ground between the track rails and without even looking at the two guards he squeezed the trigger ammar and his men were on the verge of total exhaustion when they reached the outskirts of the mine the persistent downpour had turned their clothes sodden and heavy they struggled over a long mound of tracks and thankfully entered a shed that once housed miningequipment parts ammar dropped onto a wooden bench his head drooped on his chest his breath coming in labored gasps he looked up as ibn entered with another man this is mustapha osman said ibn he says an armed group of commandos have killed their group leader and barricaded themselves in the crushing mill with our helicopter ammars lips drew back in anger how could you let this happen osmans black eyes registered panic we had no warning he stammered they must have come down from the mountain they subdued the sentries seized the train and shot up our living quarters when we launched our counterattack they fired on us from the crushingmill building casualties ammar demanded coldly there are seven of us left the nightmare was worse than ammar thought how many in their assault party twenty maybe thirty seven of you have of them under siege snarled ammar his tone heavy with sarcasm their number this time the truth or ibn here will slit your throat osman averted ammars eyes he was frozen in fear there is no way of knowing for certain he mumbled perhaps four or more four men did all this said ammar aghast he was seething but too disciplined to allow his anger to take control what of the helicopter is it damaged osman seemed to brighten a degree no we were careful not to fire at the section of the building where it is parked id stake my fathers honor it has not been hit only allah knows whether the commandos have sabotaged it said ibn well all see allah soon if we dont recapture it in flying condition ammar said quietly the only way we can overpower the defenders is to strike hard and penetrate from all sides and crush them by sheer weight of numbers perhaps we can use the hostages to bargain our way out said ibn hopefully ammar nodded a possibility americans are weak when it comes to death threats ill parley with our unknown scourge while you position the men for the assault take care suleiman aziz be ready to attack when i remove my mask ibn gave a slight bow and immediately began giving orders to the men ammar ripped a tattered curtain from one window the fabric had once been white but was now faded to a dingy yellow it would have to do he thought he tied it to an old broom and stepped from the shed he moved along a row of miners bunkhouses keeping out of sight of the crushing mill until he was across from it then he extended the curtain around a corner and waved it up and down no gunfire tore through the ragged flag of truce but nothing else happened either ammar tried shouting in english we wish to talk after several moments a voice yelled back no hablo inglgs ammar was taken back momentarily chilean secret police they were far more efficient than he thought he could speak fluently in english and get by in french but he knew little spanish hesitation would get him nowhere he had to see who stood in his way of a successful escape he held up the makeshift flag raised free hand and stepped out onto the road in front of the crushing mill the word for peace he knew was paz so he shouted it several times finally a man opened the main door and slowly limped onto the road stopped a few paces away and faced him the stranger was tall with intensely green eyes that never flickered and yet ignored the dozen gunbarrels poking through windows and doorways in his direction the eyes locked on ammar only the black hair was long and wavy skin weathered a deep copper from long exposure to sun slightly bushy eyebrows with firm lips fixed in a slight grinall lent the masculine but not quite handsome face a deceptive look of humorous detachment with only a trace of cold hardness there was a cut in one cheek that oozed blood and a wound on one thigh that was heavily bandaged under the slashed fabric the shape might have been lean under the bulky outof place ski suit but ammar could not e a clear assessment one hand was bare while the other was gloved and hung loosely beneath one sleeve of the ski jacket three seconds were all ammar needed to read this devilthree seconds to know he was facing a dangerous man he searched his mind for the few meager words of spanish stored there can we talk yes that would do for openers podemos hablar he shouted the suggestion of a grin widened into a casual smile porque no ammar translated that as why not hacer capitular usted why dont we cut the crap pitt said suddenly in english your spanish is worse than mine the answer to your question is no were not going to surrender ammar was too much a pro not to recover immediately yet he was confounded by the fact that his adversary wore expensive skiing clothes instead of battle gear the first possibility that crossed his mind was cia may i ask your name dirk pitt i am suleiman aziz ammar i dont really give a damn who you are pitt said coldly as you wish mr pitt ammar remarked calmly then one of his eyebrows lifted rightly you by chance related to senator george pitt i dont travel in political circles but you know him i can see a resemblance the son perhaps can we get on with this i had to interrupt a perfectly good champagne brunch to come out here in the rain annnar laughed the man was incredible you have something of mine id like it returned in firstrate condition youre speaking of course of one ummarked helicopter of course finders keepers you want it pal you come and get it ammar clenched and unclenched his fists impatiently this was not going as he had hoped he continued in a silky voice some of my men will die you will die and your father will most likely die if you do not turn it over to me pitt didnt blink you forgot to throw in hala kamfl and presidents de lorenzo and hasan and dont neglect to include yourself no reason you shouldnt fertilize the grass too ammar stared at pitt his anger slowly rising i cant believe your stubborn stupidity what will you gain by more bloodletting to put the skids under scumbags like you said pitt harshly you want a war you declare it but dont sneak around butchering women and children and taking innocent hostages who cant fight back the terror stops here im not bound by any law but my own for every one of us you murder we bury five of you i didnt come out here in the wet to discuss our political differences said ammar fighting to control his wrath tell me if the helicopter has been damaged doesnt have a scratch and i might add that your pilots are still fit to fly that make you happy you would be wise to surrender your weapons and turn over my craft and flight crew pitt shrugged screw you ammar was shaken by his failure to intimidate pitt his voice turned abrupt and cold how many men do you have four perhaps five we outnumber you eight to one pitt nodded his head at the bodies scattered beside the crushing mill youre going to have to play catchup ball the way i see it youre about nine strikes down on the scoreboard then as an afterthought he said before i forgeti give you my word i wont sabotage your chopper its yours in pristine shape providing you can take it but harm any of the hostages and i blow it from here to the nearest junkyard thats the only deal ill make that is your final word for now yes a thought crystallized in ammars mind and he was swept by a sudden revelation it was you he rasped you led the american special forces here luck gets most of the credit pitt said modestly but after i found the wreck of the general bravo and a splaced roll of plastic it all fell into place ammar stood there for a moment in profound astonishment then recovered and said you do your powers of deduction an injustice mr pitt i readily concede the coyote has run the fox to ground fox said pitt you flatter yourself dont you mean maggot ammar looked at pitt through narrowed eyes im personally going to kill you pitt and im going to take great pleasure in seeing your body shot to pieces what say you to that there was no in pitts eyes no hatred etched in his face he stared back at ammar with a kind of bemused disgust one might display in exchanging looks with a cobra behind glass at a snake farm give my regards to broadway he said turning his back on ammar and walking casually back to the door of the crushing null furious animar burled down the flag of truce and strode swiftly in the opposite direction as he moved he eased an american ruger p semiautomatic millimeter from the inside pocket of his coat suddenly he whirled whipped off his mask and went into the classic crouched stance with the ruger gripped in both hands the instant the sights lined up dead center on pitts back ammar pulled the trigger six times in quick succession he saw the bullets tear into the middle of pitts ski jacket in a ragged grouping of uneven holes watched as the concentrated impact knocked his hated enemy stumbling forward into the wall of the crushing mill ammar waited for pitt to fall his antagonist he knew with firm certainty was dead before hitting the ground gradually ammar became aware that pitt was not acting as he should pitt did not fall dead instead he turned and animar saw the devils own smile stunned ammar knew hed been outwitted he realized now pitt had expected a cowardly attack from the rear and protected his back with a bulletproof shield under the bulky ski jacket and with a numbing shock he saw the gloved hand hanging from the ve was fake a magicians trick the real hand had materialized a hand clutching a big colt automatic that protruded from the partially unzipped ski jacket ammar aimed the ruger again but pitt fired first pitts first shot took ammar in the tight shoulder and spun him sideways the second smashed through his chin and lower jaw the third shattered one wrist as he threw it up to his face the fourth passed through his face from side to side ammar rolled to the gravel and sprawled on his back uncaring and oblivious to the gunfire that erupted over him not knowing that pitt had leaped uninjured through the door of the crushing mill before ammars men belatedly opened fire he was only vaguely aware of ibn dragging him to safety behind a steel water tank as a short burst of fire from inside the crushing mill sprayed the ground around them slowly his hand groped up ibns arm until he clutched the solidmuscled shoulder then he pulled his friend downward i cannot see you he rasped ibn removed a large surgical pad from a pack on his belt and gently pressed it over the torn flesh that once held ammars eyes allah and i will see for you said ibn ammar coughed and spit out the blood from the shattered chin that had seeped down his throat i want that satan pitt and the hostages hacked to pieces our attack has began their lives are measured in seconds if i die kill yazid you will not die ammar went ugh another coughing spasm before he could speak again no matter the americans will destroy the helicopter now you must escape the island another way leave leave me that is my final request of you wordlessly without acknowledging the plea ibn lifted ammar in his arms and began walking away from the scene of the battle when ibn spoke his voice was hoarse but soft be of strong spirit suleiman aziz he said we will return to alexandria together pitt barely had time to leap through the door whip off the two bulletproof vests from under the back of his coat replace one in the front and return the second to giordino before a hail of concentrated fire drilled through the thin wooden walls now the jacket is ruined pitt grunted pressing his body into the floor youd have been dead meat if hed plugged you in the chest said giordino wiggling into his vest howd you know he was going to shoot when your back was turned he had bad breath and beady eyes findley began scrambling from window to window throwing grenades as fast as he could yank the activating pins theyre here he yelled giordino rolled across the plank floor and poured a continuous fire from behind a wheelbarrow full of ore pitt snatched up the thompson just in time to stop two terrorists who had somehow managed to climb into the shattered side office ammars small army charged the building from all sides with guns blazing there was no stopping the tide of the savage onslaughtthey swarmed in everywhere the sharp crackle of the terrorists smallcaliber aks and the deep stutter of pitts caliber thompson were punctuated by the boom of findleys shotgun giordino fell back to the crushing mill laying down a covering fire for pitt and findley until all three had reached the temporary protection of their mickey mouse fort the terrorists were momentarily stunned to find no enemy throwing up their hands in surrender once inside the building theyd expected to inundate their unprotected enemy with sheer numbers instead they found themselves caught naked by a withering fusillade from the mill and were cut down like milling cattle pitt giordino and findley decimated the first wave but the arabs were fanatically brave and they learned fast an intensified gunfire and the blast from several grenades engulfed the cavernous room ahead of the next assault bedlam the dead heaped the floor and the arabs took cover behind the bodies of their dead comrades it was a firefight sceneguns blasting grenades exploding the shouts and curses in two languages from two culmms as different as night and day the budding shook from the reverberations of gunfire and the concussions of the grenades shrapnel and bullets flayed the sides of the gmt mechanical mill like sparks from a bucket of molten steel the air was filled with the pungent smell of gunpowder fire broke out in a dozen places and was completely ignored giordino threw a grenade that blew off the tail rotor of the helicopter even with the last hope of escape gone now the arabs irrationally fought all the harder pitts ancient thompson slammed deafeningly and then stopped he ejected the fiftyround rotary dnun and inserted anotherhis last there was a cold calculated determination hed never felt before he and giordino and findley had no intention of throwing in the towel they had long passed the point of no return and found no fear of death behind it they hung on grimly fighting for their very existence tenaciously giving better than they received three times the arab terrorists were driven back and times they charged forward in the face of the murderous fire their badly diminished force regrouped again and launched a final suicide assault closing the ring tighter and tighter the arab mushm could not understand their enemys ferocity how they could fight with such bloodyminded precision why they were so outrageously defiant the americans fought desperately only to live while they themselves sought a blessed death and martyrdom as salvation pitts eyes stung from the smoke and tears streamed down his cheeks the whole cnishing mill was vibrating bullets ricocheted off the steel sides like angry hornets four of them tearing through pitts sleeve and slightly grazing the skin recklessly the arabs threw themselves against the crushing mill and scurried over the makeshift barricade the shooting match quickly turned into a mantoman struggle as the two groups met in a savage brawling mass of bodies findley went down as two bullets struck him in his unprotected side yet he remained on his knees feebly swinging his empty shotgun like a baseball bat giordino wounded in five places gamely heaved ore rocks with his right hand his left arm dangling useless from a bullet through the shoulder pitts thompson fired its last cartridge and he hurled the big gun in the face of an arab who suddenly up before him he yanked the colt automatic from his belt and fired at any face that lurched through the smoke he felt a stinging sensation at the base of the neck and knew hed been hit the colt quickly emptied and pitt fought on chopping the heavy gun like a small club he began to taste the begininggs of sour defeat reality no longer existed pitt felt as if he were fighting a war a grenade went off a crushing explosion that deafened him by its closeness a body fell on top of him and he was caught off balance and thrown backward his head struck against a steel pipe and an expanding ball of fire flashed inside his head and then like a wave breaking in the surf the nightmare swept over and smothered him the special operations forces landed and regrouped behind the ore tracks that shielded their approach from the mine buildings they quickly spread out in a loose battle formation and waited for the command to move in the snipers established their positions around the mine lying flat and watching for movement through their scopes hollis with dillenger at his side crawled up to the summit of the tracks and cautiously peered over the scene had the look of a graveyard the ghost mine was an eerie stage for a battle but the cold rain and barren mountainside seemed an appropriate backdrop for a killing ground the dull gray sky fell and gave the decaying buildings the look of a place that didnt belong to any world the firing had stopped two of the outer buildings were blazing fiercely the smoke rolling into the low overcast hollis counted at least seven bodies littering the road on one side of the crushing mill i hate to sound mundane said hollis but i dont like the look of it no sign of life agreed dillenger peering through a pair of small but powerful binoculars hollis carefully studied the buildings for another five seconds and then spoke into his transmitter all right lets mind our step and move in one moment colonel a voice broke in hold the order snapped hollis sergeant baker sir on the right flank i have a group of five people approaching up the railroad track they armed no sir they have their hands in the air very good you and your men round them up watch for a trap major dillenger and i are on our way hollis and dillenger snaked around the mine takings until they found the railroad and began jogging along it toward the fjord after about seventy meters several human figures took form through the pouring rain sergeant baker came forward to report we have the hostages and one terrorist colonel youve rescued the hostages hollis exclaimed loudly all four of them yes sir replied baker theyre pretty well worn out but otherwise theyre in good shape nice work sergeant said hollis pumping bakers hand in undisguised exuberance both officers had memorized the faces of the two presidents and the united nations secretarygeneral during the flight from virginia they were already familiar with senator pitts appearance from the news media they hurried forward and were enveloped in a great surge of relief as they recognized all four of the missing vips much of their relief turned to surprise when they saw the terrorist prisoner was none other than rudi gunn senator pitt stepped forward and shook holliss hand as gunn made the introductions are we ever glad to see you colonel said the senator beaming sorry were late mumbled hollis still not sure what to make of it all hala embraced him as did hasan and de lorenzo then it was dillengers turn and he went red as a tomato mind telling me whats going on hollis asked gunn gunn took grim delight in rubbing it in it seems you dropped us off at a very critical point colonel we found almost twenty terrorists at the mine along with a hidden chopper they planned to use in clearing off the island you didnt see fit to include us in your communications so pitt tried to warn you by sending a runaway train down the mountain into the fjord dillenger nodded in understanding the helicopter explains why the arab hijackers deserted the ship and left the mexicans to fend for themselves and the chopper was their transportation from the mine gunn added hollis asked where are the others last i saw of them before pitt sent me to rescue his father and these people they were under siege inside the crushing mill building the four of you took on close to forty terrorists dillenger asked incredulously pitt and the others kept the arabs from escaping as well as creating a diversion so i could rescue the hostages the odds were better than ten to one against them stated hollis they were doing a pretty good job of it when i left answered gunn solemnly hollis and dillenger stared at each other wed better see what we can find said hollis senator pitt came over colonel rudi has told me my son is up at the mine id like to tag along with you sorry senator i cant permit it until the area is secure gunn put his arm around the old mans shoulder ill see to it senator dont worry about dirk hell outlive us all thank you rudi i appreciate your kindness hollis was not so confident they must have been wiped out he muttered under his breath to dillenger dillenger nodded in agreement hopeless to think they could survive against a heavy force of trained terrorists hollis gave the signal and his men began moving like phantoms through the mine buildings as they neared the crushing mill they began to find the litter of dead awesome they counted n bodies crumpled in ragdoll positions on the road and ground outside the crushingmill building was riddled with hundreds of bullet holes and showed the splintered results of grenades not a single pane of glass was left intact anywhere every entry door had been blown into splinters hollis and five men cautiously entered through holes blown in the walls while dillenger and his team approached from the shattered opening that was once the front main entrance small fires burned and smoldered everywhere but had not yet joined to build a major conflagration two dozen bodies were heaped about the floor several stacked against the front of the ore crusher the helicopter stood amazingly clean and pristine with only its tail section in mangled condition three men still lived among the carnagemen who looked so smokeblackened so bloody in such awful shape that hollis couldnt believe his eyes one man was lying on the floor his head resting in the lap of another whose hand was held in a gorestained sling one stood swaying on his feet blood streaming from wounds on one leg the base of his neck where it met the shoulder the top of his head and the side of his face not until hollis was only a few meters away did he recognize the battered men before him he was absolutely shocked he couldnt see how those three pitiful wrecks had kept the faith and won out over fearsome odds the special operations forces grouped around in silent admiration rudi gunn smiled from ear to ear hollis and dillenger stood there wordlessly then pitt painfully straightened to his full height and said about time you showed up we were running out of things to do part iv october washington dc dale nichols and martin brogan stood waiting on the white house steps as the president stepped from his helicopter and walked swiftly across the lawn you have something for me the president asked expectantly as he shook hands nichols could not contain his excitement weve just received a report from general dodge his special operations forces have retaken the lady flamborough intact in southern chile senator pitt hala kamil and presidents de lorenzo and hasan were rescued in good condition the president was weary from a series of nonstop conferences with the canadian prime minister in ottawa but he brightened like a streetlight thank god that is good news were there any casualties two sof men were wounded neither seriously but three numa people were shot up pretty badly reported brogan numa people were on the scene dirk pitt was responsible for tracking down the cruise ship he and three others kept the hijackers from escaping along with their hostages so he helped save his own father he certainly deserves a major share of the credit the president rubbed his hands together happily its al most noon gentlemen why dont we celebrate with a bottle of wine over lunch and you can give me a full report secretary of state douglas oates alan mercier the presidents national security adviser and julius schiller also joined the group for lunch after dessert mercier passed around copies of the transcribed report from general dodge the president toyed with his fork as he read the transcript then he looked up a mixture of surprise and triumph on his face topiltzin hes in it up to his ears said brogan topiltzin provided the mexican terrorist crew and die vessel for the switch with the cruise ship so he did conspire with his brother on the lady flamborough hijacking the president said confidentially nichols nodded the facts add up that way but it wont be easy to prove any idea as to the identity of the mastermind behind the operation we have a make replied brogan briefly this is a condensed file on the man he paused to hand the president another folder he did a remarkable job of disguising himself to look like the captain of the ship during the capture and then he changed to a mask later dirk pitt met face to face with him during a truce before the fighting the name he gave was suleiman aziz ammar seems odd this ammar got lax and dropped his name mused schiller must be an alias brogan shook his head the name is real enough we have a comprehensive packet on him so does interpel ammar must have figured pitt was as good as dead and had nothing to lose by identifying himself the presidents eyes narrowed according to your file hes suspected of being directly or indirectly involved with over fifty murders of prominent government officials is this possible suleiman aziz ammar is rated at the very top of his profession a diehard terrorist assassin brogan corrected the president ammar specializes only in political assassination coldblooded as they come big on disguise and detailed planning as the words of the song go nobody does it better half his hits were so clean they were written off as accidents hes a muslim but hes taken on jobs for the french and germans and even the israelis gets top dollar hes amassed a considerable fortune for his successful operations in and around the mediterranean was he captured no sir brogan admitted he was not among the dead or wounded the man escaped the president asked sharply if he still lives ammar cannot get far brogan assured him pitt he pumped at least three bullets into him an extensive manhunt has been activated there is no escape from the island he should be found in a few hours hell be a major intelligence coup if he can be persuaded to talk said nichols general dodge has already alerted his field commander colonel morton hollis to take every precaution in capturing animar alive but the colonel thinks there is good reason to believe ammar will kill himself when cornered nichols shrugged resignedly hollis is probably right there were no other survivors among the hijackers the president asked brogan eight we can interrogate but they appear to be only ammars hired mercenaries and not radical yazid followers well need their confessions to prove ammar was working for yazid and topiltzin said the president without optimism schiller did not feel there was a setback look on the bright side mr president the ship and hostages have been rescued without injury president hasan knows damn well yazid wanted him dead and was behind the hijacking hell go after yazid now with a vengeance the president looked at him and then his eyes traveled from face to face is that the way you gentlemen see it julius has a good grasp of hasan said mercier he can be real nasty if hes crossed doug oates nodded in agreement barring unforeseen developments i think juliuss projection is right on the money hasan may not go so far as to risk riots and ignite a revolution by arresting yazid and trying him for treason but hell certainly take off the gloves and do everything short of murder to destroy yazids credibility there will be a backlash against yazid brogan predicted egypts muslim fundamentalist moderates do not condone terrorist tactics theyll turn their backs on yazid while the countrys parliament gives president hasan overwhelming support also in my best rosecolored view the military will climb down out of its ivory tower and reaffirm its loyalty to hasan the president took a final swallow of wine and set the glass on the table i must confess i like what i hear the crisis in egypt is far from over warned secretary oates yazid may be pushed out of the limelight for a while but in president hasans absence the moslem brotherhood of fundamentalist fanatics has formed an alliance with the liberal and socialist labor parties together theyll work to undemiine hasans nile to bring egypt under islamic ties with the united states and scuttle israeli peace agreements the president tilted his head at schiller do you subscribe to dougs doomsday canvas julius schiller nodded grimly i do martin brogans solemn expression told it all the inevitable has only been stalled off hasans government must eventually fall the militarys support will be here today and gone tomorrow my best brains at langley project a fairly bloodless coup eighteen to twentyfour months from now i recommend we take a handsoff waitandsee attitude mr president said oates and study our options in dealing with another muslim government youre suggesting an isolationist approach said the president maybe its time we took that stance suggested schiller nothing of substance your predecessors attempted in the last twenty years worked the russians will lose too added nichols and our big consolation is in keeping paul capesterre also known as akhmad yazid from creating another iranian disaster he would have worked to destroy our middle east interests at any cost i do not entirely agree with your overall picture said brogan but in the time we have left we still have the opportunity to cultivate the next man to rule egypt a questioning frown crossed the presidents face what do you have in mind egypts defense minister abu hamid you think hell seize the government when the time is ripe yes brogan explained patiently he has the power of the military in his pocket and hes shrewdly sought strong support from the moderate muslim fundamentalists in my opinion abu hamid is a shooin we could do much worse murmured oates with a thin smile he hasnt been above accepting favors and tapping some of the billions of dollars weve poured into egypt abu hamid would not be the type to kick a gift horse in the mouth oh sure hed make the required noises condemning israel and cursing the us for the sake of the religious fanatics but underneath the rhetoric hed keep a friendly line of communications open the fact that hes on close terms with hala kamfl wont hurt us either nichols said flatly the president was silent staring into the glass of zinfandel as if it was a crystal ball then he raised the glass to a continued friendly union with egypt hear hear said mercier and brogan in unison to egypt murmured oates and mexico added schiller the president glanced at his watch and rose followed by his advisers sorry to cut this short but i have a meeting with a group of treasury people congratulate everyone involved in rescuing the hostages for me he turned to oates i want to meet with you and senator pitt the minute he returns to discuss any words he had with president hasan during their ordeal id be more interested in hearing what he learned from president de lorenzo on the crisis south of our border egypt is of secondary importance compared to mexico we can safely assume akhmad yazid has been benched for the rest of the season but topiltzin is a far worse threat concentrate on him gentlemen god help us if we cant stabilize the upheaval in mexico slowly reluctantly pitt rose from the black depths of a sound sleep to the brightly lit surface of consciousness only to find it was accompanied by stiff aching pain he tried to go back and reenter the comforting void but his eyes blinked open and it was too late the first thing he focused on was a smiling red face well well hes back among the living said first officer finney cheerfully ill go and inform the captain as finney passed through the door pitt moved his eyes without moving his head and found a little baldheaded sitting in a chair beside the bed the ships doctor pitt recognized but the name escaped him im sorry doctor but i cant recollect your henry webster he secondguessed pitt smiling warmly and if youre wondering where you are youre in the finest suite on board the flamborough which is currently under tow by the sounder for punta arenas how long have i been unconscious while you weremaking your report to colonel hollis i was tending to your wounds soon afterward i put you under heavy sedation youve been out for about twelve hours no wonder im starving ill see our chef personally sends down one of his specialties how are giordino and findley most admirable of you to inquire of your friends before yourself giordino is a very durable man i took four bullets from him none in critical areas he should be ready to party by new years eve findleys wounds were far more serious bullets entered his right side and lodged in a lung and kidney i did what i could for him on the ship he and giordino were airlifted to punta arenas and flown to washington soon after i put you out findley will be operated on by bulletwound specialists at the walter reed medical center if there are no complications he should pull through in fine shape by the way your friend rudi gunn felt they needed him more than you did so he accompanied them home before pitt could make a reply a digital thermometer was slipped in and out of his mouth dr webster studied the reading and nodded as for you mr pittyoull mend nicely how are you feeling i dont think im up to entering a triathlon but except for a throb in my head and a stinging sensation in my neck ill manage youre a lucky man none of the bullets struck a bone internal organ or artery i stitched up your leg and neck or more accurately your trapezius muscle also your cheek plastic surgery should hide the scar unless of course your women find it adds to your sex appeal the smack on your head caused a concussion xrays showed no sign of a hairline fracture my prognosis is that youll be swimming the english channel and playing the violin within months pitt laughed almost immediately he tensed as the pain struck from every side websters look became one of quick concern i am sorry my bedside manner tends to get a bit too jolly im afraid pin relaxed and the agony soon subsided he loved english phrasing and humor they were a class act he thought he smiled grimly and stared at webster with unconcealed respect he knew the doctor had down played his skill and labors out of modesty if that hurt said pitt i cant wait to get your bill it was websters turn to laugh careful i wouldnt want you to ruin my beautiful needlework pitt gingerly eased himself to a sitting position and held out his hand im grateful for what you did for the four of us webster rose and shook pitts outstretched hand an honor doctoring you mr pitt ill take my leave now it seems youre the man of the hour i think you have some distinguished visitors gathering outside goodbye doc and thank you webster gave a willk and a nod then he walked over to the door opened it and motioned everyone inside senator pitt entered followed by hala colonel hollis and captain collins the men shook hands but hala leaned down and lightly kissed pitt i hope youve found our ships service satisfactory said captain collins jovially no man ever recuperated in a fancier hospital pitt replied im only sorry i cant bask in such luxury for another month unfortunately your presence is required up north by tomorrow said hollis oh no pitt moaned oh yes said the senator holding up his watch the sounder will be towing us into dock at punta arenas in another ninety minutes an air force transport is waiting to fly you and ms kaniil and me to washington pitt made a helpless gesture with both hands so much for my luxury cruise next came the usual round of solicitous questions concerning his condition after a few minutes hollis turned the conversation to his current problem would you know ammar if you saw him again he asked pitt i could pick him out of a lineup easily enough didnt you find him i gave you a detailed description of his height weight and looks before doc webster knocked me out hollis handed him a small stack of photos here are pictures taken and processed by the ships photographer of the hijackers bodies including those taken prisoner do you see suleiman aziz ammar among them pitt slowly sifted through the photographs studying the closeup features of the dead they had seemed faceless during the battle he recalled he wondered with morbid curiosity which ones were dead by his hands finally he looked up and shook his head hes not in here among the living or the dead youre sure asked hollis the wounds and deathlike expressions can badly alter facial features i stood closer to him than i am to you under conditions that arent easily forgotten believe me colonel when i say ammar isnt among those pictures hollis pulled a larger photo from an envelope and passed it to pitt without comment after a few seconds pitt gave hollis a questioning look what do you want me to say is that suleiman aziz ammar pitt handed the photograph back you know damn well it is or you wouldnt magically produce a picture taken of him at a different time in a different place i think what colonel hollis is holding back said dirks father is that anunar or his remains have yet to be found then his men must have hidden his body pitt said firmly i didnt miss he took a shot in the shoulder and two in the face i saw one of his men drag him to cover after he fell no way hes running around its possible his body was buried admitted hollis an extensive air and land search failed to detect any sign of him on the island so the fox hasnt been run to ground pitt said softly to himself the senator looked at him what was that something ammar said about a coyote and a fox when we met pitt replied pensively then he looked around at his audience i bet hes eluded the net anyone care to give me odds hollis gave pitt a dark look instead you better hope hes deader than a barracuda in the desert because if he isnt the name of dirk pitt will head his next hit list hala swept gracefully to the head of pitts bed wearing a gold silk dressing gown with a modernized hieroglyphic design she placed her hand lightly around his shoulder dirk is very weak she said in an even voice he needs a good meal and rest until it comes time to debark the ship i suggest we leave him alone for the next hour hollis slipped the photos back in the envelope and rose ill have to say my goodbyes a helicopter is waiting to take me back to santa inez to continue the search for ammar give my best to major dillenger i shall hollis seemed uneasy for a moment then he approached the bed and shook hands i apologize dirk to you and your friends i sadly underrated you all anytime you want to transfer from numa to special operations forces ill be the first to sign a recommendation i wouldnt fit in too well pitt grinned i have this allergy to taking orders yes so youve demonstrated hollis said smiling faintly the senator walked over and squeezed pitts hand see you on deck ill bid my farewell there also said captain collins hala said nothing she herded the men from the room then she slowly closed the door and turned the lock she walked back until she stood beside the bed the folds of the gown plunged and there was something in the casual way it draped her body that convinced pitt she was naked beneath she proved it by loosening the sash and shrugging the gown from her shoulders he heard the whisper of the silk as it slid down her soft flesh she posed like a bronze statue breasts thrust out hands flattened against her thighs one leg slightly in front of the othershe reached down and pulled back the bedcovers i owe you something she said huskily pitt caught his reflection in the mirrors on the closet doors he wore only white gauze top of his head and the side of his face were swathed in bandages as was one side of his neck and the wounded leg he hadnt shaved in a week and the whites of his eyes were red in his mind he looked like a derelict any selfrespecting bag lady would reject im a sorry excuse for don juan he murmured youre handsome in my eyes hala whispered as she gently lay beside him and gently entwine her fingers through the hairs of his chest we must hurry we have less than an hour pitt let out a long sigh he would catch hell from doc webster if he overexerted and pulled out his stitches abject surrender why is it he wondered men plan more covert schemes than an intelligence agency to seduce women only to have them turn on under crazy circumstances when you least expect it he was more convinced than ever that james bond really didnt have it all that great when ammar awoke he saw only blackness his shoulder felt as though a piece of coal were burning inside his flesh he tried to lift his hands to his face but one hand exploded with pain then he remembered bullets slamming into his wrist and shoulder he raised his good hand to touch his eyes but the fingertips felt only a tightly bound cloth that wrapped around his head covering his face from forehead to chin he knew his eyes were beyond saving not for him a life of blindness he thought he groped around for a weapon anything to kill himself all he touched was a damp flat rock surface ammar became desperate unable to repress the fear of helplessness he struggled to his feet stumbled and fell then two hands gripped his shoulders do not move or make a cry suleiman aziz came the whispered words of ibn the americans are searching for us ammar clutched ibns hands for assurance he tried to speak but could no longer utter coherent words only animallike guttural sounds came through the bloodcaked wrapping supporting his shattered jaw we are in a small chamber inside one of the mine tunnels ibn spoke softly into his ear they came very close but i had time to build a wall that concealed our hiding place ammar nodded and desperately tried to make himself understood it was as though ibn could reach through the pitch ess and read ammars thoughts you wish to die suleiman aziz no you will not die we will go together but not one minute before allah decides ammar slumped in despair he had never felt so disoriented so completely out of control the pain was unbearable and the thought of living out his days in a maximumsecurity jail cell blind and mutilated devastated him all instinct for selfpreservation had deserted him he could not stand being dependent on anyone for his hourly existencenot even ibn rest my brother said ibn gently you will need all your strength when it comes time for us to escape the island annnar collapsed and rolled to his side his shoulders came against the tunnels uneven floor it was wet and the moisture seeped through his clothing but he was suffering too much pain to notice the added discomfort he became more and more despondent his failure had become a horror he saw akhmad yazid standing over him smirking then a curtain slowly formed and parted deep in the recesses of ammars mind a faint glow appeared a glow that bloomed and then burst in a blinding flash and in that one chilling moment he glimpsed the future he would survive through revenge mentally he spoke the word over and over until at last his selfdiscipline returned the first decision he came to grips with was who should die at his own hands yazid or pitt he could not act alone he was no longer physically capable of assassinating both men himself already a plan was forming he would have to trust ibn to share in the revenge ammar anguished over the decision but in the end he had no choice ibn would draw the coyote while ammars final act would be to slay the viper pitt refused to fly home on a stretcher he sat in a comfortable executive chair leg propped on the seat of a facing chair and stared out the window at the snowcapped spires of the andes far off to the right he could see the green plateaus that marked the beginning of the brazilian highlands two hours later a distant gray haze advertised the crowded city of caracas and then he was gazing at the horizon line where the turquoise of the caribbean met a cobaltblue sky from meters the windmased water looked like a flat sheet of crepe paper the air force vip transport jet was crampedpitt could not stand to his full heightbut quite luxurious he felt as though he were sitting inside a rich kids highpriced toy his father was not in a talkative mood the senator spent most of the flight working out of a briefcase making notes for his briefing to the president what little conversation took place was onesided when pitt asked how he happened to be on the lady flamborough at punta del este the senator didnt bother to look up when he responded a presidential mission he said tersely closing off any further questions on the subject hala also kept to herself and attended to business she had the aircrafts inflight telephone in constant use firing off in structions to her aides at the united nations building in new york her only acknowledgment of pitts presence was a brief smile when their eyes happened to meet how quickly they forget pitt thought idly he turned his mind to the search for the alexandria library treasures he considered cutting in on halas phone monopoly for a progress report from yaeger but he drowned his curiosity with a dry martini courtesy of the aircraft steward instead deciding to wait and learn whatever there was to learn at first hand from lily and yaeger what river had venator sailed before burying the priceless objects it could be any one of a thousand that course into the atlantic between the saint lawrence in canada to the rfo de la plata of argentina no not quite yaeger theorized the serapes had taken on water and made repairs off what was to become new jersey the unknown river had to be south much further south than the rivers that flow into chesapeake bay could venator have led his fleet into the gulf of mexico and up the mississippi todays stream must be far different from what it was sixteen hundred years ago perhaps he had sailed into the otinoco in venezuela which could be navigated for two hundred miles or maybe the amazon he let his mind wander through the irony of it all if junius venators voyage to the americas was absolutely proved by the discovery of the buried library artifacts history books needed to be revised and new chapters written poor leif eriksson and christopher columbus would be relegated to footnotes pitt was still daydreaming when he was interrupted by the steward telling him to fasten his seat belt it was dusk and the aircraft had dipped its nose and was dropping into the long glide toward andrews air force base the twinkling sprawl of washington slid past and pitt soon found himself hobbling down the steps on a cane hastily bent from an aluminum tube and presented by the grateful crew of the lady flamborough he set foot on the concrete at almost exactly the same spot as on his arrival from greenland hala came down and bid him goodbye she was continuing on with the plane to new york youve become a treasured memory dirk pitt we never did make our dinner date the next time youre in cairo its on me the senator overheard and came over cairo ms kamil not new york hala gave him a smile worthy of the beautiful aphrodite i am resigning as secretarygeneral and returning home democracy is dying in egypt i can do more to keep it alive by working in the midst of my people what of yazid president hasan has vowed to place him under house arrest a frown crossed senator pitts face be careful yazid is still a dangerous man if not yazid there is always another maniac waiting in the wings her soft dark eyes belied the fear that rode in her heart she gave him a daughterly hug tell your president egypt will not become a nation of insane fanatics ill pass along your words she turned back to pitt she was on the brink of falling in love with him but fought her feelings with every bit of will she possessed her legs felt weak as she took both his hands and stared upward into his ageless face for an instant in her minds eye she saw herself entwilled with his body caressing his muscled skin and then just as quickly she erased the thought she had found brief fulfillment with him long denied but she knew she could never divide her love for one man with that for egypt her life belonged to those who had no life except misery and poverty she kissed him tenderly do not forget me before pitt could answer hala had turned and hurried up the steps into the aircraft he stood looking at the empty entrance for a long moment the senator read his thoughts and interrupted them theyve sent an ambulance to take you to the hospital hospital pitt said vacantly still watching as the door closed the jet engines whistled as the pilot increased the rpm and began to taxi toward the main strip pitt tore the bandages from around his head and face and threw them into the jets exhaust where they were caught and sent swirling through the air like airborne snakes only when the plane was airborne did he make his reply im not going to no damned hospital over doing it a bit dont you think the senator said with paternal concern full knowing it was a waste of breath to preach to his independentminded son how are you getting to the white house asked pitt the senator nodded toward a waiting helicopter about a hundred meters away the president arranged my transportation mind dropping me at numa his father looked at him slyly youre speaking figuratively of course pitt grinned you never let me forget which side of the family my sadistic sense of humor came from the senator slapped his arm around pitts waist come on you crazy nut let me help you over to the helicopter the tension built like a twisting knot in his stomach as pitt stood in the elevator watching the numbers rise toward numas computer complex lily was standing in the foyer as the doors parted and he stepped out she wore a big smile that froze when she saw the bedraggled look the long scab on his cheek the hump of the bandage beneath a knit fishermans turtleneck sweater borrowed from his father the dragging leg and cane then she bravely broke out the smile again welcome home sailor she stepped forward and threw her arms around his neck he winced and groaned under his breath she jumped back oh im sorry pin clutched her dont be then he mashed his lips against hers his beard scraped against her skin and he smelled of ginand delightfully masculine theres something to be said for men who only come home once a week she said finally and for women who wait he said stepping back he glanced around what have you and hiram found out since i left ill let hiram tell you she answered airily taking him by the hand and leading him across the computer installation yaeger charged out of his office without a word of greeting or sympathy for pitts wounds he came straight to the heart of the breakthrough weve found it he announced grandly the river pitt asked anxiously not only the river but i think i can put you within two square miles of the artifacts cavern where texas a little border town called roma yaeger had the smug complacent look of a tyrannosaurus rex that had just dined on a brontosaurus nwned for seven hills just like the capital of italy pretty low insignificant hills i admit but there are also reports of roman artifacts supposedly having been dug up in the area scoffed at by accredited archaeologists of course but what do they know then the river is the rio bravo as its called in spanish yaeger nodded better known on this side as the rio grande the rio grande pitt repeated the words slowly savoring each syllable to the full finding it difficult to accept the truth after dozens of missed hunches wild guesses and deadend speculations its really a great shame yaeger suddenly said morosely pitt glanced at him in faint surprise why do you say that yaeger shook his head heavily because therell be no living with the texans as soon as they learn what theyve been sitting on for the last sixteen centuries at noon the next day after landing at the corpus christi naval air station pitt and lily along with admiral sandecker were driven by a seaman first class to numas ocean research center on the bay sandecker directed the driver to stop beside a helicopter squatting on a concrete pad beside a long dock there were no clouds the sun was alone in the sky the temperature was mild but the humidity high and they quickly began to sweat after exiting the car numas chief geologist herb garza gave a friendly wave and approached he was short plump brownskinned with a few pockmarks on his cheeks and gleaming black hair garza wore a california angels baseball cap and a fluorescent orange shirt that was so blasting pitt could still see it after he momentarily closed his eyes garza said sandecker curtly good to see you again ive looked forward to your arrival garza said warmly we can take off as soon as you board he turned and introduced the pilot joe mifflin who wore smiling jack sunglasses and struck pitt as being about as animated as a door knob pitt and garza had worked together on a project along the western desert stretch of coast in south africa how long has it been herb said pitt three four years who counts garza said with a broad smile as they shook hands good to be on the same team with you again may i introduce dr lily sharp garza graciously bowed one of the ocean sciences he asked lily shook her head land archaeology garza turned and stared at sandecker with a curious expression this isnt a sea project admiral no im sorry you werent fully informed herb but im afraid well have to keep the real purpose of our work a secret for a little longer garza shrugged indifferently youre the boss all i need is a direction said mifflin south pitt told him south to the rio grande they dropped down the coast along the intercoastal waterway passing over the hotels and condominiums of south padre island then mifflin ducked the green helicopter with the numa letters on the side under a layer of popcorn puffed clouds and swung west below port isabel where the waters of the rio grande spilled into the gulf of mexico the land below was a strange blend of marsh and desert flat as a parking lot with cactus growing amid tall grass soon the city of brownsville appeared through the windshield the river narrowed as it flowed under the bridge connecting texas to matamoros mexico can you tell me what were supposed to survey asked garza you grew up in the rio grande valley didnt you sandecker queried without answering born and raised up river at laredo took my undergraduate courses at texas southernmost college in brownsville we just passed over it then youre familiar with the geology around roma ive conducted a number of field trips in the area yes it was pitts turn compared to now how did the river flow a few centuries after christ the stream wasnt much different then answered garza oh sure the course has shifted during earlier flooding but seldom more than a couple of miles quite often over the centuries it returned to its previous course the major change is that the rio grande would have been considerably higher then until the war with mexico the width ran from two hundred to four hundred meters the main channel actually was much deeper when was it first seen by a european alonzo de pineda sailed into the rivers mouth in how did it stack up to the mississippi back then garza thought a moment the rio grande was more akin to the nile nile the headwaters begin in the rocky mountains of colorado during the spring flooding season as the winter snows melted the water swept down the lower reaches in huge surges the ancient indians like the egyptians dug ditches so the high water ran to their crops thats why the river you see now is a mere trickle of its former self as the spanish and mexican settlers moved in followed by the texas americans new irrigation works were built after the civil war railroads brought in more families and ranchers who siphoned off more water by shallow and dangerous shoals put an end to steamboating if there had been no irrigation the rio grande might have been the mississippi river of texas steamboats ran on the rio grande asked lily for a short time traffic was quite heavy as trade developed upland down and on both sides of the river fleets of paddle steamers made regular runs from brownsville to laredo for over thirty years now since they built the falcon dam about the only craft you see on the lower river are outboard boats and inner tubes could sailing vessels have navigated as far as roma asked pitt with room to spare the river was easily wide enough for tacking all a ship with sails had to do was wait for easterly offshore breezes one keelboat made it as far northwest as santa fe in they fell quiet for a few minutes as mifflin followed the meandering turns of the river a few low rolling hills appeared on the mexican side little towns first settled nearly three hundred years ago sat in dusty seclusion some houses were built of stone and adobe and topped by red tile while the outskirts were dotted with small primitive huts having thatched roofs the agricultural part of the valley with its citrus groves and fields of vegetables and aloe vera gave way to and plains of mesquite trees and white thistle pitt expected a muddy brown river but the rio grande pleasantly surprised him by running a deep green were coming up on roma now announced garza the sister city across the river is called miguel aleman not much of a town except for sonic tourist curio stores its mostly a border crossing on the road to monterrey mifflin pulled up and soared over the international bridge and then dropped low on the river again on the mexican side men and women were washing cars mending fishing nets and swimming along the bank a few pigs wallowed in the silt on the american side a yellowish sandstone bluff rose from the riverbank up to the main section of downtown roma the buildings appeared to be quite old and some were rundown but all seemed in sound condition one or two were in stages of reconstruction the buildings look very quaint said lily there must be a lot of history behind their walls roma was a busy port during the commercial and military boating era garza lectured prosperous merchants hired architects to design some very interesting homes and business structures and theyve lasted quite well any one more famous than the others asked lily famous garza laughed my pick would be a residence built in the middle s that was used as rositas cantina when the movie viva zapata was filmed in roma with marlon brando sandecker gestured for mifflin to circle the hills above the town he turned to garza is roma named after rome because its surrounded by seven hills nobody really knows for sure replied garza youd be hardpressed to pick out seven distinctive hills a couple have noticeable peaks but mostly they just run into each other whats the geology pitt inquired as he stared downward cretaceous debris for the most part this whole area was once under the sea fossil oyster shells are common some have been found that measure half a meter theres a nearby gravel pit that illustrates the various geological periods i can give you a quick lecture if you care to have joe set us down not just yet said pitt are there any natural caves in the region none visible on the surface but that doesnt mean they arent down there no way of knowing how many caves formed by the ancient seas are hidden under the upper layer go deep enough in the tight spot and youll likely strike a goodsize limestone deposit old indian legends tell of spirits living underground what sort of spirits garza shrugged ghosts of the ancients who died in battle with evil gods lily unconsciously clutched pitts arm have any artifacts been discovered near roma a few arrow and spear flints stone knives and boatstones what are boatstones asked pitt hollow stones in the shape of boat hulls answered lily with mounting excitement their exact ongin or purpose is obscure its thought they were used as charms they supposedly warded off evil especially if an indian feared a witch or power of a shaman an effigy of the witch was tied to a boatstone and thrown into a lake or river destroying the evil forever pitt put another question to garza any objects turn up that confound the historic time scale some but they were considered to be fake lily put on her best casual expression what sort of objects swords crosses bits and pieces of armor spear shafts mostly made of iron i also recall the story of an old stone anchor that was dug out of the bluff beside the river probably spanish in origin ventured sandecker guardedly garza shook his head not spanish but roman state museum officials were justifiably skeptical they wrote them off as a nineteenthcentury hoax lilys hand bit deeper into pitts arm any possibility of my having a look at them she asked in an anxious voice or have they been lost and forgotten packed away in the dust of a state university basement garza pointed out the window toward the road running north from roma as a matter of fact the artifacts are right down there theyve been kept and collected by the man who found most of them a good old texan boy named sam trinity or crazy sam as hes known by the locals hes poked around this area for fifty years swearing a roman army camped here makes a living by running a small gas station and store has a shack in the rear he grandly calls a museum of antiquity pitt smiled slowly can you set us down beside his place he asked mifflin i think we ought to have a talk with sam the sign stretched nine meters in length behind the highway turnoft the giant horizontal board was supported by sunbleached weathercracked mesquite posts that uniformly leaned backward at a drunken angle garish red letters on a faded silver background proclaimed sams roman circus the gas pumps out front were shiny and new and advertised methanolblended fuel for fortyeight cents a liter the store was built from adobe and designed like the indian mesa dwellings of arizona with the roof poles protruding through the walls the interior was clean and the shelves were neatly stacked with curios groceries and soft drinks it was an echo of a thousand other small isolated oases that stood beside the nations highways sam though didnt match the decor no baseball cap advertising caterpillar tractors no scuffed cowboy boots or straw range hat or faded levis sam was attired in a bright green polo shirt yellow slacks and expensive custom lizard golf shoes complete with cleats his evenly trimmed white hair lay flat beneath a sporty plaid cap sam trinity stood in the doorway of his store until the dust from the helicopters rotor blades slowly rolled away under a light breeze then he stepped past the asphalt drive holding a two iron bob hopestyle and came to a halt about six meters from the opening door garza dropped out first and walked up to him hello there dirtkicker trinitys dark calfskin face stretched into a big texas smile herb you old taco good to see you he pulled up his sunglasses revealing blue eyes that squinted under the bright southern texas sun then he dropped them again like a curtain he was very tall skinny as a fence pole arms slender shoulders narrow but his voice had vigor and resonance garza made the introductions but it was obvious the names were hardly absorbed by trinity he simply waved and said glad to meet yaal welcome to sams roman circus then he noticed pitts face cane and limp fall off your motorcycle pitt laughed the short end of a saloon brawl i think i like you sandecker stood jauntily with legs apart and nodded at the two iron where do you play golf around here just down the road in rio grande city trinity replied genially several courses between here and brownsville i just got back from a quick round with some old army buddies wed like to poke around your museum said garza be an honor help yourself not every day someone drops in by whirlybird to look at my artifacts he pronounced it arteefacts you folks like something to drink sody pop beer ive got a pitcher of margaritas in the icebox a margarita would taste wonderful said lily dabbing her neck with a bandanna show our guests around to the museum herb the doors unlocked ill join you in a minute a truck and trailer pulled in for gas and trinity pau sed to chat a moment with the driver before entering his living quarters adjoining the store a friendly cuss muttered sandecker sam can be friendlier than a downtexas ranch wife said garza but get on his bad side and hes tougher than a ninetycent steak garza led them into an adobe building behind the store the interior was no larger than a twocar garage but was crowded with glass display cases and wax figures in roman legionary dress the artifact room was spotless no dust layered the glass walls the artifacts were rustfree and highly burnished lily carried an attached case she carefully laid it on a display case unsnapped the latches and pulled out a thick book with illustrations and photographs that resembled a catalogue she began to compare the artifacts with those pictured in the book looking good she said after a few minutes of study the swords and spearheads match roman weapons of the fourth century dont get excited said garza seriously sam fabricated what you see here and probably aged them with acid and the sun he didnt fabricate them sandecker said flatly garza regarded him with skeptical interest how can you say that admiral theres no record of precolumbian contact in the gulf there is now thats news to me the event occurred in the year ad explained pitt a fleet of ships ed up the rio grande to where roma now stands somewhere in one of the hills behind town roman mercenaries their slaves and egyptian scholars buried a vast collection of artifacts from the alexandria library in egypt i knew it burst sam trinity from the open doorway he was so excited he almost dropped the tray of glasses and pitcher he was carrying by glory i knew it the romans really walked the soil of texas youve been right sam said sandecker and your doubters wrong iall these years no one believed me sam muttered dazedly even after they read the stone they accused me of chiseling the inscription myself stone what stone pitt asked sharply the one standing over in the corner i had it translated at texas a and m but all they told me was nice job sam your latin aint half bad theyve kidded me for years for dreaming up a firstrate fish story is there a copy of the translated message asked lily re on the wall i had it typed and hung in a glassed frame i cut off the part where they panned it lily peered at the wording and read it aloud as the others crowded around her this stone marks the way to where i ordered buried the works from the great hall of the muses i escaped the slaughter of our fleet by the barbanans and made my way south where i was accepted by a primitive pyramid people as a sage and a prophet i have taught them what i know of the stars and science but they put little of my teachings to practical use they prefer to worship pagan gods and follow ignorant priests demands for human sacrifice sevenyearshavepassedsincemy arrival my return here is filled with sorrow at the sight of the bones of my former comrades i have seen to their burial my ship is ready and i shall soon set sail for rome if theodosius still lives i shall be executed but accept the risk gladly to see my family one last time to those who read this should i perish the entrance to the storage chamber is buried under the hill stand north and look straight south to the liver cliff junius venator august so venator survived the massacre only to die seven years later on the return voyage to rome said pitt or perhaps he made it and was executed without talking added sandecker no theodosius died in said lily in wonder to think the message was here all this time and ignored as a counterfeit trinitys eyebrows lifted you know this venator guy weve been tracking him admitted pitt have you searched for the chamber sandecker asked trinity nodded dug all over these hills but found nuthin but what you see here how deep used a backhoe about ten years ago made a pit six meters down but only found that sandal over there in the case could you show us the site where you discovered the stone and other artifacts pitt asked him the old texan looked at garza think its okay herb take my word sam you can trust these people theyre not artifact robbers trinity nodded vigorously all right lets take a ride we can go in my jeep trinity steered the jeep wagoneer up a dirt road past several modern homes and stopped in front of a barbedwire fence he got out unhooked a section of the wire and pulled it aside then he climbed back behind the wheel and continued on over a trail that was grown over and barely perceptible when the fourwheeled jeep crested a long sloping rise he stopped and turned off the ignition well here it is gongora hill a long time ago somebody told me it was named after a seventeenthcentury spanish poet why they named this dirt heap for a poet beats grits out of me pitt gestured at a low hill four hundred meters to the north what do they call that ridge over there has no name i ever heard of replied trinity where did you discover the stone asked lily hold on just a little further trinity restarted the engine and slowly edged the jeep down the slope dodging the mesquite and low underbrush after a twominute bumpy ride he braked beside a shallow wash he stepped from the car and walked to the edge and looked down right here i found a corner of it sticking out of the bank this dry wash observed pitt winds between gongora and the far hill trinity nodded yeah but no way the stone traveled from there to the slope below gongora unless it was dragged this is hardly a flood plain agreed sandecker erosion and heavy rains over a long time period might have carried it fifty meters from the summit of gongora but not half a kilometer from the next summit and the other artifacts asked lily where did they lie trinity swept a hand on an arc toward the river they were scattered a little further down the slope and continued almost through the center of town did you conduct a survey with transits and mark each location sorry miss not being an archaeologist i didnt think to pinpoint the holes lilys eyes flashed disappointment but she made no reply you must have used a metal detector said pitt made it myself trinity answered proudly sensitive enough to read a penny at half a meter who owns the land twelve hundred acres hereabouts have been in my family since texas was a republic that saves a lot of legal hassle sandecker said approvingly pitt looked at his watch the sun was beginning to fall beyond the string of hills he tried to visualize the running fight between the indians and the romanegyptians toward the river and the fleet of ancient ships he could almost hear the shouting the screams of pain the clash of weapons he felt as if he had been present that fateful day so long ago he returned to the present as lily continued her questioning of trinity strange that you didnt find any bones on the battlefield early spanish sailors who were shipwrecked on the texas gulf coast and managed to make their way to veracruz and mexico city garza answered her told of indians who practiced cannibalism lily made an expression of utter distaste you cant know for certain the dead were eaten perhaps a small number said garza and what remains that werent dragged off by tribal dogs or wild animals were later buried by this guy venator any they missed turned to dust herbs right said pitt any bones that remained on surface ground would disintegrate in time lily became very still she gazed almost mystically at the nearby crest of gongora hill i cant begin to believe were actually standing within a few meters of the treasures an icy calm seemed to settle over them for a few moments then pitt finally echoed the others thoughts a lot of good men died sixteen centuries ago to preserve the knowledge of their time he said softly eyes staring into the past i think its time we dig it free the next morning admiral sandecker was passed through the compound gate by secret service guards he drove along a winding lane to the presidents hideaway cottage on the lake of the ozarks in missouri he stopped his commercial rental car in the drive and removed his briefcase from the trunk there was a crisp chill in the air and he found it invigorating after the steamy temperatures along the rio grande the president dressed in a warm sheepskin jacket came down the steps from the porch and greeted him admiral thank you for coming id rather be here than in washington how was your trip slept most of it sorry to bring you up here in a mad rush im fully aware of the urgency the president put a hand on sandeckers back and steered him up the steps toward the cottage door come in and have some breakfast dale nichols julius schiller and senator pitt are already attacking the eggs and smoked ham assembled the brain trust i see sandecker said with a cagey smile we spent half the night discussing the political impact of your discovery little i can tell you in person that wasnt in the report i sent by courier except you neglected to include a diagram of your proposed excavation i would have gotten around to it sandecker said standing his ground the president was not put off by sandeckers attitude you can show everyone over but they broke off the conversation for a few moments as the president led him through the logconstructed house they walked through a cozy living room decorated more for modern living than a hunting lodge a small fire crackled away in a large rock fireplace they entered the dining room where schiller and nichols dressed as fishermen rose as one to shake hands senator pitt merely waved he wore a sweatsuit the senator and the admiral were close friends because of their closeness to dirk sandecker caught a hint of warning from the elder pitts somber expression there was one other man the president hadnt mentionedharold wismer an old crony and adviser of the president who enjoyed enormous influence and worked outside the white house bureaucracy sandecker wondered why he was present the president pulled out a chair sit down admiral how do you like your eggs sandecker shook his head a small bowl of fruit and a glass of skim milk will do me fine a whitecoated steward took sandeckers order and disappeared into the kitchen so thats how you keep that wiry shape said schiller that and enough exercise to keep me in a perpetual state of sweat all of us wish to congratulate you and your people on a magnificent find wismer began without hesitation he stared through glasses with pink lenses a snarled beard almost hid his lips he was bald as a basketball brown eyes wide to give a slight popped look when do you expect to move dirk tomorrow sandecker answered suspecting the rug was about to be pulled out from under him he pulled a blowup of a geological survey map showing the topography above roma from his briefcase then he followed it with a cutaway drawing of the hill indicating the planned excavation shafts he laid them out on a free section of the table we intend to dig two exploratory tunnels into the main hill eighty meters below the summit the one labeled gongora hill yes the tunnels will enter on opposing sides of the slope facing the river and then angle toward each other but on different levels one or both should strike the grotto junius venator inscribed on sam trinitys stone or with luck one of the original entry shafts youre absolutely sure a treasure trove of artifacts from the alexandria library is at this place wismer said tightening the noose you have no doubts none asserted sandecker in a salty tone the map from the roman stup in greenland led to the artifacts found in roma by trinity the pieces slot together nicely but could the no the roman objects have been authenticated sandecker cut wismer off abruptly this is no hoax no attempt at fraud no wild stunt or game we know its there the only question is how extensive is the hoard we dont mean to suggest the librarys treasures do not exist said schiller quickly a little too quickly but you must understand admiral the international repercussions of such an enormous discovery might be difficult to predict much less control sandecker stared at schiller unblinking i fail to see how bringing the knowledge of the ancient world to light will cause armageddon also arent you a little late the world already knows about the treasure hala kamfl announced our search in her address to the united nations there are considerations said the president seriously you may not be aware of president hasan may claim the entire trove of relics belongs to egypt greece will insist on the return of alexanders gold casket who can say what claims italy will put forth maybe i took the wrong tack gentlemen said sandecker it was my understanding we promised to share in the discovery with president hasan as a means of propping up his government true admitted schiller but that was before you nailed down the location beside the rio grandenow youve brought mexico into the picture the fanatic topiltzin can make a case on the fact that the burial site originally belonged to mexico thats to be expected said sandecker except that possession is nine tenths of the law legally the artifacts belong to the man who owns the property theyre buried on mr trinity will be offered a substantial sum of money for his land and the rights to the relics said nichols i might also add his payment will be taxfree sandecker regarded nichols skeptically the hoard might be worth hundreds of millions is the government prepared to go that high of course not and if trinity wont take your offer there are other methods of making a deal wismer said with cold determination since when is the government in the art business the art sculpture and the remains of alexander the great are only of historic interest said wismer the knowledge in the scrolls thats the area of vital interest that depends on the eye of the beholder sandecker said philosophically the information contained in the scientific records particularly the geological data could have enormous influence on our future dealings with the middle east wismer continued doggedly and there is the religious angle to consider whats to consider the greek umslation of the original hebrew text of the old testament was made at the library this translation is the basis for all books of the bible but not the new testament wismer corrected sandecker there may be historic facts that dispute the founding of christianity locked away under that hill in texas facts that would be better left hidden sandecker gave wismer a cold stare then turned his eyes to the president i smell a conspiracy mr president id be grateful for the reason behind my presence here nothing sinister admiral i assure you but we all agree this has to be conducted within stringent guidelines sandecker was not slow the trap had sprung hed known almost from the beginning what was going down so after numa he paused and stared at senator pitt and especially your son senator have done all the dirty work were to be pushed aside you must admit admiral said wismer in an official tone this is hardly a job for a governmental agency whose bureaucratic responsibilities lie underwater sandecker shrugged off wismers words weve taken the project this far i see no reason why we cant see it through to the end im sorry admiral said the president slowly but im taking the project out of your hands and turning it over to the pentagon sandecker was stunned the military he blurted whose harebrained idea was that an embarrassed look came into the presidents eyes then they flicked to wismer for an instant it makes no difference who conceived the new plan the decision is mine i dont think you understand jim said the senator quietly what you stumbled upon goes far beyond mere archaeology the knowledge under that hill could very well reshape our middle east foreign policy for decades to come reason enough why we have to approach this thing as if it was a highly secret intelligence operation said wismer we must keep the discovery classified until all documents are thoroughly examined and their data analyzed that could take twenty or even a hundred years depending on the number and condition of the scrolls after underground storage for sixteen hundred years sandecker protested if thats what it takes the president shrugged the steward brought the admirals fruit bowl and glass of milk but sandecker had lost his appetite in other words you need time to add up the value of the windfall sandecker said acidly then negotiate political bargains for the ancient charts showing the locations of lost mineral and oil deposits around the mediterranean if alexander hasnt turned to dust his bones will be traded to the greek government toward renewed leases for our naval bases all this before the american people find out youve given away the store we cannot afford to go public schiller explained patiently not until were prepared to move you fail to realize the tremendous foreign policy advantages youve laid in the governments lap we cant simply throw them away in the name of public curiosity about historic objects im not naive gentlemen said sandecker but i do confess to being a sentimental old patriot who believes the people deserve better from their government than they receive the treasures from the library of alexandria do not belong to a few politicians to barter away they belong to all america by right of possession sandecker didnt wait for them to answer he took a quick swallow of milk then retrieved a newspaper out of his briefcase and casually tossed it on the center of the table because everyone is so wrapped up with the big picture your aides missed a small item from reuters wire service that was carried in most of the newspapers around the world heres a copy of a st louis paper i picked up at the carrental agency i circled the piece on page three wismer picked up the folded paper opened it and turned to the page indicated by sandecker he read the heading aloud and then began the text romans land in texas according to toplevel administration sources in washington the search for a vast underground depository of ancient relics from the famed library of alexandria egypt has ended a few hundred meters north of the rio grande river in roma texas artifacts found over the years by a mr samuel trinity have been acknowledged as authentic by archaeologists the search began with the discovery of a roman merchant ship dated from the fourth century ad in the ice of greenland wismer stopped his face reddening with anger a leak a goddamned leak but how who wondered nichols in shock toplevel administration sources sandecker repeated that can only mean the white house he looked at the president then at nichols probably a disgruntled aide one of your supervisors either passed over for promotion or sacked schiller looked glumly at the president a thousand people will be swarming over the place i suggest you order out a military force to secure the area julius is right mr president said nichols treasure hunters will dig those hills to pieces if theyre not stopped the president nodded alright dale open a wx to general metcalf of the joint chiefs nichols quickly left the table and entered the study which was manned by secret service and white house communications technicians i strongly advise we clamp a lid on the entire operation said wismer tensely we should also spread a story that the discovery is a hoax not a good idea mr president counseled schiller wisely your predecessors found out the hard way it doesnt pay to lie to the american people the news media would smell a coverup and chew you to bits ill side with julius said sandecker close off the area but go through with the excavation hiding nothing and keeping the public informed believe me mr president your administration will be far better off putting the library artifacts out in the open as theyre recovered the president turned and looked at wismer sorry harold perhaps its all for the best let us hope so said wismer solemnly staring at the newspaper story i dont want to think about what might happen if that lunatic topiltzin decides to make an issue of it sam trinity stood and watched pitt connect a pair of electrical leads from two metal boxes that sat on the open tailgate of his jeep one had a small viewing monitor and the other a wide slot with paper unreeling from it like a flattened tongue a wildlooking rig observed trinity what do you call it the fancy name is electromagnetic reflection profiling system for subsurface exploration pitt replied as he jacked in the leads to a strange doublehumped contraption with four wheels and a push bar in plain speech its a groundprobing radar unit the georadar one manufactured by the oyo corporation i didnt know radar could go through dirt and rock it can provide a good profile down to ten meters and deep as twenty under ideal conditions hows it work as the portable probe moves across the land a transmitter sends an electromagnetic pulse into the ground the reflecting signals are picked up by a receiver and then relayed to the color processor and graphic recorder here in the jeep thats pretty much the gist of it sure you dont want me to tow the mitter buggy i have better control if i push it by hand what are we looking for a cavity you mean cavern pitt grinned and shrugged same thing trinity gazed across the ridge of hills they were standing on toward the summit of gongora hill four hundred meters away why are we looking on the backside of the wrong hill i want to run some tests on the unit before we tackle the prime site pitt replied vaguely also theres the slight possibility venator buried more artifacts someplace else he paused and waved to lily who was peering through a surveyors transit a short distance away were ready he shouted she waved back and approached carrying a board with sheet of graph paper tacked to it heres your search grid she said pointing a pencil at the markings on the paper the boundary stakes are set in place ill walk behind the jeep and monitor the transmissions every twenty meters or so ill plant a small flag marker so we can keep our lanes straight pitt nodded at her ready sam sam moved behind the steering wheel and started the jeeps engine say the word pitt turned on the machine and made a few adjustments then he took the handle of the probe wagon in his hands and pointed ahead sam dropped the jeep into drive and crawled forward while pitt followed pushing the transmitterreceiver unit five meters from the rear a light cloud overcast dulled the sun to a dim yellow ball thankfully the day was mild and comfortable back and forth they traveled dodging rocks and bushes the morning wore into afternoon as the monotony associated with search and surveys stretched out of all proportion they ignored lunch stopping only at lilys command as she studied the recordings and made notations a good reading pitt asked taking a breather sitting on the back of the tailgate were on the edge of something that looks interesting answered lily engrossed in the recordings maybe nothing though ill know better after we cover the next two lanes trinity graciously passed around bottles of mexican bohemia beer from an ice chest in the jeep it was during these short breaks that pitt noticed a growing number of cars parked at the bottom of gongord hill people were fanning out over the slope with metal detectors sam noticed too a lot of good my no trespassing signs did he grumbled youd think they was advertising free where are they coming from asked lily how did they find out about the project so soon trinity peered over the rims of his sunglasses mostly local folks somebody must have blabbed by this time tomorrow theyll be rolling in from every state in the union the telephone in the jeep buzzed and trinity answered then he passed the receiver out the window to pitt for you admiral sandecker pi took the call yes admiral weve been backstabbed were no longer on the excavation sandecker informed him the presidents advisers have talked him into turningng the operation over to the pentagon it was to be expected but id have preferred the park service theyre better equipped for an archaeological dig the white house wants to break into the storage chamber and remove the scrolls for study as quickly as possible they fear a nasty confrontation with countries that might demand to share in the discovery pitt struck his fist against the roof of the jeep damnit they cant go down there and throw everything into trucks as though it was secondhand merchandise the scrolls could crumble to dust if not handled properly the president has accepted responsibility for the gamble the past has no priority over politics is that it not the only problem said sandecker tersely some aide inside the white house leaked everything to a foreign wire service word is spreading like the plague crowds are already converging on the site theyre not wasting any time how does the government get around the fact the property belongs to sam lets just say sam is going to get an offer he cant refuse sandecker replied angrily the president and his cronies have a grand scheme to make a political bonanza out of the information contained in the library scrolls my father among them asked pitt im afraid so who exactly is taking over a company of army engineers from fort hood they and their equipment are being transported by truck a security force should be dropping in on you any time by helicopter to seal off the perimeters pitt thought a moment then could you use your clout to arrange for us to hang around give me a cover story except for hiram yaeger lily and i know more about the search than anyone who will be excavating claim were vital to the project as consultants use lilys academic credentials as a backup say were conducting an archaeological survey for surface artifacts say anything admiral but con the white house into allowing us to remain on the site ill see what i can do sandecker said warming to the idea although he didnt have the vaguest idea of what pitt was shooting for harold wismer should be the only barrier if the senator throws his support our way i think we can handle it let me know if my dad drags his feet ill get on him ill be in touch pitt handed the receiver back to trinity and turned to lily were off the case he informed them the army is taking over the excavation theyre going to haul the artifacts away as fast as they can throw them in the back of a truck lilys eyes widened in shock the scrolls will be destroyed she gasped after sixteen hundred years in an underground vault the parchment and papyrus manuscripts must be treated delicately they could disintegrate from a sudden temperature change or the slightest touch you heard me give the admiral the same appraisal pitt said helplessly trinity looked washed out waal he drawled shall we call it a day pitt looked at the stakes that marked the outer limit of the search grid not yet he said slowly deliberately lets finish the job the show is never over till its over the mercedes stretch limousine stopped at the yacht club dock in the harbor of alexandria the chauffeur opened the door and robert capesteffe climbed from the back seat wearing a tailored white linen suit with a powderblue shirt and matching tie he no longer looked like topiltzin he was guided down a stone stairway to a waiting launch he sat back in the soft cushions and enjoyed the ride across the harbor and through the enwmce where one of the seven wonders of the ancient world the famed lighthouse known as the pharos of alexandria once stood a towering meters high only a few stones built into an arab fort were all that remained of its ruins the launch headed for a large yacht that was moored around the harbor and off the long wide beach capesteffe had walked her decks on previous occasions he knew her length to be fortyfive meters she was dutchbuilt with sleek aircraftstyle lines she had transoceanic range and a cruising speed of thirty knots the pilot eased back on the throttle and slipped the launch into reverse at it approached the boarding steps capesterre was met on deck by a man dressed in an open silk shirt shorts and sandals they embraced ifre as ii re a lcotne btthere saiki paul capesterre its been too long you look healthy paul id say you and akhmad yazid have gained about eight pounds twelve almost seems strange to see you out of uniform said robert paul shrugged i get tired of yazids arabic gear and that stupid turban he stood back and smiled at his brother youre a fine one to talk i dont see you in your aztec god outfit topiltzin is temporarily on holiday robert paused and nodded at the deck youve borrowed uncle theodores boat i see ihe hardly has use for it any more since the family left the drug business paul capesterre turned and led his brother into the dining salon come along ive had lunch set now that ive learned you finally developed a taste for champagne ive dusted off a bottle of uncle theodores finest vintage robert took an offered glass i thought president hasan placed you under house arrest the only reason i bought the villa is because of a hidden escape tunnel that runs underground for a hundred meters and comes up in a mechanics repair shop also owned by you of course robert raised his glass heres to mother and fathers grand scheme paul nodded although at the moment your end in mexico looks more promising than mine in egypt youre not to blame for the lady flamborough fiasco the family approved the plan no one could foretell the cunning of the americans that idiot suleiman aziz ammar said paul harswy he blundered the operation away any news of survivors family agents report most were killed including ammar and your captain machado several were taken prisoner but they know nothing of our involvement then we should consider ourselves lucky with machado and ammar dead no intelligence agency in the world can touch us they were the only link president hasan didnt have any trouble putting two and two together or i wouldnt be under house arrest yes agreed robeil but hasan cant act against you without solid evidence if he tried your followers would rise up and prevent any trial the familys advice is to keep a low profile while consolidating your power base at least for another year to see how the wind blows for now the wind blows at the backs of hasan hala kaniil and abu hamid said paul wradlly be patient soon your islamic fundamentalist movement will sweep you into the egyptian parliament paul looked at robert with a cagey expression in his eyes the discovery of the alexandria library treasures might speed things a bit youve read the latest news reportst asked robert yes the americans claim theyve found the storage chamber in texas possession of the ancient geological charts could be to your advantage if they point the way to rich oil and mineral reserves you can claim credit for turning egypts economy around ive considered that possibility said paul if i read the white house correctly the president will use the artifacts and scrolls as bargaining chips while hasan begs and haggles for a paltry share of egypts heritage i can go before the people and raise the issue as an outrage against our revered ancestors paul hesitated his mind leapfrogging then he continued his eyes narrowing with the right semantics i think i can twist muslim law and the words of the koran into a rallying cry that will crack hasans government robert laughed try and keep a straight face when you speak the christians may have burned most of the scrolls in ad but it was the muslims in who destroyed the library forever a waiter began serving scottish smoked salmon and an caviar they ate for a few minutes in silence then paul said i hope yourealize the burden of seizing the artifacts falls on your shoulders robert stared over the rim of his champagne glass you talking to me or topiltzin paul laughed topiltzin robert set down the glass and slowly raised his hands in the air as if beseeching a fly on the ceiling his eyes took on a hypnotic look and he began to speak in a haunting tone we will rise up by the tens of thousands by the hundreds of thousands we will cross the river as one and take what was buried on our land land that was stolen from us by the americans many will be sacrificed but the gods demand we take what rightfully belongs to mexico then he dropped his hands and grinned needs a little polishing of course i believe youve borrowed my script said paul applauding whats the difference so long as were family robert took a final forkful of salmon delicious i could eat smoked salmon by the boatload he washed it down with the champagne if i can seize the treasures and hold on to them then what i only want the maps whatever else can be smuggled out goles to the family to keep or sell on the black market to wealthy collectors agreed robert thought a moment and then nodded agreed the waiter brought a tray of glasses a bottle of brandy and a box of cigars paul slowly lit a panatella he looked questioningly through the smoke at his brother how do you intend to grab the library treasures i had planned to launch a massive unarmed invasion of the american border states after i gained power this strikes me as a good opportunity for a test run robert stared at his glass as he swirled his brandy once i set the wheels of my organization in motion the poor in the cities and the peasants of the country will be gathered up and transported north to roma texas i can assemble three perhaps as many as four hundred thousand on our side of the rio grande in four days what about american resistance every soldier border patrolman and sheriff in texas will be helpless to stop the crush i plan to put the women and children in the first wave across the bridge and river americans are a maudlin lot they may have slaughtered villagers in vietnam but they wont massacre unarmed civilians on their own doorstep i can also play on white house fears of a nasty international incident the president wont dare issue orders to shoot static resistance will be inundated by a human tide that will sweep up through roma and occupy the underground vault containing the library treasures and topiltzin will lead them and i will lead them how long do you think you can hold on to the vault asked paul long enough for ancientlanguage translators to assess and remove any scrolls pertaining to longlost mineral deposits that could take weeks you wont have the time the americans will build up their forces and push your people back into mexico within a few days not if i threaten to burn the scrolls and destroy the art objects robert patted his lips with a napkin my jet should be refueled by now id better return to mexico and set the operation in motion respect for his brothers inventive reasoning showed in pauls eyes with their backs against the wall the american government will have no option but to deal i like that certainly the largest horde of people to invade the united states since the british in the revolutionary war said robert i like that even better they began arriving in the thousands the first day in the tens of thousands the next from all over northern mexico people inspired by the unpassioned mvings of topiltzin traveled by car overloaded bus and truck or walked to the dusty town of nfiguel ale across the river from roma the asphalt roads from monterrey tampico and mexico city were glutted with a continuous stream of vehicles president de lorenzo tried to stop the human wave rolling toward the border he called out the mexican armed forces to block the roads the military might as well have tried to stop a raging flood outside of guadalupe a squad of soldiers about to be swept away by a crush of bodies fired into the crowd killing fiftyfour most of them women and children de lorenzo had unwittingly played into tbpiltzins hands it was exactly the reaction robert capesterre had hoped for riots broke out in mexico city and de lorenzo he had to back off or face mushrooming unrest and the lighted match of a possible revolution he sent a message to the white house with his sincere regrets for failing to stem the tide and then he called off the soldiers many of whom deserted and joined the crusade unrestrained the throng swarmed toward the rio grande the capesterre familys hired professional planners and roberts topiltzin followers raised a fivesquarekilometer tent city and set up kitchens and organized food lines sanitation facilities were trucked in and assembled nothing was overlooked many of the poor who flooded the area had never lived nor eaten so well only the clouds of dust and exhaust smoke from diesel engines swirled beyond human control handpainted banners appeared along the mexico bank of the river proclaiming the us stole our land we want our ancestors land returned the antiquities belong to mexico they chanted the slogans in english spanish and nahuatl topiltzin walked mnong the masses agitating them into a frenzy rarely seen outside iran television news teams had a field day taping the colorful demonstration cameras their cables meandering to two dozen mobile field units stood tripod to tripod on top of romas bluff lenses panning the opposite shore unwary correspondents who wandered through the crowds did not know that the peasant families they interviewed had been carefully planted and rehearsed in most cases the simple impoverishedlooking people were trained actors who spoke fluent english but answered quesfions in a stumbling broken accent their tearful appeals to five permanently in california arizona new mexico and texas drew a wave of sobsister support across the nation when the segments ran on the evening news and the morning talk shows the only ones who stood grim and unimpressed were the dedicated men of the us border patrol until now the threat of a massive incursion had only been a nightmare now they were about to witness the realization of their worst fears border patrolmen rarely had call to draw their firearms they treated illegal immigrants humanely and with respect before shipping them back home they took a dim view of the army covering the us side of the river like nests of camouflaged ants they saw only disaster and slaughter in a long line of automatic weapons and the twenty tanks whose deadly guns were trained on mexico the soldiers were young and efficient as fighting units but they were trained for combat with an enemy who fought back they were uneasy about facing a wave of unarmed civilians the commanding officer brigadier general curfis chandler had barricaded the bridge with tanks and armored cars but topiltzin had planned for that contingency the riverbank was packed with every kind of small boat wooden raft and truck inner tube gleaned within two hundred miles footbridges made of rope were stretched out and knotted to be carried across by the first wave and positioned general chandlers intelligence officer estimated an initial rush of twenty thousand before the flotilla returned loaded and ferried the next wave he couldnt begin to guess the number of swimmers one of his female agents had penetrated the dining trailer used by topiltzin aides and reported the storm would be launched in the late evening after the aztec messiah had whipped his devotees into nearfrenzy but she couldnt learn which evening chandler had served three tours in vietnam he knew firsthand what it was like to kill fanatical young women and boys who struck without seaming out of the jungle he gave orders to fire over the heads of the mob when they began their move across the water if the warning barrage did not stop themchandler was a soldier who performed his duty without question if ordered he would use the forces under his command to repel the peaceful invasion rrgardless of the cost in blood pitt stood on the secondstory sun deck of sam trinitys store and peered through a telescope used by the texan to gaze at the stars the sun had dropped over the western range of hills and daylight was fading but the staged spectacle on the other side of the rio grande was about to begin batteries of multicolored floodlights burst out some sweeping patterns in the sky while odiers beaxned on a tall tower that had been erected in the center of the town he focused on and magnified a tiny figure wearing a white anklelength robe and colorful headdress who stood on a narrow platform atop the tower pitt judged itfrom the upraised and brisk movement of the arms that the center of attraction was engaged in a fervent speech i wonder who the character is in the jazzy costume stirring up the natives sandecker sat with lily examining the underground profile recordings from the survey he looked up at pitts question probably that phony topiltzin he grunted he can sway a crowd with the best of the evangelists any sign theyll attempt the crossing tonight asked lily pin leaned back from the telescope and shook his head theyre hard at work on their fleet but i doubt if it will come for another fortyeight hours topiltzin wont launch his big push until hes certain he commands the lead news story of the day topiltzin s an alias sandecker informed him his real name is robert capesterre hes got himself a thriving racket sandecker held up one thumb and forefinger an inch apart capesterre is that far away from taking over mexico if that convention on the other side of the river is any indication hes after the entire american southwest too lily stood up and stretched this sitting around is driving me crazy we do all the work and the army engineers get all the glory preventing us from watching over the excavation and keeping us off sams propertyi think its rude of them pitt and sandecker both smiled at lilys feminine choice of words i could put it a little stronger than rude said the admiral lily chewed nervously on the tip of a pen why no word from the senator we should have heard something by now i cant say replied sandecker all he told me after i explained dirks setup was that hed somehow work a deal wish we knew how it was going lily murmured trinity appeared on the stairs below wearing an apron anybody care for a bowl of my famous trinity chili lily gave him an uneasy look how hot is it little lady i can make it as mild on your stomach as a marshmallow or as fiery as battery acid any way you like it ill go with the marshmallow lily decided without hesitation before pitt and sandecker could put in their order trinity turned and stared through the dusk at a stream of headlights approaching up the road must be another army convoy he announced been no cars or trucks come this way since that general closed off the roads and rerouted all the traffic to the north soon they counted five trucks led by a hunner the vehicle that replaced the durable jeep the truck bringing up the rear pulled a trailer with a canvascovered piece of equipment the convoy did not turn off the road toward the engineers encampment on gongora hill or continue into roma as expected the trucks followed the hummer into the driveway of sams roman circus and stopped between the gas pumps and the store the passengers climbed from the hummer and looked around pitt immediately recognized dirty faces two of the men were in uniform while the third wore a sweater and denims pitt climbed carefully over the railing and lowered himself until he was only a few feet off the ground then he let go and landed directly in front of them uttering a low groan at the sudden pain from his wounded leg they were as startled by his sudden appearance as he was by theirs whered you drop from asked al giordino with a broad smile he looked pale under the floodlights and his arm was in a sling but he looked testy as ever i was about to ask you the same thing colonel hollis stepped forward i didnt think wed meet up again so quickly nor i added major dillenger pitt felt a vast wave of relief rush over him as he grasped their outstretched hands to say im glad to see you has to be the years understatement how is it youre here your father used his powers of persuasion on the joint chiefs of staff explained hollis id hardly finished my report on the lady flamborough mission when orders came down to assemble the teams and rush here by vehicle transportation using backcountry roads all very hush and classified i was told the field commander would not be apprised of our mission until i reported to him general chandler said pitt yes steeltrap chandler i served under him in nato eight years ago still thinks armor alone can win wars so hes got the dirty job of playing horatio defending the bridge what are your orders asked pitt to assist you and dr sharp on whatever project youve got going admiral sandecker is to act as a direct line to the senator and the pentagon thats about all i know no mention of the white house none thats down on paper he turned as lily and the admiral who had taken the long way down the inside stairs walked out the front door as lily embraced giordino and dillenger introduced hollis to sandecker hollis pulled pitt aside what the devil is going on around here he muttered a circus pitt grinned you dont know how close you are where do my special forces fit in when the freeforall starts said pitt g deadly serious your job is to blow the store the backhoe the special operations forces had transported from virginia was huge wide treads moved its massive bulk up the slope to a site marked by one of lilys small marker flags after ten minutes of instruction and a little practice pitt memorized the lever functions and began operating the steel behemoth on his own he raised the twoandahalfmeterwide bucket and then brought it down like a giant claw striking the hard ground with a loud clang in less than an hour a trench six meters deep and twenty meters in length had been carved on the rear slope of the hill that was as far as the excavation progressed when a chevrolet fourwheel blazer staff car came barreling through the underbrush with a truckload of armed soldiers following in its dust the wheels had not yet stopped turning when a captain with a ramrodstraight back and the eyes of a man driven by an inspired dedication to army discipline and standard operating procedure jumped to the ground this is a restricted area he snapped smartly i warned you people personally two days ago not to reenter you must remove your equipment and leave immediately pitt indifferently climbed down from his seat and stared into the bottom of the trench as though the officer didnt exist the captains face went red and he barked to his sergeant sergeant ohara prepare the men to escort these civilians from the area pitt slowly turned and smiled pleasantly sorry but were staying put the captain smiled back but his smile was scorching you have three minutes to leave and take that backhoe with you do you care to see papers authorizing us to be here unless they were signed by general chandler youre chewing air they come from a higher command than your general you have three minutes the captain said flatly then i will have you forcibly removed lily giordino and the admiral who were sitting out of the sun in trinitys borrowed jeep wagoneer walked over to take in the show lillie was wearing only a halter and tight shorts she saucily paraded up and down in front of the line of soldiers women who have never worked the streets as hookers cannot walk with a seductive swing and sway that appears in a natural phenomenon they tend to exaggerate to the point of slapstick lily was no exception but the men could not have cared less they ate up the performance pitt began to tense with anger he knew pompous people you have only twelve men captain twelve engineers with less than a hundred hours of combat i have forty men behind me any two of whom could kill your entire force in less than ten seconds with their bare hands im telling you to back off the captain made a casual threehundred and sixty degree scan but all he saw besides pitt were lily standing in front of the troops a man named sandecker who was unconcernedly puffing a large cigar and a man he hadnt seen before wearing an arm sling they were both leaning against the jeep as if they were halfasleep he glanced quickly at pitt but pitts eyes gave no hint of emotion he made a forward motion with his hand sergeant move people the hell out of here before his men had taken two steps colonel hollis seemed to appear as if by magic the colors of his camouflaged battle fatigues and greaseblurred hands and face were incredibly faithful to the surrounding foliage standing less than five meters away he blended into the underbrush nearly to the point of invisibility do we have a problem hollis asked the captain about as charitably as a sidewillder eyeing a gopher the captains mouth dropped open and his men froze in position he took a few steps closer and gawked at hollis more carefully seeing no obvious sign of rank who are you he blurted what is your outfit colonel morton hollis special operations forces captain louis cranston sir th engineering battalion salutes were exchanged hollis nodded toward the line of engineers their automatic weapons at the ready i think you can give the order for your men to stand at rest cranston was unsure what to make of an unfamiliar colonel who appeared out of nowhere may i ask colonel what a special forces officer is doing here seeing that these people are allowed to conduct an archaeological survey without interference i must remind you sir civilians are not permitted in a restricted military zone suppose i told you they have the authority to be here sorry colonel i am under direct orders from general chandler he was very explicit no one and that includes yourself sir who is not a member of the battalion is to be allowed to enter am i to understand you intend to throw me out as well if you cant present signed orders from general chandler for your presence cranston said nervously i will obey my instructions your hardnose position wont win you any medals captain i think youd better reconsider cranston knew damned well he was being toyed with and he didnt like it please no trouble colonel you load up your men and return to your base and dont even think of looking back pitt was enjoying the encounter but he reluctantly turned away and climbed down into the trench he began probing the dirt on the bottom giordino and sandecker idly strolled over to the edge and watched him cranston hesitated he was outranked but his orders were clear he decided his stance was firm general chandler would back him if there was an investigation but before he could order his men to clear the area hollis took a whistle from a pocket and blew two shrill blasts like ghosts rising from the graves of a horror movie forty forms that looked more like bushes and undergrowth than men suddenly materialized and formed a loose circle around containing cranston and his men holliss eyes turned venomous bang youre dead you called boss said a bush that sounded like dillenger cranstons cockiness collapsed i must report this to general chandler he stammered you do that said hollis coldly you can also inform him that my orders come from general clayton metcalf of the joint chiefs this can be verified through communications to the pentagon these people and my team are not here to interfere with your excavation on gongora hill or get in the way of the generals operations along the river our job is to find and preserve roman surface artifacts before theyre lost or stolen do youread captain i understand sir replied cranston gazing around uneasily at the purposefullooking men whose facial expressions appeared frightful under the camouflage makeup found another one pitt shouted unseen below ground sandecker excitedly waved everyone to the trench hes got something the confrontation was momentarily forgotten as the engineers and sof men clustered around the rim of the trench pitt was on his hands and knees brushing away loose dirt from a long metallic object in a few minutes he pulled it free and very carefully passed it up to lily the flippancy was gone now as she examined the ancient relic fourthcentury sword with definite roman characteristics she announced neatly intact with little corrosion may i asked hollis she held it out to him and he gently clasped his hand around the hilt and lifted the blade above his head just think he murmured reverently the last man to hold this was a roman legionary then he graciously passed it to cranston howd you like to fight a battle with this instead of an automatic firearm id prefer a bullet any day cranston said thoughtfully to being hacked to shreds as soon as the engineers left on the short drive back to their encampment pitt turned to hollis my compliments on your camouflage i only detected three out of your whole team it was eerie said lily knowing you were all around us but not visible hollis looked genuinely embarrassed were more used to concealment in jungle or forest this was a good field exercise for semiarid terrain an excellent job added sandecker pumping holliss hand lets hope general chandler buys the good captains report said giordino if he bothers to hear it pitt replied the generals most urgent business is to stop half a million aliens from flooding across the border and grabbing the librarys art and knowledge he doesnt have time to fool with us what about the roman sword asked hollis holding it up that goes back in sams museum collection hollis looked at pitt you didnt find it in the trench no you get a turn on digging holes pitt acted as though he hadnt heard hollis he walked a short distance to the summit of the hill and looked down the slope into mexico the tent city had swelled to twice what it was the previous day tomorrow night he thought topiltzin would unleash the stampede tomorrow night he turned to his left and stared up at the slightly higher gongora hill the army engineers were digging exactly where lily had placed her stakes four days ago they made two separate excavations one was at the common tunnel complete with overhead supports the other was an open mine a gouged crater in the side of the hill work was going slowly since general chandler had pulled away most of the engineers to help in the border defense pitt turned and came back down the trench he walked up to hollis whos your best demolition expert major dillenger is one of the best explosive ordinance men in the army i need about two hundred kilograms of csix nitroglycerin gel hollis looked at him in genuine surprise two hundred kilograms of csix ten kilos can take out a battleship do you know what youre asking the nitrogel mix is shockhazardous also a battery of spotlights pitt pressed on we can borrow them from a rockconcert group spotlights strobe lights and eardrumblasting audio equipment then he turned to lily ill leave it to you to find a carpenter who can knock together a box why in gods name do you want all that stuff lily asked eyes wide with curiosity you dont want to know giordino moaned ill explain later pitt hedged sounds crazy to me said lily uncomprehending the lady was only half right pitt thought his plan was twice as crazy as anything she could conceive but he kept everyone in the dark he didnt think now was the right time to tell them he planned to take his act on the stage the green volvo with the taxi markings stopped at the drive of yazids villa near alexandria the egyptian army guards who were posted by the personal order of president hasan stiffened into alertness at the gate as the taxi sat there without anyones getting out ammar sat in the back seat his eyes and jaw heavily bandaged he wore a blue silk robe and a small red turban his only medical treatment since escaping santa inez had come during a twohour visit to a backstreet buenos aires surgeon before chartering a private jet to fly him across the ocean to the small airport outside the city he no longer felt pain in his empty eye sockets the drugs took care of that but it was still agony to speak through his shattered jaw and although he felt a strange sense of tranquility his mind functioned as ruthlessly and efficiently as ever we ate here said ibn from the drivers seat ammar visualized yazids vffla in his mindevery detail as if he could actually see i know he said simply you do not have to do this g suleiman aziz i have no more hopes or fears ammar spoke slowly fighting the pain of each syllable it is the will of allah ibn swung from behind the wheel opened the rear door and helped ammar to climb out he led ammar up the driveway and turned him so he faced the heavily guarded gate the gate is five meters in front of you ibn spoke haltingly in a voice heavy with emotion he gently embraced ammar goodbye suleiman aziz i will miss you do what you promised my friend and we will meet in allahs garden ibn quickly turned and retraced his steps to the car ammar stood without moving until he heard the sound of the engine fade in the distance then he approached the gate stop right there blind man ordered a guard i have come to visit my nephew akhmad yazid said ammar the guard nodded to another who disappeared into a small office and came out with a folder containing twenty or so names uncle you say whats your name ammar enjoyed making his last play as an impostor he had collected on an old debt from a colonel in abu haniids defense ministry and received the list of names of those permitted entry into yazids villa he selected one who couldnt be immediately contacted mustapha mahfouz your name is here all light lets see your identification the guard studied ammars counterfeit id fruitlessly trying to compare the photo with the heavily bandaged features what happened to your face the car bomb that exploded in the bazaar at el mansura i was struck by flying debris too bad the guard said without sincerity you can blame your nephew it was his followers who set it off he gestured to a subordinate if he clears the metal detector guide him up to the house ammar held out his arms as if he expected to be frisked no need for a body search mahfouz if youre carrying a weapon the machine will spot it the metal detector revealed nothing and did not sound the front door ammar gloated as the egyptian army security guard led him up the steps to the front door no having to sneak in a side passage this time he sorely wished he could see the look on yazids face when they met he was guided into what he perceived to be a large entry hall by the echo of the guards boots on the tile floor he was helped to a stone bench and he sat down wait here ammar heard the guard mumble to someone before returning to the gate he sat in silence for several minutes then he heard approaching footsteps followed by a contemptuous voice you are mustapha mahfouz ammar recognized the voice instantly yes he answered casually do i know you we have not met i am khaled fawzy leader of akhmads revolutionary council ive heard good things about you the arrogant jackass thought ammar he doesnt know me under the bandages or by the slow rasp of my speech it is indeed an honor to meet you come along said fawzy taking ammar by the arm ill take you to akhmad he thought you were still on a mission for him in damascus i dont think hes aware of your injuries the result of an assassination attempt three days ago ammar lied artfully i left the hospital only this morning and flew straight here to brief akhmad first hand akhrnad will be pleased to hear of your loyalty he will also be saddened to learn of your injuries unfortunately your visit is poorly timed i cannot meet with him he is at prayer fawzy said curtly despite his suffering ammar could have laughed he slowly became aware of another presence in the room it is vital he receive me you may speak freely to me mustapha mahfouz the name was spoken with heavy sarcasm i will relay your message tell akhmad it concerns his ally who fawzy demanded what ally topiltzin the name seemed to hang in the room for an interminable time the stillness became intense and then it was broken by a new voice you should have stayed and died on the island suleiman said akhmad yazid in a menacing tone ammars calm did not desert him he had set his genius and last bit of strength for this moment he was not about to wait for death he was going to step forward and embrace it not for him a life of perpetual darkness and disfigurementrevenge was his deliverance i could not die without standing in your forgiving presence one last time save your babble and remove those stupid bandages youre losing your touch your crude imitation of mahfbuz was fourthrate for a man of your skills ammar did not reply he slowly unwrapped the bandages until the ends came free and he dropped them on the floor yazid audibly sucked in his breath when he saw the hideous disfigurement of ammars face sadistic blood ran in fawzys veins he stared with the perverted duill of one who enjoyed the sight of human wreckage my payment for my service annnar slowly rasped how is it youre alive yazid asked his voice shaken my faithful friend ibn hid me from the american special forces for two days until he fashioned a raft out of driftwood after drifting with the current and paddling for ten hours by the grace of allah we were picked up by a chilean fishing boat that set us ashore near a small airport at puerto williams we stole an airplane and flew to buenos aires where i chartered a jet to bring us to egypt that does not come easy to you muttered yazid you realize you signed your death warrant by coming here fawzy purred with anticipation i expected little else suleiman aziz ammar said yazid with a trace of sadness the greatest assassin of his time feared and respected by the cia and the kgb the creator of the most successful assassinations ever carried out and to think you should end as a filthy pathetic beggar in the streets what are you saying akhmad asked fawzy in surprise the man is already dead yazids disgust was slowly turning to satisfaction our financial experts will arrange for his wealth and investments to be taken over in my name then he will be turned out in the streets with twentyfourhour guards to make certain he remains in the slums he will spend the rest of his days begging to exist that is far worse than a quick death you will have me killed when i tell you what i came to say said ammar conversationally im listening said yazid inpatiently i dictated a complete fiftypage report of the entire flamborough affairall names conversations and dates were carefully itemized everything including my observations on the mexican part of the operation and my opinion on the connection between you and topiltzin copies are being read at this moment by the intelligence services of western countries and members of their news media however you deal with me akhmad knowing youre finished he broke off abruptly gasped as his entire head burst into excruciating agony fawzys face was livid and teeth gnashed in rage struck ammar with his fist the impact did not carry the solid weight of a planned punch fawzys unthinking explosive action came from complete loss of selfcontrol the blow glanced off one side of ammars injured jaw a man in good physical condition would have pulled it off but he was a wounded man on the brink of unconsciousness delicate scar tissue around his eyes and jaw split apart he fell backward warding off fawzys blows with his hands and arms fighting to clear ills mind of the pain face white blood spurting stop yazid shouted at fawzy cant you see the man is trying to die he maybe lying hoping well kill him here and now ammar reclaimed a measure of mental control positioning the sound of yazids voice the location of fawzy he reached out with his left hand and moved slowly forward until he was certmn he touched yazids arm then he clutched it and made a movement that brought it up behind his neck the composite knife was pressed tightly into the slight indentation just to the right of ammars upper arm secured by white surgical tapeknown as a utility device by undercover operatives it was designed to pass safely through metal detectors annnar tore the thin triangularshaped eighteencentimeter blade from his back whipped back his elbow like a piston then rammed the knife into yazids chest just under the rib cage the vicious thrust lifted the revolutionary muslim impersonator off his feet paul capesterres eyes bulged in shock and terror his only sound was a hoarse gurgle farewell vermin ammar croaked through his bleeding mouth and then the knife was jerked free and he made a sweeping arc toward the spot where he sensed fawzy was standing the knife wasnt designed for a slashing attack but his hand came in contact with fawzys face and he felt the blade slice the cheek ammar knew fawzy was righthanded and always carried a gun an old ninemillimeter luger in a holster slung under the left armpit he fell against fawzy attempting to clutch the arrogant fanatic while shoving the knife upward again without sight his timing was late fawzy had swiftly drawn the luger he pushed the barrel into ammars stomach and triggered two rounds before the knife drove into his heart he dropped the gun and clutched at his chest he swayed a few steps to his side staring down with a swaying quizzical look at the knife protruding on an upward angle below his sternum finally his eyes rolled upward and he dropped to the floor only a meter from where capesterre had fallen ammar very slowly sank to the ceramic tile floor and settled on his back there was no more pain none at all he saw visions without his eyes he could feel his life ebbing away as if it were floating down a stream his fate had been decided by a man hed only met briefly the unage came back of the tall man with the green eyes and the set grin a wave of hate surged and just as quickly passed dirk pittthe name was etched in the darkening reaches of his mind he felt a euphoric contentment close over him his last thought was that ibn would take care of pitt then the slate would be wiped clean the president sat in a leather armchair and stared at four television monitorsthree were tuned to the major networks while the fourth was a direct feed from an artny communications truck at roma he looked but his eyes glistened with intensity they roved steadily from one monitor to the next his face was set in concentration i cant believe so many people can exist in so small an area he said wonderingly their food has about run out said schiller g from an uptotheminute cia report g water is scarce and the sanitation facilities are backed up its tonight or never sighed nichols wearily the president asked what kind of numbers are we looking at a computer headwunt from an aerial photograph shows nearly four hundred and thirtyfive thousand replied schiller and theyre going to pour ugh a corridor less than a kilometer wide nichols said grimly damn that murdering bastard the president said savagely doesnt he realize or care that thousands will be killed or drowned in the crush alone a majority of them women and children added nichols the capesterres arent known for charity and goodwill muttered schiller acidly still not too late to remove him this from cia director martin brogan killing topiltzin would be comparable to assassinating hitler in providing your hired gun got close enough commented nichols afterward hed be butchered by the crowd i was thinking of a highpowered rifle from four hundred meters schiller shook his head not a practical solution a clear shot could only come from an elevation on our side of the river the mexicans would know immediately who was responsible then things could turn real ugly instead of a peaceful crowd general chandlers troops would be facing a maddened mob theyd storm roma with any weapons they could find guns knives rocks and bottles then wed have a real war on our hands i concur said nichols general chandler would have no choice but to open up with everything he had to save his men and any american citizens in the area the president struck the arm of the chair with his clenched fist in frustration is there nothing we can do to prevent mass slaughter any way we look at it said nichols were on the short end of the stick maybe we should say the hell with it and turn over the alexandria librarys treasure to president de lorenzo anything to keep it out of topiltzins filthy hands a meaningless gesture said brogan topiltzins only using the artifacts as an excuse for a confrontation our intelligence sources report he plans the same immigrant invasions from baja into southern california and across the border at nogales into arizona if only we can stop this madness muttered the president one of four phones buzzed and nichols picked it up general chandler mr president hes coming through on a scrambled frequency the president let out a long breath staring into the face of the man i may have to order to kill ten thousand people is the least i can do the monitor faded for a moment and then came back with the head and shoulders of a man who was in his late forties his face was gaunt and his heavily silvered hair was bare of helmet or cap the stress of command showed in the lines around the blue eyes good morning general the president greeted him i regret i can see you and you cant see me but there is no camera at this end i understand mr president what is the situation a heavy rain is just starting to fall which should prove a godsend for those poor people they can replenish their water supplies dust will be dampened and the stench from their latrines is already beginning to diminish have there been any provocations the usual taunts and banners but no violence from what you can observe have any of the crowd become discouraged and started drifting back to their homes no sir replied chandler if anything theyre more enthused they think their aztec messiah brought the rain and hes pounded his chest to convince them of it groups of catholic priests have been circulating among the people preaching and begging them to return to the church and their homes but topiltzins goons quickly escort the good fathers out of town martin brogan thinks theyll make their move tonight my intelligence agrees with mr brogans timetable the general hesitated before asking the fateful question any change in orders mr president im still to stop them at any cost until i tell you different general i must state sir youve placed me in a very awkward situation i cannot guarantee my men will cut down women and especially children if so ordered im in sympathy with your position but if the line is not held in roma millions of poor mexicans will see it as an open invitation to pour into the united states unhindered i cant argue the point mr president but if we let loose a wall of modern firepower into half a million people jammed shoulder to shoulder history will convict us of committing a crime against humanity chandlers words triggered the horror of nazi vileness and the nuremberg tnals in the presidents mind but he stiffened his resolve repugnant as the thought is general he said solemnly the consequences of unaction are unlikely my national security experts predict that a wave of selfpreservation hysteria will sweep the country resulting in the formation of vigilante amiies to beat back the flood of illegal immigrants no mexicanamericans will be safe the death toll on both sides could climb to astronomical proportions conservative legislators will rise up and demand congress vote a formal declaration of war against mexico i dont even want to think about what happens after that possibility everyone in the room could clearly see the confusion of conflicting thoughts and emotions that were swirling through the generals mind when he spoke it was in a quiet controlled voice i respectfully request we stay in close communication until the incursion understood general agreed the president my national security advisers and i will gather in the situation room shortly thank you mr president the image of general chandler was cut to a closeup of a small barge being pulled into the water on rollers by nearly a hundred men using ropes well said schiller shaking his head as if marveling at it all weve done all we can to contain the bomb but failed to keep the explosion from becoming irreversible now all we can do is sit by and be consumed they came an hour after dark men women and children some barely able to walk all held lighted candles the low clouds that lingered after the rainstorm glowed orange from the spraw g ocean of flickering flame they came in one gigantic swell toward the shoreline voices slowly rising in an ancient chant the sound grew from a hum to a loud drone that rolled across the river and cau windows to vibrate in roma country refugees and city poor who had abandoned their mud hovels corrugated tin shacks and cardboard carton shelters in destitute villages or noxious slums came as one they were galvanized by topiltzins pro se of a new dawning of the oncemighty aztec empire on former lands in the united states they were desperate people on the bottom rung of wrenching poverty driven to grasp at any hope for a better life they moved at a snails pace one short step at a time to the waiting fleet of boats they came down the roads that were muddy and puddled from the rain small children whined in fear as their mothers carried or led them onto unstable rafts that dipped and bobbed during the boarding hundreds were fo into the river by the crush behind frightened cries came from a multitude of young victims as they were pushed into water over their heads many went under or drifted away with the current before they could be rescued a nearimpossible job since most of the men were grouped farther to the rear slowly in disorganized confusion the hundreds of boats and rafts began to pull away for the opposite shore the american armys floodlights joined by those of the television crews brightly illuminated the turmoil swelling across the river the soldiers stared in uneasy fascination at the tragedy and the human wall advancing toward them general chandler stood on the roof of romas police station in the center of the bluff his face was gray under the lights and there was a look of despair in his eyes the scene was far more appalling than his worst fears he spoke into a small microphone clipped to his collar can you see mr president can you see the madness president stared fixedly at the huge monitor in the situation room yes general the transmission is coming in clearly he sat at the end of a long table flanked by his closest advisors cabinet members and two of the four joint chiefs of staff they all gazed at the incredible spectacle that was displayed in stereophonic sound and vivid color the fastest boats had touched shore and their passengers quickly scrambled out only when the first wave was fully across and the fleet on its way back for the next passengers did the mob assemble and press forward the few men who had crossed over were walking up and down the shore with bullhorns encouraging and urging the women forward clutching their candles and their children while chanting in the aztec language the women began scrambling up the bluff like an army of ants gathering around a rock in expectation of joining again on the other side the terrorhaunted looks of the children and the determined faces of their mothers as they stared into the muzzles of the guns were shown by the cameras topiltzin said his divine powers would protect them and they fervently believed him good lord exclaimed doug oates the entire first wave is made up of women and little kids no one commented on oatess alarming observation the men in the situation room watched with growing dread as another crowd of women began to lead their children across the bridge and toward the tanks and armored cars solidly blocking their way general said the president can you fire a volley over their heads yes sir replied chandler ive ordered my troops to load blank rounds the risk of hitting innocent people beyond the town is too great to use live ammo a sound decision said general metcalf of the joint chiefs curtis knows what hes doing general chandler turned to one of his aides give the command to fire a blank salvo the aide a major barked into a radio receiver blank salvo fire the thunderous roar spat a wall of flame into the night the concussion came like a gust of wind blowing out many of the candles held by the throng the earsplitting clap from the tank cannon and the crackle of smallarms fire reverberated throughout the valley ten seconds ten seconds it took between the commands to fire and cease fire and for the rumble to echo back from the low hills behind roma a paralyzing silence pierced by the pungent smell of cordite fell over the stunned multitude then the screams of the women shattered the quiet quickly joined by the shrieks of the terrified children most dropped in horror to the ground while the rest remained standing frozen in shock a great outcry followed from the other side as the men held back from crossing with their wives and children feared the fallen were dead or wounded pandemonium erupted and for the next few minutes it looked as though the immigrant invasion had been stopped dead in its tracks then spotlights from the mexican shore blazed to life and were beamed to a figure standing atop a small platform supported on the shoulders of several men in white tunics topiltzin stood with arms outstretched in a parody of christ shouting through speakers ordering the women who were hugging the ground to rise up and press forward slowly the shock diminished and everyone began to realize there were no bloody mangled bodies many laughed hysterically to find they were neither injured nor dead a rolling cheer went up that turned deafening as the throng mistakenly thought topiltzins powers had miraculously swept aside the destruction and shielded them from harm he turned it against us said julius schiller ruefully the president shook his head sadly just as its happened so many times in our nations history our humane efforts backfire chandlers in for it said nichols general metcalf nodded very slowly yes it all falls on his shoulders now the time for the fateful decision had arrived there was no dodging the agonizing issue any longer the president sitting safely deep in the basement of the white house remained strangely silent he had deftly passed the time bomb to the niililuy laying the groundwork for general chandler to become the sacrificial scapegoat he was between the proverbial rock and a hard place he could not allow an army of foreigners to simply storm across the borders unhindered but neither could he risk the downfall of his entire administration by directly ordering chandler to slaughter children no president ever felt so impotent the chanting women and children were only a few short meters away from the troops entrenched a short distance back of the shoreline those at the head of the snakelike column of candles crossing the international bridge were already close enough to look up at the gun muzzles of the tanks general curtis chandler had a long and illustrious military career to look back upon but nothing to look forward to except a guiltstricken conscience his wife had died the year before from a long illness and they had no children a onestar brigadier general he had no more rank to attain in the short time before his retirement now he stood on the bluff watching hundreds of thousands of illegal inunigrants flood into his nativ land and wondered why his life had cruelly culmanated at this place and time the expression on his aides face bordered on frantic sir the order to fire chandler stared at the little children nervously clutching their mothers hands their candles revealing their wide dark eyes general your orders the aide implored chandler mumbled something but the aide couldnt hear it over the chanting im sorry general did you say fire chandler turned and his eyes glistened let them pass sir those are my orders major im damned if ill go to my grave a baby killer and for gods sake dont even say the words dont fire in case some dumb platoon commander misunderstands the major nodded and hurriedly spoke into his microphone to all commanders general chandlers orders make no hostile move and allow the immigrants to pass through our lines repeat stand down and let them through with immeasurable relief the american soldiers lowered their weapons and stood stiff and uneasy for a few minutes then they relaxed and began flirting with the women and kneeling down playing with the children and gently cajoling them to wipe away their tears forgive me mr president said chandler speaking into a camera i regret i must end my military career by refusing a direct order from my commanderinchief but i felt that under the circumstances not to worry replied the president you did a magnificent job he turned to general metcalf i dont care where he stands on the seniority list please see that curtis receives another star ill be more than happy to take care of it sir good call mr president said schiller realizing the presidents silence had all been a bluff you certainly knew your man there was a faint smile in the presidents eyes i served with curtis chandler when we were lieutenants of artillery in korea he would have fired on a vicious outofcontrol armed mob but women and babies never general metcalf also saw through the facade you still took a terrible chance the president nodded in agreement now i have to answer to the american people for the unopposed invasion of their land by masses of illegal aliens yes but your show of restraint will be a strong bargaining chip for future negotiations with president de lorenzo and other central american leaders oates consoled him in the meantime added mercier our military and law enforcement agencies will be quietly rounding up topiltzins followers and herding them back across the border before the threat of vigilante warfare breaks out i want the operation to be conducted as humanely as possible the president said firmly havent we forgotten something mr president asked metcalf general the alexandria library nothing stands in the way now of topiltzins looting the artifacts the president turned to senator pitt who had been sitting quietly at the end of the table well george the army has struck out and youre the last man at bat you care to enlighten everyone on your stopgap plan the senator looked down at the table he didnt want the others to see the uneasy apprehension in his eyes a desperation long shot a deception created by my son dirk i dont know how else to describe it but if everything goes right robert capesterre aka topiltzin wont lay his hands on the knowledge of the ancients however if all goes wrong as some critics already suggest the capesterres will rule mexico and the treasure will be lost forever thankfully the outpouring of religious zeal and topiltzins maniacal grab for power did not end in bloodshed there was no death by misunderstanding the only real tragedy was that of the young victim who had drowned during the first crossing unbound the massive crowd flowed past the army units and through the streets of roma toward gongora frill the chanting had faded and they shouted slogans in the aztec tongue that all american and most mexican observers could not comprehend topiltzin led the triumphal pilgrimage up the slope of the hill the aztec god unposter had carefully planned for his role of deliverer seizing the egyptian treasures would give him the necessary influence and forcing aside the long reigning institutional revolutionary party of president de lorenzo without the inconvenience of a free election the head of mexico was within four hundred meters of falling into capesterre family hands news of his brothers death in egypt had not yet reached him his close supporters and advisers had deserted the communications truck during the excitement and missed the urgent message they walked behind topiltzins handcarried platform driven by curiosity to see the artifacts topiltzin stood erect in a white robe with a jaguarskin cape draped on his shoulders clutching a raised pole that flew a banner of the eagle and the snake a forest of portable spotlights were aimed at his platform bathing him in a multicolored corona the glare distracted him and he gestured for some of the lights to sweep the slope ahead except for several pieces of heavy equipment the excavation seemed deserted none of the army engineers was evident near the crater or the tunnel topiltzin didnt like the look of it he spread his hands as a signal for the advancing mob to halt the order was repeated through loudspeakers until the forward wall of people slowly came to a stop every face turned toward topiltzin reverently awaiting his next command suddenly a bansheelike wail rose from the summit of the hill and increased in volume until its shrill pitch forced the crowd to cover their ears with their hands then an an aray of strobe lights sparkled and flashed across the sea of faces a light display with the magical dazzle of the northern lights danced in the night sky the people stood rooted gazing entranced at the extraordinary sight the light show grew to an indescribable intensity while the shriek whipped the air around the countryside with the eerie timbre of a sound track from a sciencefiction movie together the flashing lights and the eerie sounds built to a breathtaking crescendo and then the strobe lights went out and the silence struck with stunning abruptness for a full minute the sound rang in everyones ears and the lights skyrocketed in their eyes then an unseen light source very slowly highlighted a lone figure of a man standing on the peak of the hill the effect was startling the light rays shimmered and glistened off metallic objects surrounding his body when the man was fully revealed he was seen to be wearing the fighting gear of an ancient roman legionary he wore a burgundy tunic under a polished iron cuirass the helmet on his head and the greaves protecting his shins were shined to a high gloss a gladiusa doubleedged swordhung at his side clasped to a leather sling that went over the opposite shoulder one arm held an oval shield while the opposite hand gripped an uptight pilum thrusting spear topiltzin stared with curious fascination a game a joke a theatrical hoax what were the americans scheming now his immense horde of believers stood in hushed silence and stared at the roman as if he were a phantom then they slowly turned back to topiltzin waiting expectantly for their messiah to make the first move a bluff born of desperation he decided finally the americans were playing their last card in an effort to block his superstitious dirtpoor followers from approaching the treasures could be a trick to kidnap and hold you as a hostage said one of his nearby advisers there was contemptuous speculation in topiltzins eyes a trick yes but a kidnap no the americans know this mob would go on a rampage if i was threatened the ploy is transparent except for the envoy whose skin i sent back to washington ive denied all appeals for talks with their state department officials this theatrical production is simply a clumsy attempt at a final facetoface negotiation id be interested to learn what offer theyve thrown on the table without uttering another word and without listening to further warnings from his advisers he ordered the platform lowered to the ground and he stepped off the spotlights stayed on him as he advanced up the hill alone and arrogant his feet did not show beneath the hem of his robe and he appeared to glide rather than walk he moved at a measured pace fingering a hoistered colt python revolver on a belt under his robe he also kept one hand on an orange smoke bomb in case he required a visual effect to screen a quick escape he approached until he could clearly see that the figure in the roman legionary costume was a department store mannequin it wore an insipid smile and the painted eyes stared blankly into nothingness the plaster hands and face were faded and chipped an unmistakable curiosity spread on topiltzins face as he studied the dummy but there was also a look of wariness he was sweating freely and the white robe had wrinkled and gone limp then a tall man in range boots denims and a white turtleneck sweater stepped into the spotlights from behind a thicket of mesquite he peered through opaque green eyes that were as cold as an arctic ice floe he stopped when he stood beside the mannequin topiltzin felt he had the advantage he wasted no time he spoke first in english what did you hope to gain with the dummy and the light show your attention my compliments you were successful now if youll kindly relate your governments message the stranger stared at him for a long moment anybody ever tell you your outfit looks like a bed sheet the day after a college fraternity toga party topiltzins expression hardened did your president hope to insult me by sending a clown i believe this is where im supposed to say it takes one to know one you have one minute to state your case he paused and made a sweeping gesture with his hand before i order my people to resume their march pitt turned to the rear of the hill and looked questioningly toward the many kilometers of dark open country march where topiltzin ignored the remark you can begin with your name your title and function in the american bureaucracy my name is dirk pitt my title is mister pitt my function is united states taxpayer and you can go straight to hell topiltzins eyes blazed darkly men have died horribly for showing disrespect to one who speaks directly to the gods pitt smiled with the bored unconcern of the devil being threatened by a television evangelist if we have to talk lets cut out the hype and hot air youve misled the poor of mexico with stage gimmicks while promising them new lifestyles over the rainbow you cant possibly deliver youre a fraud from top to bottom youre a fraud so dont talk down to me im not one of your garbage pickers im not impressed with criminal scum like robert capesterre capesterre opened his mouth then snapped it shut he took a step backward surprise showing in his eyes unable to fully believe what hed heard seconds passed while he stared at pitt at last he spoke in a hoarse whisper how much do you know enough pitt replied casuaily the capesterre family and their shiny business are the talk of washington champagne corks popped all over the white house when word came in about your greasehead brother the one who hes a muslim prophet poetic justice him getting killed by the terrorist who ordered him to hijack the lady flamborough and murder the passengers my brother capesterre could not spit out the word dead i dont believe you you didnt know pitt asked mildly surprised i talked to him less than twentyfour hours ago topilwn said adamantly paul akhmad yazid is alive and well a corpse is not one of his better imitations what do you or your government hope to gain by these games pitt stared at capesterre coldly im glad you brought that up the idea here is to save the alexandria library and we cant very well do that if you unleash your groupies inside the depository chamber theyll steal whatever they can to buy or trade for food and destroy books and what they dont value you alone can stop them my followers do what i command the books and artworks have to be catalogued and surveyed by archeologists i do not have to allow anything mr pitt there will be no concessions your military wouldnt turn my people back at the river therefore the treasure is mine if any attempt is made to stop our removal of the treasure to mexico i shall order it all burned and destroyed i have to give you credit capesterre pitt muttered in disgust you think big a pity youre allowed to run loose you could make up a fifth napoleon for a poker game in an asylum irritation flickered at the edge of capesterres eyes goodbye mr pitt my patience is exhausted i will genuinely enjoy sacrificing you to the gods and sending your flayed skin to the white house forgive me for not having any decorative tattoos capesterre found pitts freeandmy indifference unnerving no one had ever talked down to him before he turned and raised a hand toward the hushed mass of people dont you think you should inventory your new wealth before you turn it over to them pitt asked especially alexanders golden casket capesterres hand slowly dropped there was a flush at his temples what are you saying alexanders casket exists and so do his remains pitt motioned toward the excavated runnel would you like a guided tour before you throw open the storage chamber to your adoring public capesterre nodded with his back to the crowd he slipped the colt revolver from the belt beneath his robe and held it out of sight under a loose draped sleeve his other hand gripped the smoke bomb the slightest move by you or anyone hidden inside the tunnel to harm me and i will blow your spine in two why would i possibly want to harm you pitt asked with mock innocence where are the engineers who were working the excavation every man who could carry a gun was sent to the defense line at the river the lie seemed to satisfy capesterre raise your shirt and drop your pants below your boots in front of all these people pitt asked smiling i want to see if youre armed or wired for sound pitt pulled his turtleneck above his shoulders and lowered the denims to his ankles there was no sign of a bidden mutter or gun on his body or inside his boots satisfied topiltzm nodded he waved the gun toward the shaft entrance you lead id follow mind if i carry the dummy inside the weapons hes holding are real artifacts you can leave them just inside the entrance then turned and waved a signal to his advisers that all was safe pitt adjusted his clothing removed the weapons from the mannequin and entered the shaft the roof was slightly less than two meters high and pitt had to duck under the support beams as he walked he deposited the spear and sword but kept the shield placing it over his head as if to ward off falling rock knowing the shield was as useless as a sheet of cardboard against rounds from a magnum handgun topiltzin made no protest the shaft sloped sharply down for twelve meters and then leveled off the passage was lit by a stnug of lights that hung from the beams the army engineers had cut the walls and floor almost perfectly flat so the going was easy the only discomfort was the stuffy air and the dust that rose in swirls from their footsteps are youreceiving sound and picture mr president asked general chandler yes general answered the president their conversation is coming in quite clear but they walked out of camera range when they entered the tunnel well pick them up again in the casket chamber where we have another concealed camera how is pitt wired asked martin brogan the microphone and transmitter are inserted in the front seam of the old shield is he armed we dont believe so all those in the situation room became silent as their eyes moved to a second monitor that was displaying the excavated chamber under gongora hill the camera was focused on a gold coffin raised in the center of the chamber but not all eyes were on the second monitor one pair had not left the first who was that nichols blurted brogans eyes narrowed who do you mean nichols pointed at the monitor whose camera was still aimed at the underground entrance of the hill a shadow passed in front of the camera and moved into the tunnel i didnt see anything said general metcalf i saw it too the president agreed he leaned toward the microphone sitting on the table in front of him general chandler mr president the general replied swiftly dale nichols swears he saw someone enter the tunnel after pitt and topiltzin one of my aides thought he caught someone too so im not seeing things nichols sighed do you have any idea who it might be whoever it was chandler said alarm showing on his face he wasnt one of ours i see that you limp said capesterre a little memento of your brothers mad scheme to murder president hasan and hala k l capesterre gave pitt a questioning look but he did not pursue the subject his mind was taken up with keeping an eye on pitts every move while staying alert for the least sign of in trigue a little farther on the tunnel broadened into a circular gallery pitt slowed and came to a stop in front of a coffin supported on four legs that were carved in what looked like erect chinese dragons the entire work gleamed gold under the overhead lights a stack of roman legionary weapons leaned against one wall alexander the great pitt announced the art and scrolls are stored in an adjoining chamber capesterre moved closer in awe he hesitantly reached out and touched the top of the casket then suddenly he jerked his hand back and spun to face pitt his face a mask of rage a trick he shouted his voice echoing through the tunnels this is no twothousandyearold coffin the paint isnt dry the greeks were very advanced shut up capesterres right sleeve fell away exposing the revolver no more smart talk mister pittwhere is the treasure give me a break pitt begged we havent hit the main depository chamber yet he began to edge away from the coffin feigning fear he backed up until his shoulders touched the wall holding the ancient swords and spears his eyes darted to the casket as if expecting its resident to sit up capesterre caught the furtive glance and his lips glazed into a knowing smile he pointed the revolver at the coffin he pulled the trigger and four holes appeared on one side but exited in great shredded gouges on the opposite the reports were deafening inside the rock chamber they sounded as if the gun was fired under a giant bell capesterre took hold of the rid over the coffins upper half your backup mr pitt he snarled how simpleminded of you there was no place to hide him pitt breathed regretfully the green eyes showed no fear and his voice was tightly controlled capesterre threw open the lid and stared inside his face went deathly pate and he shuddered in horror before letting the lid drop with a loud thump a low moan escaped his lips growing into a long drawnout no sound pin turned slightly so the shield covered the movement of his right hand he edged away from the chamber wall until he stood facing capesterres left side then he glanced uneasily at the hands of his watch he was almost past his deadline capester stepped fearfully toward the coffin again and lifted the lid this time he let it fall open and backward he forced himself to stare inside paul it really is paul he stammerrd in shock from what i was told said pitt president hasan wasnt about to allow akhmad yazids followers to entomb him in a shrine as a martyr so the cadaver was led here where you two can lie together grief slowly replaced shock as capesterre stared at his brother then his face twisted in bitterness and he asked in a vicious undertone what was your part in all this i headed the team that found the key to the library treasure site that was a dedicated effort then your brothers hired terrorists tried to kill me and my friends but only succeeded ravaging my classic car that was a big mistake next you and your brother took my father as a hostage on the lady flamborough you know the ship im talking about now that was really a blunder i decided not to get mad but get even youre going to die capesterre in another minute youre going to lie as cold and stiff as your brother a damned small payment for the men whose hearts you cut out and all those children who drowned because of your insane power grab capesterres body tautened and the grief cleared from his eyes but not before i kill you he said savagely as he spun around and crouched pitt had prepared for the attack the sword hed snatched from the stack by the wall was already raised above his head he brought it down in a slashing sideways arc capesterre itantically lifted the colt the muzzle was only centimeters from lining up on pitts head the gleaming blade sliced through the air glinting under the hanging lights the gun with capestenes hand clutching the grip finger tightening on the trigger seemed to detach from his arm and sail toward the ceiling they rotated through the air end over end before dropping to the limestone floor still locked together capestets mouth sagged open and a thin scream echoed through the excavation then he sank to his knees staring dumbly at the severed limb unable to believe it was no longer a part of him oblivious to the spreading stream of blood he knelt there swaying side to side the pain tightly held in check by shock he slowly looked up at pitt with dazed eyes why this he whispered why not a bullet a small payment for a man by the name of guy rivas you knew rivas pitt shook his head friends of his told me how you mutilated him how his family stood at the grave site not knowing they were burying only his skin friends capesterre asked blankly my father and a man who lives in the white house pitt said coldly he glanced at his watch again he stared down at robeii capesterre but there was no pity on his face sorry i cant stay and help with the mess but i have to run then he turned and headed for the exit tunnel he took only two steps before he came to an abrupt halta short swarthy man wearing a pair of old and worn army combat fatigues stood in the center of the chamber entrance holding a fourshot pistolized shotgun that was pointed at pitts stomach no need to hurry mr pitt he said with a heavy accent his voice maneroffact no one is going anywhere though they had been aware of a third party entering the tunnel the sudden appearance of the menacing stranger still took everyone by surprise in the situation room calamity began to loom as they helplessly watched the scene being played out deep under gongora hill general chandler said the president sharply what in hell is going on who is the intruder were viewing him from our monitoring unit too mr president but the best guess is hes one of topiltzins men he must have penetrated from the north where our security line is spread thin hes wearing a uniform said brogan can he be one of your men not unless our quartermaster is issuing israeli army battle fatigues get some men down there to help pitt ordered general metcalf sir if i sent a squad of men anywhere near the excavation the mob would think we were out to either harm or capture topiltzin theyd go berserk hes right said schiller the crowd is getting edgy the intruder stole inside the tunnel under their noses metcalf persisted why cant a couple of your men do the same it was possible ten minutes ago but not now replied chandler topiltzins crew have set up more floods the whole slope is swimming in bright light a rat couldnt run in there without being seen the excavations face south toward the people explained senator pitt there are no exits behind the hill were lucky as it is chandler continued the gunfire echoing from the tunnel sounded like distant thunder and no one was sure where it came from the president looked at senator pitt darkly george if the crowd begins to surge forward well have to end the operation before your son can escape the senator passed a hand in front of his eyes and nodded solemnly then he looked up at the monitor dirk will make it he said with quiet confidence nichols suddenly came to his feet and pointed at the monitor the mob he rasped despairingly theyre moving while others debated his chances of survival kilometers away pitts main concern was the black mouth of the shotgun pistol he didnt doubt for a second it was held in the hand of a man who had killed many times the face behind the gun wore a bored expression hohum another one pitt thought if he didnt have his insides splashed against a wall in a few seconds he would be crushed by tons of earth he wasnt keen on either choice you mind telling me who you are pitt asked i am ibn telmuk close friend and servant to suleiman aziz ammar yes thought pitt yes the sight of the terrorist on the road in front of the crushing mill came back to him you guys go to any length for revenge dont you it was his last wish that i kill you pitt very slowly dropped his right arm so the sword hung down pointing at the chamber floor he made the show of a brave man accepting defeat and relaxed his body shoulders sagging knees slightly bent were you on santa inez yes suleiman aziz and i escaped back to egypt together pitts dark eyebrows came together he hadnt thought it possible ammar had lived after the shootout god time was running out ibn should have shot him without a word but pitt knew the arab was only toying with him the blast of fifty pellets would come in the middle of a sentence there was no reward in stalling pitt stared at ibn measuring the distance between them figuring what direction he would leap with casual ease he edged the shield across his body capesterre wrapped part of his robe around the bleeding stump moaning from the increasing pain then he held up the blood soaked cloth in front of ibn get him he cried look what he did to me shoot him down i am topiltzin his real name is robert capesterre said pitt hes a colossal fraud capesteffe scrambled over to ibn until he was sitting at the arabs feet dont listen to him pleaded capesterre he is a common criminal for the first time ibn grinned hardly that ive studied a file on mr pitt hes not common at anything looking better pitt thought ibn was momentarily distracted by topiltzin he slipped sideways a few centimeters at a time trying to place himself so that capesterre lay between him and ibn where is ammar pitt asked abruptly dead replied ibn the grin was quickly replaced with liptightening anger he died after killing that pig akhmad yazid the bombshell stunned capesterre his gaze automatically turned to his brothers body in the coffin so it was the man my brother hired to hijack the ship capesteffe uttered in a hoarse croak pitt fought the urge to say i told you so and moved another centimeter ibns eyes registered incomprehension akhmad yazid was your brother two peas in a pod said pitt would yourecognize yazid if you saw him of course his appearance is as familiar as the ayatollah khomeini or yasir arafat pitts mind raced with new modifications to his desperation plan taking advantage of the few crumbs thrown his way everything hinged on how well he could read ibns mind and predict the killers reaction to seeing yazid then take a good look in the coffin do not even think of making a move mr pitt said ibn his eyes hung warily on pitt as he shuffled toward the coffin when his right hip touched the pallbearers handle he stopped and took a quick glance inside and then back at his quarry pitt had not moved a centimeter it all depended on the unexpected pitt planned on the classic double take he took the gamble that ibns first cursory glimpse inside the coffin would cause a delayed reaction followed by a second longer look and ibn did exactly that in the special operations forces command truck parked half a kilometer west of the excavation hollis admiral sandecker lily and giordino gazed at a tv monitor their attention solidly locked into the drama being acted out under gongora hill lily stood motionless her skin eggshellwhite while sandecker and giordino fidgeted in frustration like a pair of zoo tigers with a platter of fresh meat just beyond reach of their cage hollis was pacing the small enclosure nervously clutching a small multifrequency detonation transmitter in one hand while the other held a phone receiver he was shouting at an aide of general chandlers like hell ill detonate not until the crowd passes the danger perimeter theyve moved too close now the aide a colonel countered another thirty seconds snapped hollis not before general chandler wants that hill blown now demanded the colonel his voice rising thats an order that comes from the president youre only a voice over a phone colonel hollis stalled i want the order direct from the president youre asking for a courtmartial colonel it wont be the first time sandecker shook his head fearfully dirk will never make it not now cant you do something pleaded lily talk to him he can hear you over the speaker connected to the tv camera we dont dare distract him answered hollis break his concentration and that arab will kill him thats it giordino muttered infuriated he tore out the command truck door jumped to the ground and dashed over to sam trinitys jeep before holliss men could stop him the car was bouncing through the brush toward gongora hill in one quick leap pitt uncoiled like a rattler and drove the shield against ibn the sword blurred and slashed again his muscled arm swung with all the strength of his shoulder behind it he felt and heard the blade edge clang against metal before it struck something soft an explosion went off seemingly in his face he flinched as the main force of the blast struck the middle of his shield and ricocheted against the rock ceiling the armored plastic sheeting that had been riveted to the laminated wood by major dillenger that afternoon was denied but not penetrated pitts sword hand finished the arc and he launched a murderous backhand swing ibn was fast but his shock at seeing yazid cost him a precious second he caught pitts attack out of the corner of one eye and squeezed off a badly aimed snap shot before the sword blade glanced off the breech of the shotgun and sliced through his hand severing his thumb and fingers just behind the knuckles ibn uttered a ghastly groan the pistolgripped shotgun fell to the hard limestone floor almost on top of the colt python still gripped in capesterres severed hand but ibn recoiled enough to duck away from pitts swing then in one violent twisting motion he lunged at pitt pitt was ready for the assault but as he dodged to one side his right leg folded under him in a flashing instant he knew that one or two of the shotguns pellets had missed the shield and struck him in the same leg that had been wounded on santa inez island before he could react and dance away ibn dropped on him like a panther the black eyes gleamed satanically under the string of lights the teeth ghoulishly bared pitt lost his grip on the sword hilt as ibn knocked it away his other arm was trapped under the inside straps of the shield then slowly deliberately ibns good hand closed around pitts throat kill him robert capesterre shrieked repeatedly like a mad man kill him pitt heaved in a corkscrew motion and brought his fist up from the floor striking ibn in the adams apple with the cartilage of the larynx crushed most men would have gagged to deaththe rest should have at least gone unconscious ibn did neither he simply clutched his throat made a terrible gurgling voice and reeled backward they both struggled drunkidly to their feet pitt hopping on one leg ibn gasping for air his mangled right hand hanging useless they stood there facing each other like wounded pit bulls catching their breath for the next round warily eyeing each other to see who would make the first move it came from an unexpected quarter capestene suddenly came to his senses and threw himself on the colt fiercely struggling onehanded to pry the frozen fingers from the grip the dead hand fell away then like a game of musical chairs capesterres grab triggered a like response from ibn and pitt they quickly looked around for the weapons nearest them pitt lost the shotgun was in ibns corner so was the roman sword any port in a storm pitt thought he kicked out wildly with the foot of his wounded leg connecting with capestenes rib cage but suffering a grinding pain from the effort he also hurled the shield like a frisbee at ibn s g the arab on the stomach and knocking the wind out of him a loud wailing cry gushed from capesterres lips he dropped the colt and pitt caught it in midair it was a nearperfect catchhis hand slipped around the bloodied grip and his finger through the trigger guard ibn doubled over by the blow from the shield was still awkwardly lifting the pistolized shotgun with his left hand when pitt fired pitt tightened his grip for the next recoil the arab stumbled backward against the chamber wall and then his body fell forward onto the floor and his head struck with a repugnantthud pitt stood panting through clenched teeth only then did he hear a familiar voice shout through the speaker get out of there hollis was yelling for jesus sake run for it pitt was temporarily disoriented he was so busy fighting ibn he forgot which passage led to the easier tunnel and which to the more difficult crater exit he took a last fleeting glimpse of robert capesterre the face was ashen from the loss of blood but not pitt saw with fear hate filled the eyes of topiltzin enjoy your trip to hell pitt said capesterres reply was the smoke bomb he had somehow pulled the primer pin smoke instantly burst and fined the interior of the chamber with a densely packed orange cloud what happened the president asked staring at the strange orange mist that blocked out the camera view of the chamber capesteffe must have been carrying some kind of a smokescreening device chandler answered why havent the explosives gone off one moment mr president chandler looked offcamera and conversed angrily with an aide then he turned back colonel hollis of the special operations forces insists on a direct order from you sir is he in charge of the detonation demanded metcalf yes general can you patch him into our communications network one moment four seconds was all it took before holliss face was peering from one of the monitors in the situation room iyou cant see me colonel said the president but yourecognize my voice i do sir hollis answered through tight lips as your commanderinchief im ordering you to blow that hill and blow it now the mob is swarming up the hill nichols said in near panic they all tensed and swung their eyes to the monitor sweeping the hill the huge throng was slowly moving up the slope toward the summit chanting topiltzins name if you wait any longer youll kill a lot of people said metcalf urgently for pitys sake man detonate holliss thumb was poised above the switch he spoke into his transmitter detonation but he didnt press the switch he used the enlisted mans gambit never refuse an order and be tried for insubordination but answer to the affirmative and never carry it out inefficiency was one of the most difficult of charges to prove at a courtmartial he was determined to squeeze every second he could for pitt holding his breath as though he were diving under water eyes tightly closed against the stinging smoke pitt willed his legs to move to run to crawl to do anything which would rush him clear of that horror chamber he made it into a passage not knowing if it led to the tunnel shaft or the crater he kept his eyes shut feeling his way along the wall halfhopping halfhobbling on his bad leg he felt a burning rage to live he simply couldnt believe hed die now not after having survived the last few minutes finally he opened his eyes they burned as if stung by bees but he could see he had passed the worst of the smoke it was only an orange vapor now the shaft through the limestone began to rise he felt a slight increase in temperature and a light breeze then he stumbled outside into the night the stars were there almost blotted out by the bright lights shining up the hill but pitt was not clear there was a snag he had the unsettling realization that he had exited through the crater tunnel the slanting sides rose up another five meters so close yet so tormentingly far he began clawing his way up the incline his wounded leg totally useless now dragging along behind he could only dig in and push with one foot hollis had gone silent the colonel had no words left to say pitt knew the explosion hed so carefully planned was going to take him with it fatigue swept over him in great floating waves yet he stubbornly crawled upward then a dark form appeared over the rim of the crater and a massive hand reached down grabbed the shoulder of pitts sweater and heaved him onto level ground with seemingly incredible ease giordino flung pitt into the open tailgate of the jeep leaped into the drivers seat and jammed the accelerator pedal flat onto the floorboard they had barely covered fifty meters when hollis pressed the demolition switch the signal set off the two hundred kilo of c nitroglycerin gel deep inside the hill with a monstrous roar for one brief moment it was as if a volcanic eruption was about to hurtle from the bowels of the earth the hill shook with a rumble the great mass of topiltzin followers were thrown to the ground their mouths agape in horror the concussion sucking the air from their lungs into a vacuum then the whole summit of gongora hill rose almost ten meters into the air hung there in the night as if clutched by a giant hand and cnimbled and fell inward leaving a huge plume of birowmg dust as a ghostly tombstone november roma texas five days later a few minutes past dnight the presidents helicopter set down at a small airfield a few miles outside roma accompanying him were senator pitt and julius schiller as soon as the rotor blades swung and drooped to a stop admiral sandecker walked up to the door and greeted them good to see you admiral the president said graciously congratulations on a splendid job though i must say i didnt think numa could pull it off thank you mr president replied sandecker with his usual cocky air were all grateful you had enough confidence in our mad plan to give us the goahead a neat scam a very neat scam indeed the president turned and looked at senator pitt but you have the senator to thank for my backing he can be very persuasive after a few words between sandecker and schiller they all climbed a short ladder ugh a concealed door into the bed of a huge tandem tenwheeler dump truck two of the presidents secret service agents wearing work clothes climbed into the cab with the driver four more piled into an old battered dodge van parked in the rear the exterior of the truck had a worn dusty and fadedpaint look but the interior of the fourandahalf by twoanda halfmeter bed was converted into a room containing a kitchen bar and six roomy chairs the top had been covered by side boards and covered with two centimeters of gravel to complete the disguise the door in the dump bed was closed and they settled into the comfortable chairs mounted to the floor and fastened their seat belts sorry about the unusual transportation said sandecker but we cant afford to give the show away with choppers flying in and out of the site this is my first ride inside a gravel dumptruck the president joked the suspension doesnt compare to the white house lincoln limousine weve converted six of these as undercover transports explained sandecker a good choice laughed the senator rapping the metal wall with his knuckles they come bulletproofed the smile on the presidents face died and he turned serious the secret has been kept he asked sanddecker nodded ive seen nothing to indicate otherwise from our end there wont be any leaks from the white house schiller guaranteed picking up on the generals veiled insinuation the lid is nailed tight the president was silent for a moment we were damned lucky to get away with it he said finally topiltzins mob of followers might have gone on an orgy of revenge after they realized he was dead after the shock wore off said sandecker they wandered around the hill staring into the explosions crater as if it was a super phenomenon bloody rioting was kept to a minimum because of the presence of women and children that and the fact that topiltzins close supporters and advisers quietly ducked out and beat a fast retreat for mexico unleaderless and hungry the crowd slowly began filtering back across the border to their cities and villages according to immigration said schiller a few thousand took off north but a third of them have already been rounded up the president sighed at least the worst is over if congress passes our aid plan to latin america it should go a long way in helping our neighbors to the south climb back on their financial feet and the capistene family asked sandecker how will they be dealt with the justice department is going after any assets they have in this country the presidents face was expressionless but his eyes had a steellike glint this is just between us gentlemen but colonel hollis of our special operations forces is planning an assault exercise on an island in the caribbean that shall remain nwneless if any of the capesterre family happen to be in the vicinity at the time well thats too damn bad for them senator pitt gave a sarcastic smile with yazid and topiltzin gone our foreign relations will seem pretty tame for a while schiller shook his head negatively weve only plugged two holes in the dike the worst is down the road dont cry doom julius said the president now in a jovial mood egypt is stable for the moment and with president hasan stepping aside for health reasons and turning over his office to defense minister abu h d the muslim fundamentalists will be under enormous pressure to reduce their demands for an islamic government the fact that hala kamil has consented to marry hamid wont hurt the situation either senator pitt summed up the conversation was interrupted as the truck came to a stop the concealed door was opened from the outside and the ladder set in place after you mr president invited sandecker they stepped to the ground and looked around the area was surrounded by an ordinary chainlink fence and dimly lit by widely spaced pole lights a large sign beside the entrance gate read sam sams gravel company except for a pair of gravel loaders a large excavator bucket and several dump trucks and gravel lers the entire yard was deserted the underground security guard units and electronic detection equipment were virtually invisible to anyone walking around the equipment yard can i meet mr trinity asked the president sandecker shook his head afraid not a good man sam a good patriot after voluntarily signing over the rights to the artifacts to the government he took off on a playing tour of the worlds top one hundred golf courses we compensated him i hope ten million taxfree dollars replied sandecker and we damned near had to hogtie him to take it then sandecker turned and pointed out a deep excavation a few hundred meters away the remains of gongora hill now a gravel pit weve actually made a profit on our sandandcrushedrock operation the presidents face clouded as he stared into the huge open pit that was once the summit of the hill did you happen to dig up topiltzin and yazid sandecker nodded two days ago we sent their remains through the rock crusher i believe theyre both part of a roadbed the president seemed satisfied just what the bastards deserve where is the tunnel asked schiller looking around in there sandecker gestured toward a wellused mobile home trailer that was converted to an office a sign by one window advertised the dispatcher the four secret service agents in the van had already exited and begun patrolling the area while the two in the cab of the truck jumped to the ground and entered the office to check it out as a matter of routine after the presidents party passed through two doors into a small banen office at the rear of the mobile home sandecker invited them to step to the center of the room and hold onto a railing that protruded from the floor he waved at a tv camera in one corner of the ceiling then the floor began to lower through the trailer and into the ground below pretty slick said schiller admiringly yes indeed murmured the president i can see why the project hasnt been penetrated the lift dropped through the limestone and came to a jerking halt thirty meters under the ground surface they stepped off into a widetunneled passageway lit with fluorescenttube lights for as far as they could see the tunnel was lined with sculptures a woman waited to greet them mr president said sandecker may i introduce dr lily sharp director of the cataloging program dr sharp were all deeply in your debt lily blushed im afraid i was only a small cog in the wheel she replied modestly after she was introduced to schiller lily began the guided tour of the the alexandria library weve ed and catalogued different sculptures she explained representing the finest work of the early bronze age beginning in bc and ending m the transcendental style of the byzanum era of the early fourth century except for a few stains from water seepage through the limestone which can be removed by chemicals the marble and bronze figures are in a remarkable state of preservation the president walked speechless through the long passage stopping every so often to gaze in admiration at the magnificent classic sculpture some of it five thousand years old he was overwhelmed at the sheer numbers of it every age every dynasty and empire was represented with the best its artists turned out im actually seeing and touching the alexandria museum collection he said in reverence after the explosion i couldnt believe it wasnt all destroyed the earth tremors stirred up some dust and caused a few bits and pieces of the limestone to fall from the roof said lily but the artifacts came through just fine youre seeing the sculpture just as jumus venator last saw them in ad after nearly two hours of studying the incredible display lily stopped at the last artifact before entering the main gallery the golden casket of alexander the great she announced in a hushed tone the president felt as if he was about to meet god he slowly approached the golden resting place of one of the greatest leaders the world had ever known and peered through the crystal windows the macedonians had laid their king out in his ceremonial armor his cuirass and helmet were pure gold the persian silk that once made up his tunic was mostly gone rotted away after nearly twentyfour centuries all that was left of the great subject of romantic legend were his bones cleopatra julius caesar mark antony all stood and gazed at his remains lectured lily each took his turn hardly able to conceive what lay beneath their eyes then lily led them into the great storage gallery nearly a hundred people were hard at work several were examining the contents of the wooden crates stacked in the gallerys center paintings stained and soiled but restorable along with delicate objects carved from ivory and marble or cast from gold silver or bronze were catalogued and repacked in new cases for transport to a secure building complex in maryland for restoration and preservation most of the archaeologists translators and preservation experts were gently handling the bronze cylindrical tubes that held the thousands of ancient books translating the copper tags and recording descriptions of the contents the containers and their delicate scrolls were also carefully packed for shipment to maryland for study and research here it is lily gestured around the chamber proudly so far weve found the complete books of homer much of the lost teachings by the great greek philosophers early hebrew writings manuscripts and historical data showing new insight on christianity maps illustrating previously unknown tombs of ancient kings the locations of the lost trading centers including tarshish and sheba and geological charts of mines and oil deposits long forgotten enormous gaps in ancient chronological events will be filled the history of the phoericians mycenaeans etruscans and civifintions that were only rumored to exist theyre all here and accounted for in vivid detail if restorable the paintings will give us a true picture of what the immortals of the ancient world looked like for a moment the president had nothing to say he was numbed he couldnt begin to digest the immensity of the astonishing accumulation as art it was priceless as knowledge its value was incalculable finally he asked in a hushed voice how long before youll be finished here well move the scrolls first then the artwork replied lily the sculptures will go last working around the clock we hope to have the passage and gallery emptied and the entire collection safely in maryland by new years almost sixty days said sandecker and the translation of the scrolls lily shrugged that preservation is the slow part depending on budget restrictions were looking at anywhere between twenty and fifty years to make all translations and gain a full understanding of what we have dont worry about funding said the president excitedly the project will have the highest priority ill see to that we cant fool the international community much longer into believing these magnificent treasures were destroyed warned schiller weve got to make an announcement and soon true said senator pitt the uproar from our own people and those of foreign governments has not slackened since the explosion tell me about it the president muttered dryly my popularity poll has dropped fifteen points congress is chewing my tail and every one else is if you gentlemen will forgive me said lily shyly but if you can hold off for another ten days i and the project members can produce some film and video tape of the major pieces of the inventory pitt looked at the president i think she has just handed us a bombshell a dramatic disclosure by the white house backed by a documentary sounds like a hell of an idea he took lilys hand and patted it you dr sharp youve just saved my life oh thank you mr president lily gasped throwing her arms around him in unabashed enthusiasm admiral sandecker shook his hand thank you sir i think youve just made everyones day schiller leaned over and spoke softly into lilys ear just make sure you translate the geological data first we may keep the artworks but the knowledge should be shared with the world lily only nodded after the fever of excitement and the questions eased a bit lily led the presidential group over to a corner of the gallery where pitt and giordino were sitting around a folding table with a latingreek slator who was examining a cylinders tag with a magnifying glass the president recognized them and swiftly walked over good to see you alive and healthy dirk he said with a warm smile on behalf of a grateful nation i wish to thank you for this astonishing gift pitt came to his feet leaning heavily on a cane im only happy it turned out so well if not for my friend al here and colonel hollis id still be under gongora hill will you please clear up the mystery asked schiller how did you know the library treasures were beneath this lower hill instead of the higher gongora i dont mind admitting said the president you had the hell scared out of us all we could think of was what if you blew the wrong hill i apologize for being vague answered pitt unfortunately there was no time for a lengthy explanation to ease everyones fears he paused and gave his father a wide smile im only glad you all trusted me but there was never a real doubt junius venators description of the location that was inscribed on the stone found by sam trinity said to stand north and look straight south to the river cliff when i stood north of gongora hill and stared on a line due south i found that the roma bluff stood almost half a kilometer to the west on my right so i moved farther west and slightly north to the first hill that fit venators directions whats it called asked the senator this hill pitt held up his hands in a blank gesture so far as i can tell it has no name it does now said the president laughing as soon as dr sharp gives me the goahead to announce the greatest treasure discovery in the history of man well say it came from no name hill a dawn mist was lifting from the river and the glow of a new sun rising over the rio grande valley when the presidential party returned to washington their minds thoroughly awed by what they had seen pitt and lily sat on the summit of no name hill and smelled the dampness of morning and watched the lights of roma blink out it looked like a painting by grant wood lily smiled into his eyes they did not look hard and fierce now only soft and pensive the sun shone on his face but he did not see it only felt the warmth she knew his mind was roving in the past she had come to learn he was a man no woman could ever completely possess his love was an unknown challenge somewhere over the horizon a mystery that beckoned with a siren onlyhe could hear he was a man a woman desired for an impassioned affair but never married she knew their relationship was fleeting she fully intended to take advantage of every moment that was left to her until she awoke one day and found him gone in search of the enigma waiting beyond the next hill lily sat against him head on his shoulder what did the tag read tag the one on the scroll you and al seemed so interested in a tantalizing clue to more artifacts he said quietly still staring into the distance where under the sea the scroll was labeled recorded shipwrecks with valuable cargoes she looked up at him a map to underwater treasure there is always treasure somewhere he said almost distantly and youre going to find it he turned and smiled never hurts to look unfortunately uncle sam rarely gives me the time ive yet to search the brazilian jungles for the golden city of el dorado she gave him an intuitive stare and then lay back gazing at the fading stars i wonder where theyre buried he slowly shook off the vision of sunken treasure and looked down who the ancient adventurers who helped venator save the lib collection he shook his head junius venator is a hard man to outguess he could have buried his byzantine comrades most anywhere between here and the river she placed her hand gently on his head and drew him down to her level their lips met and pressed tightly for several moments a hawk spiraled above them in the orange sky but seeing nothing appetizing it winged south into mexico lilys eyes opened and she pulled back smiling coyly do you think theyd mind pitt looked at her curiously mind what if we made love over their grave they might very well be lying beneath us he rolled them both over until she was on her back and he was above looking down into her eyes then his lips curled into a sly grin i dont think theyd care i know i certainly wouldnt
