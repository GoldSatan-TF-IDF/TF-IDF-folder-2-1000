the guns of the south by harry turtledove i headquarters january mr president i have delayed replying to your letter of the th until the time arrived for the execution of the attempt on new berne i regret very much that the boats on the neuse roanoke are not completed with their aid i think success would be certain without them though the place may be captured the fruits of the expedition will be lessened and our maintenance of the command of the waters in north carolina uncertain robert e lee paused to dip his pen once more in the inkwell despite flannel shirt uniform coat and heavy winter boots he shivered a little the headquarters tent was cold the winter had been harsh and showed no signs of growing any milder new england weather he thought and wondered why god had chosen to visit it upon his virginia with a small sigh he bent over the folding table once more to detail for president davis the arrangements he had made to send general rotes brigade down into north carolina for the attack on new berne re had but small hope the attack would succeed but the president had ordered it and his duty was to carry out his orders as best he could even without the boats the plan he had devised was not actually a bad one and president davis reckoned the matter urgent in view of the opinion expressed in your letter i would go to north carolina myself but i consider my presence here always necessary especially now when there is such a struggle to keep the army fed clothed he shook his head keeping the army of northern virginia fed and clothed was a neverending struggle his men were making their own shoes now when they could get the leather which was not often the ration was down to threequarters of a pound of meat a day along with a little salt sugar coffeeor rather chicory and burnt grainand lard bread rice cornthey trickled up the virginia central and the orange and alexandria railroad every so often but not nearly often enough he would have to cut the daily allowance again if more did not arrive soon president davis however was as aware of all that as lee could make him to hash it over once more would only seem like carping lee resumed genl early is still in the a gun cracked quite close to the tent soldiers instinct pulled lees head up then he smiled and laughed at himself one of his staff officers most likely shooting at a possum or a squirrel he hoped the young man scored a hit but no sooner had the smile appeared than it vanished the report of the gun soundedodd it had been an abrupt bark not a pistol shot or the deeper boom of an enfield rifle musket maybe it was a captured federal weapon the gun cracked again and again and again each report came closer to the one before than two heartbeats were to each other a federal weapon indeed lee thought one of those fancy repeaters their cavalry like so well the fusillade went on and on he frowned at the waste of precious cartridgesno southern armory could easily duplicate them he frowned once more this time in puzzlement when silence fell he had automatically kept count of the number of rounds fired no northern rifle he knew was a thirtyshooter he turned his mind back to the letter to president davis valley he wrote then gunfire rang out again an unbelievably rapid stutter of shots altogether too quick to count and altogether unlike anything he had ever heard he took off his glasses and set down the pen then he put on a hat and got up to see what was going on at the tent fly lee almost collided with one of his aidesdecamp who was hurrying in as he tried to leave the younger man came to attention i beg your pardon sir quite all right major taylor will this by any chance have something to do with the ah unusual gun i heard fired just now yes sir walter taylor seemed to beholding on to military discipline with both hands he was lee reminded himself only twentyfive or so the youngest of all the staff officers now he drew out a sheet of paper which he handed to lee sir before you actually see the gun in action as i just have here is a communication from colonel gorgas in richmond concerning it in matters concerning ordnance of any sort no view could be more pertinent than that of colonel gorgas lee agreed he drew out his reading glasses once more set them on the bridge of his nose bureau of ordnance richmond january general lee i have the honor to present to you with this letter mr andries rhoodie of rivington north carolina who has demonstrated in my presence a new rifle which i believe may prove to be of the most significant benefit conceivable to our soldiers as he expressed the desire of making your acquaintance as the army of northern virginia will again it is likely face hard fighting in the months ahead i send him on to you that you may judge both him his remarkable weapon for yourself i remain your most obt servant josiah gorgas colonel lee folded the letter handed it back to taylor as he returned his glasses to their pocket he said very well major i was curious before now i find my curiosity doubled take me to mrrhoodie was it yes sir hes around behind the tents here if you will come with me breath smoking in the chilly air lee followed his aidedecamp he was not surprised to see the flaps from the other three tents that made up his headquarters were open anyone who had heard that gunfire would want to learn what had made it sure enough the rest of his officers were gathered round a big man who did not wear confederate gray the big man did not wear the yellowbrown that was the true color of most homedyed uniforms either nor the black of the general run of civilian clothes lee had never seen an outfit like the one he had on his coat and trousers were of mottled green and brown so that he almost seemed to disappear against dirt and brush and barebranched trees a similarly mottled cap had flaps to keep his ears warm seeing lee approach the staff officers saluted he returned the courtesy major taylor stepped ahead general lee gentlemen this is mr andries rhoodie mr rhoodie here is general lee whom you may well recognize as well as my colleagues majors venable and marshall i am pleased to meet all you gentlemen especially the famous general lee rhoodie said you are much too kind sir lee murmured politely by no means rhoodie said i would be proud to shake your hand he held out his own as they shook lee tried to take the strangers measure he spoke like an educated man but not like a carolinian his accent sounded more nearly british though it also held a faint guttural undertone his odd clothes aside rhoodie did not look like a carolinian either his face was too square his features too heavy that heaviness made him seem almost indecently well fleshed to lee who was used to the lean hungry men of the army of northern virginia but rhoodies bearing was erect and manly his handclasp firm and strong his gray eyes met lees without wavering somewhere in his past lee was suddenly convinced he had been a soldier those were marksmans eyes by the wrinkles at their corners and by the white hairs that showed in his bushy reddish mustache rhoodie had to be nearing forty but the years had only toughened him lee said colonel gorgas gives you an excellent character sir you and your rifle both will you show it to me in a moment if i may rhoodie answered which surprised lee in his experience most inventors were wildly eager to show off their brainchildren rhoodie went on first sir i would like to ask you a question which i hope you will be kind enough to answer frankly sir you are presumptuous charles marshall said the wan winter sun glinted from the lenses of his spectacles and turned his normally animated face into something stern and a little inhuman lee held up a hand let him ask what he would major you need not forejudge his intentions he glanced toward rhoodie nodded for him to continue he had to look up to meet the strangers eye which was unusual for he was nearly six feet tall himself but rhoodie overtopped him by three or four inches i thank you for your patience with me he said now in that notquitebritish accent tell me this then what do you make of the confederacys chances for the coming years campaign and for the war as a whole to be or not to be that is the question marshall murmured i hope our prospects are somewhat better than poor hamlets major lee said his staff officers smiled rhoodie though simply waited lee paused to marshal his thoughts sir since i have but so briefly had the honor of your acquaintance i hope you will forgive me for clinging to what may be plainly seen by any man with some knowledge and some wit that is our enemies are superior to us in numbers resources and the means and appliances for carrying on the war if those peoplehis common euphemism for the federalsuse their advantages vigorously we can but counterpoise to them the courage of our soldiers and our confidence in heavens judgment of the justice of our cause those have sufficed thus far god willing they shall continue to do so who said god is for the big battalions rhoodie asked voltaire wasnt it charles venable said he had been a professor of mathematics before the war and was widely read a freethinker if ever there was one marshall added disapprovingly oh indeed rhoodie said but far from a fool when you are weaker than your foes should you not take the best advantage of what you do have that is but plain sense lee said no one could disagree now rhoodie smiled or his mouth did the expression stopped just short of his eyes thank you general lee you have just given much of my sales talk for me have i yes sir you have you see my rifle will let you conserve your most precious resource of allyour men walter taylor who had seen the gun in action sucked in a long deep breath it could be so he said quietly i await the demonstration mr rhoodie lee said you will have it rhoodie unslung the weapon lee had already noted it was of carbine length stubby next to an infantry musket because it was so short its socket bayonet seemed the longer rhoodie reached over his shoulder into his haversack that was made of mottled cloth like his trousers and coat and looked to be of finer manufacture than even a union man carried most of lees soldiers made do with a rolledup blanket the tall stranger produced a curved metal object perhaps eight inches long and an inch and a half or two inches wide he clicked it into place in front of the carbines trigger this is the magazine he said when its full it holds thirty rounds in fine the rifle now has bullets in it taylor said as all of you will no doubt have noticed it is a breechloader the other aides nodded lee kept his own counsel with a rasping sound followed by a sharp metallic click rhoodie drew back a shiny steel lever on the right side of the rifle the first round from each magazine must be chambered manually he said what about the others venable whispered to taylor youll see taylor whispered back rhoodie reached into the haversack again this time he drew out some folded papers he unfolded one of them it proved to be a target a cutout roughly approximating the shape of a mans head and body he turned to lees aides will you gentlemen please put these up at different ranges out to say four or five hundred yards with pleasure taylor said promptly ive seen how fast your rifle can shoot id like to learn how accurate it is he took some of the targets rhoodie handed the rest to the other aides they stuck lowhanging branches through some leaned others against bushes both in the upright position and sideways shall i have them straighten those sir lee asked pointing they will make your shooting more difficult never mind rhoodie answered soldiers dont always stand up either lee nodded the stranger did not lack for confidence when the aides were through a ragged column of thirty targets straggled southeast toward orange court house a couple of miles off the knot of tents that was lees headquarters lay on a steep hillside well away from encamped troops or any other human habitations the young men laughed and joked as they came back to rhoodie and lee theres general mcclellan charles marshall said stabbing a thumb in the direction of the nearest target give him what he deserves the others took up the cry theres general burnside general hooker general meade hancock warren stoneman howard theres honest abe give him his deserts by god lee turned to rhoodie at your convenience sir the aides fell silent at once one of your men might want to look at a watch rhoodie said i will sir charles venable drew one from his waistcoat pocket shall i give you a mark at which to begin rhoodie nodded venable held the watch close to his face so he could see the second hand crawling around its tiny separate dial now the rifle leaped to the big strangers shoulder he squeezed the trigger craack a brass cartridge case flipped up into the air it glittered in the sun as it fell craack another cartridge case craack another this was the same sort of quick firing as that which had interrupted lees letter to president davis rhoodie paused once for a moment adjusting the sights he explained he was shooting again as soon as the last word left his mouth finally the rifle clicked harmlessly instead of blasting out another round charles venable looked up thirty aimed shots thirtytwo seconds most impressive he looked from the rifle to rhoodie back again thirty shots he repeated half to himself where is the smoke from thirty shots by god walter taylor sounded astonished both at the lack of smoke and at himself why didnt i notice that before lee had also failed to notice it thirty closely spaced shots should have left this andries rhoodie in the middle of a young fogbank instead only a few hazy wisps of smoke floated from the breech and muzzle of his rifle how do you achieve this sir he asked the charge in my cartridges is not your ordinary black powder rhoodie said which told lee nothing not already obvious the big man went on if your officers will bring in the targets we can see how i did taylor venable and marshall went out to retrieve the paper men they laid them on the ground walked along the row looking for bullet holes lee walked with them quiet and thoughtful when he had examined all the targets he turned back to rhoodie twentyeight out of thirty i make it to be he said this appears to be a fine weapon sir and without a doubt very fine shooting thirtytwo seconds venable said he whistled softly may i show you one thing more rhoodie said without waiting for a reply he loosened the catch that held the magazine in place below the rifle stuck the curved metal container into a coat pocket then he pulled another one out of his haversack and clicked it into position the operation took only a moment to complete another thirty shots lee asked another thirty shots rhoodie agreed he drew back the shiny handle with the snick lee had heard before now i am ready to fire again but what if the americans we are americans sir lee broke in sorry the yankees i mean what if the yankees are too close for aimed fire below the handle was a small metal lever rhoodie clicked it down so that instead of being parallel to the handles track its front end pointed more nearly toward the ground he turned away from lee and his staff officers this is what the rifle roared flame spurted from its muzzle cartridges flew out of it in a glittering stream the silence that followed the shooting came hard and abrupt as a blow into it lee asked major venable did you time that uh no sir venable said im sorry sir never mind it was quite rapid enough rhoodie said except at close range or into big crowds full automatic fire isnt nearly as effective or accurate as single shots the weapon pulls up and to the right full automatic fire lee tasted the words how does this repeater operate if i may ask sir i have seen for example the spencer repeating carbines the enemy cavalrymen employ with a lever action to advance each successive bullet but you worked no lever save to chamber your first round the rifle simply fired again and again when the charge in a round explodes it makes a gas that rapidly expands and pushes the bullet out of the muzzle do you follow me certainly sir if i may remind you i was an engineer lee felt irked at being asked so elementary a question thats right so you were rhoodie spoke as if reminding himself he went on my weapon taps some of the gas and uses it to move the bolt back so the magazine spring can lift another round into the chamber then the cycle repeats itself until the magazine has no more ammunition left in it most ingenious lee plucked at his beard not wanting to go on southern inventors had come up with a great many clever ideas during the war only to have them prove stillborn because of the confederacys feeble manufacturing capacity nevertheless the question had to be asked with how many of these repeaters could you supply me rhoodie smiled broadly how many would you like i would like as many as you can furnish lee said the use to which i might put them however would depend on the number available if you can provide me with say a hundred i might furnish them to horse artillery batteries so they might protect themselves against attacks by the enemy infantry if on the other hand you are fortunate enough to possess five hundred or soand the requisite ammunitioni would consider outfitting a cavalry regiment with them it would be pleasant to have our horsemen able to match the firepower those people are able to bring to bear rather than opposing them with pistols and shotguns andries rhoodies smile grew wider still yet it was not the smile of someone sharing something pleasant with friends lee was reminded instead of the professional grimace of a stage magician about to produce two doves from inside his hat rhoodie said and suppose general lee suppose i am able to get you a hundred thousand of these rifles with their ammunition how would youhow would the confederacyuse them a hundred thousand lee kept his voice low and steady but only with a distinct effort rather than pulling two doves out of his hat the big stranger had turned loose a whole flock sir that is not a pikers offer nor a likely one if you will forgive my saying so charles marshall said that is nearly as many weapons as we have been able to realize from all of europe in three years of war i suppose you will deliver the first shipment by the next northbound train irony flavored every word rhoodie took no notice of it close enough he said coolly my comrades and i have spent some time getting ready for this day general lee you will be sending general hokes brigade down to north carolina over the next couple of nightsam i right yes that is so lee said without much thought then all at once he swung the full weight of his attention to rhoodie but how do you know of it sir i wrote those orders just today and was in the process of informing president davis of them when interrupted by you and your repeater so how can you have learned of my plans for general hokes movements my comrades and i are well informed in any area we choose rhoodie answered he was easy even amused lee abstractly admired that he knew his own presence overawed most men the stranger went on we do not aim to harm you or your army or the confederacy in any way general please believe me when i say that no less than you we aim to see the south free and independent that all sounds very fine but you did not answer the generals question marshall said he ran a hand through his slick dark blond hair as he took a step toward rhoodie how did you learn of general hokes movements i knew thats enough the stranger did not back down if you order the northbound trains engineer to stop at rivington general lee well put aboard the first shipment of rifles and ammunition that would be hmm about twentyfivehundred weapons with several magazines worth of rounds for each we can supply as many again the night after that until your army is fully equipped with new pieces a hundred thousand rifles would oversupply the army of northern virginia lee said the confederacy has more armies than yours dont you think general johnston will be able to use some when general sherman brings the whole military division of the mississippi down against him come spring general grant commands the military division of the mississippi walter taylor said all the federal troops between the alleghenies and the river oh yes thats right so he does for now my mistake rhoodie said he turned back to lee this time with a hunters intent expression on his face and dont you think general that nathan bedford forrests troopers would enjoy being able to outshoot the federals as well as outride and outfight them what i think sir is that you are building mighty castles in the air on the strength of a single rifle lee answered he did not care for the way andries rhoodie looked at him did not care for the arrogant way the man spoke did not care for anything about himexcept for his rifle if one southern man could deliver the fire of five or ten unionists the odds against which confederate armies had to fight in every engagement might all at once be set at naught rhoodie still studied him lee felt his cheeks go hot even on this icy winters day for he knew the stranger could see he was tempted the book of matthew came into his mind again the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and saith unto him all these things will i give thee if thou wilt fall down and worship me but rhoodie did not ask for worship and he was no devil only a big tough man who was not too tough to wear a cap with flaps to keep his ears warm for all that lee had not taken to him he spoke like a reasonable man and now said reasonably general i will stay here and guarantee with my person that what i say is true give the order for the train to stop and pick up the rifles and ammunition if they do not come as i say they will why you can do whatever you please with me where is your risk in that lee searched for one try as he would he could not find it to no one in particular charles venable said the fellow doesnt lack for brass thats certain no he doesnt lee agreed the majors remark helped decide him very well mr rhoodie i will give that order and we shall see what arrives on that northbound train if you make good on your claims the first rifles will go to general stuarts cavalry after that well the divisions of general anderson and henry heth are quartered closest to us here those men can have first call on the rifles among the infantry if he makes good charles marshall said heavily what if he fails what would you recommend major lee asked genuinely curious a good horsewhipping to teach him to brag no more how say you to that mr rhoodie lee inquired ill take the chance the stranger answered despite himself lee was impressedwhether the fellow could do as he said remained to be seen but he thought he could rhoodie went on with your permission general some of my comrades will ride north with the rifles youll need instructors to teach your men to use them properly they may come lee said afterwards he thought that moment was the one when he first truly began to believe andries rhoodie began to believe a trainload of fancy repeaters and ammunition could arrive from north carolina rhoodie was just too sure of himself to doubt walter taylor asked mr rhoodie what do you call this rifle of yours is it a rhoodie too most inventors name their products for themselves do they not no its not a rhoodie the big stranger unslung the title held it in both hands as gently as if it were a baby give it its proper name major its an ak lee returned to his tent to finish the delayed letter to president davis then went back outside to see how his staff officers were dealing with andries rhoodie rhoodie for his part seemed perfectly ready to wait to be proved right either from that commodious haversack of his or from the pack behind his horses saddle he had taken out and erected a neat little oneman tent and was now building a fire in front of it majors taylor venable and marshall stood around watching him each of them kept a hand close to his side arm it occurred to lee though that with such a quickfiring repeater rhoodie might take advantage of a seconds inattention to take out all three men before they could shoot back the notion was unsettling but the extraordinary repeater was inside the tent at the moment and the big stranger showed not the slightest sign of hostility he got his fire going on the first match and proceeded to warm his hands over it lee smiled a little rhoodie did net have the air of a man about to attack everyone around him he ducked into the tent but emerged with nothing more lethal than a pot and a folding metal stand he dipped up some water from a little brook that ran eventually into the rapidan then returned to his fire and put the pot over it to boil lees servant came up supper be ready soon marse robert thank you perry what do we have tonight possum soup all nice and thick with peanuts the black man answered that sounds very fine lee walked over to rhoodie would you care to share supper with me sir perry has not much to work with here but one would never know it by the meals he turns out rhoodies eyes flicked toward perry your slave hes free lee answered rhoodie shrugged lee could see he did not approve the stranger started to say something then evidently thought better of it which was just as well when he did speak it was about supper will you let me add to the meal i know youre on short rations here i wouldnt want to deprive you times are hard everywhere its no trouble i have plenty rhoodie peered into the pot ah good its boiling he set it on the ground excuse me he went back into the tent when he came out he was holding a couple of packages whose sides and bottoms reflected the firelight metallically he peeled a lid off each of them the insides of the lids looked metallic too he set down the packages poured hot water into each of them instantly savory steam rose lee watchedand sniffedwith interest is that desiccated stew you have there the federals use desiccated vegetables but i did not know anyone was preparing whole meals that way desiccated stew it is general the tall strangers voice was oddly constrained as if hed expected lee to be more surprised he passed him one of the packages and a spoon before you eat stir it about a little lee stirred then tasted his eyebrows rose this is excellent were they to taste it the wits in the army wouldnt joke so about desecrated vegetables he ate another couple of spoonfuls very good indeed now i find myself embarrassed at having nothing better than possum soup to offer in exchange dont fret about it general rhoodie said he held out his metal packet as a bowl when perry came by a couple of minutes later with the kettle perry ladled the container full he smiled you have nothing to be embarrassed about your black is a fine cook he does seem to work miracles doesnt he he has to these days i fear lee finished the last of his stew even desiccated it had more and finer ingredients than he was used to he could still feel their rich savor in his mouth he said mr rhoodie youve spoken glibly of all the rifles you can furnish us can you also supply desiccated rations of this sort enough to hold hunger at bay in this army until spring our ah firm is chiefly concerned with weapons as far as rations go i will have to inquire before i tell you how many we can bring in i wish you would lee said a soldier who cannot march and fight is as much a loss to his country as one without a rifle ill do what i can rhoodie said i dont know how much that will be were ready to move with the rifles now for food we would have to begin to make special arrangements and they might take some time you know your own affairs best im sure i merely say that if practicable rations would be of material benefit to us lee got to his feet so did the big stranger he started over to the brook with his pot lee said surely you arent still hungry sir i was going to boil water for coffee would you like some real coffee lee asked rhoodie nodded with a rueful smile lee said i almost think real coffee might be too potent for me after so long drinking chicory and scorched grain masquerading under the name still i will gladly hazard the experiment provided you have enough for my staff as well i would not see them deprived of what i enjoy theyre welcome rhoodie said they need their own mugs though by all means lee called his aides gave them the good news they exclaimed in delight and hurried back to their tents lee went off to fetch his own mug by the time everyone converged mug in hand on rhoodies shelter he had his pot back over the fire with his free hand he passed each confederate officer a small flat packet rhoodie said tear it open and pour it into the bottom of your cup folgers instant coffee lee read on the packet below that in much smaller print was something he could not make out he put on his glasses the words came clear made in usa he returned the glasses to his pocket thinking he should have been able to guess that without reading it as rhoodie had directed he poured the contents of the packet into his cup the stuff did not look like ground coffee is this another of your desiccations he asked you might say so yes general now if youll hold out your cup rhoodie filled it to the brim with hot water all at once it smelled like coffee stir it about to dissolve it all rhoodie said as he filled the aides mugs in turn lee raised the cup to his lips it was not the best coffee hed ever had but coffee it unmistakably was he took a long slow sip closed his eyes with pleasure that is most welcome he said one after another the staff officers echoed him im glad you enjoy it rhoodie said charles venable had been examining his packet too instant coffee he said musingly an apt description though not one ive heard before is this little envelope made of tinfoil mr rhoodie i think so the big stranger answered after a slight hesitation which lee believed he recognized it sounded like the pause of a man who was not telling everything he knew andries rhoodie seemed to know a fair number of things he wasnt telling the things he had already spoken of and shown were quite remarkable enough lee wondered what secrets he still kept walter taylor pointed to rhoodies coffee mug what is that emblem your cup bears sir if i may ask at first seeing the red background and the white i took it for a confederate symbol but now i see it is not rhoodie held the mug close to the fire to give taylor a better view of it lee looked too inside a white circle on the red background was a spiky black emblem that reminded him of a caltrop under the emblem stood three letters awb rhoodie said it is the sign of my organization he was good at appearing to answer while actually saying little lee asked what do the initials signify our motto rhoodie replied with a smile america will break taylor raised his mug in salute ill drink to that by god the other aides followed suit so did lee he had stayed in the federal army as long as he could but when virginia left the union he went with his state it counted for more with him than did the idea of the united states another cup gentlemen rhoodie asked i have more coffee the staff officers said yes in a chorus coffee won them over where even rhoodies repeater had left suspicion in its wake lee declined after so long without a second cup would surely leave me wakeful at my age i find i must be careful of my sleep for i need it more but have more trouble winning it nodding to rhoodie he turned to go his aides saluted he returned the courtesy and walked slowly back to his tent he took off his boots and jacket lay down on the cot and pulled several blankets over himself even with them the night would be cold most of his men had but a single cover many had none the surgeons would see frostbite and catarrh come morning sick call that happened every day the coffee did not keep him from falling asleep it woke him a couple of hours later though he stood up to use the chamber pot the ground chilled his toes through his socks before he went back to bed he glanced out through the tent flap andries rhoodie had kept his fire large and bright he was sitting in front of it in a folding chair of gaudy canvas webbing and wood he did not notice lee being intent on the book in his lap what are you reading sir at this late hour lee called softly rhoodie looked up and peered into the night with his eyes full of firelight he needed a few seconds to catch sight of lee when he did he stuck a thumb in the book to keep his place then shut it and held it up a golden cross gleamed on the black cover ah lee said all at once feeling easier about rhoodie than he had since the moment hed met him you could find no better companion by day or night may i ask which verses you have chosen the story of gideon the big stranger answered i read it often it seems to fit it does indeed lee said it does indeed good night sir i hope you sleep well when you do seek your bedroll thank you general a good night to you too lee went back to bed as hed told rhoodie he often had trouble sleeping not tonight thoughhe dropped off as smoothly and easily as a child just before he stopped thinking altogether he wondered why maybe it was hope something that had been in short supply since gettysburg he slept the next couple of days went by in something close to a state of anticlimax general samuel jones of the department of western virginia sent a letter promising cattle and beef for the army of northern virginia lee wrote effusive thanks but the promised animals were slower arriving than joness letter had been as hed feared he had to reduce the armys rations just after hed finished drafting the general order for the melancholy necessity charles venable poked his head into the tent telegram for you sir he paused for dramatic effect its from rivington read it to me at once major lee said yes sir venable unfolded the flimsy sheet of paper stopped at rivington northbound per your orders of january many crates of two different shapes taken on board townsfolk helpful and well organized after departing opened two crates at random one of each type contents metal cartridges and carbines of curious manufacture a dozen men also boarded asbury finch first lieutenant csa well well lee said and then again well well our mysterious mr rhoodie does indeed have the rifles he promised or some of them at any rate despite his certainty i wondered i truly did i did more than wonder sir venable answered i doubted and doubted strongly but as you say he seems to have kept the first part of his promise so he does when general stuart sees what these carbines can do he will want no others the repeaters which ever more of the federal cavalry employ have hurt his troopers badly now he will be able to reply on equalor better than equalterms and if mr rhoodie was not spinning a tale all out of moonshine there will be rifles for our infantry as well i wonder how much the bureau of ordnance is paying for thesewhat did he call them aks lee supplied whatever the price it may well mark the difference between our liberty and suppression it would be difficult to set that price too high yes sir venable hesitated then went on may i ask sir what you think of mr rhoodie well i certainly think a good deal better of him now that i know for a fact he is not a solitary charlatan with a solitary if marvelous carbine lee said at once then he too paused but that wasnt the whole of what you asked was it major no sir normally a fluent speaker venable seemed to be struggling to put what he thought into words i do believe he is the most peculiar man ive ever met his carbine his gear even the food he eats and the coffee he drinksive not seen nor heard of their like anywhere nor have i and with their uniform excellence and convenience i should hope i would have the better to wage this war lee said there is also more to it than that the man knows more than he lets on how could he have learned of my orders sending general hoke south that still perplexes me and worries me no small amount as well had he been exposed as a fraud i would have had some hard questions to ask him about it and asked them in as hard way as need as is lee shrugged he is manifestly a good southern man how long do you suppose we could have lasted major had he chosen to go north and sell his rifles to the enemy venable made a sour face as if disliking the taste of that idea not long sir i quite agree they outweigh us enough as is but he chose our cause instead so for the time being the hard questions can wait and he is a pious man no one who was not would read his testament late at night where nobody could be expected to see him every word you say is true sir venable said and yeti dont knoweverything rhoodie has seems too good to be true somehow the union has had the advantage in material goods all through the war major are you saying we are not entitled to our share or that if fortune should for once choose to favor us we ought not to take advantage of it put that way no of course not general lee good lee said for i intend to wring every drop of advantage from it that i may a plume of woodsmoke announced a train heading up the orange and alexandria railroad to the little town of orange court house lee pointed to it with the eagerness of a boy who spies his christmas present being fetched in if i have calculated rightly gentlemen that will be the train from rivington shall we ride to meet it and see this first consignment of mr rhoodies rifles his aides hurried off to get their horses andries rhoodie went with them perry brought up traveller lee swung onto the gray the staff officers and rhoodie soon joined them they rode down from the hills to orange court house together lee and his aides were all fine horsemen he soon saw rhoodie was not though he managed well enough old civilian men walking or riding along the streets of orange court house lifted their hats in tribute to lee as he passed he gravely returned their greetings few young male civilians were to be seenin the town or anywhere else in the confederacy there were a fair number of soldiers seeing what the shops had to offer not much probably they saluted lee and his staff officers some pointed at andries rhoodie his size his strange clothes and the fact that he a stranger rode with lee drew their notice to him the train station was not far from the courthouse that gave the hamlet half its name for that matter nothing in orange court house was far from anything else the train had already arrived by the time lee and his companions got to the station under the watchful eye of the crew slaves loaded cut logs into the tender for the next trip south other blacks were starting to unload the freight cars some of the men who supervised them wore the confederate uniform others were dressed like andries rhoodies in caps and mottled jackets and trousers even their ankle boots were the same as his lee rubbed his chin thoughtfully what one man wore was his own business when a dozen mena bakers dozen counting rhoodie himselfwore similar outfits that suggested the clothes were a uniform of sorts indeed rhoodies colleagues looked more uniform than the southern soldiers with them whose pants coats and hats were of several different colors and cut in a variety of ways behind lee walter taylor turned to rhoodie and remarked your friends are all goodsized men sir he was right the smallest of the men m spotted clothes had to be five feet ten most of them were sixfooters two or three were as big as rhoodie they all looked well fed too in spite of the war and the hard winter the confederate soldiers came to attention when lee and his aides rode up the men from rivington did not a few of them greeted rhoodie with a nod or a wave most just kept calling orders to the slaves who were taking crates off the train your fellows here have the same interesting accent as you yourself charles venable observed we are countrymen rhoodie said blandly lee smiled at the majors polite probe and at rhoodies equally polite but uninformative reply rhoodie had given a lot of polite but uninformative replies the last few days lee told himself that a trainloadmaybe a great many trainloadsof repeaters and cartridges gave him the right to hold his tongue lee dismounted his aides and rhoodie followed him to the ground venable hitched traveller to the rail a soldier with two bars on either side of his collar walked up to them his face lee thought was too thin for the whiskers hed chosen which were like those of the federal general burnside he saluted asbury finch sir st georgia yes lieutenant i received your telegram yes sir finch sent a glance to andries rhoodie who had gone over to greet his comrades so youve already met one of these alloverspots fellows have you sir theyve purely done wonders for rivington that they have i commanded in north carolina a couple of years ago lieutenant but i must confess i do not remember the town lee said a couple years ago general lee sir wasnt nothin worth remembering just a town barely big enough for the train to bother stoppin at it but its growin to beat the band now thanks to these folks a big bunch of em done settled there bought a raft o niggers and run up new houses and warehouses and i dont know what all and all in the last three four months too i heard that from one of the folks whos lived there all his life while we were takin on these crates they pay gold for everything too he says no wonder theyre welcome then lee said confederate paper money had weakened to the point where a pair of shoes cost a private soldier three or four months wages that was one reason so many men in the army of northern virginia went barefoot even in winter another was that there were not enough shoes to be had at any price pity they couldnt have come a year ago walter taylor said think what we might have done with those rifles at chancellorsville or up in pennsylvania i have had that thought myself a fair number of times the last few days major lee said whats past is past though and cannot be changed the guns theyre as fine as all that sir finch asked they are indeed lieutenant taylor said with them i feel we truly may hold in our hands the goose that lays the golden eggs or it holds us charles marshall said his voice sour lee looked at him sharply marshall had not taken to andries rhoodie not at all but after a moments thought lee decided he had a point trainloads of repeating carbines might save the confederacy but if rhoodie and his friends were the only source for them they held a hand to the throat of the south they were not squeezing nowfar from it if however they chose to major marshall lee said sir please draft a letter to colonel gorgas in richmond i would like his opinion on the practicability of our manufacturing copies of these weapons as we do now with the springfield and mississippi rifles when the first shipment of rifles reaches our headquarters you might also send one and a stock of cartridges to colonel gw rains in georgia who is i think the man most expert in the bureau of ordnance on matters pertaining to powder perhaps he can enlighten us on how these rounds produce so little smoke i will attend to it sir marshall said his spectacles wire frames could not hide a raised eyebrow your trust in mr rhoodie is not perfect then the only perfect trust is in god lee answered marshall smiled and nodded a relative of the great chief justice he had been a lawyer till the war began which gave him another reason besides religion to place perfect trust in no human institution just then rhoodie came back to lee his staff officers and lieutenant finch several of his friends were right behind him he said general let me introduce some of my comrades here are konrad de buys wilhelm gebhard benny lang and ernie graaf gentlemen lee said extending his hand they came up one by one to shake it an honor to meet the great general lee ernie graff said he was about lees height and wore a neat sandy chinbeard which only partially hid a scar that ran up to the angle of his jaw as major venable had noted he and the rest of the men in mottled clothes spoke with the same notquitebritish accent as rhoodie and the same harsh undertoneif anything that was stronger in his voice than in rhoodies you neednt say my name as if youd found it in some history book sir lee protested mildly all of rhoodies comrades smiled or laughed at that rather more than the small joke deserved even so lee was pleased to put them at their ease general stuart is the man i want to meet said the one who had been introduced as konrad de buys most of the strangers had a businesslike look to them but de buyss tawny eyes held a gleam that reminded lee of a cougar this man fought for the joy of it then lee remembered how rhoodie rode de buys would have to do better than that to satisfy jeb stuart you are a horseman sir lee asked de buys nodded in a way that left no doubt lee said then i am certain general stuart will be pleased to make your acquaintance as well colonel mosby also perhaps with his partisan command by the way de buys grinned lee knew he had judged his man aright general stuart is byfredericksburg wilhelm gebhard asked he turned the soft g of general hard as a german might have behind lee one of his aides whispered dutchmen to another lee guessed it was marshall he seemed most dubious of rhoodie and the bulk of germans in americaincluding a good many who lived in the confederacywere unionists but these men were far too openand far too strangeto be spies and in any case general meade knew where the army of northern virginias cavalry was passing the winter yes around fredericksburg lee answered he would sooner have had stuarts troopers closer to hand but getting horses through the winter was harder and required more land than men did gebhard turned to rhoodie asked him something in a language that sounded close to english but was not rhoodie replied in the same tongue dutchmen they are lee thought in english rhoodie said he wants to know whether he and de buys should arrange to go to fredericksburg to show off our guns or whether you will call general stuart here lee thought about that at last he said with the cavalry spread out on the countryside as it is the more efficient course would appear to be convening general stuart and his divisional and brigade commanders here at orange court house so they can judge your repeaters for themselves fine rhoodie said when we shoot though better we go back up to your headquarters to keep word of what these guns can do from reaching the enemy a sensible plan lee agreed talking to himself as much as to lee rhoodie went on since this will be the center from which we give out guns to your army we ought to rent quarters here and warehouse space too we have a lot of work to do before spring getting your men ready the officers of the army of northern virginia should prove of some assistance to you lee said drily irony bounced from andries rhoodie like solid shot off an ironclads armored hull he looked lee full in the face and said some will help us general i dont doubt it but if i were on the other side of the rapidan and dealing with the federals say with general burnside or general sigel they might not even have given me a hearing they have their springfields after all and once a routineer settles in with something its hard to boot him loose from it you will be treating with better men in this army than the two you named lee said i should certainly hope so at any rate you vouch for every brigadier every colonel rhoodie persisted my comrades and i havent enough manpower to do more than show the basics of how to shoot and clean the ak regiment by regiment getting your soldiers to use it afterwards will be up to those commanders some of them will mistrust anything new and different i see what you are saying sir lee admitted there was some truth to it too the confederate states themselves had banded together in the hope of preserving their old way of life against the growing numbers and growing factories of the north but hereyou get my men these repeaters mr rhoodie and i shall undertake to see they are used thats what i wanted to hear general lee you have heard it singing as they worked slaves carried long crates with rifles in them and square crates of ammunition out of the freight cars and stacked them beside the railroad tracks the stacks grew higher and higher and higher ii what else alsie first sergeant nate caudell asked patiently private alsie hopkins furrowed his brow as well as a man in his early twenties could tell em i feel good he said at last tell em the arm where i got shot at gettysburg dont hurt no more and the diarrhea aint troublin me neither caudells pen scratched across the page actually it wasnt a proper page but the back of a piece of old wallpaper he wrote around a chunk of paste that still clung to it he was sure he wrote more letters than anyone else in company dmaybe more than anyone else in the whole th north carolina that went with being a schoolteacher in a unit full of farmers many of whomlike alsie hopkinscould neither read nor write for themselves what else alsie he asked again hopkins thought some more tell em we had us a riproarin snowball fight the other day and one feller he got two teeth knocked out of his head when he got hit with a snowball with a rock in the middle of it we all laughed and laughed except the man who got hit caudell said drily no him too caudell thought that likely to amuse hopkinss family so he started to write it down just then though a bugle call came through the open shutters of his cabins single window he put down his pen have to finish this another time alsie thats assembly for officers sergeants and corporals everybody but us privates hopkins said happy at the prospect of his superiors working when he didnt have to can i leave this paper here first sergeant and we get it done maybe some time later on i suppose so caudell said resignedly his battered felt slouch hat lay beside him on the bed he put it on got to his feet ive got to go now though he and hopkins ducked out through the cabins low door with nothing better to do the private ambled away caudell hurried up the lane that ran through the cabins and leantos and tents of the regiments winter quarters his cabin which he shared with the other four sergeants of company d lay farthest from the open space at the center of the encampment closest to that open space was captain lewiss tent being captain he had it all to himself the company banner stood beside it the words castalia invincibles picked out in red silk on a blue ground pierced by more than one bullet hole men with chevrons or collar badges converged on the parade ground they did not begin to fill it up they were perhaps one part in seven of the sixhundredodd soldiers who regularly drilled there along with all the officers and noncommissioned officers was one private ben whitley of company a as usual the teamster perched on his wagon with him sat another man a stranger whose cap coat and trousers looked to be made of nothing but patches some the color of dirt some of grass some of mud slung on the strangers back was a carbine of unfamiliar make excitement ran through caudell the cavalry had got itself new rifles the past couple of weeks so had major general andersons infantry division whose winter quarters were even closer to orange court house than those of henry heths division of which the th north carolina was a part if halfif a titheof the stories about those rifles were true colonel george faribault limped around from the far side of the wagon he moved slowly and with the aid of a stick hed been wounded in the foot and in the shoulder at gettysburg and was just back to the regiment by his pallor even standing was not easy for him he said gentlemen it is as you may have guessed our brigade and our division are next to receive the new repeater the ak they call it herehe pointed to the stranger in the suit of many muddy colorsis mr benny lang who will show you how to operate the rifle so you can go on and teach your men mr lang lang jumped lightly down from the wagon he was about fiveten dark and on the skinny side his clothes bore no rank badges of any sort but he carried himself like a soldier i usually get two questions at a time like this he said the first one is why dont you teach everyone yourself sorry but we havent the manpower today my friends and i are working with general kirklands brigade thats you people the th north carolina the th north carolina the th north carolina and the d north carolina tomorrow well be with general cookes brigade and so on youll manage you have to be more than stupid to screw up an ak you have to be an idiot and even then its not easy listening to him caudell found himself frowning camp rumor said these fellows in the funny clothes were not merely from north carolina but from his own home county nash lang didnt sound like a carolina man though or like any kind of southerner he didnt sound like a yankee either in the past two years caudell had heard plenty of yankee accents the first sergeant kept listening the other question i hear is why bother trying anything new when were happy with our regular rifles id sooner show you why than tell you whos your best chap with springfield or enfield or whatever you use all eyes swung to the regimental ordnance sergeant he was a polite softspoken man he looked around to see if anyone else would volunteer when no one did he took a step forward out of line reckon i am sir george hines very good lang said would you be so kind as to fetch your weapon and ammunition for it and while hes doing that private whitley why dont you move the wagon so we dont frighten the horses sure will whitley drove the team perhaps fifty feet then jumped down and walked back over to watch what was going on ordnance sergeant hines returned a minute or so later rifle musket on his shoulder he carried the piece like a part of him as befit any man who wore a star in the angle of his sergeants stripes benny lang pointed to a tall bank of earth that faced away from the soldiers huts is that what you use for target practice yes sir it is hines answered lang trotted over pinned a circular paper target to the bank he trotted back to the group then said ordnance sergeant hines why dont you put a couple of bullets in that circle for us fast as you can load and fire ill do that hines said while the men who stood between him and the target moved hastily out of the way watching the ordnance sergeant handle his rifle nate caudell thought was like being back on the target range at camp mangum outside of raleigh hearing the command load in nine times load hines did everything perfectly smoothly just as the manual said he should to load he held the rifle upright between his feet with the muzzle in his left hand and with his right already going to the cartridge box he wore at his belt caudell imagined the invisible drillmaster barking handle cartridge hines brought the paper cartridge from the box to his mouth bit off the end poured the powder down the muzzle of his piece and put the minié ball in the muzzle the bluntly pointed bullet was about the size of the last joint of a mans finger with three grooves around its hollow base which expanded to fill the grooves on the inside of the rifle barrel at the remembered command of draw rammer the long piece of iron emerged from its place under the rifle barrel next in the series was ram which the ordnance sergeant did with a couple of sharp strokes before returning the ramrod to its tube at prime he halfcocked the hammer with his right thumb then took out a copper percussion cap and put it on the nipple the next four steps went in quick sequence shoulder brought the weapon up at ready it went down again for a moment while hines took the proper stance then up it came once more with his thumb fully cocking the hammer aim had him peering down the sights his forefinger set on the trigger fire and the rifle roared and bucked against his shoulder he set the butt end of the piece on the ground repeated the process without a single changed motion he fired again another cloud of fireworkssmelling smoke spurted from his rifle the two shots were less than half a minute apart he scrubbed at the black powder stain on his chin with his sleeve then turned with quiet pride to face lang anything else sir no ordnance sergeant youre as good with a rifle musket as any man ive seen however lang brought up his own rifle blazed away at the white paper target the sharp staccato bark repeated again and again and again was like nothing caudell had ever heard silence fell again in less time than hines had needed to fire twice lang said that was thirty rounds if i had this weapon and the ordnance sergeant that one whose chances would you gentlemen like better goddam somebody behind caudell said softly stretching the word out into three syllables it seemed as good an answer as any and better than most benny lang drove the point home anyhow if you had this weapon and the federals that one whose chances would you gentlemen like for a long moment no one replied no one needed to privates came dashing onto the parade ground drawn as if by magnets to learn what sort of rifle had fired like that then somebody cut loose with a rebel yell in an instant the shrill hairraising cry rose from every throat caudell yelled with the rest like most of them he had come back from picketts charge far too many of their onetime comrades hadnt not in the face of the barrage the federals poured down on them he was all in favor of having the firepower on his side for a change colonel faribault waved the private soldiers off the drill field your turn will come he promised the men withdrew but reluctantly while that was going on benny lang walked over to the wagon lowered the tailgate and began taking out repeaters like the one he had reslung nate caudells palms itched to get hold of one lang said i have two dozen rifles here why dont you men form by companies two groups to a company and private whitley and i will pass them out so i can show you what you need to know a few minutes of milling about followed as men joined with others from their units caudell and his messmatessergeants powell high daniel and eurenaturally gravitated together that left the invincibles two corporals who were present for duty grouped with captain lewis and his pair of lieutenants its all right lewis said were all new recruits at this business here you go first sergeant ben whitley handed caudell a repeater he held it in both hands marveling at how light it was compared to the springfield that hung from pegs on the wall back in his cabin he slung it as lang had done it seemed to weigh next to nothing on his shoulder toting this kind of rifle a man might march forever before he got sore let me have a turn with it nate edwin powell said with a twinge of regret caudell passed him the carbine he brought it up to firing position looked down the barrel fancy kind of sight he remarked his grin turned rueful maybe i can nail me a yankee or two without get tin hit my own self goin up to the firin line without your shoot me signd probably be a good idea too edwin dempsey eure said the sergeants all laughed so far as anybody knew powell was the only man in the regiment whod been wounded at three different fights ben whitley came by again a few minutes later this time he gave caudell a curved blackpainted metal object caudell had no idea what it was until he turned it and saw that it held brass cartridges talk about your fancy now edwin he said handing it on to powell this looks to beat millie balls all hollow sure does if theres enough of these here bullets so as we dont run out halfway through a battle powell answeredanybody whod been shot three times developed a certain concern about such things does every group have an ak and a banana clip lang asked he waited to see if anyone would say no when no one did he continued turn your weapon upside down in front of your trigger guard youll see a catch it holds the clip in place he pointed to it on his own carbine everyone finger that catch pass your weapon back and forth everyone needs to put hands on it not just watch me when the ak came back to him caudell obediently fingered the catch lang had the air of a man whod taught this lesson many times and knew it backwards and forwards as a teacher himself caudell recognized the signs the man in the patchworklooking clothes went on now everyone take turns clicking the clip into place and freeing it the curved end goes toward the muzzle go ahead try it a few times caudell inserted the clip released the catch took it away lang said this is one place where you want to be careful warn your other ranks about it too if the lips of the magazine are bent or if you get dirt in there it wont feed rounds properly in combat that could prove embarrassing he let out a dry chuckle the laughs that rose in answer were grim a rifle that wouldnt shoot hundreds of rounds a minute was less use than one that would shoot two or three in the group next to caudell his captain stuck up his hand mr lang yes captain ah im george lewis sir what do we do if the lips of thisbanana clip you called itsomehow do get bent ive been shot once sirhe was only recently back to the regiment himselfand i dont care a damn to be ah embarrassed again dont blame you a bit captain the obvious answer is switch to a fresh clip if you havent but one good one left you can load cartridges into it one at a time in two staggered rows like this as i said when i fired the clip holds thirty rounds he pulled a clip and some loose cartridges from his haversack and demonstrated well come back to that later youll all have a chance to do it now though let whoevers holding the gun put that magazine in place caudell was holding the ak he carefully worked the banana clip into position listened for the click that showed it was where it belonged good lang said now youre ready to chamber your first round here pull this handle all the way back again he demonstrated caudell followed suit the action worked with a resistant smoothness that was unlike anything he had ever felt before very good once more lang said all of you with rifles come forward and form a firing line take aim at your target and fire caudell pulled the trigger nothing happened no one elses carbine went off either the instructor chuckled no theyre not defective look at the short black lever under the handle you just pulled see how its parallel to the muzzle that little lever is called the change lever when its in the top position its on safety and the weapon cant fire thats how youll carry it on march to avoid accidents now move it down two positionsmake sure its two mindthen aim and fire again caudell peered down the sights they seemed close together he was used to a longer weapon he squeezed the trigger the rifle barked and spat out a cartridge case compared to what he was used to the kick was light lordy someone halfway down the line exclaimed i could fire this piece right off my nose the kick wasnt that light but it wasnt far away either fire another round lang said you dont have to do anything but pull the trigger again caudell pulled the repeater fired intellectually he had expected it would intellectually expecting something though was different from having it happen the chorus of whistles and lowvoiced exclamations of wonder that went up from the firing line showed he was not alone thirty rounds to this thing somebody said hell just load it on sunday and shoot it all week long lang said each time you fire the spring in the magazine pushes up another round so you have one in the chamber again take off the magazine why dont you then fire that last round to empty the weapon and pass it to someone in your group so he can have his three practice rounds caudell moved the lever up thumbed the catch that held the magazine where it belonged when it separated from the carbine he did not know what to do with it for a moment finally he thrust it inside the front of his trousers he aimed the weapon felt the light jolt of its kick when he fired my turn now allison high said tapping him on the shoulder high was half a dozen years younger than caudell two inches taller and several inches wider through the chest not only that it was his turn even so caudell said i dont want to give it to you allison i want to keep it to myself it aint your wife nate its only a gun high said reasonably sides from what this lang fellers been sayin well each get one all our own fore long a little embarrassed caudell surrendered the rifle and the banana clip high clicked the magazine back into place the sound reminded caudell of a faithless lovers laugh as she slipped into the arms of someone new he laughed too at himself benny lang took the new firing line through the drill of working the change lever chambering a round and firing the rifle the instructor had the knack of repeating his lessons without sounding bored caudell listened just as hard without the carbine in his hand as he had when he held it soon enough hed be teaching privates he wanted to make sure he could stay ahead of them lang kept at it until everyone had had a turn shooting an ak then he said this weapon can do one other thing i havent shown you yet when you move the change lever all the way down instead of to the middle position this is what happens he stuck a fresh clip in the repeater turned toward the target circle and blasted away he went through the whole magazine almost before caudell could draw in a startled breath good god almighty rufus daniel said peering in awe at the brass cartridge cases scattered around langs feet why didnt he show us that in the first place he was not the only one to raise the question quite a few shouted it caudell kept quiet by now he was willing to assume lang knew what he was doing the weapons instructor stayed perfectly possessed he said i didnt show you that earlier because it wastes ammunition and because the weapon isnt accurate past a few metersyardson full automatic you can only carry so many rounds if you shoot them all off in the first five minutes of a battle what will you do once theyre gone think hard on that gentlemen and drill it into your private soldiers this weapon requires fire disciplinerequires it i say again he paused to let the point sink in then he grinned it made him look like a boy when he was serious his thin sallow features showed all his years which had to be as many as caudells own thirtyfour he said now weve done the exciting things with the weapon time to get on to the boring details that will keep it working and you alivecleaning and such a groan rose from his audience the sort of groan caudell was used to hearing when he started talking about subtracting fractions benny lang grinned again he went on i warned you it wasnt glamorous well get on with it just the same watch me please he held up his repeater so everyone could see it look here at the top of the weapon all the way back toward you from the sight there at the end of the metal part is a little knob its called the recoil spring guide do you see it edwin powell had the rifle in caudells group caudell looked it over with his fellow sergeants sure enough the knob was there lang waited until he saw everyone had found it now he said every chap with a weapon push in on that knob powell pushed a little hesitantly caudell didnt blame him for being cautious after all the marvels the ak had displayed he would not have been surprised to find that pushing that knob made it sing a chorus of the bonnie blue flag nothing so melodramatic happened lang was also pushing the knob on his repeater as he did so he went on lift up the receiver cover and take it off the receiver more clumsily his students imitated him caudell peered curiously into the works of the weapon thus revealed never saw a rifle with so many guts dempsey eure observed i never saw a rifle with guts at all caudell said to which the other sergeants nodded a rifle was a barrel and a lock and a stock plus such oddments as sight and ramrod and bayonet it had no room for guts but this one did caudell wondered what the unschooled farmers who made up the bulk of the castalia invincibles would think of that dont panic lang said caudell remembered that the instructor had seen other soldiers reactions to the complicated interior of an ak lang continued to take the carbine apart lecturing all the while weve already taken off the receiver cover right next thing to do is push the recoil spring guide in as far as it will go and then lift it up and take it out along with the spring itself then slide the bolt carrier the bolt and the piston back and lift them out he held up each piece as he named it so his inexperienced pupils could see what he was talking about now watch how i turn the boltthe lugs here have to line up with the grooves on the carrier then the bolt slides back until it comes off the carrier you only really have to worry about the spring the bolt carrier and the bolt you need to clean them every day the weapon is fired lang pulled a rod out from under the barrel of the ak the carbines stock had a hinged compartment he took from it a little bottle of gun oil brushes and cloth patches with meticulous care he ran a patch down the inside of the barrel then wiped the black spring and silvery bolt and carrier clean when he was done he resumed his discussion reassembly procedure is the exact reverse of what weve just done the bolt goes on the carrierhe deftly matched action to wordsand they both go into the receiver then the recoil spring and its guide fit in back of the bolt carrier push em forward till the rear of the guide clears the back of the receiver then push down to engage the guide then you put the receiver plate in place push in on the spring guide and push the plate down to lock it he grinned at the north carolinians now you try it dont bother cleaning your weapon this first time just get it apart and back together that dont look too hard edwin powell said caudell wasnt so sure he didnt trust the look on benny langs face the last time hed seen a look like that billy beddingfield of company f had been wearing it in a poker game billy had also had an extra ace stuck up his sleeve the spring gleaming with gun oil went back where it belonged with no particular argument the bolt was something else again powell tried to fit it into place as lang had it did not want to fit shitfire powell said softly after several futile tries far as im concerned the damn thing can stay dirty he was far from the only man having trouble lang went from group to group explaining the trick there obviously was a trick for people looked happier once hed worked with them after a while he came to caudells group where powell was still wrestling with the bolt it goes on the carrier likethis he said his hands underscored his words do you see yes sir i think so powell answered as humbly as if speaking to one of the camp mangum drill sergeants who had turned the th north carolina from a collection of raw companies into a regiment that marched and maneuvered like a single living creature lang carried the same air of omniscience even if he didnt display it so loudly or profanely he said show me powell still fumbled but at last he got the bolt into place lang slapped him on the back good do it again powell did a little faster this time lang said when you get your own weapon tomorrow youll practice till you can do it with your eyes closed first try every try powell grunted been usin guns my whole life never reckoned id have to put puzzle pieces together to make one work oddly that complaint cheered nate caudell when he was a boy his father had carved puzzles for him to play with thinking of the aks works as a toy rather than something strange mysterious and threatening let him attack them without feeling intimidated when his turn came he got the bolt back into place after only a couple of false starts do it again that fast nate and ill believe you really can allison high said caudell did it again and then just to show it was no fluke one more time high whistled a long low note of respect might could even be a reason youre wearin that first sergeants diamond to go with them stripes of yours first time weve seen one if there is dempsey eure said a grin eased the sting from the words eure had trouble taking anything or anyone seriously to hell with both of you caudell said he and his messmates all laughed wonder what sid bartholomew would say if he was here to get a look at this repeater edwin powell remarked everyone nodded nominally a member of company d bartholomew was a gunsmith by trade and had spent the whole war on detail in raleigh doing what he did best reckon hed say good godalmighty like the rest of us rufus daniel said and everyone nodded again the ak brought on remarks like that by the time everyone was able to clean and reassemble the repeater morning had given way to afternoon as hed promised lang showed how to load cartridges into the rifles magazine after the mysteries of the bolt that was childs play he also showed how to open the catch at the bottom of the clip and clean the spring inside thats a onceamonth job though not once a day he said but do remember to see to it every so often he paused looked around at his audience youve been very patient chaps the lot of you thank you for your attention ive said everything i need say have you any questions of me yeah i got one somebody said immediately heads turned toward him as he took a swaggering step out of his group you got your fancypants rifle there mr benny lang kill anything that twitches twenty miles away what i want to know is how good a man are you without it he gazed toward lang with insolent challenge in his eyes beddingfield captain lankford of company f and colonel faribault barked the name in the same breath caudell said it too softly howd billy beddingfield ever make corporal rufus daniel whispered he could teach mean to a snapping turtle you dont want to get on his wrong side though caudell whispered back if i were a private in his squad id be more afraid of him than of any yankee ever born you got that right nate daniel said chuckling back in ranks beddingfield captain lankford snapped i dont mind captain benny lang said let him come ahead if he cares to this might beinstructive too come on corporal if youve the stomach for it he set down his repeater and stood waiting is he out of his mind edwin powell said billyll tear him in half looking at the two men caudell found it hard to disagree lang was taller but on the skinny side built like a bull beddingfield had to outweigh him by twenty pounds and as rufus daniel had said beddingfield had a mean streak as wide as he was he was a terror in battle but a different sort of terror in camp he grinned a school bullys nasty grin as he stepped forward to square off with lang that mans face is made for a slap caudell said to allison high reckon youre right nate but i got ten dollars confed says lang aint the one to slap it for him high answered ten dollars confederate was most of a months pay for a private caudell liked to gamble now and then but he didnt believe in throwing away money no thanks allison i wont touch that one high laughed edwin powell said ill match you allison that there lang he looks to have a way of knowin what hes doin he wouldntve called billy out if he didnt expect he could lick him one of caudells sandy eyebrows quirked up toward his hairline he hadnt thought of it in those terms can i change my mind he asked high sure thing nate i got another ten that aint doin nothin i he shut up big knobby fists churning beddingfield rushed at benny lang lang brought up his own hands but not to hit back he grabbed billy beddingfields right wrist turned ducked threw beddingfield flew over his shoulder landed hard on the frozen ground he bounced to his feet he wasnt grinning anymore bastard he snarled and waded back in a moment later he went flying again this time he landed on his face his nose dripped blood onto his tunic as he got up lang wasnt breathing hard you fight dirty beddingfield said wiping his face with his sleeve now lang smiled coldly i fight to win corporal if you cant stand it go home to your momma with a bellow of rage beddingfield charged caudell watched closely but still didnt see just what happened all he knew was that instead of flying beddingfield went down hard he moaned and tried to rise benny lang stood over him kicked him in the ribs with judiciously calculated force he stayed down still unruffled lang said has anyone else any questions no one did he smiled that cold smile again colonel faribault captain i think youll find i didnt damage this fellow permanently i wouldnt have blamed you if you had sir he picked the fight captain lankford said he plucked at his chin beard maybe some hours bucked and gagged will teach him to save his spirit for the yankees maybe lang shrugged it wasnt his problem good day to you gentlemen private whitley do you mind giving me a lift back to orange court house no sir not a bit sir mr lang whitley hadnt sounded nearly so respectful before lang knocked the stuffing out of billy beddingfield good lang ambled toward the wagon i could walk it easily enough i supposeits only a mile and a halfbut why walk when you can ride i dont know who that lang feller is or where he comes from edwin powell declared but he thinks like the infantry the other sergeants from company d solemnly nodded caudell said talk has it he and his people are from rivington right in our home county you cut out that our and speak for your own self nate allison high said unlike his messmates he was from wilson county just south of nash rufus daniel said i dont give a damn how talk has it and thats a fact heres two more factslang dont talk like hes from nash countyhe exaggerated his drawl till everyone around him smiledand he dont fight like hes from nash county neither i wish hed learn me that fancy rasslin of his along with this here repeater old billy beddingfield he never knew what hit him look hes still lyin there cold as a torch throwed in a snowbank the wagon started out of camp harness jingling wheels squeaking and horses hooves ringing against the ground it swung off the camp lane onto the road north billy beddingfield still did not move caudell wondered if lang had hurt him worse than he thought so evidently did colonel faribault he limped over to the fallen corporal stirred him with his stick bedtlingfield wiggled and moaned nodding as if satisfied faribault stepped back flip water in his face somebody till he revives then captain lankford along with whatever punishment details you give him have the stripes off his sleeves a raw brawler like that doesnt deserve to wear them yes sir lankford said thats fair caudell said after a couple of seconds thought no one in his group disagreed with him a corporal from company f ran off the parade ground returned a minute later with his canteen whose contents he poured over beddingfields head the fallen bully spluttered and swore and slowly sat up colonel faribault said each of todays groups will hold its rifle and practice as much as possible until the full regiments rifles arrive which i am told will be tomorrow his phrasing drew ironic chucklesthe time of promised shipments had a way of stretching like india rubber he went on try not to actually shoot except at our target here for safetys sakeespecially not when the rifle is onwhat did lang call it full automatic sir someone supplied thats it faribaults mouth set in a grim line that his little mustache only accented a fool with an enfield can hurt one man with an accidental shot a fool with one of these new guns can mow down half a company if he starts with a full banana clip bear it in mind gentlemen you are dismissed dempsey eure carried the ak as the sergeants started back to their cabin he slung it over his shoulder then said id sooner tote this than my old rifle any day dont hardly weigh nothin do it rufus daniel echoed stubby little thing though allison high said critically wouldnt want to get into a bayonet fight or have to swing it like it was a club daniel spat i leave the bayonet off my own rifle now when im goin into a fight allison so do most of the boys an you know it too you dont hardly ever get close enough to a yankee to use the blamed thing with these here new guns they aint goin to get that close to us neither as was his habit high kept looking at the darker side of things if they dont break down from use and if benny lang and however many friends hes got can keep us in cartridges i aint never seen the likes of these before not even from the yankees thats so daniel allowed well well use em hard these next couple of months till we break camp thatll tell us what we need to know and if they aint to be trusted well george hines can put minié balls in the ammunition wagons too we still got our old rifles be just like the first days of the war again when the springfields and enfields was the new guns and a lot o the boys just had smoothbore muskets an we needed tcarry bullets for both i dont miss my old smoothbore and thats a fact though i did a heap o missin with it when i carried it you got that right dempsey eure said danl boone couldnt hit the side of a barn with a goddam smoothbore an anybody who says different is a goddam liar goddam right rufus daniel said before the war caudell would have boxed the ears of any boy who dared swear in his hearing now half the time he didnt even notice the profanity that filled the air around him these days he swore too when he felt like it not so much to fit in as because sometimes nothing felt better than a ripe round oath he said cant be sure of course but i have a notion well get all the cartridges we need that benny lang he knows what hes doing look at the way he handled billy like edwin said he knew he could take him and he did if he says well have repeaters here tomorrow im inclined to believe him i expect he and his people can manage cartridges too double or nothin on our bet that them guns dont come tomorrow high said youre on caudell replied at once i want my ten now edwin powell said high turned around as if to punch him then looked back to the parade ground he pointed see nate theres one man who doesnt know if youre right about them cartridges caudell turned too george hines was on his hands and knees picking up spent cartridge cases hes a good ordnance sergeant caudell said he doesnt want to lose anything he doesnt have to remember after the first day at gettysburg when they told off a couple of regiments to glean the battlefield for rifles and ammunition both i remember that powell said his long face grew longer i wish they could have gleaned for men too hed taken his second wound at gettysburg the sergeants ducked back into their cabin one by one rufus daniel started building up the fire which had died to almost cold embers while the five men took their long turn on the parade ground caudell sat down in a chair that had begun life as a molasses barrel pass me that repeater dempsey he said i need to work with it more to get the proper hang of it we all do eure said as he handed over the carbine caudell practiced attaching and removing the magazine several times then pushed in on the recoil spring guide and fieldstripped the rifle to his relief he got the pieces back in the right way without too much trouble he did it again and again hed told his students that reciting over and over made each subsequent recitation easier and better he was glad to find the same true here his hands began to know what to do of themselves without having to wait for the thinking part of his mind to tell them give me a go with it now nate powell said youre slick as butter and i was all fumblefingered out there on the field not too far away a man started banging on a pot with a spoon mess call allison high said edwin its your turn to fetch the grub youll have to fiddle with that repeater later on who gets the water tonight i do rufus daniel said he picked up his canteen a wooden one shaped like a little barrel give me yours too nate caudell reached onto his bunk tossed his canteen to daniel it was metal covered with cloth taken from a federal soldier who would never need water again the two sergeants went back out into the cold dempsey eure said dont hog the rifle just on account of edwins gone nate if wagonloads of em really do show up tomorrow wed all best know what were doin or well look like godalmighty fools in front of the men wouldnt be the first time he added fear of embarrassment caudell thought as eure ran his hand over the chambering handle was a big part of the glue that held the army together send a man alone against a firing line with no one to watch him and he might well run away why not when going forward made getting shot all too likely but send a regiment against that same line and almost everyone would advance on it how could a man who fled face his mates afterwards rufus daniel came back a few minutes later he set the canteens down not far from the fireplace reckon edwinll be a bityou dont have to stand in line by the creek the way you do for rations he said while were waitin how about i try that there repeater everyone was eager to work with the new rifle as much as he could what do you have edwin dempsey eure demanded when powell returned caudells stomach growled like a starving bear hed known some lean times before the warwhat man hadnt save maybe a planter like faribault but hed never known what real hunger was till he joined the army powell said got me some cornmeal and a bit o beef likely be tough as mule leather but i wont complain till after i get me outside of it we still have any o that bacon your sister sent you dempsey little bit eure answered you thinkin o makin up some good ol confederate cush i will unless you got a better notion powell said aint none of us what youd call fancy cooks why dont you get out that bacon and toss me our fryin pan here nate you cut the beef small he handed caudell the meat the hairy skin still on it the pan had once been half a federal canteen its handle was a nailedon stick powell tossed in the small chunk of bacon and held the pan over the tire when he had cooked the grease out so it bubbled and spattered in the bottom of the pan caudell added the cubed beef after a minute or two he poured in some water meanwhile allison high used more water to make the cornmeal into a tin of mush he passed the mush to caudell who upended the tin over the frying pan powell stirred the mixture together then kept the pan on the tire until the mush soaked up all the water and a brown crust began to form along the sides he took the pan off the fire set it down with his knife he sliced the cush into five moreorlessequal pieces there you go boys dig in i hate this goddam slosh rufus daniel said when i get home from this damn war i aint goin to eat nothin but fried chicken and sweetpotato pie and ham and biscuits and gravy just as thick as you please aii that goddam pans still hot he stuck a burned knuckle into his mouth while hed been complaining hed also been using belt knife and fingers to get his portion of supper out of the frying pan caudell tossed his slab of cush from hand to hand till it was cool enough to bite he wolfed it down and licked his fingers when he was through it wasnt what he would have eaten by choiceit was as far as the moon from the feast rufus daniel had been imaginingbut cornmeal had a way of sticking to the ribs that made a man forget he was hungry for a while dempsey eure lit a twig at the fire got his pipe going daniel did the same caudell lit up a cigar tilted his head back and blew a smoke ring at the ceiling the cabin filled with fragrant smoke glad were not short of tobacco anyhow he said not in this regiment eure said the th drew its men from the heart of north carolinas tobacco country half a dozen soldiers had been tobacconists before the war almost makes me wish i was on picket duty up by the rapidan powell said shifting a chaw from one cheek to the other might could be id find mea friendly yank on the other side trade him some tobacco for coffee and sugar and maybe some o them little hard candies they have sometimes his messmates sighed that kind of trading went on all the time confederates and federals winked at it why not caudell thoughtit isnt going to change who wins the war only make both sides more comfortable at the moment with some food in his belly a cigar in his hand and a warm cabin around him he was comfortable enough he took another drag picket dutys cold he said reflectively thats true a couple of the other sergeants said dempsey eure added to hell with your coffee and sugar edwin i aint gonna freeze to get it they talked awhile longer and smoked and passed around the new repeater one by one they went to bed the last thing caudell saw before he fell asleep was edwin powell sitting close by the fire assembling the ak and taking it apart again reveille the next morning hit caudell like an artillery barrage he threw off his threadbare blanket scrambled out of bed and put on his shoes tunic and slouch hat everyone else was getting dressed at the same time the hut wasnt really big enough for five men to dress in all at once but they managed by now theyd been doing it for three months dempsey eures black felt hat was even more disreputable than caudells but he kept a gaudy turkey feather in the band you walk out wearin that bird somebodyll shoot it off you rufus daniel said he cracked the same joke about once a week caudell went outside as always he had mixed feelings about that first breath of early morning air it was sweet and fresh and free of most of the smoke that built up inside the cabin but it was bitterly cold when he exhaled he breathed out as big a cloud as if hed started another cigar soldiers came scrambling out of their shelters to line up for morning roll call in the federal army their appearance would have given apoplexy to any noncommissioned officer worth his stripes not all of them had shoes their torn trousers were variously blueunion bootygray or butternut no one wore a blue blouse for fear of being mistaken for a yankee troop but that was as far as uniformity went there some wore forage caps others slouch hats like caudells the only thing of which that imaginary federal sergeant would have approved was their bearing the castalia invincibles might have been in rags but they could fight dress ranks allison high shouted the men shifted a little company d as a whole numbered between five and six dozen men which total included two corporals four sergeants first sergeant nate caudell a couple of lieutenants and a captain right after gettysburg sergeants had commanded some companies of the th north carolina at the moment the invincibles were oversupervised captain lewis limped up call the roll first sergeant yes sir caudell took from his pocket a muchfolded piece of paper after so many repetitions he hardly needed to look at it as he called the mens names bailey ransombarnes lewis d w bass gideon he finished a few minutes later winstead john awinstead william t he turned back to lewis with a salute all present sir very good sick call sick call caudell said loudly a couple of men took a step forward whats your trouble granbury he asked one of them i got the shitsbeggin your pardon first sergeant the runsagain granbury proctor said caudell sighed with the bad food and bad water the regiment got diarrhea was a common complaint this was proctors third bout this winter caudell said go see the assistant surgeon granbury maybe he can do something for you proctor nodded and walked off caudell turned to the other sufferer what about you southard dont rightly know first sergeant bob southard answered his voice cracked as he answered he was only eighteen or so he bent his head and coughed im feelin right poorly though caudell put a skeptical hand on the youngsters forehead southard had already deserted the regiment once he was a shirker no fever get back in line dejectedly the private went back into his slot the cook banged on his pan caudell said dismissed for breakfast breakfast was corn bread the meal from which it had been made was ground so coarse that some kernels lay in wait intact and rockhard to ambush the teeth caudell plucked at his beard to knock crumbs loose he heard a wagonno more than onerolling down from orange court house you dont suppose he said to rufus daniel this early naah daniel said but it was the wagon train turned off the road and rumbled toward the regimental parade ground benny lang rode beside the lead wagons driver slaves accompanied the others caudell held out his hand palm up to allison high pay up hell high reached into his hip pocket drew out a wad of bills and gave two of them to caudell heres your twenty whodve thought anybodyd move so quick hell he walked off scowling his head down easy there allison caudell called after him its only twenty dollars confederate not like before the war when that was a lot of money benny lang leaped down from his wagon and started shouting like a man possessed come on get those crates off this isnt a bloody picnic so move it you lazy kaffirs the slaves started unloading the wagons at the same steady but leisurely pace they usually used it was not fast enough to suit lang move damn you he shouted again the blacks were used to letting such shouts roll off their backs secure in the knowledge that the work would eventually get done and the yelling white man would shut up and leave them alone lang met that quiet resistance head on he stamped over to one of the slaves threw him to the ground with a flip like the one hed used against billy beddingfield ow the man cried whatd i do boss not bloody much lang snarled punctuating his words with a kick the slave cried out again lang said scornfully you arent hurt now get up and work and i mean work damn you that goes for the rest of you lazy buggers too or youll get worse than i just gave him move the black men moved boxes came down from wagons at an astonishing rate will you look at that rufus daniel saidif i had me enough niggers to hire an overseer that there langd be first man id pick for the job maybe so caudell said but he watched the sidelong glances that were the only safe way the slaves could use to show their resentment if he treats em like that all the time though hed better grow eyes in the back of his head or else hell have an accident one fine dayor lots of runaways anyhow might could be youre right daniel allowed once the wagons were unloaded lang ordered the work crew to carry a share of the crates to each company standard when the slaves again didnt work fast enough to suit him he booted one of them in the backside they moved quicker after that lang followed them from company to company when he came to the castalia invincibles he picked caudell out by his chevrons handed him a length of iron with a curved and flattened end here you are first sergeanta ripping bar to get the crates open we found some of your units had a spot of trouble with that you think of everything caudell said admiringly we do try youll have two magazines per weapon there more or lessenough ammunition to get a start at practicing your ordnance sergeant neednt fret well get you plenty more as you need it with a nod lang was off to company e caudell watched him go after yesterday and this morning he believed langs promise this was a man who delivered but then the army of northern virginia always got the ammunition it needed one way or another caudell wished benny lang or someone like him would take over the confederate commissary department the soldiers gathered round the stacked crates those the repeaters the badtempered feller was showin off to yall yesterday asked melvin bean a smoothfaced private with a light clear voice yup caudell attacked a crate with the bar the lid came up with a groan of nails leaving wood sure enough an ak lay inside caudell said anybody with the tools to give me a hand run and fetch em well get the job done that much quicker tom short who worked as a saddler left and returned shortly with a claw hammer he fell to work beside caudell before too long all the castalia invincibles held new repeaters a heavyset private named ruffin biggs gave his weapon a dubious look were supposed to whup the yankees with these little things it aint the size of the dog in the fight ruffin dempsey eure drawled its the size of the fight in the dog these here puppies got plenty of fight in em believe you me captain lewis said break into groups of six or seven men each that way everyone who learned about these repeaters yesterday will have one group to teach the division into groups smaller than squads went rather awkwardly eyeing the soldiers in his group caudell suspected that the sergeants and corporalsthe companys regular squad leadershad stuck him and the officers with the men they wanted least he shrugged everyone would have to learn he held up his rifle pointed to the lever below the charging handle this is the change lever see it has three positions for now i want you to make sure you have it in the topmost one whys that first sergeant melvin bean asked because if you dont youre liable to end up shooting yourself before you find out how not to caudell answered drily that made everyone sit up and take notice he went through the lesson lang had given him the soldiers practiced attaching and removing a magazine he showed them how rounds were arranged inside the clip and had them practice putting rounds into it a rifle cracked over in another company shouts of alarm rose after the gunshot thats why i want that change lever up top caudell said as long as its there the repeater cant go off by accident its called the safety paschall page the regimental sergeant major came up to captain lewis and saluted the colonels compliments sir and the companies will practice shooting at our targets one by one in order very good sergeant major thank you lewis said page saluted again and marched off every inch a gentleman his blue sergeants stripes were joined above by an arc that showed he was the most exalted of all the regiments noncommissioned officers the lessons went more smoothly than caudell dared hope for one thing benny lang had done a good job with his instructions the day before and caudell had paid careful attention for another despite being different from a riflemusket the ak was an easy gun to use even ruffin biggs and alsie hopkins who had not a letter between them soon got the hang of the repeater caudell wondered how they would do when time to clean the weapon came around he intended to hold off on that till his pupils had fired the soldiers were learning how to chamber the first round in the banana clip when a volley of shots came from the parade ground company a was shooting for the first time almost at once the gunfire rang so thick and fast as to remind caudell of a whole regiment on the line not just one understrength company the chicora guards got new guns run for your lives henry joyner yelled out toward the practicing graycoats like the castalia invincibles the chicora guards were mostly recruited from nash county which made the rivalry between them all the fiercer for that matter each company currently boasted three joyners the relationships between them were too complicated for caudell to keep straight one of the soldiers of company amaybe one of the joynersyelled back shame we aint got the bullets to waste to turn these here fine new repeaters on you all couldnt hit us ifn you did henry jeered he thumbed his nose enough caudell said horseplay was fun but horseplay between men who carried rifles had to be controlled before it got out of hand companies b and cneither of which had a nametook their first turns practicing with the ak the men came away from the firing line exclaiming and shaking their heads in wonder some of them slung the new repeaters on their backs others carried the carbines in both hands as if they could not bear to let them go three or four men from company c started a chant enfield springfield throw em in the cornfield before long the whole company officers and all was singing it captain lewis said form column of foursto the parade ground march a couple of new men just up from north carolina started off on the wrong foot but growls from the sergeants soon had them in step with everyone else shift to the left from column to linemove lewis said the company performed the evolution with mindless precision born of unending practice caudell remembered the first day of marching down at camp mangum when an irate drill sergeant had compared their ragged line to a drunken centipede in an asskicking contest even that drill sergeant assuming he was still alive would have been satisfied to see them now load your rifles captain lewis said in one motion the men drew back their charging handles and each chambered a round fire not every repeater spat flame check your change lever caudell shouted along with everyone else who had had instruction the day before soldiers checked some of them swore at themselves the next volley was fuller in a moment a fusillade of shots made separate volleys impossible to distinguish the companys privates shouted in wonder and delight at how rapidly their repeaters fired and how easy they were to shoot caudell knew how they felt the ak was so different from any other rifle that hearing about it wasnt enough even after you shot with it it was hard to believe what happens if you put this here change lever thing on the middle notch henry joyner asked if its as much different from the bottom one as that there one is from the top reckon this gunll march out and shoot yankees an by its lonesome im for it i tell you that sorry henry caudell explained about full automatic fire he also explained about how much ammunition it chewed up finishing shooting fast can be bad if you run out of cartridges before the battles over thats not easy to do with a rifle musket with one of these repeaters especially on full automatic its easy as pie youll want to be careful about that melvin bean said i got shot in the arm the first day at gettysburg after id used up all my cartridges even if id seen the damn yankee who nailed me i couldntve done nothin about him the new men listened and nodded solemnly caudell reflected that a wound on the first day had kept bean out of the third days charge and very possibly kept the private from being captured or killed ruffin biggs fired one more round at the paper target circle which by now looked as if it were suffering from measles or smallpox he yelped out a rebel yell then said next time the drummers play the long roll them yankees is gonna wish they was never born this here rifle shoots like hellbeatintanbark is that good joyner asked caint be beat biggs answered positively clear the parade ground captain lewis said time for company e to have their turn form column of fours grumbling disappointed they couldnt shoot more his men obeyed somebody sang out enfield springfield throw em in the cornfield the chant ran down the column like wildfire the men from the other companies that had already fired took it up again too whole armys going to be singing that before long caudell predicted hope youre right dempsey eure answered on account of thatll mean the whole armys got themselves repeaters once they were back by their own shelters the castalia invincibles regrouped around the men benny lang had instructed now for the dull part cleaning caudell said the men groaned they groaned again when he showed them the cleaning rod and the kit in the stock compartment and then how to open the receiver plate and extract spring bolt carrier and bolt its not as bad as it looks he told them they go together likethis he reassembled the mechanism closed the cover plate now you do it they tried the bolt proved reluctant to go back where it was supposed to maybe for you it goes like this melvin bean said for me it just goes straight to the devil practice caudell said smugly willingness to practice was a virtue teachers needed his voice got deeper more serious you allll keep practicing till i see you can do it watch me again he went through the process very slowly you take another lick at it a couple of them succeeded in getting it right melvin bean kept failing and swearing caudell walked over took the privates hands in his guided them through what had to be done there do you see now bean smiled reckon so this time everything went smoothly thats a good job caudell said smiling himself anyone else still having trouble nobody said anything good just dont think that because you did it once you have it by the tail keep working at it tonight well go over it again tomorrow and the day after that by then i want you to be able to take that repeater apart clean it and put it back together in your sleep if you cant maybe you should be toting a billet of wood instead the soldiers expressions sobered carrying a billet wasnt onerous punishment but there were better ways to pass a morning caudell hesitated before he taught the privates how to clean the magazine springwhy burden them with something they might not need to know benny lang had said it was only occasionally necessary and there looked to be plenty of banana clips about but on second thought caudell did demonstrate the technique what passed for the confederate supply system could turn plenty into famine without warning more questions he said at last all right thendismissed most of the men drifted away still talking excitedly about the new repeaters they were carrying the other groups had already broken up some a good while before caudell cared nothing about that thoroughness counted here and he was used to repeating himself any number of times until students caught on to what he was saying melvin bean did not wander off the private removed the receiver plate took out the rifles works tried to put them back together caudell watched they proved balky bean swore softly then said i just cant make the pesky thing fit do you want to come back to my hut with me and show me what im doin wrong id be glad to do that caudell said they walked down the straight muddy lane between rows of shelters beans cabin was small but neat its one window even boasted shutters no one else lived here which was unusual if not quite unique in the regiment bean opened the door go right on in first sergeant caudell did the private followed closing and barring the door behind the two of them now show me that trick of puttin this fool rifle back together again you really were having trouble then i said as much didnt i thought i had it when you showed me before but i lost the knack again they sat together on the blanketcovered pine boughs that did duty for a bed bean watched intently as caudell went through everything so thats what yall were doin here let me have a go natei reckon i really have got it now sure enough the pieces went back together smoothly do it some more show me it wasnt a fluke caudell said bean did twice running caudell nodded bean checked to make sure the repeaters change lever was in the safe position then set the weapons aside good i need to be able to do that mischief sparked in the privates eyes and now nate caudell i expect youll be lookin to find out how your own bolt fits id like that a lot bean had not waited for him to reply but was already opening the sevenbutton privates tunic caudell reached out and gently touched one of the small but perfectly feminine breasts that unbuttoning revealed he smiled you know mollie if you were one of those bosomy girls youd never get by with this if i was i could bind em up i suppose she said seriously itd be as uncomfortable as all get out though an i do enough pretendin as it is melvin took me a goodish while even to get used to answerin to it caudells lips followed his fingers mollie bean sighed and pulled the tunic off altogether a long puckered scar marred the smooth skin of her left upper arm outer mark of where a minié ball had gashed the muscle an inch or two lower and it would have smashed the bone and cost her the limb here now she reached for him aint hardly fair for me to be the only one gettin out of my clothes sides its chilly in here he held her close and did his best to warm her he certainly forgot about the cold himself at least until afterwards when he sat up again though he found he was shivering he dressed quickly so did mollie back in confederate uniform with her forage cap pushed down so the brim covered her eyebrows she seemed just another private too young to shave the th north carolina claimed more than a few of those but she had been all woman in his arms he studied her as if she were a difficult problem in trigonometry she was very different from the hardeyed richmond whores to whom hed occasionally resorted when he got leave he supposed that was because he saw her every day and knew her as a person not just a convenient receptacle for his lust to be forgotten as soon as he was out the door ask you something he said she shrugged go ahead how come you didthis you mean how come i came up to the fightin she said he nodded she shrugged again i was bored down home wasnt hardly nobody comin by the bawdyhouse where i was at either what with so many men bein away to the war guess i figured id come up and see it for myself see what it was like and her face twisted into a wry grin she still wasnt pretty in any conventional sense of the word especially with her black hair clipped off short like a mans but her wide fulllipped smile made her seem much more feminine when she smiled she said didnt like get tin shot worth a damn i tell you that nate i believe you he thanked his lucky stars he was still unwounded few bullets were as merciful as the one that had found her the ghastly piles of arms and legs outside the surgeons tent after every fight the screams of men shot in the belly the dying gurgles of men shot through the chest he was glad to forget those images when she went on but for that though yall in the company are more like family n anything i ever knew fore i got here yall care about me like you was my brothers and yall keep th officers from findin out what i amher wry grin flashed again cause you know blamed well i aint your sister he laughed at that hed never asked before though shed been with the regiment a year he didnt know what hed expected to hearperhaps something more melodramatic than her plain story he took out the twenty dollars confederate hed won from allison high gave the bills to her wish it was federal greenbacks she said but itll do nate itll do want to go another round he thought about it but shook his head id better not i cant afford the time ive been away too long as is you care about what youre doin thats a good thing mollie made a face at him or is it just im gettin old cain t think o many who wouldve turned me down if id asked em when i was down in rivington youre a damn sight younger than i am you caudell stopped you were in rivington before you joined up they say these new repeaters come from there and the people who make them or sell them or whatever it is they do ive heard that too mollie said caudell reflected that shed probably heard it well before he did she usually got news even before colonel faribault heard it she went on dont know nothin about it though them fellers werent there when i left the place a year ago not much else was neither specially not men so i got out sure you dont want to go again what i want to do and what i have to do are two different things caudell said this is the army remember her laugh followed him as he returned to the cold and military world outside her cabin door he looked down the lane toward the parade ground george hines was out there on his hands and knees gathering up brass cartridge cases iii the locomotive snorted and hissed as it slowed the shriek of the locked driving wheels against sanded rails reminded general lee of the cries of wounded horses the most piteous sound on any battlefield the train stopped there was a last jolt as the cars came together with a clanking clatter of linkandpin couplings lee and the other passengers got to their feet all out to richmond the conductor called before hurrying down to the next car to repeat the cry carpetbag in hand lee descended to the muddy ground outside the virginia central railroad depot at the corner of sixteenth and broad the depot was a plain wooden shed much in need of paint a banner on the door of the tavern across the street advertised fried oysters at half price in honor of george washingtons birthday the banner made lee pause in mild bemusement strange how the confederacy still revered the founding fathers of the united states or perhaps it was not so strange surely washington were he somehow to whirl through time to the present would find himself more at home on a southern plantation than in a brawling northern factory town like pittsburgh or new york and of course washington was a virginian so where better to celebrate his birthday than richmond a young mans brisk voice brought lee out of his reverie and back to the here and now general i have a carriage waiting for you sir he turned around exchanged salutes with a lieutenant who wore a uniform nattier than any still to be found in the army of northern virginia i hope you were not waiting long for me no sir the lieutenant pulled out a pocket watch its but a few minutes after four the train was due in at a quarter past three i arrived then on the off chance it might be on time both men smiled knowing how unlikely that was but a wise lieutenant did not take chances not when he was meeting the senior officer of his army he held out his hand for lees bag if youll come with me sir lee followed him to the carriage its black driver tapped a finger against the brim of his tall silk hat as lee got in evenin marse robert hello luke how are you today oh middlin sir i expect im about middlin thats a fair enough place to be lee said judiciously the lieutenant put a snap of command in his voice back to the presidents office luke yassuh luke flicked his whip the twohorse team started northwest up broad street like the lieutenant both animals were in finer fettle than the beasts jeb stuarts troopers rode it was the same in washington city lee had heard he believed it the farther one drew from the front lines the easier one found comfort train tracks ran down the middle of broad street connecting the virginia central depot with that of the richmond fredericksburg and potomac eight blocks away lee heard an engine coming their way puffing at full throttle to haul a fully laden train up steep shockoe hill the horses heard too and tossed their heads to show they did not approve luke calmed them with a few soft words before the bellowing cinderbelching monster appeared the carriage turned left onto twelfth street it rattled through capitol square on the way to the new building that had been the customhouse before virginia left the union off to the left twin rows of oaks led to the governors mansion to the right lee got a quick glimpse of the equestrian statue of george washington before it vanished behind the severely classic bulk of the virginia state capitol now also the home of the confederate congress the white columns and walls were remarkably handsome in spring and summer when set against the rich green of the lawns and shrubbery and trees that surrounded them now the lawns were dead and yellow the trees skeletal without their cloak of leaves the confederate flag waved bravely over the capitol red canton with blue saltire cross and thirteen stars on a white ground the stainless banner would come down soon sunset was near it was both like enough to the stars and stripes and different enough from it to stir conflicting feelings in lee he remembered the day almost three years gone now when he had gone into the house of delegates to take charge of virginias forces he shook his head four days before that winfield scott had offered him command over the armies of the united states to lead them against their seceded brethren he still thought he had made the rightfor him the onlychoice the massive rectangle of the former customhouse took up a whole city block built from concrete and steel it might have served duty as a fortress unlike most of richmonds major buildings it was in italianate rather than neoclassic style its three stories shown by the tall windows with arched tops luke hitched his team to the rail in front of the building the lieutenant said he will be at your disposal for the length of your stay in the city sir now i will take you up to president davis let me have your bag there if you would thats very kind of you sir lee followed the lieutenant inside the first floor housed the treasury department most of the time busy men there would pause to look and point as lee walked to the stairs those men needed to be busy he thought with less than perfect forbearance to print all the paper money that was pushing prices in the confederacy to the sky but even they had washingtons birthday as a holiday the second floor was always quiet today no more so than usual that floor belonged to the department of state no foreign nation had recognized the confederate states of america nor did any seem likely to unless the south won more victories than she had thus far president daviss offices were on the third floor the lieutenant tapped on a closed door yes jefferson davis called from within i have general lee with me sir excellent i will see him you may return to your other duties the lieutenant opened the door saluted lee one last time and hurried away mr president lee said come right in general ill be with you directly davis was going around with a tallow dip lighting lamps his bearing was militaryindeed extraordinarily erect he was a west point man himself from the class a year ahead of lees he came back to his desk last and lit two lamps there go on sit down make yourself comfortable thank you sir lee waited for davis to seat himself before he sank into an overstuffed armchair the lamplight played up the hollows in daviss gaunt cheeks lit his pale eyes within the shadows of their deep sockets he was aristocratically handsome while abraham lincoln had no claim to either breeding or good looks but the two presidents lee thought irrelevantly had faces of similar shape and leanness davis said how was your journey south well enough sir lee answered with a shrug i left this morning and am here now if i am a trifle later than the railroad men claimed i would be when i set out well what train ever runs dead on time none i think none on our railroads at any rate davis glanced to a tall clock that ticked in a corner of the office his nostrils flared with exasperation nor is mr seddon i had hoped him to be here half an hour ago lee shrugged again the secretary of war had doubtless expected his train to run even later than it did unlike the young lieutenant he was sufficiently important in his own right to take such chances in any case president davis was for all practical purposes his own secretary of war lee knew he would sooner have been commanding confederate armies in the field than governing from richmond as luck would have it james seddon walked into the office nt fifteen seconds after davis had complained about him lee rose to shake his hand seddon was tall thin and resembled nothing so much as a tired vulture he wore his gray hair combed straight back from his forehead it was thin in those parts anyhow and long enough on the sides to cover his ears at the presidents murmured invitation he drew up a chair beside lees they sat together to business davis said general lee ive heard great things of these new repeating carbines the soldiers are being issued even general johnston has written to me from dalton singing hosannas in their praise if anything praise from joe johnston was liable to make the president suspicious about the new rifles if johnston said it looked like rain davis would expect a drought and the lack of affinity was mutual lee said quickly for once mr president i would say the reports are if anything understated the repeaters are robust they are reasonably accurate with adequate range and they and their ammunition appear to be available in quantities sufficient to permit us to take the field with them when spring comes i intend to do so they improve our prospects by so much then seddon asked they do indeed sir lee said the federals have always had more weight than we could they but effectively bring it to bear these repeaters go far toward righting the balance without them our chances were become rather bleak in saying this i know i catch neither of you gentlemen by surprise no indeed davis said i am most pleased to hear this news from you general for some of the counsel i have had from others approaches desperation he rose from his desk strode over to close the door that led out to the hallway as he turned back he went on what i tell you now gentlemen must not leave this room do you understand certainly mr president said seddon who usually said yes to whatever jefferson davis wanted lee bent his head to show he also agreed very well then i shall hold you to that promise davis said to give you the full import of the remedies which have been contemplated out of anxiety for our future let me tell you that last month i received a memorial from general cleburne of the army of tennessee ah that seddon said yes that needs to stay under the rose he was familiar with the memorial then cleburne is an able officer lee said he fought well in the chattanooga campaign by all accounts as may be he stirred up a fight of his own among the generals of his army you see in his memorial he proposed freeing and arming some portion of our negroes to use them as soldiers against the yankees many might say what point to the confederacy then seddon remarked what point to our revolution lees brows came together as he thought at last he said the federals let some of their negroes put on the blue uniform they will surely take away ours if we are defeated would it not be better to preserve our independence by whatever means we may and measure the cost to our social institutions once that independence is guaranteed fighting for their freedom negroes might well make good soldiers put that way it might be so seddon said still the agitation and controversy which must spring from the presentation of such views by officers high in the public confidence are to be deeply deprecated i agree we cannot afford such controversy now davis saidcleburnes memorial is a counsel of the last ditch at the last ditch i would consider itat the last ditch i would consider any course that promised to stay our subjugation by the tyranny in washington what i hope however general lee is that newly armed as we shall be we succeed in keeping ourselves from that last ditch and thus preserve our institutions unblemished by unwelcome change i hope so too mr president lee said it may be so that our prospects are better with these repeating carbines than they would be without them cannot be denied whether they will bring us victorygod alone can answer that i shall do my best to foster that victory as will your other commanders that was as much as lee felt he could say he wished davis would trust general johnston further wished the two of them could compose their quarrel he was not however in a position to suggest it both proud touchy men would surely take it wrong davis said general am i to understand that these amazing rifles spring from rivington north carolina i had not thought of rivington as a center of manufacture indeedhe smiled frostilyup until this past month i had not thought of rivington at all id never heard of the place either seddon put in nor had i lee said since it was brought to my attention my staff officers and i have inquired about it of train crews and soldiers who pass through the place their reports only leave me more puzzled for it has not the appearance of a manufacturing town no smelting works no forges no factories there has lately been a good deal of building there but of homes and warehouses not the sort of buildings required to produce rifles cartridges or powder moreovermr president have you had the opportunity to examine these rifles for yourself not yet no davis said among other things they bear truly astonishing gunsmiths marks some proclaim themselves to have been manufactured in the peoples republic of china a part of that country no one has been able to locate in any atlas others say they were made in yugoslavia a country which appears in no atlas and still others are marked in what after some effort we determined to be russian i have learned they were made in the sssr but what the sssr may be i cannot tell you it is i confess a considerable puzzlement by what you are telling us rivington seems more likely a transshipment point than one where the weapons are actually made seddon said so it does lee looked toward the secretary of war in some surprise why couldnt seddon make such cogent suggestions more often or was it cogent lee went on from where could the rifles be transshipped granted rivington is on the wilmington and weldon railroad but the blockade runners are not bringing them in at wilmington they seem to originate directly at rivington coming i cannot tell you how from these unknown places i have mentioned and travel from rivington to us and i gather to other armies you have interrogated the railroad workers and our soldiers you say jefferson davis said have you not also questioned the men of rivington the ones who are with your army as instructors mr president i have but i confess only circumspectly lee said they turn aside all significant queries they are as closemouthed a band of men as i have ever encountered and without your order i have been unwilling to do anything that might antagonize them lest the stream of carbines dry up as suddenly as it began to flow davis rubbed the smoothshaven front of his chin plucked at the beard that grew under his jaw i dislike our nations dependence upon any single small group let alone one about which we know so little under the circumstances though general i must reluctantly concur with your judgment perhaps we should send agents to this rivington to learn of it what we maycircumspectly of course seddon said a good plan see to it davis said seddon took a pencil and a scrap of paper from his pocket he leaned forward made a note to himself on the presidents desk and put away the paper is there anything more mr president lee asked hoping the secretary of war would not forget until the next time he chanced to wear that waistcoat no general thank you very much you may go i know youll be eager to see your wife please convey my greetings to her she and her ladies have been of material benefit to the soldiers of the confederacy and i would not have her believe herself unappreciated davis said lee stood to go i will give her your exact words mr president as best i can remember them i know she will be grateful to hear from you he nodded to seddon i hope i see you again sir it was full dark outside and cloudy with a feel of rain in the air lee put on his hat and buttoned the top buttons of his coat as he walked out to the waiting carriage luke looked up at the sound of his footsteps the black man quickly stowed away a small flask lee pretended he had not seen it if luke wanted a nip against the nighttime cold that was his affair gwine home now marse robert he asked as he got down to untie the team thats right luke to mrs lees house it was hardly home his proper home arlington lay just across the potomac from washington city it had been in federal hands since the beginning of the war for the last two years he had lived with the army of northern virginia anywhere away from it he felt like a visitor have you there soon luke returned to his seat it only be a couple blocks the horses snorted eagerly as they began to walk they had been cold too the carriage clattered northwest along bank street the lower boundary of capitol square when luke got to ninth street he turned right half a block later at the corner of ninth and franklin he went left again onto franklin despite the holiday lights burned at several windows of mechanics hall which stood at the corner of ninth and franklin seddon no doubt had come from there the building housed the war and navy departments before the confederate capital moved to richmond the convention that had taken virginia out of the united states had met there too past mechanics hall franklin street was quiet and almost deserted two blocks away on broad street another train roared along between the depots of the virginia central and the richmond fredericksburg and potomac its racket was in marked contrast to the serenity that seemed to flow from every brick of the united presbyterian church on the corner of eighth and franklin lee smiled and shifted forward in his seat as the carriage rolled past the church the house mary custis lee was renting lay halfway down the same block on the opposite side of the street yours is the middle house am i right marse robert luke said yes and thank you luke lee descended from the carriage before it had quite stopped luke flicked the whip over the horses as they began to move faster again he reached down for the flask he had put away he swallowed and sighed with pleasure the house across the street from franklin had in front of it a young maple in a planter painted with chevrons as you were sergeant lee told it smiling slightly he opened the gate to the castiron fence in front franklin hurried up the short walk to the porch there he paused to wipe the mud from the unpaved street off his boots before he knocked on the door he heard footsteps inside the door opened lamplight spilled onto the porch silhouetted by it agnes lee peered out father she exclaimed and threw herself into his arms hello my precious little agnes he said you must be careful with your knitting needles there behind my back lest you do me an injury worse than any those people have yet managed to inflict on me she looked up at him with a doubtful smile all her smiles were doubtful these days and had been since her sister annie died a year and a half before she and annie had been almost as close as twins after he kissed her on the cheek she pulled herself free and called mother mary mildredfathers here mildred came rushing up first precious life he said indulgently as he hugged her and how is my pet this evening father she said in the tone of voice any eighteenyearold uses when her elderly and obviously decrepit parent presumes to allude to the unfortunate fact that she was once much younger than her present peak of maturity lee did not mind his youngest child was his pet regardless of what she thought of the matter how is custis morgan he asked her hes happy and fat she answered acorns are easier to come by than human provender such a happy fat squirrel had best not be seen in camp he teased lest he exit the stage in a stewpotbound blaze of glory she made a face at him he shook his head in mock reproof his eldest daughter came into the front hall a moment later pushing his wife ahead of her in a wheeled chair hello mary he called to them both mary his daughter bore a strong resemblance to his wife though her hair was darker than mary custis lees had been when she was young he took three quick steps to his wife bent a little so he could clasp her hand in his how are you my dear mary he asked her she stayed in her chair most of the time rheumatism had so crippled her that she could hardly walk you didnt write to let us know you were coming she said a little sharply even when shed been young and pretty and wellmore than half a lifetime ago lee thought with some surprise he could call up in his mind the picture of her then as easily as if it had been day before yesterdayher temper was uncertain years as an invalid had done nothing to soften her he said i was summoned down to confer with the president and took the first train south a letter could hardly have outrun me so here i am my own messenger i am glad to see youglad to see you all your hands i note dear mary are not too poorly for you to knit he pointed to the yarn needles and halffinished sock that lay in her lap when i can no longer knit you may lay me in my grave for ill be utterly useless then she answered shed loved to ply the needles since she was a girl now she went on since you are here you may take the next bundle back with you for the men between our daughters and me weve finished nearly four dozen pairs since we last sent them and with them in your hands the count should be right when they reach camp times are hard for everyone lee said if a railroad man is needy enough to filch a pair of socks i dare say he requires them as badly as any of my soldiers his eldest daughter said mrs chesnut visited not long ago and said we were so busy we reminded her of an industrial school mary tossed her head to show what she thought of the blueblooded south carolina woman at the same age her mother would have done the same thing i dont care what mary boykin chesnut thinks of us mary custis lee declared it would be altogether improper for me to lead in any entertainments of the social sort when the men you lead are all halfstarved and when you yourself live like a monk in that tent of yours president daviss opinion of you is rather higher than mrs chesnuts lee passed on daviss compliment tell me then whose approbation would you sooner have yours his wife said he stooped to kiss her cheek however her body troubled her she was loyal to him to the bone and he to her they were part of each other after more than thirtytwo years of marriage he had trouble imagining things being otherwise julia turn down the second bed in mothers room please agnes called the black woman started up the stairs lee said thats thoughtful of you but i dont plan on turning in quite yet i should like to sit up awhile and listen to the doings of the city from the lot of you if you can stand to hear me i may even go on a bit about affairs at camp im going to go hide custis morgan so you dont take him back to orange court house with the socks mildred said whats your daughters happiness set against the prospect of squirrel stew for your men chuckling lee told her your pet is safe from me precious life he would not go far enough divided among hungry soldiers to be worth absconding with if the scriptures spoke of the miracle of loaves and squirrels though instead of loaves and fishes everyone laughed at that even agnes briefly mary custis lee said lets go back into the parlor then and talk the wheels of her chair squeaked as mary turned her around i dont want to talk about squirrels anymore mildred said then we shant lee promised the womens needles clicked busily as they resumed their interrupted knitting the war touched them in richmond almost as hard as it did him with the army of northern virginia one of the stories lees eldest daughter told was of the mass escape of federal officers from libby prison less than two weeks before over a hundred men had got loose and fewer than half of them were rounded up again our own soldiers suffer in northern prison camps lee said though the north has more to spare for captives than do we the north has more to spare for everyone he sighed i have said that thought that wrestled with that for too long i wish this war had never come it wastes both sides i said as much when it began his wife observed i know you did nor did i disagree with you i wanted no flag but the starspangled banner no song besides hail columbia but once here the thing must be fought through he hesitated then continued it may evenmay i sayhave seen a turn in our favor the knitting needles stopped his wife and daughters all looked at him he had always done his best to sound hopeful in his letters and to act so when he saw them but he was not one to be falsely or blindly optimistic and they knew it his daughter mary asked from where has this good news come from rivington north carolina as a matter of fact lee said the name of the place meant no more to his family than it had to him a month before he quickly told the story of the new repeaters and the curiously accented men who supplied them finishing we cannot outnumber the federals if we outshoot them though that may serve as well his daughters seemed more interested in his account of the strangers and their gear than in details of the carbines mildred said i wonder if those are the same men as the ones who not long ago rented a whole floor in the building across from mechanics hall why do you say that precious life lee asked any time anyone pays his bills in gold these days word gets around and by what you said thesewhat did your lieutenant call themthese alloverspots fellows appear to have an unmatched supply of it and if i were selling guns to the war department instead of making socks i should like my offices close by theirs none of which necessarily proves a thing he said mildreds lively features started to cloud up but he went on still i think you may well be right it could do with some looking into perhaps why father agnes scratched her head her hair now tightly done up with pins came closest of all his childrens to matching the rich yellow that had been her mothers why she asked again from all youve said these men from rivington mean us nothing but good the old homely saying is look not a gift horse in the mouth if you follow that saying you will end up with a great many old hardmouthed horses in your barn lee answered when the gift is of such magnitude as that which these men are giving us i would examine it as closely as possible to learn if it is in fact as fine as it appears and to see if it comes attached to strings even if it does you will have to accept it father wont you mary asked you always did see clearly my dear he said yes i think we must if our southern confederacy is to survive which god grant amen agnes said softly the slave woman brought in a tray with cups and a steaming pot the spicy scent of sassafras tea filled the parlor thank you julia lee said as she poured for him the tea made him think of the instant coffee andries rhoodie had brought up to the headquarters near orange court house coffee his wife said longingly when he spoke of it weve been some time without it here surely it would come to richmond more readily than to a small town like rivington north carolina especially if as you say father it was made in the united states mary said thats true and i should have thought of it for myself lee said still with gold a great many things become possible rivington is on the railroad up from wilmington maybe a blockade runner brought it in there rather than something more truly useful to our cause maybe he found himself yawning mary custis lee put down her needles there this sock is finished and a good enough place to call the days work finished as well knitting by the light of lamp and candle is hard on the eyes which does not stop you from doing so mother agnes said reprovingly not on most nights her mother agreed but tonight we find robert here so halting early is easier to square with my conscience i wish i were here with you and my girls every night both for the pleasure of your company and because it would mean the war was over and our independence won lee said he yawned again tonight though i own myself tired riding the train with the rails in their present sadly decrepit state is hardly more enjoyable than driving a light buggy headlong down a corduroy road then let us seek our beds his wife said surely you will rest better in a real bed and a warm house than in your tent by the rapidan mary dear if you would be so kind mary got up and wheeled her mother to the base of the stairs lee rose quickly too to go with them as he stood he felt a probing pain in his chest that pain had been with him now and again all through the winter doctors thumped his chest and made learned noises without finding its source or doing him any good to speak of he endured it stoically mary he knew suffered far worse at the foot of the stairs she used her left arm to push herself out of her chair and upright then grabbed the banister with her right hand lee stepped up beside her slid his arm around her waist the feel of her body against his was strange from separation yet at the same time infinitely familiar shall we ascend my dear he said he took most of her weight as they climbed to the second floor you are smoother at helping me than anyone else i think she said you have a gentle touch who is likely to know you better than your husband he replied as he guided her down the hallway toward the bedroom he had nursed her many illnesses through their marriage whenever they were together before that his mother had spent her last years as an invalid he was long practiced in dealing with the sick he helped mary change into a warm flannel nightgown then put on the pajamas julia had left out for him and a nightcap too he exclaimed as he set it on his head such luxury is bound to spoil me his wife snorted he walked over to her bed and kissed her good night dear mary he went back to his own bed blew out the candle by it the room plunged into darkness sleep well robert mary said thank you im sure i shall he answered after so long on his cot the bed felt almost indecently soft but the room was warm at least compared to a tent in the hills close by the rapidan he had no trouble dropping off luke and his carriage showed up in front of the house on franklin street at breakfast time when lee went out to him he seemed none the worse for wear for however much drinking he had done the night before where to today marse robert he asked the armory lee answered i need to confer with colonel gorgas whatever you say marse robert luke plainly could not have cared less whether lee went to the armory to confer with gorgas or with george washingtons ghost but he flicked his whip over the team and got them moving which was what mattered the carriage rolled down seventh street toward the james river the armory sprawled at the foot of gambles hill diagonally between seventh and fourth the kanawha canal ran behind it luke pulled up to the columned central entranceway the dome that surmounted it did not seem to be of a piece with the rest of the long low brick building the armory rang with the sounds of metalwork and carpentry drills and lathes and dies and punches and molds turned wood and iron and lead into small arms and bullets no other confederate arsenal came close to matching its production without the machines captured at harpers ferry and moved here in the first days of the war the south would have been hardpressed for weapons general lee josiah gorgas came up and saluted he was a heavyset moonfaced man in his forties his closetrimmed beard just starting to be streaked with gray im very glad to see you sir id hoped to have the opportunity to speak with you and here you are and i with you colonel i suspect we have in mind a similar topic of conversation too likely we do sir will you come up to my office where we can talk more comfortably he led lee up to the second floor lee took the stairs slowly worried that the pain in his chest might recur to his relief it did not he sat opposite gorgas pointed to the ak on the ordnance chiefs desk yes there it is the marvel of the day gorgas looked at him sharply i meant no sarcasm colonel i assure you i am in your debtthe confederacy is in your debtfor sending andries rhoodie on to me i hoped you would feel so general after seeing it demonstrated i certainly did and i am glad to have my judgment vindicated by a soldier in the field i do endeavor to give satisfaction so far as arms go he spoke with some diffidence a shipment of cavalry carbines the summer before had been almost as dangerous to the men who held them as to those at whom they were aimed lee said my only possible reservation about these repeaters is that they have not yet seen combat but i think they will answer though they are so different from our usual rifles they are easy to learn and use and maintain and the troops are much taken by the volume of fire they deliver i like men to be confident in their arms it makes them more belligerent general i think you yourself are the most belligerent man in your army gorgas said lee considered henry heth said something to that effect to me once he remarked it may be so hemmed in as i am by responsibility i have few opportunities personally to demonstrate it if it is but i would surely rather strike a blow than either flee of remain quiet waiting to be struck enough of my ramblings now sirto business i thank god for these gentlemen from rivington and for the arms with which they are supplying us i am not however eager to forever depend on them for weapons if anyone if any establishment in the confederacy can manufacture their like you are the man and this is the place gorgas looked baffled and unhappy like a hound that has taken a scent and then lost it in the middle of an open meadow general lee i do not know i thank you for being thoughtful enough to provide me with more of these carbines and a stock of ammunition i already had one and a couple of magazines from andries rhoodie i have been puzzling at it since before he departed for orange court house andi do not know what perplexes you so about the rifle lee asked he had his own list he wanted to see what the confederacys ordnance wizard would add to it first that it springs ex nihilo like minerva from loves forehead colonel gorgas evidently had a list toohe was ticking off points on his fingers generally speaking a new type of weapon will have defects which may in some cases be ameliorated through modifications made in the light of experience the next defect i discover in this ak will be the first the gun works sir which is no small wonder in itself i had not thought of it in those terms lee said slowly you mean it gives the impression of being a finished arm like for example a springfield exactly so the springfield rifle musket has a great number of less efficient ancestors so logically must the ak yet where are they even a less efficient rifle based on its principles would be better than anything we or the federals have that is the case i have noticed with much of the equipment borne by andries rhoodie and his colleagues lee said remembering a tasty tin of desiccated stew carry on from the general to the particular gorgas reached into a desk drawer took out a couple of rounds for the ak he passed them over to lee you will observe that the bullets are not simply lead yes i had seen that lee agreed putting on his glasses for a clearer look at the ammunition the cartridges were surely brass as for the bulletsare they copper an the way through no sir they have a lead interior sheathed with copper we might be able to match that though it is expensive and we are short of enough copper even now to be commandeering coils from whiskey cookers stills then again unsheathed lead might serve at need but do you see the cleverness of this ammunition it all but eliminates lead fouling of the barrel less need for williams bullets then lee said the williams bullet had a zinc washer at the base of the lead slug which served to scour away fouling from the inside of a rifle barrel when it was fired lee went on but would a coppersheathed bullet not be too hard to take rifling well and would it not wear away the interior grooves in short order with any normal barrel the answer to both those questions would be yes gorgas ticked off another point the steelor whatever alloy it may bein the barrel of this weapon however is hard enough to lessen the difficulties again i doubt we could produce its like let alone work it once manufactured they seem to manage in rivington lee said i know they do sir butidontknowhow the colonel ground out the words one by one through clenched teeth he was a man of sanguine temperament and great resource as he had to be to keep the confederacy supplied with armaments in the face of an evertightening federal blockade and its own inadequate factories when he said i am thwarted i admit it it was as if he threw down his sword to surrender to superior force tell me what else you do know lee urged not liking to see such a capable officer so downhearted very well sir you mentioned the williams bullet as you must know the chief fouling problem it is designed to alleviate comes not from the lead of the minié ball but rather from the powder which propels it whatever powder is in these ak cartridges it produces far less fouling than even the finest gunpowder with which i was previously familiar has that a connection with the lack of smoke from this powder upon discharge lee asked exactly fouling consists of smoke and tiny bits of unburned powder that congeal so to speak on the inside of a gun barrel with this powder there is next to no smoke and thus next to no fouling i have sent a good deal of ammunition down to colonel george rains at the powder works in augusta georgia lee said with his knowledge of chemistry in general and gunpowder in particular i thought him the man best suited to penetrate the mystery of these rounds if anyone can if anyone can gorgas echoed gloomily but after a moment he brightened a little as you say if anyone can colonel rains is the man without his expertise we should be much the poorer for powder there i quite agree with you colonel chemical knowledge is too uncommon in the confederacy of course the same also obtains among the federals lee smiled at a memory when i administered west point a few years ago i had to dismiss from the academy a cadet who informed his instructor and fellow chemistry students that silicon was a gas do you know colonel were silicon truly a gas that lad would likely be a federal general today as lee had hoped gorgas also smiled at the story his amusement though soon faded he said and now general i come to the particular most baffling of all and when i speak of this weapon that is no small claim do you know sir what these rivington men charge the ordnance bureau for each ak carbine fifty dollars sir it hardly seems excessive a henry rifle goes for a similar price in the north i understand and this weapon is surely far superior to a henry of course the treasury department will doubtless be anguished at the prospect of discovering sufficient specie to purchase the number of carbines we require butwhat is it colonel gorgas had lifted his hand as if he wanted to speak now he said you misapprehend general not that i can blame you for it the asking price is fifty dollars confederate paper per carbine you must be mistaken lee said gorgas shook his head lee saw he knew whereof he spoke but how is that possible while i love our country i am not blind to our financial straits fifty dollars of confederate paper will not buy two gold dollars nor much of anything else gorgas said save these aks the asking price for their ammunition is similarly ah reasonable lee frowned ferociously as if facing foes in the field you are correct colonel the cost of an ak is even more perplexing than any of its mechanical aspects extraordinary as those are yes sir the only thing i thought of was that these rivington men are such strong patriots that they insist on our dollars equality to that of the north but no one is that patriotic sir nor should anyone be with the manifest untruth of the proposition demonstrated every day of the year lee said yet the rivington men despite the money they surely lose on every repeater they sell us seem to have plenty of it when they came to rivington they paid gold for homes and warehouses and slaves and i am given to understand they have also put down gold here in richmond for offices across from mechanics hall id heard that too gorgas said even the rumor of gold let alone the sight of it will set tongues wagging here what are we to make of it though that they have so much money they care nothing for how much these carbines bring them the notion is logical but not reasonable if you take my distinction sir i do indeed colonel lee started to rise then paused and sat down again may i please have a pen and a scrap of paper gorgas passed him pen and inkwell he sketched rapidly gave his drawing to the ordnance chief are you by any chance familiar with this emblem that rhoodie and his comrades use yes ive seen it funny you should ask for it interested me not long after i first made rhoodies acquaintance i made a copy of it and showed it to a friend of mine who knows something of heraldry he said it reminded him of the arms of the isle of man save that those show three bent legsdont ask me for the proper terms please sirinstead of mere lines the isle of man you say most interesting manxmen have a distinctive way of speaking do they not perhaps that is the accent rhoodie and his comrades bear it might form a useful basis from which to begin inquiries at any rate so it might gorgas smiled ruefully a pity to have to think about investigating men who are helping us so greatly but they do seem rather too good to be true you are not the first to use those very words about them colonel and when something seems too good to be true it is all too apt to be so well now i have spent enough of your time this morning with all my fretting about our benefactors you will no doubt be thinking of me as granny leea nickname i assure you i was not sorry to lose after the first year of the war i dont blame you for that sir gorgas said nor for the other too many peculiar things hover about rhoodie and his carbine for me to be easy with them no matter how useful the gun may prove that is exactly my view lee really stood this time through the window in gorgass office he saw the white frame buildings of the confederate laboratory on browns island separated from the mainland by a thin stretch of the james pointing across to them he said i trust everyone at the cartridge loading works is busily engaged yes sir gorgas said we have put last springs misfortune behind us and go on as we must my wife fatigued herself very much visiting and relieving the poor sufferers injured in the blast how many died lee asked ten women were killed at once another twenty perished over the next several weeks a considerable number more were burned but recovered terrible lee shook his head and as terrible that we must employ women and girls to produce the sinews of war for us but with even our armies ever short of men i suppose no good choice exists you and your wife have your living quarters here in the armory do you not yes sir just a couple of doors down from here as a matter of fact you are fortunate colonel in being able to honorably carry out your vital duty and yet remain in the bosom of your family i often think so gorgas said as you should such circumstances are given to few and ought not to be taken for granted and now i will let you return to your duties no you need not see me out i can find my way given that permission gorgas was already reaching for a pen as lee shut the door behind him the man was a glutton for work lee wished the confederacy had more like him piles of shells in the yard around the armory testified to the diligence of gorgas and his crews the muscular men loading some of those shells onto a wagon for transport to a railway station and thence to the field paused when lee came out and walked over to his carriage a couple of them lifted their caps to him he nodded in return they grinned as they went back to work luke breathed whiskey fumes into lees face as lee got in behind him you give em somethin to brag on marse robert just because they see you lee glanced down but the black man had his flask out of sight he asked where you want to go to now lee considered the question hed had no definite plans for the rest of the day his first impulse was to rush headlong to the treasury beard secretary memminger in his lair and demand of him if he knew what an impossibly good bargain he was getting in rhoodies repeaters but finance was not his own province he said take me back to the war department yassuh marse ropert tight or sober luke could handle horses he swung the team around another wagon coming into the armory to be loaded with shells then drove back to mechanics hall lee eyed with keen interest the building across the street from the war department a threestory brown brick structure hed gone by countless times before but scarcely noticed his scrutiny was rewarded by the sight of a man in the mottled outfit that seemed the trademark costume of andries rhoodie and his comrades passing in through the buildings marblefaced entranceway officers with lace on their gray sleeves and civilians in black clawhammer coats bustled in and out of mechanics hall as if the place were an ants nest with some workers going forth to forage and others returning with their spoils luke pulled up right in front of the building a confederate with the two stars of a lieutenant colonel on his collar shouted you damned stupid nigger what do you think youre doing blocking the the words stuck in his throat when lee got out of the carriage he pulled himself to attention and snapped off a salute that would have done credit to a cadet from the virginia military institute lee turned and said thank you luke before he returned it the black man smiled a secret smile as he took the team around the corner to find a place to hitch it the walk from the street into the foyer of mechanics hall was only twenty or thirty feet but in that short space lee was saluted close to a dozen times he paused in the foyer to let his eyes adjust to the dimmer interior light then he walked over to a desk where a clerk was industriously jotting in a ledger or notebook after a glance at the enameled brass nameplate in front of the fellow he said excuse me mr jones does colonel lee still maintain his office on the second floor the clerkjohn beauchamp jones his nameplate proclaimed him to be as if by trumpeting his middle name he could make up for the utter plainness of those that flanked itfinished writing his sentence before he looked up his thin cleanshaven face bore a sour expression at the interruption that quickly changed when he saw who stood before him yes general he does hes there now i believe i saw him go up this morning thank you sir lee had not taken two steps toward the stairway before jones returned to his writing he fielded more salutes on the second floor as he made his way down the hall to his son custiss office custis was writing when he tapped on the open door though with less zeal than john jones had displayed father sir he exclaimed springing to his feet he too saluted then stuck out his hand lee took it swept his eldest son into an embrace hello my dear boy youre looking very well i see it is possible to find adequate victuals in richmond after all custis laughed ive always been heavier than you father here sit down tell me what i can do for you is iti hope it isa post in the field i have none to give son i wish i did i know how you chafe as president daviss aide lee said custis nodded tugging at his beard in frustration though he was past thirty it remained boyishly thin and silky on his upper cheeks he said how am i ever to deserve command if i have not led men ill the field soon i am sure you will take the field in some capacityeveryone who has ability will be needed when spring comes do not think you have no value in your current post either you render the president and the nation important service it is not the service i would give custis said stiffly i know i have been in that predicament myself in western virginia and then in the carolinas at the moment however your presence in richmond may prove of considerable advantage to me how so sir the younger lee still sounded dubious as if he suspected his father of devising some makework assignment to reconcile him to remaining in the confederate capital but interest flowered on his face when lee asked do you remember the organization that calls itself america will break of which i wrote you the one which appears centered in the town of rivington north carolina the people with those amazing repeaters custis said yes of course i do i shouldnt mind getting my hands on one of their carbines myself that can be quite simply arranged i think you need only walk across the street as the organization has established offices right opposite mechanics hall but i wish you would not custis smiled youd best have a good reason father for if they are so close i think i shall straightaway beat a path to their door i believe i do have a good reason custis or rather several of them lee briefly outlined his conversations with major venable back at army headquarters and with colonel gorgas not an hour earlier when he finished by telling custis what the rivington men were selling their repeaters for his son stared and exclaimed youre joking no my dear boy lam not lee assured him and so you will grasp that i have cause to wonder about these people who call themselves america will break they are on their way to becoming a power in the confederacy and i do not know whether they will prove a power for good or ill there is a great deal i do not know about them and i wish i did that is where you come in how now custis seemed eager not doubtful before his father could answer he went on fifty dollars confederate fifty dollars confederate wont buy a pocket knife let alone a repeating rifle that is why i want you his father said i cannot personally investigate these awb establishments myself even if i had the time i am too readily recognizable for that matter you may be as well you favor your mother as much as me but the name lee draws attention to its bearer thanks to you sirwhat you have done makes me proud to bear it you have made your own contributions to it and will i am confident make more you can aid your country now by recruiting a band of meni care not whether soldiers or civilianswhose names and faces will certainly draw no notice and by using them to keep watch on the men and offices of america will break report what you learn to me and if it is of sufficient urgency directly to president davis your being his aide may well prove valuable in this task for it gives you his ear custiss face grew set and abstracted lee knew the look his son was thinking through the task he had been given it was not a formal order he was not under his fathers command but he said of course ill take it on sir i see the need perhaps i ought to enlist some negroes among mymy spies not to mince words to a white man no one is more invisible than a slave that may be an excellent notion if you make sure they are trustworthy and can be relied upon not to gossip by all means make use of them do not stint in rewarding them either if they give you good service i promise father i shant be niggardly good for mostly being poor they are lee broke off and did his best to stare severely at his son who was grinning to see his delayed reaction you young scamp im sorry sir i couldnt resist you might have tried lee said i think i shall take myself away before i find myself under further bombardments he got up so did custis they hugged again take care of yourself my dear son and you father give my love to rob when you get back to the army and to cousin fitzhugh as well one of custiss brothers was in the artillery his cousin a cavalry officer i shall lee promised any word on rooney custis asked his other brother also a cavalry officer had been wounded at brandy station the year before and captured while recuperating for a time he had been under threat of death lee said the exchange talks seem to be moving forward at last god willing well have him back again next month thank heaven yes i expect to be down here a few more days doing this and that perhaps you and your wife will be able to stop by the house on franklin street before i have to return if not tell her i know i owe her a letter and custis i do attach much importance to this business of the rivington men believe me i had not doubted it sir you are not in the habit of concerning yourself with trifles ill learn all i can of them im sure you will god bless you and keep you custis lee walked out of his sons office and down the stairs his way out to the street carried him past john joness desk the clerk was turned away from him talking to the man at the next desk my boy custiss parrot happened to be loose from its cage it swooped down on the meat as if it were a hawk the miserable bird and gulped it down before we could get it back again meat is too hard to come by in richmond these days to waste on a parrot well go without on account of it i wish the damned talking feather duster would flyaway for good luke was waiting patiently outside mechanics hall he waved when he saw lee and called ill get the carriage for you marse robert he hurried off to fetch it lee went down the marble stairs and stood to one side of them so he would not be in the way of people going in and out on war department business good to see you smiling general lee sir a friendly passerby said tipping his stovepipe hat now i know things cant be bad without waiting for an answer he went up the stairs two at a time and disappeared into mechanics hall lees smile grew broader though the stranger had been cheered by an amusement which had nothing to do with the prospective course of the war between confederacy and union the thought uppermost in lees mind was that custis joness parrot ought to make the acquaintance of custis morgan the squirrel iv with his small bald head long nose and long neck richard ewell inevitably reminded everyone who met him of a stork having lost a leg at groveton during second manassas he could now also imitate the big white birds onefooted stance he was sitting at the moment however sitting and pounding one fist into the other palm to emphasize his words we smashed em sir smashed em i tell you his voice was high and thin almost piping i am very glad to hear it general ewell lee replied if those people send raiders down toward richmond with the intention of seizing their prisoners thereand perhaps even the city itselfthey must expect not to be welcomed with open arms oh we met em with arms all right jeb stuart said with a grin patting the ak that leaned against his camp stool the repeaters woodwork was not so perfectly varnished as it had been fresh out of the crate it had seen use since then stuart patted it again and we sent kilpatricks riders back over the rapidan with their tails between their legs lee smiled hed liked stuart for years ever since the young cavalry corps commanders days at west point with custis he said excellent but dont you think that leather might better have gone into shoes for the men ever flamboyant stuart wore crossed leather belts over his shoulders each one with loops enough to hold a magazines worth of brass ak cartridges the effect was piratical but stuart instantly became a contrite swashbuckler saying im sorry general lee it never crossed my mind let it go lee said i doubt the confederacy will founder for want of a couple of feet of cowhide but i take it i am to infer from your ornaments that you are pleased with the performance of the new repeaters in action general lee yesterday i sold my lemat stuart said lee blinked at that stuart had carried the fancy revolver with an extra charge of buckshot in a separate lower barrel ever since the war was young the rifles are outstanding general ewell agreed so are the men who furnish them if i had a drink in my hand id toast them i have some blackberry wine here in my tent brought up from richmond lee said if you truly feel the need i should be glad to bring it out ewell shook his head thank you but let it be still had we not heard from those america will break fellows that kilpatrick was on the move who knows how much mischief he might have done before we beat him back as it was i understand some of their cavalry captured a train station on the line up from the capital not long after i passed through on the way back to the army lee said fugitives from the main band after we scattered them stuart said im glad they got to the station too late to nab you otherwise however badly the rest of their plan failed they would have won a great victory if a republic will stand or fall on the fate of any single man it finds itself in grave danger indeed lee observed but ewell said our republic is in great danger as well you know sir we would be in graver danger still were it not for your andries rhoodie and his fellows when meade sent sedgwick west with the vi corps when custer went haring off toward charlottesville i would have shifted the entire army to meet them had rhoodie not warned me of a possible cavalry thrust south from elys ford but fitz lee was sitting there waiting for the bold kilpatrick stuart said with the smile of a cat who has caught his canary general killcavalry killed a good many of his yankees by spotsylvania court house im delighted fitz lee was there lee said thinking kind thoughts about his nephew so am i stuart said also there was rhoodies friend konrad de buys general lee that man is wilder in battle than any of stand waties red indians in the transmississippi he awed me damn me if he didnt any man about whom a warrior like stuart would say such a thing had to be a man indeed lee said i wondered how the rivington men would fare but i wonder more how rhoodie and de buys knew kilpatrick was coming general ewell you say the army of the potomac feinted to the west to draw your attention to your left wing and that the feint was competently executed ewells pale eyes turned inward as he pondered that very competently sedgwicks as good a corps commander as the federals have and custerwhat can i say about custer save that he wishes he were jeb stuart stuart smiled again a smile the brighter for peeping out through his forest of brown beard under normal circumstances you might have been deceived then general ewell at least long enough for kilpatrick to slip past you and make for richmond lee asked ewell nodded and you had picked up nothing from spies and agents to warn you kilpatrick might be on the move ewell nodded once more lee plucked at his beard how did rhoodie know why dont you ask him sir jeb stuart said i think i shall lee said walter taylor stuck his head into lees tent mr rhoodie is here to see you sir thank you major have him come in rhoodie pushed his way through the tent flap with his height and wide shoulders he seemed to fill up the space the canvas enclosed lee rose to greet him and shake his hand have a seat mr rhoodie will you take a little blackberry wine the bottle is right there beside you if you are having some i wouldnt mind thank you i believe i set out two glasses would you be kind enough to pour sir ah thank you your very good health lee took a small sip he was pleased to see rhoodie toss off half his glass at a swallow wine might help loosen the fellows tongue he said from what general ewell tells me the confederacy finds itself in your debt once more without your timely warning kilpatricks raiders might have done far worse than they actually succeeded in accomplishing so they might rhoodie finished his wine i am pleased to help in any way i can can i fill you up again general no thank you not yet but by all means help yourself lee took another sip to indicate he was not far behind rhoodie he nodded imperceptibly to himself when the big man did pour again as a fisherman will when his bait is taken he said interesting how you got wind of kilpatricks plans when the rest of the army would have been hoodwinked by meades motion toward our left rhoodie looked smug we have our ways general lee marvelously good ones they must be too as with your rifles they altogether outdistance that which anyone else may hope to accomplish but how do you know what you know mr rhoodie be assured that i ask in the most friendly way imaginable my chief concern is to be able to form a judgment of your reliability so i may know how far i may count on it in the crises which surely lie ahead as i think i told you once before general my friends and i can find out whatever we think important enough to know yes rhoodie was smug lee said that hardly appears open to question sir not after your repeaters your desiccated foodsthough i wish you might find a way to provide us with more of the latterand now your ability to ferret out the federals plans but i did not ask what you could do i asked how you did it the difference is small but i think it important isee suddenly andries rhoodies face showed nothing at all save a polite mask behind which any thoughts whatever might form seeing that mask lee knew he had been foolish to hope to loosen this mans tongue with a couple of glasses of homemade wine after a small but noticeable pause the big man with the odd accent said even if i were to tell you i fear you would not believe meyou would be more likely to take me for a madman or a liar madmen may babble of wonderful weapons but they do not as a rule produce themcertainly not in carload lots lee said as for whether you speak the truth well say what you have to say and let me be the judge of that rhoodies poker face hid whatever calculations were going on behind it at last he said all right general lee i will my friends and ieveryone who belongs to america will breakcome from a hundred and fifty years in your future he folded his arms across his broad chest and waited to see what lee would make of that lee opened his mouth to reply then closed it again while he did some thinking of his own he did not know what he had expected rhoodie to say but the big mans calm assertion was nothing he had imagined he studied rhoodie wondering if he had made a joke if he had his face did not show it lee said if that be sonote i say ifthen why have you come i told you that the day i met you to help the confederacy win this war and gain its freedom have you any proof of what you allege lee asked now rhoodie smiled rather coldly general lee if you can match the ak anywhere in the year then i am the greatest liar since ananias lee plucked at his beard he himself had brought up the excellence of rhoodies equipment but had not thought that very excellence might be evidence they were from out of time now he considered the notion what would napoleon have thought of locomotives to carry whole armies more than a hundred miles in the course of a day of steampowered ironclads of rifled artillery of rifle muskets with interchangeable parts common enough for every soldier to carry one and napoleon was less than fifty years dead and had rampaged across russia while lee was a small boy who could say what progress another century and a half would bring andries rhoodie might to his own surprise lee realized he believed the big man rhoodie was simply too strange in too many ways to belong to the nineteenth century if you intend to see the confederate states independent mr rhoodie you would have been of more aid had you chosen to visit us sooner lee said tacitly acknowledging his acceptance of rhoodies claim i know that general lee i wish we could have come sooner too believe me but our time machine travels back and forth exactly one hundred fifty years no more no less we did not manage to obtain even the small one we havesteal it not to mince wordsuntil just a few months agojust a few months ago up in that is still all is not lostfar from it another year and a half and it would have been too late those few sentences held so much meat that lee needed a little time to take it in by itself the idea of travel through time was enough to bemuse him he also had to come to grips with the notion of two stations in timein his minds eye he saw them as train stations with an overhang to keep passengers dry in the raineach moving forward yet always separated from the other by so many years just as richmond and orange court house each moved as the earth rotated on its axis yet always remained separated from the other by so many miles not content with those conceptions rhoodie had saved the most important for last you tell me lee said slowly that absent your intervention the united states would succeed in conquering us general lee i am afraid i do tell you that are you so startled to hear it no lee admitted with a sigh saddened yes but not startled the enemy has always put me in mind of a man with a strong body but a weak head our southern body is weak but our head sir our head is filled with fire still they may find wisdom while we have ever more difficulty maintaining what strength they have they force themselves upon us do they when all we ever wanted was to leave in peace and live in peace they do just that rhoodie said grimly they force you to free your kaffirsyour niggers i meanat the point of a bayonet then set them over you with the bayonet still there to make you bow down the southern white man is ruined absolutely and the southern white womanno i wont go on that is why we had to steal our time machine sir the white mans cause is so hated in times to come that we could obtain it by no other means there was one question answered before lee had the chance to ask it he sadly shook his head i had not looked for such not even from those people president lincoln always struck me as true to his principles however much i may disagree with those in his second term he shows what he really is he does not aim to stand for election after that so he need not mask himself any longer and thaddeus stevens who comes after him is even worse that i believe lee wondered at rhoodies claims for lincoln but thaddeus stevens had always been a passionate abolitionist his mouth was so thin and straight that but for its bloodlessness it reminded lee of a knife gash set a stevens over the prostrate south and any horror was conceivable lee went on somewhere though in your world of no it would be nowsympathy for our lost cause must remain or you would not be here so it does im proud to say rhoodie answered even if it is not as much as it should be niggers still lord it over white southern men because they have done it for so long they think it is their right the bloody kaffirs lord it over south africa too my own homelandover the white men who built the country up from nothing there are even blacks in england millions of them and blacks in parliament if you can believe it how do i know i can believe any of what you say lee asked i have not been to the future to see it for myself i have only your word that it is as you assert if you want them general lee i can bring you documents and pictures that make the slave revolt in santo domingo look like a sunday picnic i will be happy to give you those but general let me ask you this why would my friends and i be here if these things were not as i say there you have me mr rhoodie lee admitted now he finished his glass of wine and poured another though it warmed his body it left his heart cold thaddeus stevens president i had not thought the northerns hated us so much as that they might as well have chosen john brown were he yet alive just so rhoodie said you captured john brown didnt you yes i was proud to be an officer of the united states army then i wish i had never found the need to leave that service but i could not lead its soldiers against virginia he studied rhoodie as if the man were a map to a country he had never seen but where he would soon have to campaign fair enough the future was just such a country normally no man had a map into it everyone traveled blind but nowmr rhoodie you are saying are you not that you know the course this war will take i know the course the war took general we hope to change that course with our aks we have already changed it in a small way kilpatricks raid would have penetrated much further into virginia and caused much more damage and alarm had it not been for usand for the valor of your troopers i understand your konrad de buys showed uncommon valor of his own lee said rhoodie nodded ive talked with him he enjoyed himself theres no room for cavalry in our timetoo much artillery too many armored machines it is well that war is so terrible or we should get too fond of it lee said i am glad to hear the horses at least are out of harms way in time to come they cannot choose to go into battle as men do true enough rhoodie said lee thought for a while before he spoke again you say you think you have as yet affected the course of the war in only a small way yes rhoodies poker face had disappeared he was studying lee as hard as lee studied him and not bothering to hide it lee felt as if he were back at west point not as superintendent but as student he had to assume rhoodie knew everything about him that history recorded while he knewcould knowonly what rhoodie chose to reveal of himself his organization and his purposes picking words with great care lee said then you will have knowledge of the opening events of the coming years campaign but your knowledge thereafter will decrease as our victories should we have such deflect events away from the path they would have taken without your intervention is my understanding accurate yes general lee you understand as well as any man could my friends and i hope and expect that with the confederate states a bulwark of freedom and strength the white mans cause all through the world will be stronger than in our own sorry history as may be lee said with a shrug bear with me a moment further though if you would it follows from what you have said that our generals including myself will need to be informed as exactly as possible on the situation of the federals in front of them at the moment the campaigning season resumes that we may extract the maximum advantage from what you know i will draft you an appreciation of what the army of the potomac plans to do rhoodie said one of our people will do the same for general johnston in regard to the army of the tennessee other fronts will be less important yes johnston and i have our countrys two chief field armies i look forward to receiving your appreciation mr rhoodie it may well give me an important edge as the years campaign opens afterwards i gather things will have changed and we shall have to rely on the valor of the men the army of northern virginia has never failed me there you can rely on one other thing now rhoodie said lee looked a question at him he said the ak oh certainly lee said you see how i am already coming to take it for granted mr rhoodie now i have answers to some of the matters which have perplexed me for a long while thank you for giving them to me my pleasure general rhoodie stood to go lee also rose as he did so the pain that sometimes clogged his chest struck him a stinging blow he tried to bear up under it but it must have shown on his face for rhoodie took a step toward him and asked are you all right general yes lee said though he needed an effort to force the word past his teeth he gathered himself yes i am all right mr rhoodie thank you i ceased to be a young man some years ago from time to time my body insists on reminding me of the fact i shall last as long as i am required i assure you rhoodie he realized must know the yearperhaps the day and hourin which he was to die that was a question he did not intend to put to the rivington man about some things one was better ignorant then it occurred to him that if the course of battles and nations was mutable so small a thing as a single lifespan must also be the thought cheered him he did not care to be only a figure in a dusty text pinned down as immovably as a butterfly in a naturalists collection is it your heart general rhoodie asked my chest at any rate the doctors know no more than that which i could tell them for myself doctors in my time can do quite a lot better general lee i can bring you medicine that may really help you ill see to it as soon as i can with the campaign coming up we want you as well as you can be you are too kind sir yes rhoodie knew lees allotted number of days could change he wanted to make sure they didnt unexpectedly shorten even that possibility made lee feel freer he thought of something else may i ask you an unrelated question mr rhoodie of course rhoodie was the picture of polite attentiveness these negroes you mentioned who were elected to the british parliamentwhat manner of legislators do they make and how were they elected if i may ask by other negroes voting mostly yes but to the shame of the english some deluded whites sank low enough to vote for them as well as for what sort of members they make theyre what youd expect they always push for more for the niggers not that they dont have too much already if they were elected to stand for their people how are they to be blamed for carrying out that charge storm clouds came over andries rhoodies face lee said well mr rhoodie its neither here nor there thank you once more for all of this youve given me a great deal to think on further and i do want to see that plan of what general meade will attempt once off the topic of negroes rhoodie relaxed again it will be general grant sir he said will it so they will name him lieutenant general then such has been rumored yes they will in just a week or so and he will come east to fight in virginia most interesting lee frowned looked sharply at rhoodie the day you first came to this camp sir you spoke of general sherman as commanding in the west and major taylor corrected you you were thinking of the time when operations would commence werent you i remember that general lee yes i was and so i slipped he nodded and ducked his way out of the tent after a couple of minutes lee stepped outside too rhoodie was riding back to orange court house lee started to call his aides then stopped to consider whether he wanted them to know the rivington men were from out of time he decided he didnt the fewer ears that heard that secret the better he went back inside sat down once more at his work table he reached out for that second glass of blackberry wine he had poured finished it with two quick swallows he seldom drank two glasses of wine especially in the early afternoon but he needed something to steady his nerves men from the future to say it was to find it laughable to deal with andries rhoodie with the new repeaters in almost everyones hands now with the small square ammunition crates growing to tall pyramids by every regiments munitions wagons with the occasional shipments of desiccated food that helped keep hunger from turning to starvation was to believe the creaky machinery of the presentday confederate states could not have produced such quantities of even ordinary arms and foodstuffs let alone the wonders at rhoodies beck and call lee thought about general grant in the west hed shown both straightahead slugging and no small skill from what rhoodie said he would win here too defeat the indomitable army of northern virginia we shall see about that lee said aloud though no one was in the tent to hear him here you go first sergeant preston kelly said theyre most as good as new nate caudell tried on the shoes kelly had repaired he walked a few steps smiled broadly yup thats licked it the cold doesnt blow in between the soles and the uppers anymore thank you kindly pity you cant do more a good many of us dont even have shoes to repair these days are you the only shoemaker in the regiment heard tell theres another one mongst the alamance minute men kelly answered couldnt rightly swear to it though them boys from company k they still stick close to themselves after all this time alamance county lay a fair ways west of wake nash franklin and granville which provided most of the manpower for the regiments other nine companies so they do caudell said come to that i wish you were in my company preston the invincibles would all be better shod if you were might could be but then my boys from company cd be worse kelly spat a brown stream of tobacco juice onto the ground when you aint noways got enough to go around first sergeant some poor bastard always has to do without isnt that the sad and sorry truth caudell said well thanks again for finding the time for me wasnt but a little repair with more nailin than new leather you keep your gear in good shape not like some folks as let things fall to pieces fore they fetch em in to be fixed hell if i had more leather an there was five of me wed be fine far as shoes go that was one of the smaller ifs caudell had heard through the long hungry winter he waved goodbye to the shoemaker and headed back to his own companys area the parade ground was full of men watching two base ball nines go at each other he decided to watch for a while himself the bat was handcarved and the ball even seen from a distance imperfectly round but the players didnt mind the pitcher underhanded his missile toward the batter who took a lusty swing and missed the catcher caught the ball on the first bounce and tossed it back to his battery mate the pitcher delivered again the batter connected this time launching the ball high but not far mortar shot somebody yelled yall take cover get out your bumbershootsthat onell bring rain somebody else said the shortstop circled under the ball catch it iverson his teammates screamed the shortstop did catch it everyone cheered except the batter who had run to first base in the confident expectation he would be able to stay there he kicked at the dirt as he left caudell didnt blame him with a muddy holestrewn field to traverse catching a ball barehanded was anything but easy another batter came up after taking a couple of pitches he connected solidly if the earlier pop had come from a mortar this ball was blasted out of the brass muzzle of a twelvepounder napoleon it also flew straight to the shortstop he leaped high in the air and speared it the watching soldiers went wild the batter flipped his club away in disgust the shortstop threw the ball to the pitcher then rubbed his hands on the ragged seat of his trousersthat one had stung is that iverson longmire from company g caudell asked the man next to him hes something to watch thats him the private answered yeah hes a demon baseballer aint he after those two quick outs four straight hits fell in and two runs scored then another ball this one on the ground went to the intrepid longmire caudell waited for him to gobble it up and throw it to first base but at the last instant it kicked up off a pebble and hit him right between the legs he went down in a heap clutching at himself two more runners crossed the plateactually a piece of wood from an ak crate the men who had cheered longmire to the skies laughed until they had to hang on to each other to stay on their feet that was enough baseball for caudell he went past captain lewiss tent and the company banner a few soldiers leaned against their huts more than one was stripping an ak and putting it back together again the fascination with the new repeaters had not worn off in the month since theyd been issued hello melvin caudell said seeing mollie bean outside her cabin she was feeding rounds into a banana clip hello first sergeant she answered reckon were gonna get ourselves some yankees fore too long caudell took a step he squelched in mud thanks to the work hed just had done it didnt soak his toes all the same he said my guess is we wont move for a while yet unless the yanks try something sneaky marching on muddy roads wears a man down too much for good fighting afterwards or even a woman he thought remembering to whom he was talking she said youre likely right comin back from gettysburg in the rain wasnt nothin but slog slog slog till a body wanted to fall down dead at the end of a day makes me tired just remembering caudell agreed the th north carolina had been part of the rear guard at falling rivers maryland as the army of northern virginia drew back into its home state and had lost many men captured because they could not keep up all at once mollie bean became intensely interested in the ak magazine in her lap bending her head down over it i need to see you first sergeant someone said from behind caudell he turned lifted his hat yes sir what is it captain lewis walk with me lewis said caudell obeyed matching his pace to the captains slow and halting strides lewis went by mollie bean without the least notice of her with her head down the brim of her cap hid her face from him caudell smiled to himself she was expert at such small concealments after a few steps lewis went on we have to get the most we can out of these new repeaters certainly sir i think that means thinning our firing lines lewis said with these rifles we dont need to stand shoulder to shoulder to put out a large volume of fire the more widely we space ourselves out the more front we can cover and the smaller the target each individual man presents to the enemy sounds good to me sir caudell said at once we were packed together so tight in the charge at gettysburg i still think its a wonder all of us didnt get shot the more space between us for the bullets to go by the better space for the bullets to go by lewis echoed musingly i like that you have a way with words first sergeant thank you sir caudell said thinking that if he did it was because he wrote so many of them for other people as with anything else practice made them come easier lewis said you hit on something important there if a skirmish line will let us hold our position or advance as we might have before with a full firing line that frees up the rest to move round the enemys flank or probe his line for weaknesses when we next go into the field well have to maneuver accordingly some drill with more widely spaced lines would seem to be in order ill see to it sir caudell said george lewis hadnt been a teacher before the warhed dabbled in politicsbut two years as an officer had taught him full respect for drill and practice good he said now pass the word on to the sergeants and corporals in battle well often be maneuvering by squads so theyre the ones who will have to be able to put the men through the proper paces ill see to it caudell said again im sure you will carry on first sergeant lewis limped away a determined man whod settled one piece of business but had many more to see to nate caudell lacked the captains abrupt decisiveness he stood scratching his chin for several seconds wondering whether he should head straight back to his cabin and tell whichever of his messmates happened to be there what the captain had said at last he decided not to hed see them all together at supper and tell them then tomorrow morning would be time for corporals lewiswho was no relation to the captainand massey having made up his mind thus he ran into otis massey not five minutes later makes sense to me first sergeant massey said when caudell was through relaying captain lewiss words course rememberin it when them damnyankees is shootin at us might could take a bit o doin thats why we practice it beforehand caudell said patiently massey shifted his chaw from one cheek to the other which made him look for a moment like a sheep chewing its cud yeah reckon so hed always been a good soldier that was how hed got himself promoted he was slower to grasp that as corporal he was responsible for his whole squad not just himself caudell walked down to his hut he was about to go in when he saw a black man in confederate grey going by with an ak slung on his back how you doin georgie he called george ballentine looked to see who was talking to him is right well first sergeant suh he answered how you be im all right caudell answered so the boys in company h let you have one of the new repeaters did they yassuh they did is a regular noth carolina tiger i is ballentine said ifn i goes to the fightin with food or some such i gets to shoot back if the yankees shoots at me youve got a better rifle there than your master ever dreamed of hed have one too if he hadnt run away on us caudell said ballentine had come to the regiment as bodyguard to addison holland of company h holland was a deserter six months gone now ballentine had stayed with the north carolina tigers as company cook tailor and general handyman caudell wondered about that why didnt you take off too georgie we havent caught your master yet odds are we never would have got you something changed in the black mans face all at once it became a fortress to guard the thoughts behind it though he owned no slaves himself caudell had seen that guarded look on other mens negroes many times don wanna be no runaway ballentine said caudell thought that would end the conversation the black man had said what a black man had to say to get by in a white mans world but ballentine chose to elaborate is just about like a free man now the men they treats me like one o them i don belong to nobody in particularjus about as good as not belongin tnobody at all like you say i even gots this here nice gun hows i gonna do bettern that runnin away go north was the unspoken thought in caudells mind it had to be in george ballentines too but risks went with it if a confederate picket spotted him trying to cross the rapidan he was dead the other thing that struck caudell was how much ballentines answer reminded him of mollie beans neither had any prospects to speak of in the outside world both had found in the army niches that suited them and people who cared about them company h is lucky to have you georgie caudell said they dont have to eat their own bad cooking ballentines dark face split in a grin ki thats a natural fact first sergeant suh some o them fellas they burns water if they tries to cook it i gots to go nowgot me some chickens to stew up chickens where caudell had been mildly envious of the north carolina tigers before now greeneyed jealousy woke to full clamor whered you come up with chickens georgie as me no questions i tells you no lies the black man said smugly he strutted on back toward his own company visibly proud of his talent as a forager a horse came trotting off the road south from orange court house into the regimental encampment aboard it was benny lang he pulled the animal up short in front of caudell his lean face was twisted with fury he stabbed a forefinger in the direction of george ballentines back you first sergeant what the bleeding hell is that fucking kaffir doing with an ak answer me damn you hes not in my company so i cant answer you exactly mr lang caudell said speaking as carefully as if the rivington man were an officer whose bloody company is he in then lang demanded company h sir caudell said he explained how ballentine had come to be there and how he had stayed with the company after addison holland abandoned it im sure its all right in a pigs arse it is teach a kafa niggerto use a weapon and next thing you know hell be aiming at you company h you say whos captain there that would be captain mitchell sir captain sidney mitchell i am going to have a small chat with captain sidney fucking mitchell then first sergeant well see if he lets a nigger touch a weapon after that by god he jerked savagely on the reins to turn the horse dug his heels into its sides the animal let out an angry neigh and bounded off space showed between the saddle and langs backside at every stride he was anything but a polished rider but he clung to his seat with grim determination rufus daniel came out of the cabin along with caudell he watched benny langs furious ride i take back what i told you a while ago nate daniel said wouldnt want him for overseer after allhe purely hates niggers thatd bring a farm nothin but grief georgie ballentine i druther have him alongside me n half the white men in this company me too caudell took off his hat so he could scratch his head lang hates niggers as if theyd done something to him personally not justyou know what i mean reckon i do daniel said hardly a white man in the south failed to look down on blacks but the two races lived and worked side by side they saw each other dealt with each other every day caudell could think of nothing likelier to spark a slave revolt than all whites displaying the ferocity benny lang showed you know i hope captain mitchell tells him where to get off caudell said he had no great love for negroes himself but george ballentine was part of the fabric of the regiment in a way benny lang could never be dont think hell do it daniel said morosely them rivington fullers theyre where the repeaters n cartridges come from aint smart to rile em stacked against that poor georgies a small fish caudell sighed im afraid youre right rufus laughter and shouts of fury mixed with harsh coughs came from behind him he whirled around when he saw a cabin with smoke billowing out its door and windows his first thought was that it had caught on fire then he noticed the flat board placed over the top of the chimney it wasnt a fire it was a prank to confirm that the evident prankster stood a few feet away from his handiwork laughing so hard he could barely stand up that was unwise three men had been in the cabin and they set on him with intent to maim his laughter abruptly turned to cries of pain goddam fool rufus daniel said yup well wed better get em apart caudell raised his voice to a shout you there thats enough break it up he and daniel ran toward the combatants break it up i tell you the three turned loose the one now he could hardly stand because hed been badly knocked around rufus daniel put hands on hips stared scornfully at the battered private well gideon looks to me like you got bout what you deserve gideon bass felt cautiously under his right eye it was already purpling hed have a fine shiner tomorrow but a grin quickly crept back onto his face he was only nineteen an age when a man is often willing to suffer for his art oh but werent it a hell of a fine smudge sarge he said caudell turned on the three men who had been smoked out one had just taken the offending board off the chimney and was sidling around toward the back of the cabin caudells cough froze the wouldbe escapee in his tracks nice try john he said now come on back as nonchalantly as he could john floyd rejoined david leonard and emelius pullen caudell glared at all three of them you dont go beating on your mates you seen what he done first sergeant floyd protested his voice had an upcountry twang to it he and leonard were from davidson county a long way west of caudells home i saw it caudell said you all should have just grabbed him and let sergeant daniel and me deal with him we would have i promise you that he turned to daniel what shall we do with em now up to you nate but i dont reckon tomfoolerys worth takin to the captain daniel said these three done breathed smoke awhile and this uns got a set o lumps you ask me its even fair enough caudell said after a pause intended to convey that he was going along with the suggestion only out of the goodness of his heart when that pause had sunk in he added this had better be the end of it if theres a next time youll all be sorry understand yes first sergeant the miscreants intoned with unctuous sincerity why dont yall go someplace else for a while gideon rufus daniel put in someplace a good ways away i mean and stay there till suppertime bass strode away as he rounded a corner caudell heard him guffaw he rolled his eyes what are we going to do with him hope nobody wrings his fool neck till the fightin starts that oughta settle him down some maybe daniel said hope dempsey dont hear about this too otherwise we uns is gonna get smudged one fine day one fine day soon caudell said dempsey eure loved mischief other thing is dempseys too smart to stand around waiting for us to come out and beat on him hed turn up an hour later looking all innocent and wed never be able to prove a thing rufus daniel grinned wed git him anyways he sounded as if he were looking forward to it when sunday morning rolled around caudell joined most of the regiment at divine services chaplain william lacy was a presbyterian while the majority of the men he servedcaudell among themwere baptists but he had proved himself a good and pious man which counted for more than differences in creed let us bend our heads in prayer he said may god remember our beloved confederacy and keep it safe may he lift up his hand and smite that of the oppressor and may our true patriots in gray withstand their test with bravery amen caudell said he added a silent prayer of his own for general lee lacy said i will take as my text today romans we know that all things work together for good to them that love god we see it illustrated in the events of the past few weeks when our army came short of success at gettysburg many may have suffered a loss of faith that our cause would triumph but now god has delivered into our hands these fine new repeaters with which to renew the fight and through them he will deliver into our hands the yankees who seek to subjugate us you tell em preacher a soldier called lacy paced back and forth as he warmed to his sermon he was a tall lean man with a neat beard and cleanshaven upper lip he wore a black coat of almost knee length with green olive branches embroidered on each sleeve to show his calling in times of peace the coming of a new rifle could hardly be taken as a sign of gods love he said but here and now when we battle for the freedom which is more precious than life itself how can we view the arrival of these aks as anything save providential thats right a man said another shouted these here repeaters is gonna let us give the yankees hell the chaplain went on in that vein for a few more minutes then called up soldiers who helped him pass out hymn books to the rest of the men he didnt have enough to go around but almost all the soldiers knew the hymns by heart anyhow well start today with rock of agespage fortyseven for those of you with hymnals he said i want to hear you put your hearts into it todaymake a joyful noise unto the lord caudells voice rose with the rest the men sang enthusiastically there were enough of them that good voices and poor mostly blended together as the last notes of the hymn died away though caudell looked around in puzzlement something was missing but he could not place what it was lacy noticed nothing wrong amazing grace nowpage ah fiftyone in the army hymn book amazing grace was harder to sing than rock of ages which required little more than vigor maybe that was why halfway through the hymn caudell figured out what had bothered him before his own singing faltered as he looked around again this time for someone in particular he did not see him the hymn ended in the distance another regimentprobably the th north carolina whose camp was closest to that of the thwas singing the old rugged cross caudell turned to the private next to him wheres georgie ballentine huh the nigger aint he here the fellow said no he caudell had to stop for the regiment launched into praise god from whom all blessings flow he looked around once more while he sang no ballentine wasnt here his ears had already told him thatthe black mans molassessmooth baritone anchored the regiments singing week in and week out for be never missed a service caudell spotted a corporal from the north carolina tigers close by when the hymn was done he caught his eye wheres georgie henry is he sick henry johnson shook his head made a sour face nope he aint sick he done run off day before yesterday run off georgie caudell stared at him i dont believe it he stopped and thought no wait a minute maybe i do did they take his rifle away from him you heard tell about that did you johnson said capn mitchell he didnt want to but that benny lang feller he pitched a fit like you wouldnt believe said hed go to colonel faribault an then to general kirkland and then to general heth an all the way up to jeff davis till he got his waymaybe on up to the holy ghost if ol jeff wouldnt give him what he wanted georgie he took it right hard but there werent nothin he could do werent nothin nobody could do afterwards though he seemed to settle on down some but he wasnt there at roll call yesterday mornin so he mustve been shammin you know how niggers can do just then chaplain lacy called page fiftysix mennearer my god to thee caudell sang mechanically while he thought about what johnson had said of course blacks grew adept at hiding their thoughts from whites they had to if they wanted to stay out of trouble but george ballentine had been so at home in company hcaudell shook his head the joy had gone out of the service when nearer my god to thee was done henry johnson said you know i hope ol georgie makes it over the rapidan to the yankees an i dont give a damn who hears me say so even a nigger hes got his pride yup caudell said instead of waiting for the next hymn he drifted away from the openair assembly johnson had hit the nail on the head not giving george ballentine a repeater in the first place would have been one thing but to give him one and then take it awaythat was wrong he hoped ballentine made it over the rapidan to freedom too but the slaves luck as a runaway was no better than his luck with the ak had been three days later a wagon came squelching down the muddy highway from orange court house in the late afternoon it wasnt a scheduled stop you have a load of those desiccated dinners for us caudell called hopefully as the driver pulled off the main road no just a dead niggerpicket shot him up by the rapidan station he was headin for the river hear tell he likely belongs to this regiment the driver jumped down and lowered the rear gate want to see if its him caudell hurried over peered in george ballentine lay limp and dead on the planks without even a cloth over his staring eyes the lower part of his gray tunic was soaked with blood hed been shot in the belly a hard hard way to die caudell clicked his tongue between his teeth yeah thats georgie you gonna take charge of him take him over to company h why dont you he belonged to them caudell pointed the way i expect theyll want to give him a proper burial what the hell for he was a goddam runaway just do it caudell snapped as if by accident he brushed a hand against his sleeve to call attention to his chevrons the driver spat in the roadway but he obeyed caudells guess had been shrewd the north carolina tigers even went so far as to ask chaplain lacy to officiate at the funeral and he agreed that told caudell what the chaplain thought of the negros reasons for running away driven by guilt caudell went to the funeral toohad he not told lang who ballentine was and where he belonged the black man would still be alive lacy chose a verse from psalm the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether caudell wondered about that he saw no evidence of divine wrath in ballentines death only the wrath of benny lang it did not seem an adequate substitute he thought about talking things over with the chaplain but ended up talking with mollie bean instead however fine a man william lacy was he was also an official part of the th north carolina caudell didnt feel comfortable discussing georgie ballentines fate with anyone official mollies place in the regiment was even less official than the negros had been aint nothin to be done about it now she said a self evident truth i know that it gravels me all the same he said it wasnt fair life aint fair nate she answered you was a woman youd know that you ever work in a bawdyhouse youd sure as shit know that her face clouded as if at memories shed have sooner forgotten then that wry smile of hers tugged one comer of her mouth upwards hell first sergeant caudell sir you was a private youd know that maybe i would he said startled into brief laughter but just as mollie could not stay gloomy he had trouble remaining cheerful i expect id know it if i were a nigger too georgie sure found out niggers aint the same as white folks they saythey just go on from day to day dont worry none about stuff like that sure people say that ive said it myself plenty of rimes but if its true why did georgie run off when they took his repeater away corporal johnsons words came back to caudell even a nigger hes got his pride i know what you mean nate but georgie he didnt seem like your regular nigger mollie said he just seemed like peopleyou know what i mean yup caudell said i felt the same way about him thats why he bothers me so much now ballentine had seemed like a person to caudell not just some digger because hed got to know him in the same way mollie seemed like a person to him not just some whorebecause hed got to know her he kept that part of his thought to himself but went on in musing tones maybe a lot of niggers seem like people to somebody who knows them maybe but mollie sounded dubious some though you got to sell south and thats the truth they aint nothin but trouble to their own selves an everybody around em thats true enough but you know what else caudell waited for her to shake her head then said if billy beddingfield was black id sell him south in a minute too she giggled and that benny lang he knocked billy sideways so theres one up for him to go with the one down for georgie i hadnt thought of that its not as big an up as georgie is a down not even close but its there reckon it goes to show nobodys all good or all bad you got that right he brung us the repeaters too to whup the yankees with so he did that has to count for something i suppose right then caudell did not care to give benny lang any points but he was too just to find a way around it mollie looked at him out of the comer of her eye did you just fall by to chat nate or did you have somethin else on your mind i hadnt thought about anything else but as long as im here robert e lee took off his reading glasses slid them into his breast pocket so lieutenant general grant will go through the wilderness will he i had rather expected him to try to duplicate mcclellans campaign up the james toward richmond it is the shortest route to the capital given the federals regrettable control of the sea he will send the army of the potomac through the wilderness general at the beginning of may as ive written there andries rhoodie said positively his aim is not so much richmond as your army if richmond falls while the army of northern virginia lives the confederacy can stay alive but if your army is beaten richmond will fall afterwards lee thought about that nodded in concession it is sound strategy and accords with the way grant fought in the west very well then i shall deploy my forces so as to be waiting for him when he arrives no you mustnt general lee rhoodie sounded so alarmed lee stared at him in sharp surprise if he knows youve moved and are lying in wait for him he can choose to attack by way of fredericksburg instead or up the james or any other way he pleases what i know only stays true if what leads up to it stays the same isee lee said slowly after a few seconds he laughed at himself here id always imagined no general could have a greater advantage than knowing exactly what his opponent would do next now i know and find myself unable to take full advantage of the knowledge for fear of his doing something else because i have prepared for this one thing thinking of what is to be as mutable comes hard to me it comes hard to almost everyone rhoodie assured him lee tapped with his forefinger the papers rhoodie had given him by these i am to have general longstreets corps returned to me from tennessee before the campaign commences i am glad to see that would have happened for otherwise i should have been leery of requesting it lest in so doing i disrupt the chain of events ahead yet were i without it the army of the potomac would have overwhelming weight of numbers may i suggest general that when it does come next month you station it around jacksons shop or orange springs rather than farther west at gordonsville rhoodie said as the fight developed longstreets men nearly came too late because they had so far to travel will this change not make grant change his plans in response lee asked the risk i think is small right now grant doesnt look at the wilderness as a place to fight only a place to get through as fast as possible so he can battle your army on open ground hell be wondering if you will choose to fight anywhere this side of richmond is that a fact lee meant the phrase as nothing but a polite conversational placeholder but rhoodie nodded all the same smiling a huntsmans smile lee said i expect we shant keep him long in suspense as to that point sir the ak s should also be an unpleasant surprise for him rhoodie said i should have attacked without them lee said where better than the wilderness in the forest and undergrowth the federals superiority in artillery is nullifiedthere are few places for it to deploy and few good targets at which to aim and my soldiers farmers most of them are better woodsmen than the yankees yes mr rhoodie if general grant wishes to allow a fight there i shall be happy to oblige him i know that rhoodie said yes you would wouldnt you lee looked down at those irresistibly fascinating papers will you excuse me now sir i confess i feel the need to study these further certainly rhoodie stood to go then he said oh i almost forgot and reached into a pants pocket he handed lee a bottle of small white tabletsif your heart pains you let one or two of these dissolve under your tongue they should help they may bring a spot of headache with them but it shouldnt last long thank you sir youre most kind to have thought of it lee put his glasses back on so he could read the bottles labelnitroglycerine hmm it sounds most forbiddingly medical i can tell you that eryes rhoodies inscrutable expression made his face unreadable as he said it is among other things useful in stimulating the heart and now general if you will excuse me he ducked out under the tent flap lee stuck the jar in a coat pocket he forgot it in moments as he resumed his study of the information andries rhoodie had given him here a month and more in advance he read the ford by which each federal division would cross the rapidan and the road south it would take altogether without such intelligence he had smashed the yankees the year before at chancellorsville on the eastern fringes of the wilderness with it if i cannot whip general grant with what is in these papers he said to no one in particular i am willing to go home a few minutes later perry brought in lees dinner set it on the table in front of him and hurried away he did not notice the black man enter or leave the food sat a long time untouched lees eyes went back and forth from rhoodies documents to the map spread out on the cot beside him but his mind did not see the names of units or the symbols that represented roads and hamlets his mind saw marching men and flashing guns and patterns of collision lee slid off traveller the horses grassy earthy smell mingled with the perfume of dogwoods at last in blossom spring had taken a long time coming but was finally here in full force sergeant b l wynn came out of the hut that housed the confederate signal station on clarks mountain good morning to you sergeant lee said pleasantly morning sir wynn answered his voice casuallee was a frequent visitor to the station to see for himself what the federals across the rapidan were up to then the young sergeants eyes went wide uh sirs he amended quickly lee smiled yes sergeant ive brought rather more company than usual with me today he paused to enjoy his own understatement not only were his young staff officers along but also all three of the army of northern virginias corps commanders and a double handful of division heads i want them to get a view of the terrain from the mountaintop here by western standards this isnt much of a mountain james longstreet said how high are we anyhow i dont quite know lee admitted sergeant wynn about eleven hundred feet sir wynn said longstreets fleshy cheeks rippled in a snort eleven hundred feet in tennessee or north carolinahis home statethis wouldnt be a mountain they might call it a knob in the rockies they wouldnt notice it was there it suffices for our purposes nonetheless lee said standing here we can see twenty counties spread out below us as if on the map sergeant wynn may i trouble you for your spyglass wynn handed him the long brass tube he raised it to his right eye peered northward over the rapidan the winter encampment of federal general warrens v corps centered on culpeper court house leaped toward him smoke floated up from chimneys bright divisional flags bloomed like orderly rows of spring flowers grant had his headquarters by culpeper court house a couple of miles further east by stevensburg lay winfield scott hancocks ii corps the encampment of sedgwicks vi corps was beyond it past brandy stationlee thought for a moment of rooney returned at last to confederate service farther north and east past rappahannock station and bealeton were the cabins and tents of ambrose burnsides ix corps with the army of the potomac but not formally part of it colored troops made up a good part of that corps lee had heard he lowered the telescope all seems quiet still in the federal camps soon enough though those people will move he pointed east toward the rank green growth of the wilderness they will come by way of the fords there germanna and elys just east of it you sound very sure longstreet said of all lees generals he was most given to setting his own judgments against his commanders i think i should have suspected it in any case but i also have intelligence i regard as trustworthy on the matter from the rivington men lee left it at that had he explained that andries rhoodie and his colleagues came from the future and thus could view grants plans through hindsight rather than guesswork he was sure most of the assembled officers would have thought him mad maybe he was but any other explanation seemed even more improbable than the one rhoodie had given him ah the rivington men longstreet said if their ear for news is as good as their repeaters then it must be very good indeed one day before long general lee at your convenience id like to sit down with you and chat about the rivington men had the i corps not spent the winter in tennessee id have done it long since certainly general lee said i want to be part of that chat a p hill said his thin fierce face had an indrawn look to it the past year or so hed had a bad way of taking sick when battle neared lee worried about him now he continued id like to speak to them over the way they treat our negroes sir they show more care to the animals they ride it is not right the commander of iii corps was a southern man through and through but had even less use for slavery than did lee i have heard of this before general hill and have hesitated to take them to task over what one might call a relatively small fault when the aid they have rendered us is so great lee said carefully perhaps i am in error time permitting we shall discuss the matter may i borrow the telescope sir henry heth said lee passed it to him he turned the glass toward the wilderness with it still at his eye he remarked the place is a bushwhackers dream just so henry lee said pleased the divisional commander saw the same thing he did the enemy are at their weakest in that kind of fight and we are at our strongest something hot and eager came into heths usually chilly grayblue eyes he fingered the tuft of light brown hair that grew just beneath his lower lip if we hurt them badly enough there they may skedaddle back over the rapidan and leave us alone for a while longstreet shook his head i know sam grant hes never been one to back away from a fight he will come straight at us every day he leads the army of the potomac we shall see what we shall see lee said if what the rivington men say is to be believed the enemy will begin their move on wednesday the fourth of may four days from now richard ewell murmured to himself my men will be ready and mine a p hill said longstreet simply nodded i am confident we shall all meet the test lee said again he saw the upcoming battle in his minds eye so real so convincing were the images he summoned up that his heart began to pound as if he were truly in combat and on the heels of that pounding came pain that squeezed his chest like a vise he set his jaw and did his best to ignore it then he remembered the medicine andries rhoodie had given him he took the glass bottle from his pocket he struggled with the lid before he got it open he was not used to tops with screw threads he removed a tuft of cotton wool shook out one of the little pills and slid it under his tongue as rhoodie had told him to do the pill had no particular taste that in itself separated it from the vast majority of the medicaments he knew which displayed their virtue by being either sweet or aggressively vile rhoodie had warned him thehe put on his glasses for a moment to read the name on the bottle againnitroglycerine might bring on a headache sure enough blood thundered in his temples still hed known far worse after a few goblets of red wine blood also thundered in his chest the grip of the vise eased he took a deep breath all at once he seemed able to get plenty of air he felt as if the weight of ten or twelve years had suddenly fallen from his shoulders he looked at the bottle of pills again in its own way it was as startling as the repeaters rhoodie had furnished to his army but then a future without wonders would hardly be worth looking forward to he returned the bottle to his pocket four more days he said v the drums beat on and on not just in the th north carolina but in all the iii corpss winter quarters the hoarse monotonous sound warned of battle to come nate caudell heard the long roll without surprise for the past couple of days couriers had galloped back and forth between lees headquarters and the encampment a sure sign something was in the wind just the night before colonel faribault had relayed the order that all men were to have three days cooked rations at hand which meant the army would move soon caudell hurried to the cabin that had been his home for the past few months a couple of his messmates were already there frantically getting ready to move out dempsey eure and rufus daniel came in hard on his heels gonna feel funny never seein this place again daniel said as he started loading his meager personal property into his blanket sure is caudell said you want to pass me our frying pan there i have room for it with it in his blanket went the latest letter from his mother a pocket testament a couple of reading primers a second pair of socks and his toothbrush he tied the ends of the blanket together covered it with an oilcloth and draped it from left shoulder to right hip his marching rations consisted of a big chunk of corn bread a smaller piece of salt pork and several of the packaged desiccated meals that had lately started showing up in their supply shipments he thought highly of thosethey were better than what the cooks turned out almost any day and did not weigh down his mess bag he clicked a banana clip into his ak made sure the change lever was in the safe position three more full magazines went into his pockets he looked around to see if he had anything else to take he didnt he snaked through his comrades and went outside only a few men had fallen in more still ran here and there shouting at each other getting in one anothers way captain lewis and a corporal were loudly trying to bring some order to the confusion caudell added his voice to theirs then his fellow sergeants came up the soldiers were used to obeying them inside half an hour the company was fully formed on the parade ground along with the rest of the regiment the blue castalia invincibles banner fluttered in the sweet spring breeze in front of the captain atlas denton the regimental colorbearer carried the ths southern cross battle flag out in front of the assembled troops colonel faribault followed the flag companyattention captain lewis called the other company commanders gave the same order the whole regiment straightened in its ranks without preamble faribault said the yankees have crossed the rapidan theyre moving south through the wilderness general hills corps will march east by the orange plank road we have the honor of being lead regiment in the lead brigade of the lead division some of the men cheered caudell kept quiet but a grin spread across his face being the lead regiment was privilege as well as honorother soldiers would eat their dust instead of their eating other mens faribault went on we are to camp near verdiersville tonight as the morning is already well along we have some smart marching to do god willing tomorrow we shall start to drive the yankees out of our country the soldiers cheered again this time with a baying eagerness in their voices by companies form column of foursand march colonel faribault called with officers sergeants and corporals amplifying the simple command the th north carolina became a long gray serpent that wound its way out of the encampment as if shedding a confining winter skin and tramped north up the road toward orange court house the weather was fine and mild a better day to march could hardly have been imagined as caudell had hoped his new repeater seemed to weigh nothing he looked back over his shoulder that gray serpent seemed to have no end as regiment after regiment followed the th north carolina but other even longer snakes these clad in blue surely lay ahead at orange court house the th swung east onto the orange plank road despite its name the road was imperfectly corduroyed much of it was just dirt when caudell looked back again dust partially obscured the rear of henry heths division and the lead brigades of that of cadmus wilcox which took their place behind heths men more clouds of dust rose into the eastern sky ahead general ewells corps was also on the move caudell looked south sure enough more dust still longstreets men were heading east on the pamunkey road the first sergeant nodded in satisfaction warmed by the thought that the whole army of northern virginia was back together again he could not imagine any force of federals beating these lean tough soldiers he felt proud to be part of such an army before long more than pride warmed him sweat trickled down from under the brim of his hat darkened his tunic at the armpits his feet began to complain they hadnt worked so hard in months the ak on his shoulder did weigh something after all what had been a pleasant outing turned into work the men had been singing since they set out some kept on more caudell among them began to find saving their breath the wiser course after the fourth or fifth time the battle cry of freedom even the southern version wore thin because the th north carolina was at the head of the long confederate column parties of highranking officers often rode nearby caudell was used to seeing general kirkland the brigade commander and general heth when a p hill came by in his red battle shirt he pointed him out to allison high i dont know why youre raisin such a fuss the dour sergeant said when we get shot its on account o the likes of him not much later the north carolina regiment behind the th raised a cheer craning his neck to find out why caudell saw a grayhaired man aboard a gray horse with dark mane and tail several younger soldiers rode with him its general lee he exclaimed his words were drowned out by a perfect torrent of cheers lee smiled and nodded for a brief instant his eyes locked with caudells the first sergeant felt ten feet tall able to conquer washington city singlehanded when the cheers would not stop lee took off his hat and waved it someone called well whip em for you marse bob of course you will lee said the soldier whooped with delight at having his beloved commander answer him caudell instantly felt jealous he called to lee too but the commander of the army of northern virginia chose that moment to swing travellers head around and ride back down the column his aides followed caudells shoulders slumped as he trudged along everyone was dragging by the time twilight brought a halt to the days march caudell wanted to throw himself full length on the ground instead he went over to captain lewis who looked even more worn than caudell felt sir wheres the nearest stream lewis pointed theres a creek over that way about a quarter of a mile caudell went back to the men of company d who were sprawled out as he wished he could be fatigue detail he said a chorus of groans greeted the announcement corporal lewis privates batts bean beard biggs and floyd fall in with canteens to fetch water now the groans came from the soldiers he had named mollie bean took off a shoe and sock to display blisters the size of halfdollars ruffin biggs pleaded that he had twisted an ankle john floyd alleged his gettysburg wound was acting up caudell would hear none of it everyone else is as frazzled as you are but its your turn for the duty we especially need the water for the desiccated suppers a lot of us are toting authority and logic were both on his side grumbling and letting out martyred sighs the members of the fatigue detail slowly and sadly got to their feet their luckier comrades passed them canteens until each of them was carrying six or eight caudell aimed them toward the creek they shambled away complaining still caudell told off another detail to gather wood for cook fires some men did not wait for hot food but chewed on corn bread or wheatcakes others went without a good many soldiers preferred eating their three days rations at the start of a march to carrying them a frying pan was not the ideal instrument for boiling water but it was what caudell had and he managed then he opened one of the metallic ration packs and poured the water over it a couple of minutes later he was spooning up noodles and ground meat in tomato sauce hed had that supper before and liked it after a day on the march he was hungry enough to lick the inside of the pack clean a few men carried shelter halvesspoil from the federals the ones who did joined together to put up their little tents and sleep inside them more caudell among them lay down on their oilcloths spread their blankets over themselves and slept under the stars with hats for pillows crickets chirped little frogs peeped bigger frogs croaked the suddenly glowing periods that were fireflies punctuated the night caudell loved fireflies when he was a boy hed snuck out of bed to press his nose against the window to watch them he watched them now but not for long the snores from the men alongside fazed him not in the least his own soon added to the chorus that threatened to drown out bugs and frogs alike when the drums woke him the next morning he was convinced he could not march a step his legs were one vast ache his feet two sharper pains the whole regiment moved like so many old men with rheumatism sign me up for the invalid corps dempsey eure groaned that corps took its members from men too badly wounded to stay in the regular army but still able to hold down a prison guard slot or other duty that required little in the way of activity i cant move fast enough to get into the invalid corps edwin powell said neatly topping his fellow sergeant for all their complaints the men moved out while the dew was still wet on the grass and the sun just coming up to shine in their faces caudells feet still hurt but before long he warmed up and limbered up and no longer felt elderly just worn when lieutenant winborne started singing maryland my maryland he even joined in the th north carolina led general hills corps past verdiersville and new verdiersville just south and east of it about an hour after the soldiers passed new verdiersville they came to the massive earthworks lee and meade had dug by mine run the november before each hoping the other would attack him they were both disappointed and the campaign had been a fizzle as he came up to the works caudell wondered if the army would be ordered into them he could think of nowhere better to stand on the defensive but colonel faribault rode up to the head of the column and shouted forward they marched on into the wilderness were going to have ourselves a big fight today caudell said nobody argued with him mollie bean said wonder where the yankees are in there caudell peered down the orange plank road grants whole army could have been within a quarter mile as long as they kept quiet the confederates would never know until they stumbled over them trees and underbrush grew right up to the edge of the road their branches interlacing overhead the wilderness was secondgrowth country gullied and full of scrubby chinkapin and blackjack oaks scraggy pines hazel and every kind of thorn and bramblebearing bush known to man get off the road and you were lost maybe for good the occasional clearing seemed like a lamp going on in a gloomy room caudell blinked in the sudden strong sunlight as he marched past new hope church on the south side of the road place like this no hope church would be a better name for it dempsey eure remarked colonel faribault rode up again he had his sword out which meant he thought action was near no sooner had the thought run through caudells mind than the colonel said skirmishers forward we may come upon them any time now the picked men trotted east their repeaters at the ready some hurried down the road others crashed through the tangled undergrowth and headed into the woods caudell could trace their progress for a while by the way they swore when thorns and stickers gouged their flesh but the skirmishers soon fell silent today the wilderness held more dangerous things than thorn bushes it was still midmorning when a brisk crackle of rifle fire started up ahead of the main body of the regiment the men looked at one another caudell saw pale tense faces all around he suspected his own was no ruddier no calmer however little they spoke of it few men went into battle without fear but the best way to overcome it to avoid deserving comrades scorn was to pretend it did not exist without being ordered the soldiers stepped up their pace a skirmisher his tunic ripped came pelting back he gasped bluebellies up ahead cavalry fightin on foot company load your rifles captain lewis ordered caudell unslung his repeater pulled back the charging handle two clicks on your change levers mind he called dont go shooting off all your rounds without good targets two clicks the other sergeants echoed the regiment drew closer to the firing another skirmisher came back this one staggering and cursing and dripping blood from his left forearm wheres fowler he said several men pointed the way to the assistant surgeons wagon still cursing the wounded man went on toward the rear caudells gut knotted how many more would face chloroform and the knifeor the bone sawbefore this days work was through and would he be one of them then two more skirmishers appeared they werent hurt they were grinning from ear to ear and prodding along a glumlooking yankee whose buff chevrons said he was a cavalry corporal colonel faribault came up to him on foot now whats your unit he asked fifth new york cavalry the prisoner answered readily enough his voice held more than a bit of a brogue he looked from his captors to the rest of the th north carolina faith do the lot of yez have these funnylooking guns i thought it was half a brigade wed run into not a wee skirmish line the carolina men howled like wolves to hear that take him back to general heth for more questions faribault told the men who had captured the new yorker they led him away the colonel went on company i forward to support the skirmishers other companies form line of battle behind their banner the men of company i hurried down the orange plank road toward the fighting company by company the rest of the regiment moved off the road into the wilderness the castalia invincibles were close to the center of the line and so still close to the roadway all the same caudell discovered at once that this was no place for fancy paradeground maneuvering even keeping the line straight was next to impossible forward he called to the handful of men he could see forward meant vines wrapping around his ankles like snakes and branches hitting him in the face and pulling at his arms he fell three times before hed made a hundred yards then a bullet cracked past his head and slapped against a tree trunk not five feet away he threw himself flat and crawled through the bushes on his belly another shot rang out and another bullets probed the underbrush looking for him the federal cavalrymen had repeaters of their own they might not have been aks but they were bad enough caudell peered through a screen of leaves tried to spy the yankee who was trying to kill him he saw no trace of uniformthe fellow was hidden as well as a red indian but he could not hide the blackpowder smoke that rose every time he fired it drifted up from behind a clump of blackberry bushes carefully so as not to give away his own position caudell brought the rifle to his shoulder squeezed off two rounds one after the other hed flushed his bird the blackberry bushes stirred as the federal trooper scrambled toward what he hoped was better cover just for a second caudell caught a glimpse of blue he fired the yankee screamed caudell fired again the scream stopped as abruptly as if it had been cut off by a knife caudell dashed forward past the bushes where the dead yankee had been hiding the crash of gunfire resounded all around louder by the minute as more and more confederates got into the woods and collided with the federals already there as was their way the dismounted cavalry had firepower out of proportion to their numbers thanks to the sevenshot spencer carbines they carried but now the men of the th north carolina could match them and more it was a heady feeling so was pushing the yankees back they went unwillingly in the tangled badlands of the wilderness a few determined men behind a log or hiding in a dry wash could knock a big piece of an assault back on its heels caudell discovered one such knot of resistance by tripping over the corpse of a skirmisher who had been shot through the head gitdown dammit a live confederate growled at him they aint playin games up ahead there he pointed over to a clump of oak saplings theres at least three of the bastards in there and they won it move for hell twigs cracked off to the right caudell swung his rifle that way but the newcomersalmost invisible against the bushes in their gray and butternut clotheswere confederates yankees there he called pointing at the thicket as if to underscore his words a couple of spencers barked making all the rebels flatten out against the brambled ground he nudged the private next to him you and me lets put some bullets through there make them keep their heads down when the fellow nodded caudell looked over to the soldiers who had just arrived you flank em while we keep em busy the words were punctuated by a dive into better cover as the federals fired at the sound of his voice he fired back so did his companion the other confederates scrambled forward from log to tree to bushes before theyd moved fifty feet they disappeared from caudells sight a few seconds later though their aks snarled as caudell had noted on the practice range the new repeaters had a shorter sharper report than any rifle hed known before he could tell which was which without having to turn and look an asset on a field like the wilderness the oak thicket shook like a man with the ague caudell grinned savagelythe yankees cover from the side couldnt have been as good as it was from his direction four bluecoats ran for a stand of cedars the private next to caudell shot one of them he went down in a thrashing heap screaming and cursing at the same time dust puffed from the back of another federals jacket as one of the flankers scored a hit that yankee pitched forward onto his face and did not move again the other two cavalrymen stopped in their tracks they threw down their carbines thrust their hands into the air you got us goddammit one of them shouted the private flicked a glance at caudell he nodded he had no stomach for butchery cautiously he made his way through the brush to the federals throw down your cartridge boxes and your mess bags he told them then pick up the wounded fellow there and head west i reckon someone will take charge of you sooner or later thank you johnny reb one of the men in blue said as he shed ammunition and rations he stooped beside his injured comrade come on pete were going to pick you up now itll be all right the hell it will pete gasped out between clenched teeth he gasped again when the two unhurt cavalrymen hauled him to his feet and supported him between themselves seeing caudell he fixed him with a baleful stare and growled whered you bastards come by all these repeaters i aint been shot at so much in the last two years put together and now one of you had to go and nail me dont anger him up pete the cavalryman who had spoken before said but his gaze kept flicking to caudells ak too what kind of rifle is that anyway johnny never you mind caudell gestured with the barrel of the repeater just get going as the dispirited federals obeyed he scooped up their haversacks he handed one of them to the private who had fought beside him both men grinned good eating caudell said even with the rivington mens desiccated meals belts had been tight all winter coffee and sugar too likely the private said dreamily not far away a spencer spoke the private and caudell dove for cover a bullet could end all dreams in a hurry or turn them to nightmares caudell kept moving east now quickly now slowly the federal cavalrymen put up a stubborn fight but more and more confederates were coming into line against them caudell spotted men he did not recognize what regiment he called to them fortyfourth north carolina one of them answered who are you all fortyseventh lets go fortyseventh a rebel yell ripped the air lets flank these bluebellies out of their shoes again they drove the federals past parkers store and the handful of houses that huddled in the clearing with it the open space gave the confederates a chance to dress their lines a little victory had left them about as disorganized as defeat had the yankees caudell almost stumbled over captain lewis what are we aiming to do now sir he asked lewis pointed east about three miles from here i hear tell the orange plank road crosses the brock road we want to grab that crossing if we can do it we cut the yankees in half three miles caudell gauged the sun and was surprised to find how early it still was we can be there before noon the sooner the better lewis said along with as many of the castalia invincibles as had reassembled around parkers store caudell plunged into the woods again as he scrambled along he munched on a hardtack from the yankee cavalrymans haversack the square flat biscuit lived up to its name by the way it challenged his teeth he choked it down swigged from his canteen and pushed on the wilderness was like no battlefield on which hed ever fought at gettysburg the whole panorama of war had spread out before him when the th north carolina joined in the great charge against the center of the federal position caudell had seen every rifle every artillery piece that slaughtered his companions here he could not even see more than a handful of those companions let alone the yankees they were doing their best to slay all he knew was that the confederates were still rolling east which meant they were driving back the enemy by twos and threes the confederates dashed across a narrow roadway yankee bullets from the other side kicked up dust around their feet and knocked down more than one man but before long the dismounted cavalry had to retreat againthey were not only outnumbered but outgunned caudell wondered if this was the brock road of which captain lewis had spoken he didnt think hed come three miles since parkers store but in the tangle he couldnt be sure evidently the brock road lay further onhe heard an officer yelling come on men keep it moving give those damnyankees hell more rebel yells rang out caudell did his best to keep it moving he reached up to settle his hat more firmly on his head only to discover hed lost it to a grasping branch or bush without ever noticing somewhere to the north he could hear a great crash of gunfire ewells ii corps and the federals were tearing at each other along the orange turnpike then he took a moment to wish his fellows well a bullet crashed past his head and made him pay full attention to his own battle cheers came from just ahead caudell wondered why the fight seemed no different now from what it had been all alongconfusing exhilarating and terrifying at the same time then without warning he found himself out of the underbrush and standing in the middle of a dirt road which had recently seen heavy traffic a dirt road that by the sun ran north instead of east its the brock road a first lieutenant from some other regiment bawled in his ear we done beat the federals to the crossroads and trapped the ones whove already gone by for a moment that made caudell want to yell too but when he said holy jesus it came out in a whisper he turned to the lieutenant does that mean theyll be coming at us from north and south at the same time the lieutenants eyes got wide he nodded now caudell shouted as loud as he could lets get some branches stumps rocks whatever the hell onto this road weve got lots of yankees heading this way and wed better have something to shoot from the confederates worked like men possessed attacking the federals fixed positions at gettysburg had taught them the value of field fortifications no matter how quickly improvised caudell dragged fallen logs across the roadway to help seal it off on the other side of the junction with the orange plank road more soldiers ran up breastworks facing south still others started building barricades along the orange plank road east from the brock road the first lieutenant seemed to be the highestranking officer around run em back west too he said if the yankees cant go through us theyll try to go around they have to reconnect or we chew em up in detail he grabbed two men by their jackets go back and tell em to fetch us all the cartridges they can were going to need em the privates sprinted off in a way caudell envied them hed already seen his share of fighting this morning if he stayed here he would see a lot more than his share he hunkered down behind the thickest log he could find and settled himself to wait he did not wait long a party of yankee horsemen came trotting down the brock road toward the breastworks they pulled up in obvious dismay as soon as they saw them the first lieutenant whooped too late yankees too late the horsemenofficers some of them by their fancy trappingsrode forward again more slowly now to see just what sort of barrier the confederates had built and how many of them crouched behind it caudell took careful aim at the lead man whose gray hair said he might be of high rank the range was long close to a quarter mile but worth a try he rested the barrel of the rifle on the log in front of him took a deep breath let it out pulled the trigger the yankee tilted in the saddle as if hed had too much to drink before he mounted he slid off his horse and crashed to the dirt of the brock road good shot shouted one of the men by caudell he and several others started firing at the men who had leaped down to help their stricken comrade the federals heaved him over the back of the horse they all galloped away though a couple of them reeled as if they were hit skirmishers forward the lieutenant said therell be more where those came from men hurried up the road and north through the woods an ammunition wagon reached the crossroads its horses were lathered and blowing caudell and several other soldiers helped the driver unload crate after crate of cartridges the wagon also carried hatchets and shovels the driver passed those out too so the men could strengthen the breastworks in whatever time was left before the enemy descended on them a corporal pried the lid off an ammunition crate he started to reach down for a handful of cartridges stopped and stared in disbelieving disgust what the hell goddam bucketheaded jackass sent us up a load of minié balls the whole crate was full of paper cartridges for the rifle muskets the army of northern virginia no longer carried by the howls of rage that rose from several other soldiers theyd made the same unwelcome discovery caudell ground his teeth in fear and fury a big part of the army of the potomac was bearing down on him he and his comrades would need every possible round and here were boxes and boxes of cartridges they couldnt use i just brung em up here the wagon driver protested when the angry confederates rounded on him i didnt load em in a few hundred yards to the north the skirmishers began a brisk fire a couple of them let go on full automatic caudell scowled and worked his jaws harder either they were overeager or a whole lot of yankees were on the way all packed together he suspected he knew which heres the right ones somebody shouted his voice rising in relief caudell hurried over grabbed a couple of magazines and stuffed them into his pockets the firing was getting closer in a hurry not just aks but also the familiar deep roar of springfields under the gunfire came the tramp of marching men the confederate skirmishers dashed back toward the breastworks some turned to fire last shots others just scrambled over the barricade or off into the concealing woods yankees the shout came from a dozen throats at once caudells among them a thick blue column appeared on the brock road a swordswinging officer at its head he pointed his sword at the confederates makeshift works the northern men their bayonets gleaming even in the uncertain light upped their pace to doublequick they cheered as they charged not the wild rebel yell but a more studied rhythmic hurrah hurrah caudell thumbed his change lever to full automatic his rifle spat flame he used up what was left of his first banana clip in the twinkling of an eye he rammed in another fired it off at full automatic too he knew he would never find a better more massed target when a few seconds later the second magazine was also gone he stuck on a third banana clip and glanced down to switch the change lever back to single shots he looked up over his sights at the head of the oncoming federal column the lead ranks were all down some writhing some still and obviously deadhe was far from the only rebel to have hosed the yankees with a stream of thirty bullets or more than one the northern officer incredibly still stood still waved his men on even as caudell took aim at him he spun backwards and fell clutching at his right side but the federals stumbling over the wounded and slain men in front of them advanced without him through the unending rattle of gunfire came a bugles high thin cry urging them forward the bluecoats in the lead fired at the confederates who were slaughtering them two men over from caudell a rebel sagged to the dirt the back of his head blown out one or two others at the breastwork screamed as they were hit but then the yankees had either to stop and reload or keep on charging and trust they would live long enough to use bayonets or clubbed rifles even against a firing line of singleshot springfields both choices would have been evil caudell had not been at the battle of fredericksburg where lees men on maryes heights smashed wave after wave of attacking yankees the th north carolina had not yet joined the army of northern virginia but was further south in that state on provost guard duty at petersburg now though he knew what the defenders must have felt then with men too brave to run away coming at them again and again rushing headlong toward annihilation the federals on the brock road were brave men too as brave as any caudell had ever seen they kept trying to rush the long barricade none of them got within a hundred yards of it no man in the open roadway could push farther than that in the face of the withering fire the confederate repeaters put out wounded soldiers reached out and grabbed at the legs of men pushing past trying to hold them back from the deadly stutter of the aks but the fresh troops shook off those hands and advanceduntil they were wounded or killed themselves at last even their courage could bear no more the federals stopped hurrying forward into the meat grinder even then they did not break and run they ducked into the woods and huddled behind the dead bodies of their mates and kept up as strong a fire as they could off the brock road to either side the crackle of rifle muskets crept closer to the orange plank road caudell gnawed nervously on his lip the yankees had cover in the thickets and tangles of the wilderness that let their numbers count for more against the repeaters than was possible on the road itself if they forced their way around the crossroads they might yet link up with the corps trapped to the south a whistling through the air a crashcaudell threw himself flat all strategic considerations driven from his mind by pure and simple terror the wilderness was such a jungle that artillery could find few jobs firing straight down the brock road at the confederate breastwork unfortunately was one of them the first shell landed short a moment later another one screamed overhead to detonate about fifty yards beyond the barricade caudells belly turned to ice split the difference between the two of them andhed been shelled at gettysburg he knew only too well what came after and the federals started their hurrah again but the third shell was also safely long if the yankees had set up two guns in the roadway perhaps the first ones crew had overcorrected that kind of luck though could not last long it did not have to off to the left rose a great racket of ak fire and rebel yells the northern hurrahs turned to shouts of dismay yankees began bursting out of the bushes and dashing across the brock road from west to east for a moment caudell was too bemused even to shoot at them the first lieutenant who still seemed to be the ranking officer at the crossroads let out a whoop here comes the rest of the corps by god caudell whooped too if the federals had formed their line in the woods to try to force the confederates off the orange plank road then the rebels advancing from the west toward the junction with the brock road would have been ideally placed to take them in flank and roll them upand incidentally to reach the brock road and drive away those field guns or put their crews out of action caudell had no idea which had happened he did know no more shells landed close by for which he was heartily glad not all the yankees had been smashed firing continued in the woods as knots of soldiers refused to give ground on a more open battlefield that would have been impossible in the wildernesss thickets and tangles and clumps of bushes men could find places to make a stand even after their comrades had given way but the confederates had gained a long stretch of the brock road caudell sniffed along with the familiar tang of blackpowder smoke and the sharper thinner odor of the nonsmoking powder in ak cartridges he smelled burning weeds all that shooting in the undergrowth had set the wilderness ablaze he shuddered at the thought of wounded and helpless men in there watching the little flames lick closer the jingle of horses trappings released him from his unpleasant reverie he glanced back over his shoulder where the lowly lieutenant had led the confederates through the heavy fighting at the crossroads now generals kirkland and heth were here to see how things stood that was the way the world worked caudell thought how clean the men look william kirkland said a remark seldom made about the army of northern virginia especially after some hours of combat henry heth quicker on the uptake figured out why they havent been biting cartridges all day not with these new brass ones so theyve no need to look as though they were in a blackface minstrel show thats true by god kirkland said i hadnt thought about it caudell hadnt thought about it either after his struggle through the forest he suspected he was quite grimy enough for any ordinary purpose he used the lull in the fighting to take some cartridges out of his pockets and refill the banana clips hed emptied another horse came clopping down the orange plank road a darkmaned graywhere caudell had sat and tended to his business in the presence of his brigade and division commanders he scrambled to his feet for general lee so did most of the other soldiers close by as you were gentlemen please lee peered north up the brock road toward the blueclad bodies that corduroyed it like so many planks those people are paying dearly for every acre of wilderness they hold he remarked as he turned to look south henry push such forces as you can spare down along this road if you please general hancock will be along shortly unless i miss my guess yes general lee heth said we might have been in a bad way if hed hit us from the south at the same time as getty was coming down from the north so we might have lee said but however brave its men may be coordination of attacks has never been the army of the potomacs strong suit a good thing too caudell thought a dispatch rider galloped up to lee he held reins in one hand an ak in the other and his message between his teeth lee read it nodded and rode off with him after reloading caudell lit up a cigar hed only taken a couple of drags on it when general heth said i expect you heard what general lee wants boys the sooner we get moving the farther south well get and the better the works well be able to set up before hancocks men hit us the confederates at the crossroads would have obeyed some commanders only slowly and reluctantly theyd already seen their share and more of hard fighting for the day but heth and kirkland and their staff officers rode down the road in front of the infantry as if the idea that danger might lie ahead had never entered their minds with that example before them the foot soldiers followed readily enough fresh troops coming up the orange plank road took their places at the breastwork theyd built a little more than a quarter of a mile south of the crossroads the brock road narrowed and bent slightly to the east heth reined in this looks to be a good spot boys he said well stop em right here the soldiers attacked the timber on either side of the road for the field fortifications mixed earth and stones in with the logs off in the woods caudell heard men making even ruder works to protect themselves from yankee bullets just as the skirmishers heth had pushed out south of his main line began to fire a couple of ammunition wagons brought fresh cartridges down the road better not be them goddam minié balls several soldiers growled using almost identical words this time they werent caudell filled his pockets again crouched behind the breastwork and waited more and more single shots from yankee springfields mingled with the bark of the skirmishers repeaters the skirmishers crashed back through the undergrowth to heths main line we stung em one called off in the woods federal skirmishers came first trotting up the brock road to learn what lay ahead for their comrades they stopped short when they spied the rebel breastwork that barred their path one of the bluecoats raised his rifle musket to his shoulder fired the bullet kicked up dust a few yards short of the barricade the yankee dove into the bushes to reload his companions turned and ran south to report what theyd seen a minute or so later the head of the main federal line came into view caudells stomach churned lee might remark that the yankees had trouble putting their attacks together but every one they made was fierce fire at will a confederate officer shouted which ones will some army wit shouted back that stupid joke got made on every firing line yankee or rebel somehow it helped caudell relax the front rank of federals suddenly dropped to one knee the second rank took aim over their heads a couple of yankees fell over or reeled back out of linethe confederates had already begun to shoot but then the northerners muskets all in a row belched flame and great curls of greasy black smoke caudell thought the rebel beside him at the breastwork had tapped him on the left shoulder he automatically glanced down neat as a tailors scissors a bullet had clipped his uniform without touching him he shuddered he could not help it lower by only a couple of fingers breadth and his precious arm would have ended up on the slaughterhouse pile outside a surgeons tentif hed managed to make it back to a surgeons tent at all the fellow beside him who he thought had tapped him would never need a surgeon again a minié ball had clipped him and clipped off the top of his head blood and shattered brains poured from the wound as he slowly toppled over backwards caudell looked away tried not to hear the cries of other men who had been wounded close by gettysburg had hardened him to horror and if he did not help slay the yankees rushing up the brock road toward the barricade behind which he crouched he and all his fellows hale and wounded alike would surely perish the yankees were reloading as they ran most of them had to stop to use their ramrods caudell and everyone else on the breastwork who could still handle a rifle fired again and again and again men in blue coats began to drop and kept on falling faster and faster a few managed to fire again but only a few after that first volley the rebels had it all their own way miraculously every bullet missed one federal corporal his face set and grim he charged on alone toward the breastwork dont kill himcall ran up and down the line the confederates could still admire gallantry even in a foe firing slackened for a moment go back you damned fool caudell shouted to the yankee look behind you the corporals doublequick faltered as the words reached him caudell could see him leave the exalted state in which hed rushed toward certain death he knew that state himself it was all that had sustained him as he advanced on the union guns up in pennsylvania its ebbing came hard hard when it left a man he felt more drained than after a week of forced marches and rightly so for with it he lost spirit as well as strength the federal did look around his shoulders sagged as he took in the carnage on the brock road the ruin of his regiment some of his comrades were crawling or creeping or dragging themselves away from the dreadful fire of the confederate repeaters others would not move again until the last trump sounded the corporal slowly turned back toward the barricade you rebs dont fight fair he shouted now his exaltation was gone leaving only ear behind he fled into a pine thicket off to one side of the road he was none too soon for more federals tramped up the brock road a few minutes later the crossfire would have chewed him to pieces the bluecoats came to a ragged halt when they saw what had happened to the first attacking party but then moved ahead all the same the south had gone into the war doubting yankee courage after three years of fighting few in the army of northern virginia doubted it anymore this group of union men attacked more cleverly than had the previous one instead of forming a neat firing lineand a target that could not be missedthey advanced in rushes a few men pausing to shoot while others moved up then the men who had gained ground ducking into the bushes and providing covering fire for their companions to push ahead caudell shot missed shot again missed again a minié ball buzzed past his head he involuntarily duckedonly men with no nerves whatever could keep from dodging when bullets zipped by he fired again at a yankee less than two hundred yards away the fellow threw down his springfield and grabbed at his shoulder he lurched away from the front line of fighting a lot of confederates were behind the breastwork even though caudell had aimed at the northerner he couldnt be sure his was the round that had wounded him no matter how cleverly no matter how boldly they attacked the rebel barricade the federals on the brock road could not drive the defenders from it the fire from the confederates repeaters swept the roadway clean of life men fell killed or wounded but more replaced them teamsters and other soldiers fetched crates of cartridges to the breastwork ironic cheers rang out every time the crates proved to contain the proper ammunition once or twice they didnt and the cartridgebearers retreated scorched by curses from the fighting men in the wilderness proper especially east of the brock road the federals were able to come to closer quarters with their foes their hurrahs and the boom of their springfields crept ever nearer the line the confederates held south of the orange plank road off to the north a huge racket of riflery and cannons broke out lee had said the federals had trouble putting their attacks together theyd managed now had they done it sooner the rebel lines between them would have been thin the confederates had won a critical couple of hours to bring more men forward and widen the stretch they held along either side of the orange plank road the yankees were hitting them with everything they had now they had more men the confederates had better rifles caudell hoped that would do the job between assaults up the roadway he filled banana clips chewed on corn bread and salt pork and drank from his canteen the water was warm and turbid it went down like champagne even so he and his companions smoked and listened to the gunfire all around and tried to guess how the fighting was going away from their little piece of it i think we got em a beardless soldier declared didnt notice you come up uh melvin caudell said hope youre right but i wouldnt bet on anything yet theyre putting a lot of their people into the fight this time were holding so far but mollie bean interrupted him holy jesus she was looking over the breastwork caudell sprawled with his back against it he whirled around the federals had given up on subtlety a deep column of bluecoats their bayonets fixed stormed up the brock road at the doublequick officers trotted ahead of them urging them on all or nothin this time boys somebody not far from caudell said them bluebellies is gonna run over us or die tryin caudell vastly preferred the second alternative he aimed at a colorbearer in front of the first rank as soon as the advancing yankees reached the first men lying in the roadsome of the wounded as before to the north tried to hold their fellows back but others cheered them onhe started shooting he did not know if his bullet struck home but the colorbearer stumbled and fell another yankee caught the regimental flag before it touched the ground bore it forward a dozen paces more before he too was hit yet another federal grabbed it and carried it on three more fell before the banner drew close enough for caudell to read it sixteenth massachusetts then still another colorbearer went down and the banner fell in the dust no one picked it up no one was left to pick it up like the corporal before him that last brave and luckyat least lucky up to a pointcolorbearer pushed far beyond his comrades the southerners repeaters had worked a fearful slaughter there was a limit beyond which flesh and blood could not be made to go caudell had met that limit on the third day at gettysburg now he and the soldiers crouching to either side of him acquainted the federals with it but another regiment came in right behind the slaughtered sixteenth massachusetts the federals leaned forward as they advanced as if moving into a heavy rain so they were but the rain was of lead this aint war mollie bean yelled in caudells ear this heres murder i reckon youre right he answered but if we dont keep shooting them theyll surely shoot us she kept firing so he supposed she agreed with him after that second federal regiment wrecked itself assaulting the barricade the rebels behind it had another brief respite they used it to strengthen their protection if the yankees are pushing this hard theyll try us again before long caudell said as he set another log in place by the way the rest of the soldiers worked alongside him they thought as he did more ammunition came up he filled his pockets again he wondered how many rounds hed fired hed lost track far more than on any day with his old enfield he was certain so had everyone else here the drifts of yankee corpses in front of the barricade sometimes two and three men high testified to that while he worked caudell kept an ear cocked to try to gauge how the rest of the battle was going to the north federals and rebels still went at it hammer and tongs by the sound of things the line hadnt moved there which was all to the good as far as he was concerned the yankees also kept trying to break through east of the brock road a sudden flurry of hurrahs said they were close to doing it too rebel yells and the wild snarl of aks fired on full automatic answered them the hurrahs ebbed knocked em back caudell guessed they just keep comin a soldier said dang fools dont know when theys licked remembering picketts charge caudell thought that a failing of which both sides were guilty just then the soldier dropped the fence rail he was carrying and snatched up his repeater oh sweet jesus here they is again the new federal attacking column marched up the brock road in perfect order fining the roadway from edge to edge each bluecoat a regulation thirteen inches from the man on either side of him the yankees hesitated when they saw ahead of them the ruins of the two regiments that had gone in before them a few men in the first ranks took half steps instead of fun marching paces but shouts and curses from officers and sergeants quickly got their lines dressed once more and they bore down on the breastwork with a hurrah the confederates broke them mollie bean had the right of it caudell thought as he fired again and againusing repeaters against such a bunched target was murder but he had been right too for it was necessary murder if he was to live himself the northerners went down like ninepins but more and more pushed forward to take their places until at last they would advance into the face of death no more but turned and ran for the rear caudell and his companions on the firing line raised a tired cheer to see them go dead and wounded men were thick on the ground behind the barricade too even if the yankees had never come close to reaching it the soldiers gave what rough first aid they could and sent to the rear men who could walk hospital stewards some wearing green sashes as their federal counterparts did came forward to haul off on stretchers men too badly hurt to travel on their own a small brushfire reached the roadway a couple of hundred yards south of the breastwork it caught in the clothes of a federal lying there a few seconds later his cartridges began exploding poppoppop almost as if they were kernels from an ear of popping corn wounded men writhed frantically trying to escape the flames several confederates started to scramble over their piled logs and rails and stones to go to rescue the yankees from the fire but they scrambled back a moment later for yet another regiment of federals appeared battle flags flying to hurl their bodies at the barricade caudells repeater was hot in his hands hed been shooting at bluecoats the whole day longforever it seemed he glanced through leaves and drifting smoke at the sun it was getting low in the west before too long night would halt combat if nothing else did after three regiments had tried the barricade and failed the brock road in front of it was clogged with bodies more than one shot had come from behind them as lightly wounded men used their comrades corpses as barricades of their own now dead and wounded alike broke up the neat ranks of the oncoming federals they came on all the same caudell and his fellows began the grisly task of educating them about what repeaters could do the federals had sufficient horrid examples right before their eyes they did not rush with the same élan their predecessors had shown when men at the head of the column began dropping the bluecoats behind them hesitated through the cries of the wounded caudell heard officers screaming at their men trying to get them to advance in spite of the scourging fire that lay ahead then drowning cries and screams alike a great new eruption of gunfire broke out to the south the federals on the brock road looked back over their shoulders in surprise and alarm even their officers stopped urging them forward for a moment caudell frowned as he tiredly wondered what the new fighting was about mollie bean pounded him on the shoulder and yelled longstreet longstreet he said the name once with no particular feeling then the lightning flashed inside his head he yelled too longstreet if lees war horse had pitched into this federal corps from the south while ap hill kept it from going north the yankees hereabouts were in more trouble than you could shake a stick at they knew it too they milled about just out of good shooting range but then they came on once more now the officers had no trouble with balky men they knew they had to break through if their corps was to survive fire low caudell shouted as the blue wave again surged toward the breastwork that dammed its progress as the confederates had three times before they shredded the charge no yankee could come within fifty yards of that rude wall and live the captains and lieutenants who headed the rush fell bravely leading their men like most troops on both sides in the war the common soldiers took heart from the example their officers set without that example most of those who could made for the rear and at least temporary safety a couple of bluecoats stood where they were their empty hands high in the air dont shoot you rebs one of them shouted his northern accent sharp in caudells ears you done caught us caudell looked around wheres that lieutenant he asked seeing no one of higher rank than himself he got shot mollie bean answered laconically oh without showing more of himself than his head caudell called to the federals come ahead yanks make it pert thoughif we have to start shooting again you all will be right in the middle the northern men sprinted toward the barricade more shouted directions from caudell took them out of the roadway and through the edge of the wilderness caudell listened to them scrabbling over the lower fieldworks there they disappeared from sight until they came back out onto the brock road the confederates promptly relieved them of their haversacks and whatever money they had on them shoes too yanks a barefoot private said one of you might could be my size and if you aint ill wear one pair anyways and pass the other on to somebody else the prisoners did not protest you just take what you want rebs one of them said as he pulled off his stout marching shoes im so glad youre not shooting at me anymore i dont care about anything else the way the bullets came at us i figured you had a million men back here maybe two the confederates grinned at that caudell sent the two federals to the rear he stayed by the barricade waiting to see if the union men would mount yet another attack the firing to the south was coming closerthat had to mean longstreet was doing well the firing to the north grew louder too or rather deeper more artillery was mixing with the rifles there the sun sank a bloodred ball looking down on blood through tangled branches and curls of smoke from gunpowder and brushfires the fifth yankee attack had not come as darkness gathered the sound of fighting to north and south began to slacken it also eased in the woods east of the brock road though it never died away altogether and would flare up every so often in a brief spasm of ferocity caudell looked up and down the breastwork but for mollie bean he saw no one he recognized any battle was liable to tear up a neat line of march battle in country like the wilderness made such disorder a sure thing he asked melvin do you know where the rest of the boys from the th are mollie pointed east some of ems over in the thickets yonder maybe half a mile i was with em for a while then i heard all the shootin over here and figgered id come lend a hand things are dying down for the night seems like caudell said lets see if we cant bed down with our regiment she nodded and followed him as he headed into the undergrowth pushing through the rank second growth of the wilderness was even worse in the evening twilight than it had been during the day a red indian would have laughed himself sick at caudells noisy stumbling fight with thorn bushes and cedar saplings whos there a nervous voice called from up ahead two men from the th north carolina caudell answered quickly before the nervous owner of that nervous voice started shooting behind him mollie bean chuckled softly he ignored her he had to think of her as a soldier now not a woman he called back who are you fifteenth north carolinacookes brigade the still invisible fellow answered he sounded less nervous now yall are out o kirklands brigade right thats us caudell agreed gratefully at least he was talking with someone from his own division keep goin east youll find em caudell kept going east he never did see the man whod given him directions he and mollie were challenged twice more in short order he also challenged a couple of small groups of men himself soldiers heading west looking for their regiments he was certain what they were before he opened his mouth he challenged anyhow in the wilderness certainty meant little that half mile took close to half an hour to cover then to his disgust caudell learned hed somehow gone right past his regiment and had to double back had mollie scolded him for that he would have sworn at her but she said only the goins rough hereabouts nate nodding a grateful nod she probably couldnt see he pushed on he stumbled into a tiny clearing some soldiers were sitting around a campfire one of them looked up it was dempsey eure i will be damned he said we reckoned you was buzzards meat nate i thought so myself a couple of times caudell sank to the ground footsore and weary you even managed to hang on to your plumed hat dempsey i lost mine straight off wouldnt lose this beauty nate eure doffed it to mollie glad we didnt lose that there little beauty either you shut up dempsey you hear she said dont want no officers catchin the wind from your big flappin mouth sorry uh melvin eure said contritely any water close by caudell asked shaking his empty canteen im bone dry eure jerked his thumb to the north theres a little creek down that way couple minutes walk hoping the couple of minutes would not stretch as the trip to find his regiment had caudell went off to look for the creek and to answer a call of nature which mollie beans presence had forced him to suppress until now such modesty was a foolish thing but it was his own he sighed with relief as he unbuttoned his trousers he found the water by stepping into it he took off his shoes and bathed his tired feet before he filled the canteen once hed drunk he felt better he knew his comrades were only a few yards away knew tens of thousands of federals and confederates were within a few miles but for all he could see of them he might as well have been alone in the wilderness his ears told him otherwise in spite of full darkness firing went on between rival pickets but the cries of the wounded were worse in the tangle through which both armies had pushed their lines a hurt man had a hard time getting to the rear nor could his mates easily rescue himor sometimes even find him wails shrieks moans turned the thickets to the haunt of tormented ghosts most of the sounds of pain came from the south which meant they rose from yankee throats but confederates also shouted out their hurt to the world caudell shivered as he made his way back to the clearing though the night was warm what save luck had kept his tender flesh rather than someone elses from pouring out its blood in the unwelcome track of a bullet nothing of which he was aware he patted himself as if to prove he was still whole and unholed how marvelous that each hand grasped that each foot moved confidently in front of the other once sitting again by the fire he shared some of his food and the spoil from captured yankee war bags with men whod already gobbled the rations they were supposed to carry a couple of soldiers went to sleep their hats either over their eyes or under their heads as pillows more though stayed up awhile to smoke and to hash over the battle and try to draw a bigger picture from the tiny pieces theyd seen plainly lee had trapped a big chunk of the federal army between hills corps and longstreets mollie bean said reckon well go on and try poundin em to pieces come mornin thats clear enough otis massey agreed the corporal patted the ak that lay on the ground beside him with these repeaters might could be well even do it too be a nasty butchers bill to pay for certain if we was usin muzzleloaders instead youve got that right otis caudell said as a general murmur of agreement rose from the soldiers a yankee said we werent fighting fair dempsey eure spat into the fire fair didnt stop their cavalry from usin their repeaters against singleshot muskets now they see what the shoes like on tother foot talk about repeaters reminded caudell he hadnt yet cleaned his with more fighting ahead tomorrow he wanted the rifle as ready as he could make it he stripped the ak and dug out a rag and the gun oil that had come with the weapon the little black oil bottle said break free clp the sweet almost fruity smell of the oil mixed with the odors of coffee food and woodsmoke he was in the middle of putting the repeater back together when someone came crashing through the brush toward the clearing mollie bean and a couple of other privates reached for their rifles in case it was a yankee who needed capturing but it wasnt a yankeeit was colonel faribault turn those aside boys if you please he said when he saw he was looking down the barrels of several repeaters however much i admire stonewall jacksons memory i have no desire to share his fate the rifles were hastily lowered but for accidents like that which had befallen jackson only a bad officer risked bullets from his own men faribault was a good one whats the word colonel caudell asked tomorrow morning five oclock we go after winfield scott hancock again faribault said god willing we may put an end to the whole federal ii corps general heth told general lee we are driving them beautifully i heard him say it myself the men round the campfire grinned and nodded to one another pleased at the news and as common soldiers have a way of being proud theyd already figured out what their officers had planned for them caudell said how are we doing up by the orange turnpike we pushed them hard there too all the way back to the germanna ford roadthey dont care for our repeaters not a bit of it faribault answered and a couple of soldiers yowled with glee but the colonel held up a hand i think the yankees have all the artillery in the world set up in the clearing around wilderness tavern general ewell tried mounting an assault on it but the federal guns knocked his men back into the woods soldiers talk is sometimes curiously bloodless caudell did not need any sanguinary speech to picture the storm of shells and cannon balls case shot and grapeshot that must have greeted the onrushing confederatesor the torn and broken bodies that bombardment must have produced hed heard the big guns start to roar late in the afternoon now he knew why whatre they going to do up there colonel otis massey asked that i cant tell you otis for i dont know faribault said i shouldnt worry though i expect general lee will come up with something reckon youre right about that colonel massey said caudell thought so too lee had a way of coming up with something the th north carolina had joined the army of northern virginia after chancellorsville but he knew how lee had divided his outnumbered army and then divided it again to fall on joe hookers flanks and drive him back over the rapidan in dismay and defeat not even all the artillery in the world could long contain a man with the nerve to devise a scheme like that caudell was sure of it want to sleep here tonight colonel he asked it isnt fancy hospitality but its what we have faribaults laugh sounded more tired than amused i thank you first sergeant but ive a ways to go before i think of sleep if im to lead the regiment tomorrow tonight i must learn where this days fighting scattered the men and let them know what is required of them thus far ive found less than a quarter part i expect i shall be busy well into the evening yes sir caudell said he expected that faribault wouldnt sleep at all tonight not if he intended to track down the whole th in the jungle of the wilderness he also saw faribault knew that it was part of what went with being a colonel if one aimed to make a proper job of it as faribault plainly did may we succeed tomorrow as we did today and may god keep all of you safe through the fighting to come faribault said he limped off into the woods before long the occasional spatters of picket firing and the neverending groans from the wounded swallowed the sounds of his footsteps hes a good colonel mollie bean remarked i was just thinking the same thing caudell said as he clicked the receiver plate back into place on his rifle he sees to his men before he worries about himself he spoke as if he were giving a lesson back in the classroom he wanted otis massey to listen to him though a corporal had fewer men in his charge than a colonel he needed to look out for them too but if massey was paying attention he showed no sign of it caudells sigh turned into a yawn he undid his blanket roll wrapped himself up and fell asleep by the fire the long roll woke him early the next morning or so he thought until he realized where he was the rattle was not drumsticks on snares it was gunfire the reports bunched tighter together than the fastest drummer could hurry his sticks the fighting had begun again even if sunrise still lay ahead no time to boil water for a desiccated meal caudell choked down a couple of yankee hardtack biscuits he clicked off the aks safety clicked again to fire single shots the private whod been on watch in the clearing woke the men too worn to rouse even for the racket of battle close by we dont have an officer with us caudell said that was nothing new after the third days fighting at gettysburg three of the ths ten companies had been commanded by sergeants he went on remember though the yankees are likely in worse shape than we are because we whipped their tails yesterday lets go get em one by one the confederates climbed over the rude barricade of branches and earth and stones behind which theyd fought the day before they spread out into a firing line though not one of the paradeground sort not in halflight in rugged overgrown country a rifle fired not far ahead it was a springfield caudell burrowed deep into the brush hed been cursing till that moment he crawled forward twigs and thorns grabbed at his clothes like childrens hands the springfield boomed again he peered through bushes waited something movedsomething blue he fired an instant later a bullet buzzed past his head so close he felt the wind of its passage on his ear it had not come from the man at whom hed shota couple of yankees were working an ambush and hed stumbled right into it he scuttled backwards toward a fallen log hed seen a few yards away another bullet zipped by him before he got there and no sooner had he taken cover than another flew by just over his head he buried his face in the musty dirt a twig the last minié ball had clipped fell on the back of his neck it tickled he did not brush it away after half a minute or so he slid sideways toward the far end of the log he still could not see the federals who were shooting at him but the smoke that lingered in the cool air under the trees told him where they might be he fired several times in quick succession blessing his repeater all the while he didnt know whether hed scored any hits but a thrashing in the bushes ahead said the yankees were getting out of there or he thought it said that these yankees were sneaky customers he advanced with infinite caution only when hed gone past the clump of oak saplings where theyd hidden did he dare believe hed really driven them off he pushed farther south once or twice federals shot at him he shot back again he had no idea whether he hit anyone that was hard enough to tell on a battlefield where the foe stood right in front of you in the wilderness it was impossible he rejoined otis massey and several other soldiers with whom hed spent the night the firing ahead grew ever more intense a few minutes later he discovered why the bluecoats were fighting from behind a breastwork of their own hereabouts it stood at the far edge of a cleared space even with the ak in his hands his mouth went dry at the prospect of charging those blazing rifles form your line here in the woods men an officer said most of the confederates stayed low on their knees or their bellies the officer walked up and down as if on a sunday promenade minié balls made branches dance all around him but he affected not to notice them as he strode past the stump behind which caudell crouched the first sergeant recognized captain john thorp of company a thorp was a slim little fellow with nondescript features he wore a thin line of mustache that tried to give him the air of a riverboat gambler but couldnt quite bring it off however he looked though his courage was beyond reproach make sure your banana clips are full men he said and paused to let the soldiers stuff in as many bullets as they could at my word well give them a good shout and go for their works readynow yelling like fiends the rebels burst from cover and dashed toward the barricade halfmore than halfof caudells yell was raw fear he wondered if that was true of the men to either side of him or if like thorp they were immune to the disease no sooner had the thought crossed his mind than the private on his right spun sideways and crashed to the grass blood spurting from his thigh caudell squeezed the trigger again and again and again his aim was poor but he put a lot of bullets in the air with the ak he could shoot and move at the same time no more stopping to reload under remorseless enemy fire no more ramrod slipping through sweaty fingers no more jabbing it against the ground or hitting it with a rockif you could find a rock more confederates fell but so did yankees in back of the breastwork just in front of caudell a bluecoats head exploded into red ruin he yowled like a catamount and started scrambling over the logs a bayonet almost pinned his arm to the untrimmed branch he was holding with a fourfoot rifle and eighteen inches of steel on the end the snarling federal who stabbed at him had all the advantage in that kind of fight the fellow raised his springfield for another thrust caudell shot him at a range of perhaps a yard the federal folded up like a man punched in the belly unlike a man punched in the belly he wouldnt unfold later then caudell stood on the south side of the barricade another confederate beside him one of them turned east the other west they both shot rapidly down the crumbling yankee linerepeaters were made for enfilade fire federals went down one after another more and more men in gray reached the breastwork caudell suddenly realized the ak wasnt kicking against his shoulder he threw himself flat while he clicked in a fresh clip with his old enfield loading while prone had been next to impossible leaving a man not only without a bullet but a perfect target for any foe who had one still prone caudell started firing again a few yankees kept shooting back at the rebels more fled into the woods some with their rifles some throwing them away to run the faster more yet threw down springfields but did not flee they threw their hands into the air and shouted dont kill us johnny we give up captain thorp sent the bluecoats who had surrendered north over the barricade and into captivity just keep your hands high and youll be all right till someone takes charge of you he told them before giving his attention back to his own men come on weve broken them one more good push and theyll fall to bits south and south againcaudells clothes were tatters by afternoon but he did not care thorp had been right once the yankees field fortifications cracked some of the dogged fight went out of them at last when repeater fire broke out near them they started to yield instead of shooting back or some of them did here and there stubborn bands of bluecoats gave no quarter and asked for none a bullet hissed malignantly past caudell he dove for cover bullets whistled through the brush where he lay he rolled frantically the fusillade continued either that was a couple of squads of yankees up ahead orlee he shouted hurrah for general lee the shooting stopped who are yall a suspicious voice called fortyseventh north carolina hills corps he answered who are you third arkansas longstreets corps the unseen stranger answered what kind of rifle you carryin there noth carolina no yankee was likely to know the right answer to that yet an ak caudell said by way of answer the fellow whod shot at him let loose with an unmistakable rebel yell caudell cautiously stood another man in gray came out of the thicket ahead they clasped hands pounded each other on the back the soldier from arkansas said goddam good to see you noth carolina you too caudell said more than half to himself he added wonderingly we really have broken them he still had trouble believing it but if he and his comrades coming down from the north were meeting longstreets men coming up from the south the federals caught between them had to be in a bad way the private from the d arkansas might have picked the thought right out of his mind damn straight weve broke em he said happily now we pick up the pieces vi general lee sat easily on traveller watching his soldiers splash up out of the rapidan at raccoon ford once on the north side of the river the men paused to put their trousers back on before they formed ranks again many of them had no drawers that bothered lee more than it seemed to bother them they grinned and cheered and waved their hats as they marched past lee waved back every so often letting the men know he saw them and was pleased with them he turned to walter taylor tell me the truth major did you ever expect to see us moving to the attack again of course i did sir his aide answered stoutly startlement filled his eyes as the possible import of the question sank in didnt you i always had the hope of it lee said and let it go at that a new regiment was fording the river its battle flag fluttering proudly as the colorbearer carried it in front of the troops lee had trouble reading a printed page without his spectacles but he easily made out the unit name on the flag forty feet away he called you fought splendidly in the wilderness th north carolina the soldiers hed praised cheered wildly youve made them proud sir walter taylor said they make me proud any officer would reckon his career made to command such men lee said how can i help but admire their steadfastness their constancy and devotion i stand in awe of them yes sir taylor looked back over the rapidan toward the winter encampments of general ewells corps only a few regiments still waiting on the road then all of general hills corps will have crossed along with ewells i wish longstreets men could be with us as well but for the time being i must leave them behind to guard the fords further east lest general grant rather than shifting in response to my movement should try to cross the rapidan again and march on richmond i think that unlikely but neglecting the possibility would be illadvised strange to think of one corps and that made up of but two divisions holding back the whole army of the potomac taylor observed even with our repeaters i am uncertain whether longstreet could do that major but he can certainly delay those people and give us the chance to return and perhaps pitch into their flanks just for a moment lees smile turned savage and let me remind you the whole army of the potomac no longer exists at least not as it did before the fighting in the wilderness began hancocks corps is for all intents and purposes hors de combat and the rest of the federal force received rough handling as well i doubt anything less than that would have persuaded general grant to retreat he had little choice unless he aimed to stay where he was and have his whole army chewed up taylor said another day of fighting at close quarters and hed not have had left an army with which to retreat the maneuver was well executed grant made skillful use of his superiority in cannon to hold off our infantry while he pulled back his own lee stroked his beard as he thought he handles his men better than any previous commander of the army of the potomac save perhaps general meade i believe and he is more aggressive than meade by far taylor grinned one of the prisoners we took said he had the air of a man who had made up his mind to ram his head through a stone wall he ran up against one in the wilderness but he didnt go through no but now we shall have to go through him and that after he has made the acquaintance of our repeaters any man may be taken by surprise once but only a fool will be surprised twice and general grant i fear is not a fool what then sir shall we try to outmarch him and approach washington from the north and west as we did last year i have been considering precisely that lee said no more his mind was not fully made up and might change again but if he moved straight up the line of the orange and alexandria railroad toward washington grant would have to try to block his path without the new repeaters assaulting a bigger army that stood on the defensive would have been suicidally foolhardy lee had made it work even so against hooker at chancellorsville but the wilderness had shown him grant was no hooker grant could be beaten he could not be made to paralyze himself lee made his decision he pulled out pen and pad wrote rapidly then turned to a courier take this to general stuart at once if you please the young man set spurs to his horse rode off at a trot that he upped to a gallop as soon as he could lee felt walter taylors eyes on him he said i have ordered general stuart to use his cavalry to secure the rappahannock crossing at rappahannock station and to hold that crossing until our infantry joins them have you one of taylors eyebrows lifted slightly youll go straight for grant then straight for washington city at least for the time being lee corrected i expect general grant will interpose himself between his capital and me when he does i shall strike him the hardest blow i can and see what comes of it yes sir by taylors tone he pad no doubt what would come of it lee wished he had no doubts himself his aide asked how soon do you think we could reach washington city we could reach it in four or five days lee said taylor stared at him deadpan he went on of course that is only if general grant becomes a party to the agreement without his cooperation we shall probably require rather more time taylor laughed lee allowed himself a smile he had slept perhaps four hours a night since the campaign started rising at three every morning to go see how his men fared he felt fine his chest had pained him a couple of times but one or two of the tablets the rivington men had given him never failed to bring relief he was not used to medicines that never failed with reins and feet he urged traveller forward his aides rode after him he scarcely noticed them he was thinking hard hed beaten grant once and badly but simply beating the army of the potomac did not suffice hed beaten the federals again and again at chancellorsville at fredericksburg at second manassas in the seven days campaign they kept returning to the fray and like the mythical hydra seemed stronger every time they were cast to the ground they were as determined in their insistence that the south return to the union as the confederate states were in their desire to depart from it i must suppress them lee said aloud but how the new repeaters had caught grant by surprise in the wilderness there lee had also been able to use the detailed knowledge of grants movements the rivington men had brought him from theyd wanted to change the world of here and now and theyd succeeded but that meant they were no longer a move ahead of the game as for grant hed handled his army about as well as could be expected given the trouble in which hed found himself in a defensive fight with his powerful artillery to back up his numbers he might yet be very rough indeed and lee wondered how long before some clever northern gunsmith works out a way to make his own ak colonel gorgas had been unsure it was possible gorgas was gifted but for every man like him in the confederacy the north had three or five or ten and the factories to assemble what those gifted men devised if the federals suddenly blossomed forth with repeaters of their own the situation would return to what it had been before the men from out of time arrived not only must i suppress those people i must do it quickly lee said every minutes delay hurt him and helped grant he brought traveller up to a trot the exact moment he got to rappahannock station almost certainly would not matter but all at once any delay seemed intolerable in the middle of the afternoon a courier on a blowing horse rode up to him held out a folded sheet of paper from general stuart sir thank you lee unfolded the paper read we hold rappahannock station federal pickets withdrew northeast past bealeton we pursued and discovered more federals approaching the town from the southeast their cavalry leading we shall endeavor to hold the place unless your orders are to the contrary your most obt servant i e b stuart commanding cavalry bealeton another sleepy hamlet was about to have its name written down in history in letters of blood lee wrote general stuart hold your position at all hazards infantry is advancing in your support r e lee general commanding he gave the message to the courier who booted his tired mount into a trot and then forced a gallop from it lee turned to walter taylor major i should like to confer with my corps commanders we have driven the enemys pickets past bealeton general smart informs me but the main force of the army of the potomac is now approaching that town with a view to contesting our possession of it ill fetch the generals sir taylor said he rode away dick ewell came back to lee first his peg leg sticking out from the saddle at an odd angle as he reined in his horse having fought farther to the north in the wilderness than hills men his corps headed the line of march today he cocked his bald head and listened intently as lee explained the report from smart when lee was done he asked can the troopers hold back the whole federal army long enough to permit us to deploy that is the question lee admitted with their repeaters i hope they may wed best hurry all the same ewell glanced at one of his aides order the men up to quickstep as the aide rode off a p hill rode up always gaunt and holloweyed he no longer seemed on the edge of breaking down as he had before the campaign began victory lee thought agrees with him as he had with ewell he told hill of the new situation hills jaws worked as he listened finally he said i dont care for the prospect of fighting with the river close in our rear we almost paid for that at sharpsburg i remember lee said grant isnt such a slowcoach as mcclellan was either hill persisted he wasnt what youd call smooth in the wilderness but he got more of the army of the potomac into the fight than weve seen before i want him to put his men into the fight if that means they are advancing straight into the fire of our new rifles lee said not even the resources of the north will stand such bloodlettings indefinitely repeatedwhich reminds me have we enough ammunition for another large fight two trains full of cartridges came into orange court house from rivington this morning walter taylor said that should be all right then lee said relieved thanks to the rivington men his soldiers had won a smashing victory in the wilderness thanks to them the army of northern virginia would have the wherewithal to pursue another one but without a continued flow of munitions from the rivington men his army would soon be if it was not already unable to fight at all lee reminded himself to write once more to colonel rains in augusta to see if he had succeeded in producing loads suitable for the ak how would you have us deploy ewell asked lee had been working on that with most of his mind ever since the message came back from the cavalry he saw battlefields as a chess player looked over his board save that for him no two matches were played on the same squares and both players moved at the same time post your men in the most advantageous line south from bealeton toward the rappahannock general using general johnsons division as your reserve he answered general hill you will form the left move behind the line general ewell will establish and into position be prepared to attach or defend as shall seem most advantageous the corps commanders nodded walter taylor drew out a map from a saddlebag unfolded it lee traced with his finger the dispositions he had in mind the generals looked nodded again and rode off hill all business in the saddle ewell instantly recognizable because of his out thrust wooden leg send also to general longstreet major lee said as taylor put away the map tell him he must be ready to move at a moments notice either to pitch into general grants rear or to come to the support of the rest of this army send the order by telegraph he must have it as soon as possible yes sir taylor noted down lees instructions summoned a courier to take them to the armys field telegraphy wagon ill also send a copy by messenger he said very good lee said like the confederacys railroads southern wires were imperfectly efficient he envied the federal army its far more elaborate system but he could have headed that federal army sent messages along that system as he chose having declined he was content to make do with what his chosen country could provide dempsey eure let out a loud unmusical bray if i was a mule theyd shoot me after a march like this on account of i wouldnt be of no more use nohow youre a damn jackass dempsey and youre marchin to give some yankee the chance to shoot you allison high answered a few men who heard the exchange had the breath left to chuckle most simply plodded on too busy putting one foot in front of the other to have room for anything else mulus marianus nate caudell thought in the small pan of his mind not emptied by fatigue he wished captain lewis were close by of all the castalia invincibles lewis was the only other man who had any latin and might have appreciated the allusion but the captains bad foot was giving him trouble on the march and hed fallen back to the rear of the company caudell coughed the th north carolina was not in the lead today the men tramped through a graybrown cloud of dust that left their hides and uniforms the same color every time caudell blinked the grit under his eyelids stung when he spat his saliva came forth as brown as if he were chewing tobacco hed already forded both the rapidan and the rappahannock but the memory of splashing through cool water was only that a memory reality was muggy heat and sweat and dust and tired feet and the distant thunder of gunfire to the east the federals were not going to leave virginia without more fighting and were not of the mind to let the army of northern virginia get free of its home state again either then shots came from the right front not heavy rolling volleys mixed with artillery where general ewells men were already hotly engaged with the federals but a spattering of skirmisher fire grants looking to flank us allison high guessed hes got men and to spare to try it if he didnt lose three for our one in the wilderness ill eat my shoes caudell said and if he did he still has more men than we do high answered which was so manifestly true that caudell could only click tongue between teeth by way of response he tasted wet dust when he did the regimental musicians beat a brisk tattoo on their drums by the right of companies into line captain lewis echoed shouting as loud as he could so the whole company could hear him with a certain relief caudell strode off the dustfilled roadway into the field to one side of it the air would be fresher at least for a while general kirklands whole brigade was shifting into battle formation th th and th north carolina forward with the th and d going into line behind them regimental and company flags took the lead as colorbearers stepped out in front of their units caudell looked leftward for the banner of company e of the th north carolina it was his favorite in the whole brigade he grinned when he spied it though it was too far away to seem more than a tiny green square he knew its devicea snapper with mouth agapeand the company nickname turtle paws spelled out below skirmishers forward colonel faribault yelled men from every company trotted ahead of the main line get a move on nate rufus daniel called when caudell failed to advance with the rest of the skirmishers lieutenant winborne done got hisself shot so theyre your boys caudell was glad for the thick coat of dust on his face no one could see him turn red hed completely forgotten that with the third lieutenant wounded the skirmishers fell to him a couple of them laughed as he dashed up to join them make sure your pieces are loaded and ready he growled the skirmishers paused to check which took their attention off him for a moment they hurried forward each man a couple of yards from his neighbors to either side do we aim to go straight toward the shooting somebody called caudell didnt know the answer third lieutenant will dunn of company e did no were to move to the left of it he answered if theres a hole there well plug it till the rest of the brigade comes up a few minutes later three people sang out yankee skirmishers at the same time wishing for his lost hat caudell raised a hand to shade his eyes sure enough a thin line of bluecoats tiny as insects in the distance was approaching the thin grayclad line of which he was a part behind them a cloud of dust masked more federal soldiers the yankees were still too far away to make worthwhile targets they spotted the rebels at about the same time they were seen caudell watched them adjust their line he admired the way they shifted they might have been on the parade ground exercising for an inspector general rather than maneuvering on the field of battle polished rifle barrels and bayonets revealed the men who kicked up so much dust to their rear lieutenant dunn carried a pair of field glasses on a leather strap around his neck he lifted them to his face for a better look at the foe ahead when he let go with a cry of outrage caudell and all the confederates in earshot stared at him the field glasses had already fallen to his chest again pointing ahead he shouted you know what those are up ahead boys those are nigger troops a couple of rebels started shooting the second they heard that at a range still close to half a mile they did no harm caudell could see whatever color they were the federal skirmishers had the discipline to hold their fire caudells jaw tightened escaped slaves and free negroesthey would have no reason to love southern men any better than he and his comrades loved them the bayonets on aks were permanently secured under the barrel by a bolt caudell hadnt brought his forward at any time during the wilderness fighting neither had any other confederates he remembered seeing now several men paused to deploy them with black men ahead bullets were not enough for them seeing black men in uniform made it literally war to the knife as far as caudell was concerned any man with a rifle musket in his hands be he white black or green was a deadly enemy so long as he wore a blue coat still as if on parade half the yankee skirmishersnow they were close enough for caudell to tell they were negroes with his unaided eyebrought their springfields to their shoulders in smooth unison and fired a volley at caudell and his comrades the range was still long had caudell been leading that federal skirmish line he would not have had his men shoot so soon even so a couple of men from the skirmish line fell groaning and cursing at the same time the negroes who had fired began to reload those who had not raised their weapons to volley again give it to em caudell shouted all the other company skirmish leaders yelled orders that meant the same thing caudell raised his own rifle and started firing while he advanced on the negro skirmishers they began to drop as the confederates repeaters filled the air in their neighborhood with bullets the blacks still on their feet though kept loading and firing as coolly as any veterans a couple of white men with swordsofficers caudell supposedshouted commands to them those officers soon fell they would have been natural targets on any skirmish line and were all the more so here because of whom they led but even after they went down their black soldiers continued to fight steadily jesus god almighty shouted a private named ransom bailey a few feet away from caudell he pointed toward the oncoming line of battle behind the colored skirmishers theys all niggers looks like a division of em worry about them later caudell told him these ones up front are enough trouble for now skirmish lines seldom came to grips with each other one would usually retreat because of the others superior firepower the confederates badly outgunned the black union troops but the negroes would not retreat they made charge after charge against the southerners merciless rifles only when just a handful of them were still on their feet did they stubbornly withdraw by then they did not have far to go the regiments of which they were a part had almost caught up with them the black troops line was wide and deep because their regiments were new and untried they had far more men in them than units which had already seen hard fighting they deployed with the same almost fussy neatness the skirmishers had shown behind caudell behind the whole brigade cannon went off with a crash round shot and shells began landing among the negro soldiers a cannon ball knocked down a whole file of men the negroes did not break their front rank went to one knee the second rank raised rifle muskets above their comrades heads they volleyed as smartly as had the federals rushing up the brock road to attack the breastworks there the th north carolina was not behind a breastwork now it had been hurrying forward to get round the federals right grant had sent these blacks to stop lees advance where they collided they would fight officers shouted advance bugles echoed the command after that blast of fire from the negroes though some confederates would never advance again yankee artillery was on the field too a shell shrieked past caudell exploded just in front of the main rebel battle line the blast and the fragments blew a hole in it the men on either side who had not been hit closed ranks and came on the third and fourth ranks of black soldiers stepped forward while the first and second reloaded their volley was not as neat as the first one had been fire from the confederate repeaters tore at their line officers went down one after another in most units north and south alike officers commonly wore outfits like those of their men but for insignia of rank the better to avoid drawing the enemys eye to them but the men who commanded the black troops stood out not only because of the color of their skin but also for their fancy dress shoot the niggerlovers before the nigs a private not far from caudell shouted many of his comrades seemed to be taking his advice after that second volley the negroes raised a cheera wild shout much closer to a rebel yell than to the northern white soldiers usual hurrahand advanced on kirklands brigade at the doublequick caudell and his fellow skirmishers fell back into their own front ranks to keep the main body of confederates from shooting them in the back between shells and rifle fire the battle din was deafening a near miss from a shell knocked the man beside caudell into him he fell over somehow he hung on to his repeater two men stepped on him before he managed to get to his feet he looked down at himself hardly daring to believe he was still intact muttering a prayer of thanks he started shooting again the black soldiers were frighteningly close theyd taken dreadful casualties but still they came on even as he did his best to kill them caudell admired the courage they showed it occurred to him that george ballentine might have fought well if anyone had given him the chanceand if benny lang hadnt made him want to run away instead because their regiments started so large the colored troops greatly outnumbered the rebels at the start of the engagement that meant they still had men left when their battered line and that of the confederates crashed together they threw themselves on the southerners with bayonets and clubbed muskets the confederates wavered their aks were not made to double as spears but they could still shoot black men fell clutching at chest or belly or legs screams and curses almost overwhelmed the thunder of gunfire right beside caudell a colored soldier drove a bayonet into a southerners belly the confederate shrieked blood dribbled from his mouth he crumpled to the ground as the negro ripped out the bayonet caudell fired at the black man his rifle clicked harmlessly hed fired the last round in his clip without noticing grin flashing whitely in the middle of a black face made blacker by gunpowder stains from minié ball cartridges the negro spun toward caudell ready to spit him too before he could thrust with the bayonet a rebel landed on his back the two men went down in a thrashing heap the confederate tore the springfield from the colored mans hands he heaved himself up onto his knees rammed home the length of edged steel that tipped the musket the negro screamed like a lost soul the southerner stabbed him again and again and again a dozen times a score long after he was dead then grinning like a devil that seizes lost souls he got to his feet thanks billy caudell gasped that was bravely done shitfire caudell you dont got to thank me none for killin niggers billy beddingfield said i do that for my own self handtohand fighting seldom lasted long one side or the other soon found the punishment too much to bear so it was with the black federal troops now they broke away from their foes and retreated to the north the confederates raked them with heavy fire from their repeaters that was finally enough to make the negroes run though even then some turned back to shoot at the southerners a fresh magazine in his ak caudell took his own pot shots at the colored soldiers rescuing him like that was the sort of thing that could earn billy beddingfield his corporals chevrons again as long as the regiment was in active combat he was as good a soldier as any officer could want trouble wits hed already shown he couldnt hold his temper in camp kirklands brigadeheths whole divisionpushed ahead trampling down early wheat and corn as they advanced the very precision of the blacks who opposed them cost those negroes dearly their officers still handled them as if they were in a review rather than a battle and used extra time to make every maneuver perfect meanwhile the ragged confederates took a heavy toll with their repeaters a few negroes tried to surrender when the rebels overran them caudell brusquely jerked the muzzle of his ak southward two frightened blacks babbled thanks as they shambled away a few seconds later a rifle barked behind him he whirled the colored men lay twisted on the ground their blood spilled over cornstalks and soaked into the dirt billy beddingfield stood above them that devilish grin on his face once more theyd given up caudell said angrily a nigger with a rifle in his hands caint give up beddingfield retorted before caudell could answer captain lewis tapped him on the shoulder an ammunition wagon just came up lewis said pointing pullout as many of your skirmishers as you can find then have each man draw two or three clips worth of cartridges make for that stand of plum trees up there he pointed again from there you ought to have a fair shot at that yankee battery thats been tearing us up even as he spoke another shell whistled overhead to land with a crash an instant later caudell looked from the plums to the distant battery the federal artillerymen were busy at their pieces working together with drilled precision even thats long range he said dubiously i know it is lewis said i wouldnt send you out there if we still carried our old muzzleloaders but these repeaters let us send enough bullets their way that some are likely to hit all right sir caudell rounded up four men whod been on the skirmish line with him they got their extra ammunition and made for the plums one was wounded before he got there he staggered back to the rebel line caudell and the other three reached the little grove up ahead the artillerymen were still at their trade one soldier set ball and powder inside a napoleons muzzle another rammed them down to the bottom of the barrel a third jabbed a wire pick through the vent to pierce the bag that contained the powder still another attached primer and lanyard that same man yanked on the lanyard and fired the piece the fellow with the rammer swabbed it down back at the limber that held the ammunition chest two more soldiers handed another bag of powder and a ball to a third who carried them at a run to the man who loaded them into the smoothbore the process began again caudell and his comrades began to interrupt them and the other five gun crews that made up the battery take your best shots he told the skirmishers he and they stood behind stout tree trunks not so much for protection as to give themselves cover we arent going to hit all the time but well do them some harm a gunner went down then another caudell kept firing steadily still another man reeled away from his cannon a few seconds later a rammer was hit as he ran up to the muzzle of his piece with a soaked sponge replacements took over for men wounded or killed they began to fall too although the confederates were shooting from cover the muzzle flashes of their rifles quickly gave them away someone pointed toward the plums artillerymen leaped to a napoleons handspike began swinging the twelvepounder toward the stand of trees even from half a mile the guns bore though only a bit more than four and a half inches wide seemed a huge and deadly cavern to caudell take out that crew he shoutedneedlessly for the skirmishers had already started shooting at the gunners the corporal or sergeant who stood behind the napoleon to gauge the range clapped a hand to his face and toppled a rammer fell grabbing at his leg another man snatched up the swabended pole and carried on the brass cannon belched flame and a great cloud of thick white smoke a round shot smashed a tree not twenty feet from caudell with a noise like a giant clapping hands the artillerymen began their drill once more two more of them went down before they could fire again this time they chose a bursting shell my arm a skirmisher wailed the federal artillerymen stolidly resumed their appointed tasks when yet another man was hurt one of the drivers from the limber crew replaced him another shell exploded in the grove fragments thumped against the trunk which sheltered caudell he fed bullets into a banana clip and hoped the next shell would be a dud federal gunners unfortunately used better fuses than their southern counterparts but the next shell did not come the depleted gun crews fired a last couple of shots then rushed to attach their cannons to the limbers some of them snatched out pistols and began to fire them the drivers urged teams into motion four of the guns in the battery made good their escape caudell shouted with delight as rebels advancing from the southeast swarmed over the other two one of those was the napoleon that had been trying to blast his comrades and him out of the grove we did something worthwhile boys he yelled to the other skirmishers we kept em too busy to run till it was too late for em anyhow the yankee infantry was pulling back too north and east along the line of the orange and alexandria railroad the black foot soldiers did not run like a frightened mob but they did not show the same extraordinary stubbornness they had displayed earlier in the day either against the confederates repeaters that had only gotten more of them killed caudell sent a fatigue party out to a stream not far away he waited to eat until they came back he wanted to boil water for a desiccated meal most of the castalia invincibles did not bother to wait after plundering the haversacks of the black troops theyd fought they had plenty of hardtack and salt pork the rich smell of brewing coffee soon filled the night air around the campfires more than a few confederates sported new blue trousers or new shoesmore spoil from the battlefield they sent them niggers out carrying everything but bake ovens on their backs rufus daniel said he had a new pair of pants himself niggers otis massey spat as he said the word niggers with guns thats what the yankees want to do with usgoddam niggers with guns allover the south a general mutter of agreement rose from the soldiers who heard him dempsey eure said heard tell the yankeesd given em guns but you give a man a gun that dont mean he can fight with it never reckoned in all my born days that if you give a nigger a gun hed fight the way them fellers did theys too stupid to know theys get tin whipped said a private named william winstead more people nodded at that but caudell said you werent with us at gettysburg bill theyd seen what we did to their skirmish line so they had to know they were going into the meat grinder but they kept coming the same way we did then anybody here going to tell me they didnt fight like soldiers only thing niggers is good for is slaves winstead said positively again a good many soldiers nodded along with him caudell wanted to argue more despite questions about georgie ballentine hed always thought pretty much as winstead did so did most people in the south so for that matter did most people in the north but as a teacher hed urged his studentsespecially the bright onesto test what people said about the world against the world itself here what they said and what hed seen didnt add up the same way the negroes had fought as well as anyone could expect one of the other things hed seen in the world though was that most people didnt really want to look at it straight on going with what they saidwhoever they werewas easier and more comfortable than trying to figure out how things truly worked so instead of directly challenging winstead caudell shifted the argument i saw billy beddingfield kill a couple of niggers whod surrendered i didnt reckon that was righti sure as hell wouldnt want them to kill us if we had to give up to them any nigger comes at me with a gun thats a dead nigger winstead said an i wouldnt surrender to em anyways no matter what on account of what theyd do to me if i done it some truth in that caudell had to admit but if they can learn to fight like soldiers they might be able to learn to act like soldiers other ways they better dempsey eure added otherwise this here wars gonna turn even ugliern it is already youve got that right dempsey caudell said this time nobody disagreed who could deny that black men and what to do about them lay at the heart of the war between the states the north was convinced it had the right to dictate to the south how to treat them the south was equally convinced it already knew caudell wanted no part of having someone hundreds of miles away telling him what he could or couldnt do on the other hand if negroes really could fight like white men the souths answers didnt look so good either caudell reflected that america would have been a much simpler place were the black man not around to vex it unfortunately however the black man was here one way or another north and south would have to come to terms with that major marshall i should like you to draft a general order to the army of northern virginia to be published as soon as it is completed lee said yes sir charles marshall took out notepad and pen the subject of the order as you must be aware major the enemy has begun to employ against us large numbers of colored soldiers i aim to order our men that if these colored troops be captured their treatment at our hands is to differ in no particular from that accorded to any other soldiers we take prisoner yes sir behind marshalls spectacles his eyes were expressionless he bent his head and began to write you do not approve major lee said the younger man looked up from the folding table on which he was working since you ask sir in no way do i approve of arming negroes the very concept is repugnant to me lee wondered what his aide would have thought of general cleburnes proposal that the confederacy recruit and use negro troops in pursuit of its independence but president davis had ordered him to keep silent about that instead he said major not least of my concerns in issuing this order is fear for the safety of the thousands of our own captives in northern hands last summer lincoln issued an order promising to kill a confederate soldier for each union man slain in violation of the articles of war and to put at hard labor one man for every black captive returned to slavery by all means make that point explicit in the language of the order to help the men understand its promulgation is among other things a matter of practical necessity youve thought a step farther ahead than i did marshall admitted put that way i see the need for what you have asked of me he bent to his task again this time with a better will a few minutes later he offered lee the draft the general skimmed through it this is very fine major but could you not insert perhaps after the valor of your arms and your patient endurance of hardships something to the effect of your patriotic devotion to justice and liberty you might also end by appealing to the mens sense of duty than which no soldierly virtue is of greater importance marshall noted the changes handed the paper back to lee now we have it lee said have the order distributed at once i want it read in every regiment by this evening or tomorrow at the latest ill see to it sir the aide promised good now on to other business lee unfolded several newspapers these have been sent on to me by those behind federal lines who are in sympathy with our cause not only does the government in washington city often inadvertently reveal its intentions in the press but through it we can gauge northern sentiment toward the war and marshall asked eagerly what is the northern sentiment toward the war now that we have beaten back yet another forward to richmond drive i shall be delighted to provide you with a representative sampling major lee held a newspaper close to his face even with his spectacles the small cramped letters were hard to read this is the new york times disaster grants army overthrown in the wilderness forced to retreat above the rappahannock and there defeated once more below these headlines the story continues as follows unhappily like many of our engagements the late fighting though serving to illustrate the splendid valor of our troops has failed to accomplish the object sought the result thus far leaves us with a loss of upwards of men in the two battlesuseful information thereand absolutely nothing gained not only did the rebels hold their lines but they are advancing behind the impetus of their new breechloading repeaters against which the vaunted springfield is of scarcely greater effect than the red mans bows and arrows i wish that were true marshall said it would make the task before us rather easier would it not lee chose another paper here is a statement from stanton the federal secretary of war as reported in the washington evening star a noble enthusiasm must reanimate our gallant army who have been battling so long for the preservation of the union we have it is true recently met with serious disasters we have suffered much and must be prepared to suffer more in the cause for which we are struggling let us then fellow countrymen tread the plain path of duty let us show the fortitude endurance and courage of our race and not permit the brute force of the enemys arms to extinguish the life of this republic marshall smiled the special smile of a man contemplating his foes discomfiture that sir is a cry of pain so it is secretary stanton is notorious for them lee said he shook his head it is also almost perfectly foolish so far as i am concerned so far as anyone in richmond is concerned the united states may proceed exactly as they care to provided only that they extend to us the same privilege does stanton go on oh at some length lee put the newspaper aside none of it however is much more to the point than that which i just read you charles venable came into lees tent dispatches from richmond sir and a copy of yesterdays daily dispatch he glanced over at the northern papers on the folding table i suspect its tone is rather more cheerful than theirs i suspect you are correct major lee said business before pleasure however the dispatches if you please venable handed them to him as he read the first he felt a great load of worry lift from his shoulders general johnston has held general sherman at rocky face ridge with heavy losses on the federal side and then again at resaca and snake creek gap when he tried to use his superior numbers to outflank us shermans forces are now halted prisoners report he dares not seek to outflank us again for fear of the casualties he would sustain from our rifles business and pleasure together venable exclaimed true enough major lee had feared that only his own army would derive full benefit from the repeaters the rivington men had provided hed never been so glad to be proved wrong true johnston had given up a little ground to the enemy instead of advancing as the army of northern virginia was doing but the enemy in georgia had more room to maneuver than was true here and johnston was a counterpuncher in any case a master of the defensive lee would not have wanted to be a federal general assaulting a position he chose to hold the more so when his men were armed with aks what is the other dispatch sir we shall know in a moment lee opened the envelope he read the paper inside refolded it and put it back in its place before he lifted his head to face his aides both of whom were fidgeting in an effort to contain their curiosity lee said in southwestern virginia general jenkins with twentyfour hundred men was engaged by federal general george crook with between six and seven thousand on the ninth of this month just south of cloyds mountain yes sir the two men said together they both sounded anxious close to threetoone was long odds against any army lee lifted their suspense our troops succeeded in holding their position the federals withdrew to the north and west up the dublinpearisburg turnpike among their dead were general crook and colonel rutherford hayes who commanded a brigade of ohioans i regret to have to add that general jenkins was also wounded in the action and had his right arm amputated but as general mccauslandwho replaced himadds the victory has preserved our control of the virginia and tennessee railroad without which rail connection between the two states would have been broken thats excellent news sir charles marshall said perhaps the tide has turned at last perhaps it has lee said the words seemed to hang in the air as if only now when he spoke them aloud did he acknowledge their truth in his heart hed grown so accustomed to fighting at long odds that the edge the rivington mens repeaters gave remained difficult to believe in completely he read on in the dispatch general mccausland reports that a prisoner declared the fire from our repeaters made the battlefield appear one living flashing sheet of flame the daily dispatch certainly thinks the war as good as won charles venable began to read from the newspaper hed brought our information is such as to give encouragement to the hope that the sacred soil of virginia will soon be rescued from the hands and divested of the polluting tread of the yankee invader the great battles of the week just past fought in the wilderness and in and around the hamlet of bealeton resulted in the overthrow of the army of the federal government with a loss that is perhaps unequalled in the annals of the present war general lee has utterly routed the force under meade and grant there are no grounds upon which to question the glorious success of our arms were wars fought in the newspapers they would be won by both sides in the first days after they were declared lee observed in one way that would be as well for it would spare a great part of the effusion of blood which accompanies warfare as it actually is in another sense though newspaper chatter can be dangerous if those responsible for actually prosecuting a war take seriously the contempt for the foe which is typical newspaper fare they leave themselves open to a defeat for which they would have only themselves to blame but we actually do have the federals on the run venable protested no one could be gladder than ito see those people in retreat major lee said but if we only drive them into the fortifications across the potomac from washington city then we have gained nothing but time and these people can make better use of time than we they have come back from too many defeats i want to give them a lesson sharp enough to impress itself upon even the most stolid and stubborn of their leaders what do you intend sir charles marshall asked slamming his way straight up the line of the orange and alexandria no longer seemed as attractive to lee as it had before he traced on the map the plan that had come to slow fruition in his mind this will require general stuarts cavalry to more effectively screen our forces from the enemy than was achieved in last years campaign but i trust and believe he has learned that lesson by heartand once more the repeaters his troopers carry will aid their efforts as for general longstreets part in keeping the enemy off balance no one i think could play it better major marshall if you would be so kind marshall took out the pad on which he had drafted lees general order the leader of the army of northern virginia began to frame the specific commands that would set his men in motion once more andries rhoodies horse came trotting up to lee as he rode alongside the head of a long column of grayclad troops the rivington man politely stayed a few feet outside the group of generals and officers with lee and waited to be recognized good morning mr rhoodie lee said he studied the way rhoodie handled his bay gelding your horsemanship has improved sir since i first had the pleasure of your acquaintance ive had a good deal of practice since then general lee rhoodie answered before i came to join your army id spent little time on horseback the officers with lee concealed scornful expressions some well some not so well a man who habitually rode in a buggy was hardly a man at alland what other reason could there be for eschewing horses lee thought he knew the answer to that question which to the others must have been purely rhetorical by the distant year men must have discovered better means of transport than either horses or buggies lee wondered whether railroads ran down the center of every street in every city in the almost unimaginable time from which the rivington man had sprung one day he might ask rhoodie about such things the priceless knowledge that man had to hold in his head no time now though no time all too likely until the war was done no time for anything save the immediate till the war was done to the immediate then how may i help you today mr rhoodie id like to speak with you in private general lee if i could rhoodie said wait until i finish my business with these gentlemen sir then i am at your disposal lee said the staff officers took his ready acquiescence without blinking but some of his commanders raised eyebrows rhoodie wore no uniform save the mottled clothing the rivington men habitually usedwho was he to deserve their chiefs sole attention lee gave them no chance to dwell on it now gentlemen lets make certain of our dispositions as we approach middleburg the division commanders and brigadiers rode off to make sure their forces conformed to the line of march lee had spelled out he glanced at his aides they fell back fifteen or twenty yards lee nodded to andries rhoodie he brought his bay up shoulder to shoulder with traveller and what can i do for you sir lee asked rhoodies answer took him by surprise you can rescind your general order for treating captured kaffirsniggerslike white prisoners of war not only that general lee you can do it immediately i shall not nor let me remind you have you the right to take a tone of command to me sir lee said coldly common humanity forbids it not only in regard to our treatment of the federals colored troops but also in that the federals have promised to mistreat the prisoners they hold to the same degree to which we maliciously harm their men you go about giving the nigger equality in anyone way general lee and you set foot on the path to making him equal in all ways rhoodie sounded less peremptory than he had a moment before but no less serious that is not what america will break stands for general if you dont care to bear that in mind we dont care to keep providing you with ammunition lee swung his head around to stare at the rivington man rhoodies smile was less than pleasant lee nodded slowly having wondered if this moment would ever come he was the more ready for it now that it was here he said if president davis ordered me to do such a thing sir i should present him with my resignation on the spot to you i shall merely repeat what i said a moment before no he urged traveller up to a trot to leave rhoodie behind rhoodie stayed with him he was a better rider than he had been he said think carefully about your decision general remember what will happen to the confederacy without our repeaters i remember what you said lee answered with a shrug i have no way of verifying it for myself save by living up to the days i bid you remember that if our cause should fail yours fails as well you must act as your conscience dictates mr rhoodie as shall i now it was rhoodies turn to stare at lee you would sacrifice your precious virginia for the sake of kaffirs who were doing their best to kill your own men as general forrest has said upon occasion war means fighting and fighting means killing but there is a distinction to be drawn between killing on the battlefield where foes face one another man against man and army against army and killing helpless prisoners after the fighting is done it is the distinction between man and beast sir and if it is a distinction you find yourself incapable of drawing i shall pray to god for the salvation of your soul i believe in my heart general lee that god has established that white men are to rule over blacks rhoodie said and lee no mean judge of character discerned nothing but sincerity in his voice the rivington man went on as for general forrest his men didnt take any high moral tone when they captured fort pillow last month they found kaffirs in arms there and they disposed of them lees mouth twisted in a grimace of distaste the report of the fort pillow massacre had come to his notice for a moment he wondered how rhoodie had heard of it then he shook his head annoyed at himself in one sense rhoodie had known about fort pillow for a century and a half lee said general forrest is not under my command i would never deny his abilities as a soldier of his other qualities i am less well qualified to speak in point of fact most of what hed heard about nathan bedford forrest was unsavory much of the fortune the man had amassed before the war came from slave trading less than a year ago hed been shot by a disgruntled subordinate whom hed proceeded to stab to death with a penknife he would never have fit in among the virginia aristocrats from whose numbers lee sprang but only jeb stuart deserved to be mentioned in the same breath as a confederate cavalry commander rhoodie said america will break is happier with forrests performance than with yours general lee i tell you again if you do not rescind that general order we will be forced to cut off your supply of cartridges lee thought about swooping down on rivington with a couple of brigades that would assure the confederacy of however many cartridges were there but how many was that as secretary of war seddon had said the place seemed more a transshipment point than a factory town and for all lee knew the rivington men could disappear into the future and never come back he rather wished they would though what point to a raid on them then he said as i told you mr rhoodie do as you feel you must and i shall do likewise for now i wish you a good morning you will regret this general lee rhoodie said though he held his voice low and steady he could not keep angry blood from mounting to his cheeks he jerked his horses head around hard enough to draw an angry snort from the animal he rode off at a fast trot looking neither right nor left the staff officers rejoined lee as soon as rhoodie had gone charles marshall looked after the rivington man am i to construe that he did not gain of you that which he had hoped for he asked with lawyerly curiosity you may construe it if you like major lee said drily before too long the whole army may well construe it nevertheless we shall proceed all his aides looked curiously at him when he said that he said no more if rhoodie did indeed cut off the flow of ak ammunition it would soon become obviousperhaps not so soon as it might have under other circumstances for the retreating federals had wrecked the railroad between catletts station and manassas junction which left the army of northern virginia dependent upon horsedrawn wagons for supply but pretty soon just the same the aides had learned better than to push lee when he did not care to be pushed everyone in the army knew better than to push him save occasionally james longstreet that made rhoodies blunt demand all the more startling and all the more annoying lee angrily tossed his head to one side as if snapping at his own ear no matter how sweetly the rivington man framed that demand he would have refused it what if no more cartridges were forthcoming lee thought about that he did not care for any of the conclusions he reached reequipping his army with repeaters had taken a couple of months if he required that much time to go back to rifle muskets the army of northern virginia was done for the army of the potomac would never leave it alone long enough to make the changeover not in spring he reproached himself for not having had his men pick up the precious brass cartridges theyd expended in the fighting thus far even if colonel gorgas and colonel rains had to load them with ordinary black powder and unjacketed lead bullets theyd keep the aks in action a while longer he thought about sending men back to bealeton to glean such cartridges as they couldin the miserable tangles of the wilderness the brass was likely gone forever he decided to hold off he had succeeded in imposing his will upon federal generals throughout the war even the capable aggressive and determined grant now moved to his tunethanks in no small measure to andries rhoodies repeaters now to learn whether he could outlast rhoodie a man nominally an ally in strength of purpose the army continued past the dormered cottages of middleburg on toward leesburg and waterford stuarts cavalry slashed up to seize a stretch of the alexandria loudon and hampshire railroad and keep grants men from using the train to get to leesburg first lee ordered the troopers to hold the federal infantry as long as they could he would never have given such a command to soldiers with singleshot rifles but one man with an ak was worth a fair number with springfieldsand by now the federals knew that as well as lee did the lead elements of the army of northern virginia went through leesburg the next day tramping past the elms and oaks that shaded the whitepillared buildings of the courthouse square lee rode back to check on the ammunition supply and learned a new wagon train had just come in up from the end of the warrenton railroad spur excellent he said softly excellent a few minutes later he saw andries rhoodie riding along beside the long gray files of confederates he gave no sign hed noticed the rivington man but affectionately patted the side of travellers neck with a gloved hand hed called rhoodies bluff and got away with it rhoodie needed him as much as he needed rhoodie rain in his face rain turning the roadway to muddy soup nate caudell slogged on when the weather was fine hed wished for rain to cut the dust now that he had it he wished for dust again mud was worse the road already chewed up by countless feet disappeared into water ahead whites ford had steep banks two years earlier stonewall jackson had had to dig them down before wagons and artillery could cross caudell held his repeater and haversack over his head as he splashed into the potomac the river was waisthigh he did not mind he was already soaked he knew only relief that the rain hadnt made the water at the ford rise any higher regimental bands played on the northernhere actually the easternbank of the potomac the downpour did nothing to improve their musicianship but caudell recognized maryland my maryland as it had the previous two summers the army of northern virginia stood once more on northern soil thanks to the rain that soil clung to caudell in abundance similarly bedraggled dempsey eure observed if this really was my maryland im damned if id go boasting about it doesnt look like much does it caudell agreed the wet weather kept him from seeing a great deal in any case even the long low bulk of south mountain to the west lay shrouded in mist and rain but he remembered maryland as distinctly poorer country than the fat farms and houses farther north in pennsylvania and though maryland was a slave state its citizenry did not gather at whites ford to greet the army of northern virginia not a civilian was in sight somewhere out there caudell was sure federals scouts and pickets waited to catch their first glimpse of the men in gray that could not be helped caudell knew more fighting lay on this side of the potomac come on you invincibles first lieutenant willie blount shouted keep it moving plenty more behind us by god caudell and the other sergeants echoed the command they and their men crossed the chesapeake and ohio canalwhich ran parallel to the potomacon a makeshift bridge the army engineers had thrown across at a lock a cavalryman sat his horse at a crossroads not far past the canal rain dripped from his horses mane and tail from the brim of his hat from the end of his nose he used his saber to wave everyone south after a couple of miles the road branched again this time several horsemen waited at the fork whose division one of them called general heths caudell answered along with several other men the rider held out a gloved hand to shield a list from the downpour after he checked it he pointed southeast rather than due south yall are on the road to rockvillefifteen miles maybe a tad more give it all you can youre supposed to be there by sundown the fellow was too obviously an officer to make laughing in his face a good idea but caudell felt like it nor was he the only one snorts and halfstifled guffaws rose from the throats of a good many safely anonymous privates trudging along in line the th north carolina had crossed the potomac a little before noon it had to be after that hour now fifteen miles by sunset was forcedmarch speed but might have been possible on a dry road in mud it was not going to happen well do our best caudell said the horseman waved an acknowledgment he didnt repeat the order so he probably knew it couldnt be carried out caudell marched on while maryland was not flowing with milk and honey it also hadnt been a continual battleground the foraging looked good general lees orders required any requisitioned goods to be paid for with confederate money with the confederate dollar worth only a few cents in gold caudell did not mind throwing away some paper if that meant he could take what he needed the regiment did not make rockville by the time darkness fell instead of marching on through the night colonel faribault pulled his men off the road to camp in a wheat field ill be glad for a little sleep caudell said relief in his voice as he struggled to get a campfire going with damp fuel and water still drizzling down from the sky fancypants officers with their suede gloves can order you to march to hell and gone but they dont know anything about what its like to fight once youve got there yall got that one right nate allison high said here you want to take a burnin branch from me i got this here fire goin pretty good even if it is smoky enough for a smudge thanks allison with the help of the branch caudells fire finally caught it too put out a great cloud of greasy black smoke if this were daylight i reckon the yankees in washington city would figure we were burning rockville from all the smoke were making hell with rockville tall and lean the firelight reflecting redly from his eyes high resembled nothing so much as a leading wolf in a pack closing in on prey if im to do some burnin let me do it in washington city thatd be a burnin to remember an a foragin wed never forget what do you want to bet marse roberts right now cypherin out how to do it no bet allison he cant be doing anything else not with us in maryland the mere thought of foraging in the vast federal supply depots by washington made caudell breathe hard but taking the northern capital would mean more than that if we take washington the wars as good as won wouldnt that be somethin allison high said dreamily he looked south and east as if he could pierce rain and night and close to twenty miles distance to see the white house and abraham lincoln cowering inside it caudell feared that lincoln wasnt cowering theres forts all around the place they say attacking the field works on cemetery ridge left him leery of moving against positions prepared years in advance and filled with guns bigger than any that could keep up with an army on the move but high so often gloomy like the current weather was for once nothing but sunshine yeah theres forts but wheres old abe gonna find the men to put in em only federals in the whole world can fight a little bit is in the army of the potomac an thats on account of they learned from us longstreets givin grant hell down the other side of the potomac an well surely whip any greenhorns the yankees stick in those works o theirs hope youre right allison caudell glanced fondly at his ak without the repeaters how could lee have dared to attack grants whole army with one undersized corps even with them the first sergeant could not imagine longstreet defeating the immense army of the potomac but if he could keep the federals in play offer threat enough to prevent them from filling the trenches in front of lees men elbow to elbow with men in blue coatsif he could do that nate caudell had some hope of going home to nash county once the war ended if longstreet failed caudell would be lucky if his name was written in pencil on a piece of board above the shallow grave that would hold him he wrapped his rubber blanket around himself to hold mud and rain at bay his worries were not enough to keep him awake not after the marching and fighting hed been through he slept like a stone when he awoke before dawn the next morning shots were coming from rockville the thunder of field artillery every so often braying through crackling rifle fire he gnawed on corn bread a weevil crunched between his teeth he ignored it and finished the small square loaf he was still chewing when the th north carolina moved out as he drew closer to the fighting he recognized the reports of the federal rifles ahead hed heard their like in the first hours of fighting in the wilderness sounds like dismounted yankee cavalry with those sevenshot spencers of theirs he said that could be trouble those are about the best rifles they have there aint enough dismounted cavalry in the whole goddam united states army to slow us down rufus daniel said not with these here guns in our hands he was right the federals fought briskly but by the time the th north carolina came up to rockville they had already been driven out of town confederate cannon had knocked down some of the houses a couple of them were burning as caudell marched past a dead bluecoat lay in the street another one hung limply from a window of the hungerford tavern his blood ran down the wall collected in a puddle under him not far away sprawled a rebel in butternut equally dead yankee field artillery was still in business south of rockville throwing shells into the town to slow the confederate advance caudell ducked involuntarily as a projectile screamed by overhead and landed with a crash behind him a moment later human screams joined the shells mindless shrieks that one had struck home but the federal field guns could not hold their positions not after the dismounted cavalrymen who protected them had been driven out of rockville they limbered up and rolled off as caudell watched two horses in one team went down the drivers cut them out of harness the bronze napoleon limped away hauled by the four animals left to the team the dismounted federals kept up a stubborn rearguard action fighting from behind boulders apple trees and farmhouses to let the cannon make good their escape nor were the guns alone in their flight from the army of northern virginia wagons and carriages of every description filled the road that led to washington doesnt seem like yankee civilians much care to take what their armys been dishing out in virginia caudell said pointing to the swarm of refugees ahead reckon they figure we owe em somewhat for that rufus daniel said he shifted his pipe to one corner of his mouth spat out of the other might could even be theyre right maybe caudell looked southeast nothing lay between lees soldiers and washington city but its ring of forts it was a big but he suspected marse robert would keep the army too busy for it to do much wrecking for wreckings sake vii the spyglass showed lee a small bright circle in the middle of blackness it made the heart of washington city seem close enough to reach out and touch there was the white house flanked on the right by the threestory brick building with columned entranceway that housed the federal war department on the left by the greek revival columns of the huge treasury department building with the smaller state department headquarters in front of it south of the white house across a lot empty but for temporary barracks he could make out the tall but unfinished obelisk intended to honor george washington to the east the capitol its great dome done at last lee admired lincoln for continuing work on the dome in the midst of war it showed the northern president thought about more than the immediate present lee frowned a little how to reconcile such thoughtfulness with the vicious tyrant andries rhoodie had described he dismissed the irrelevant problem as he lowered the glass sweeping in an instant across the city to the works that held him away from it those works were formidable the federals had cut down all the trees within two miles in front of them to rob advancing rebels of cover from the big guns in their forts a network of trenches in front of the forts protected them and the field artillery positions between them if it were done when tis done then twere well it were done quickly lee murmured macbeth charles venable said beside him in this instance major we would be wise to heed the bards tactical advice lee passed the long brass tube to his aide examine the trenches carefully if you would they are not yet full and the men in them i hear are garrison troops not the veterans of the army of the potomac we may break through tonight tomorrow will be far more difficult and the day after surely impossible tonight venable echoed lee glanced at him with amusement are you so careful of your words that you expend them only as single shots yes tonight the worst mistake i ye made in all this war and the one that cost us dearest was the assault on cemetery ridge that third day at gettysburg the position ahead is stronger and the cannon in it bigger were we to make a daylight attack they would slaughter us before we drew close enough for our repeaters to rescue us in the darkness they will have more difficulty finding proper targets but a night battle venable had more than one word at a time in him after all how do you propose to control a night battle sit i dont propose to lee answered he almost laughed at the shocked look on venables face can we but come to close quarters with the enemy i think we shall break through somewhere along the line once we do the advantage will be oursand with it i hope washington city yes sir venable did not sound convinced lee was not altogether convinced himself he was convinced however that the army of northern virginia would never have a better chance to take washington and if the federal capital fell into southern hands how could britain and france and the rest of the world continue to deny the confederate states of america were as true and genuine a nation as the united states the stakes made the risk worthwhile he dictated orders sent them to his corps commanders the army began to shift into a line that centered on the seventh street road from the earthworks of fort slocum in the east past fort stevens to fort de russy in the southwest the sun slipped down the western sky lee watched the federal lines and waited he did his best to appear impassive but his heart thudded in his chest and with the thudding came pain absently he slid one of the little white pills from andries rhoodie under his tongue the pain went away twilight was deepening when walter taylor came up and said sir rhoodie requests permission to speak to you the rivington man had not been so formal before lee defied him at first lee intended to say he was too busy then remembering the nitroglycerine tablet he softened tell him he may but to be quick taylor led rhoodie up to lee general rhoodie said politely dipping his head lee returned the gesture taking lees warning literally rhoodie plunged ahead general lee if you intend to attack the federal forts tomorrow my men and i can help i intend to attack tonight sir lee answered and had the somber satisfaction of watching rhoodies jaw drop the rivington man muttered something in his own guttural language but he quickly recovered youre as bold as you are said to be thats certain we can still help you maybe even more whatever the differences you and i have had america will break aims for the south to win this war that was the gamble lee had made when he defied the big man from the future now he said thank you mr rhoodie but youve already furnished us plenty of repeaters he pointed to the ak slung on rhoodies back the handful you and your comrades might add will make scant difference in the outcome of the fight but we have something you do not the rivington man took from his knapsack a greenpainted spheroid a little bigger than a baseball a metal shaft stuck out from it this is a rifle grenade general the ak can shoot one about three hundred yards they should do nicely for spreading confusion in the federal trenches and forts wouldnt you say a rifle grenade the federals sometimes used hand grenades fused with percussion caps they were however limited by the strength of a mans arm shot from riflesit would almost be as if we were shelling them without employing artillery wouldnt it exactly rhoodie said any surprise we can effect will surely accrue to our advantage very well mr rhoodie you and your men may proceed i aim to move forward at ten tonight you will i presume wish to obtain your firing positions somewhat before that time yes general let us move out a bit ahead of your forces so we can soften the way for them i sincerely appreciate your joining in our fight sir though he did not say so lee was also curious to see how the rivington men would fare in combat konrad de buys fought well enough on horseback to satisfy as exacting a critic of courage as jeb stuart so far as lee knew though none of the other men from america will break had gone into action he thought of them more as military engineers than frontline troops of course his own career had also begun in the engineersgood luck to you mr rhoodie thank you general may we meet again tomorrow inside washington rhoodie touched a finger to the brim of his mottled cap and hurried away lee watched till he was out of sight however brutal some of the principles he espoused he knew the right wish to make pin that on there good for me nate alsie hopkins said caudell made sure the scrap of paper was securely attached to the back of hopkinss shirt as he stepped away the private went on thanks for writin it for me too i hope you dont need it thats all alsie caudell said hed written names and home towns or counties for several soldies already tonight if they died assaulting the fortifications aheadwhich seemed only too likelytheir loved ones might eventually learn they had fallen for that matter hed had edwin powell pin his own name on the back of his shirt he saw mollie bean checking her rifle by firelight he knew she had trouble with her letters hed taught her a little out of a primer every so often but when he asked her if she wanted him to write her name for her she shook her head only people who care a damn whether i live or die are right here in the company with me captain lewis strode from fire to fire into formation he said quietly its time no drums or bugles announced the rebels assembly the better to keep the federals from learning what lee intended the sky was gray and overcast as caudell came to the edge of the strip the yankees had denuded of standing trees the federal forts and trenches that lay on the high ground ahead were deeper darknesses against the night caudell was grateful no moonlight betrayed his comrades to the bluecoats with field glasses and telescopes who were surely peering out at their foes we advance in skirmisher order captain lewis said theyll hurt us less with their artillery that way and the repeaters should let us fight through their trenches once we get up to them god bless every one of you and may you all come through safe you too capn several soldiers called to him caudell said nothing aloud but the thought was in his mind lewis held his watch close to his face waited swung his arm forward caudell and the companys other proper skirmishers moved out ahead of the rest of the men he felt horribly exposed to the yankee guns as if he were going into battle naked he quivered every time he stepped on a dry leaf or broke a twig with his foot like flowing shadows the confederates moved forward all along the line it seemed impossible the federals could not see them could not hear the beat of their feet against the soil the jingle of cartridges in their pockets but stride after cautious stride brought caudell closer to the enemy works without the slightest sign the men inside them guessed he and his fellows were coming the ground was so bad a tight battle line could not have held together in any case not even in daylight the federals had left on the ground most of the trees theyd felled caudell was constantly on the dodge and fell several times when branches he hadnt seen tripped him hed advanced perhaps a third of the way when the federals woke up drums began to pound within their lines beating out the same long roll that called the confederates to action a flash of light from an opening in the embrasure of fort stevens a booma louder deeper boom than any hed heard from a cannon beforeand a shell screamed through the night to crash down somewhere behind caudell men screamed back there another blast came and another and another as all the forts eightinch howitzers and thirtypounder parrott rifles opened up sparks of light blinked on and off in the rifle pits in front of the main federal trench they reminded caudell of the fireflies hed always loved he would not think of fireflies in the same way again still pickets shooting into the night at the range of a mile could hit someone only by luck more explosions came from fort stevens not all of them though seemed to accompany shots from the big siege gunssome sounded more like shells landing than cannon going off but lees field artillery was only now starting to go into action it had had to move up with the infantry so its guns could reach the forts whatever the explosions were they disrupted the smooth firing caudell had seen from the federal artillerymen outside bealeton that was a blessingevery northern shell not fired meant southern men not dead some of the flashes from the yankee rifle pits were not aimed at the oncoming confederates but at each other or perhaps at a space between two of them no sooner had caudell made that guess than a chatter of ak fire confirmed it somehow lee had snuck somebody up close to the federal line before the main attack got rolling caudell wondered if those advance scouts were somehow responsible for the troubles the federal cannoneers were having he hoped so he tramped on toward the waiting federals here and there soldiers in the rebels leading ranks began to shoot he knew those bullets were probably wasted but sometimes a man had to answer the enemies who were trying to lay him low he was within a couple of hundred yards of the abatis of downed trees that protected the trenches ahead when one of the guns from fort stevens let go with a blast of canister he threw himself flat when he heard the deadly hiss of the lead balls canister fire from a napoleon was dreadful enough canister fire from an eightinch gunwhen he turned his head he saw that a gap had been blown in the line to his right as neatly and thoroughly as if the men had been swept away by a broom by then the yankees were shooting from their main line caudell stayed low trying to find a swell of ground behind which to shelter before he scuttled forward again the abatis loomed ahead already rebels were pulling saplings out of the way to make paths for their comrades to reach the trenches the bluecoats shot them down as they worked more men took their places others answered the federal fire had they had only rifle muskets their task would have been hopeless for they were exposed while their enemies enjoyed good shelter but the aks fired enough faster than springfields to redress the balance as more and more confederates got up to and through the abatis they began to beat down the defenders fire sharp branches tore at caudells clothes as he pushed toward the trench line for a moment he thought he was back in the wilderness some of the undergrowth there had been about as thick as this deliberately made obstruction the federal fire was worse here though he saw the glint of a rifle barrel as it swung to point straight at him he fired first then ducked lowthe muzzle flash would have drawn yankees notice to him sure enough two bullets cracked through the space where he had been standing a moment before he crawled forward there was already fighting in the trenches confederates and federals shooting and shouting and cursing as hard and fast as they could he recognized springfields by their reports and by the clouds of smoke that rose like swirling fog when they were fired he shot into the fogbank once twice heard a man cry out he thought the cry carried a northern accent he hoped it did he slid down into the trench on his backside keep moving a southern voice cried authority behind it we dont want to stay stuck in these damned trenches its the city we want washington city keep moving that was easier said than done the federals fought desperately their numbers made their singleshot muzzleloaders almost a match for the rebels repeaters every new corner in the earthworks brought deadly danger in handtohand combat the bayonets that tipped yankee springfields were actually of use a shell landed in a federalheld section of trench caudell yowled like a catamount then another shell exploded and another and another the blasts spaced much too close together to come from even the quickestfiring gun what the hell is that somebody shouted i dont rightly know but i think its on our side caudell shouted back anything less than a shout went unnoticed in the din he howled out a rebel yell as much to tell himself he was still alive and fighting as for any other reason yet another of those mysterious shells crashed down among the yankees behind caudell somebody yelled go on you lazy buggers ive put the fear of god in them for you the shouter did not sound like a southern man but caudell recognized his voice all the same it was benny lang he turned around for a moment he thought the rivington man had the trick of invisibility not only were his clothes splotchy but hed also painted his face in dark jagged stripes only his fierce grin told where he was instead of his usual cap he wore on his head what looked like a mottled pot what the devils that caudell asked pointing a helmet lang answered you bloody bastards can do just as you please but i dont fancy getting shot in the heador anywhere else come to that he had an ak in his hands and another on his back he stuffed something fairsized and roundish into the muzzle of the rifle he was holding when he fired the report sounded strange almost metallic an instant later another crash went up from the trenches lang must have seen caudells flabbergasted expression his voice was smug rifle grenade whatever you say without thinking caudell grabbed the rivington man by the arm and yanked him toward the fighting come on lets take em out only later did he remember that lang could have thrown him through the air if he didnt care to come along but lang just shrugged and followed the grenade bombardment cleared a long stretch of trench caudell stepped on and over bodies some still others thrashing in torment not only that the rain of explosives seemingly from nowhere had set a good many unhurt yankees running not all though a bluecoat raised himself up on one knee fired from the hip the bullet caught benny lang in the belly oof he said caudell cut the federal down with a short burst of fire then he turned to see how lang was actually he was already sure belly wounds always killed if not from loss of blood then from fever but lang was not down and screaming was not in fact down at all he hurried past caudell calling back over his shoulder come on damn it theyre wavering we can break them wait a minute caudell reached out and took langs shoulder this time to hold him back i saw you shot he shouted in the rivington mans face why arent you dead put that way the question sounded stupid but caudell didnt care he didnt think he believed in ghosts either but he would hardly have been surprised to feel his fingers sink straight through what should have been benny langs flesh but lang remained solid under the brim of his helmet his thin face bore a smirk yes i was shot my bellyll have a bruise tomorrow too i should expect as for why im not dead he took caudells hand set it where the minié ball had struck under his tunic he wore something with flat hard scales flak jacket whats a flapjack caudell asked wondering if hed heard straight its body armor now get moving damn you weve wasted too bloody much time here already caudell got moving his mind awhirl no one wore armorarmor thick enough to stop a rifle bullet would have put enough steel on a soldier to double his weight but there went benny lang moving lightly down the length of trench hed cleared the trench where his guts and his life hadnt spilled into the dirt caudell wanted to shake the rivington man like a terrier shaking a rat to shake from him the secret of where hed found that impossible armor the same place he found his rifle grenades the first sergeant thought and then a moment later the same place the rivington men found these aks the only trouble was caudell could not imagine where in the world that place might be he did not dwell on it for long the federals tried to counterattack but by then enough rebels had come forward to chew their assault to bloody rags and then without warning a blast like the end of the world came from fort stevens caudell staggered he dropped his rifle to clap both hands to his ears bursting shells filled the sky a thousand fourths of july an boiled down into an instant night turned to noon he saw benny langs lips move as that unnatural light faded but his hearing was still stunned he shook his head as he stooped to recover his repeater lang put his mouth against his ear and screamed the magazines gone up he heard the rivington man as if from many miles away but he heard him maybe he wouldnt be deaf forever after an and certainly he thought as the ability to think slowly returned fort stevens wouldnt work any more murder against the men in gray a little later another magazine this one from a fort farther away also blew up fort de russy lang shoutedhe didnt quite have to scream anymore for caudell to hear him or maybe that was battery sill between stevens and de russy caudell didnt care which magazine it was he was just glad it was gone he heard a roar ahead that he heard it meant it was loud wondering what had gone wrong he hurried toward the noise his ak at the ready by the fickle light of explosions behind him he scrambled up onto high ground a good many confederates were already there all of them yelling like madmen he stared wondering what had taken possession of them then he started yelling himself he and his comrades had fought their way through the federal trenches now no set defenses remained between them and washington city which did not mean the untaken yankee forts had quit fighting he threw himself flat when a big shell came down far too close for comfort keep moving an officer crieda sensible command which caudell had grown thoroughly tired of tonight the officer went on the farther inside their lines we get the fewer of those cannon will bear on us suddenly given a good sensible reason to move caudell scrambled to his feet and ran south as fast as he could go more shells shrieked by these from the field guns of a battery east of the junction of the seventh street road and the milkhouse front road the officer told off a detachment to take that battery in the rear most of the soldiers caudell among them he sent south down the seventh street road toward washington form by regiments if you can by brigade if thats the best you can do he said this wont be just a paradewell have more fighting to do fortyseventh north carolina caudell called obediently kirklands brigade fortyseventh north carolina before long he found himself with a solid band of north carolinians close to half of them from his own regiment benny lang stayed with them that pleased caudell you never could tell when more of those rifle grenades might come in handy or for that matter what other tricks the rivington man had up his sleeve caudell still wondered why he called his wonderful armor a flapjack then from ahead came the roar of a volley of minié balls and hard on their heels shouts and oaths word came back quickly the federals had thrown a makeshift barricade of logs across the road and were firing from behind it flank em out someone a few feet ahead of caudell said two squads to the left of the roadway two to the right who are you to be giving orders caudell demanded the man turned even in the darkness his plump features neat chin beard and sweeping mustaches were unmistakable so were the wreathed stars on his collar im general kirkland by god who are you sir first sergeant nate caudell sirth north carolina caudell said gulping well first sergeant get up there and take one of those flanking squads kirkland thundered cursing his own big mouth caudell hurried forward toward the fighting he passed benny lang you come too he said one of those grenades of yours ought to startle the yankees enough to make our job easier lang nodded and came the federals had not had time to extend the barricade far off the roadway itself they had a few men posted in the bushes but thanks to their repeaters the rebels pushed past them and circled around behind the improvised breastwork benny lang loaded and fired a rifle grenade several federals started to turn at the odd report the grenade landed among them they all shouted in alarm when it went off and a couple of men its fragments had wounded went on crying from pain the others though fired out into the night in the direction from which the little shell had come one millie ball snarled past caudells head by then though he and his comrades were shooting at the muzzle flashes from the federals springfields a northerner started screaming and would not stop others shouted for their lives you got us surrounded rebs dont shoot no more we give up general kirklands booming authoritative voice came out of the night you yanks put that barricade up there you can get to work and help tear it down caudell heard timbers shift heard men swear mildly as they often did when a physical task went slightly wrong northern and southern accents mingled as lees troops and their prisoners worked side by side even before the logs were all removed kirkland said forward boys forward you wont let em stop us now will you the sky began to grow light in the east not long after caudell marched past the junction of the seventh street road and another dirt track that was marked taylors lane road to the southwest and rock creek church road to the northeast now washington city was less than two miles away caudell had trouble believing hed fought all night only a couple of hours seemed to have gone by the yankees still kept up a sullen fire to the front and flanks of the advancing confederate column but nowhere sharp enough to do more than harass it as dawn progressed caudell could see farther and farther washington lay spread out before him like a painted panorama he was surprised at the mixed feelings the federal capital evoked in him excitement anticipation the almost hectic flush of triumphhe had expected all those but seeing the white house for the first time in his life seeing the capitolup until three years before those had been national shrines for him as much as for any northern man he found they still had the power to raise a lump in his throat nor was he the only one for whom that held true the confederate advance slowed as men gaped at what theyd come to capture go on god damn you all general kirkland shouted dyou want to wait until grant brings the rest of his army over the potomac on the long bridge and makes you fight for the city house by house that got the rebels moving again then someone said they aint comin over no long bridge if thats it straight ahead there its burnin sure enough a column of smoke rose from the middle of the potomac kirkland must have had a telescope for a moment later he said not only is it burning by god but its broken as well the artilleryman who did that deserves a generals wreath and i dont care a jot whether hes but a private soldier hes sealed the victory for us hes sealed all the ants in the nest too and they dont much fancy it caudell said to a soldier nearby he pointed toward the city ahead at this distance the people in the streets did seem small as ants but ants did not drive carriages and ants generally moved with greater purpose than the throngs who jammed the avenues ahead all they knew was that they wanted to flee the oncoming confederates any person who got in their way was as much an obstacle as a tree or a post the soldier by caudell spat in the dusty road what you want to bet we dont catch us one single congressman at the capitol i dont care about yankee congressmen caudell said what id like to do is catch abe lincoln thatd be about the only way my name would ever go down in history by the look of him the ragged soldier had never worried about going down in history but his eyes lit up at the prospect of capturing lincoln lets try it by god somebodys got to be first to the white house then he shook his head naaheven if we are reckon hellve run off too along with everybody else worth a shot at it caudell hurried over to general kirkland he thought well of commanders who stayed up with their troops he wondered where colonel faribault and captain lewis weremaybe dead back in the trenches maybe just a few hundred yards away in the confused aftermath of victory gaining the brigadiers ear might be worth more now anyway sir may we head for the white house the ear caudell had gained was a keen one youre that mouthy sergeant from the fight in the dark arent you kirkland fixed caudell with an icy blue stare but his expression warmed as he thought about the suggestionwhat southerner could resist going after the man for fear of whom his state had seceded kirkland looked around gauging how far other confederate units had come i have no orders to the contrary and we might get there first mightnt we lets see if we canwhy the hell not he waved his sword pointed southwest and shouted new orders the soldiers cheered into washington city the rebels tramped down vermont avenue in loose skirmish order repeaters at the ready civilians peered from houses some came outside to gape at the spectacle they had never imagined a few people cheeredwashington had its share of southern sympathizers caudell coughed loudly as he passed a pretty girl so did a good many other men the soldiers sounded as if theyd all caught cold at once overwhelmed by such vigorous public praise the girl flushed and fled indoors about a hundred yards farther on a company of federal soldiers turned onto vermont avenue they must not have realized lees men were already in the city the first couple of ranks never knew it the confederates cut them down as soon as they came into sight a few men returned fire others dashed for cover shrieking noncombatants ran every which way including right between the rival forces get out of there you damned fools caudell shouted appalled at the idea of having to fight a battle in a crowd of civilians when the federals kept shooting he found himself without any choice he dove behind a hedge and looked for targets benny lang did not seem to care who got stuck in the middle of a fight he sent a grenade through the window of a house from which yankees were shooting a moment later the blast blew out every pane in that window and the one next to it three bluecoats dashed out of the house as terrified as any ordinary washingtonian they would have done better to stay where they were the confederates stretched them lifeless before theyd run ten paces rebels darted down side streets to get around the federals the fight did not last long outnumbered and outgunned the northern men died or fled keep going kirkland shouted dont let em stop you now caudell and his comrades kept going neither he nor any of them had slept for a full day neither he nor any of them cared he could see the white house ahead with that for a target rest could wait he felt like crying when a lieutenant waved him onto fifteenth street instead of letting him keep on going straight down vermont avenue the lieutenant saw his disappointment grinning he said dont feel too bad soldier once upon a time general mcclellan lived down this way his house ought to be worth seeing caudell thought the house near the corner of fifteenth and h streets a mean hovel though it was three stories high with shuttered windows and a railed porch under them from which to receive wellwishers who cared where a discredited federal general had lived when the presidents house was so close but he and the men with him had been sent only a little out of their way bluecoated officers were hurrying in and out of a brown brick building on the north side of pennsylvania avenue caudell fired a quick burst that sent them tumbling back inside guard this place he told some of the other rebels on the avenue he spent the next few minutes arguing them into it they wanted the white house as much as he did that afternoon he learned hed helped capture the headquarters of the federal defenses for washington that was later though as soon as he had men with repeaters posted all around the building he hurried west along pennsylvania avenue to the big white mansion that had housed his presidents until and now was home to the leader of another country the white house drew confederates like a lodestone caudells delays had let general kirkland portly though he was get there before him kirkland was shouting you men keep your order do you hear me think about what general lee will do to anyone who lets harm come to this building or anyone inside it lees name was a talisman to conjure with it calmed men who without it might gleefully have rampaged with torches across the lawn under the front colonnade stood federal sentries they carried rifles but made no move to raise them to the firing position they just kept staring at the evergrowing numbers of ragged men in gray and homespun butternut who filled the broad cobblestoned street and now hesitantly advanced over the grass toward them they did not seem to believe this hour could ever have come remembering gettysburg remembering the botched fight at bristoe station remembering the long cold hungry winter south of the rapidan before the repeaters came caudell marveled at the hour too as he pressed toward the white house with his comrades his feeling that the world had turned upside down deepened further for out among the bluecoats came a tall thin figure dressed in funereal black caudell looked around for the private whod guessed the federal president would run by happy chance the fellow was standing not ten feet from him he pointed see weve bagged old abe after an lincolns name ran through the rebels a few cheers rang out and a few jeers but not many of either the force of the moment seized most men with almost religious awe still slowly they came forward across the white house lawn to the base of the steps there they halted staring in wonder at the edifice and lincoln both caudell was in the fourth or fifth row of tightpacked troops as they hesitated lincoln came down the steps toward them one of the federal sentries tried to block his path he said what does it matter now son what does anything matter now beneath his frontier twang he sounded tired past all endurance the young sentry beard still downy on his cheeks stepped back in confusion caudell frankly stared at the president of the united states southern papers and cartoonists made lincoln out to be either a back country buffoon or a fiend in human shape in the flesh he did not seem either he was just a tall homely man whose deepset eyes had already seen all the griefs in the world and now this crowning one piled atop the rest he coughed and turned his head to one side when he somehow found the resolution to face the crowd of confederate soldiers again those eyes glistened with the tears he would not shed caudell thought they were tears of sorrow not weakness it was the expression a father would wear watching his beloved son die of a sickness he could not cure not all the rebels stayed solemn a short broadshouldered corporal in front of caudell and to his left spoke up brashly well uncle abe you gonna try and take our niggers away from us now it was billy beddingfield caudell hadnt realized hed been promoted again he was also certain beddingfield like most southern soldiers had not a single negro to his name beddingfield brayed laughter at his own wit a good many men joined him lincoln stood on the white house steps waiting to see whether the rebels would quiet down when they did he said i did not become president with the intention of interfering with the institutions of any state in the union i said that repeatedly at every forum available the great regret of my life is that you southerners would not credit it what about the emancipation proclamation then half a dozen soldiers shouted at once some of them profanely embellished the question lincoln did not quail everything i have done i have done for the purpose of holding the union together and of restoring it once it was torn asunder had i thought that meant freeing all the slaves i should have freed them all had i thought it meant leaving them in chains in chains they would have stayed as it chanced i thought the wisest course was to free some and leave others alonenote that even now i have hesitated to touch the institution in those states which remained loyal the proclamation was a weapon to hand in the war against your rebellion and i seized it make what you will of that damn little good it did you billy beddingfield said again some of the rebels laughed but caudell gave his beard a thoughtful tug he hadnt known the emancipation proclamation was selective the papers had painted it as a desperate effort to incite blacks to rise up against their masters so it was to some degree but if it was a blow against the confederate government rather than against slavery per se that made it more or less what lincoln claimed it wasan unpleasant ploy but a ploy nonetheless the federal president said personally i hate slavery and all it stands for that took courage in front of the audience he faced he let the rebels boos and hisses wash over him when they slackened he went on it is too late now i think to rescind the proclamation i issued too much has happened since but if only the southern states were to return to the union the federal government would fully compensate former masters for their bondsmens liberty the rebels laughed loud and long lincoln hung his head caudell strangely found himself respecting the man anyone who clung to his principles strongly enough to refuse to abandon them even in complete defeat owned more sincerity than he had credited lincoln with possessing lincoln drew himself up to his full and impressive height his black suit conformed perfectly to the motion it was far from new and had been worn so often that it molded itself to its owners shape if my death would restore the seceded states i would beg for your bullets he said if the union fails i have no wish to live from most politicians that would have been just talk looking at the sorrow that masked lincolns roughhewn features caudell was convinced he meant every word of it but if he thought the federal government had the right to tell states they had to stay in a union they no longer desired then he might be sincere but to caudells way of thinking he was sincerely wrong some of the confederates were willing to find him most literally sincere too billy beddingfield started to raise his ak caudell grabbed the repeater and pushed it back down no billy damn it he said this isnt like shooting a couple of nigger prisoners nobody had ever assassinated a president of the united states caudell could imagine nothing surer to bring on lasting enmity between usa and csa beddingfield turned on him scowling he dont deserve no better all the trouble he brung on us he started to swing the rifle back toward lincoln caudell ground his teeth benny lang had handled beddingfield easily enough but he knew he couldnt match the rivington man and how strange to think of fighting a man from his own regiment to save the president whose troops hed been battling these past two and a half years before beddingfield could shoot before the fight could start a murmur ran from back to front through the crowd of soldiers in gray marse robert marse roberts here caudell looked around sure enough lee sat aboard traveller the crowd parted before him like the waters of the red sea he rode up to the base of the white house steps lincoln waited for him infinitely alone one of the federal sentries began to lift his springfield another man slapped it down as caudell had with beddingfield lee took off his broadbrimmed gray felt bowed in the saddle to lincoln mr president he said as respectfully as if lincoln were his own chosen leader see caudell whispered to billy beddingfield shut up beddingfield hissed back general lee lincoln said with a stiff nod he looked from the confederate commander to the men of the army of northern virginia back again his lips quirked in what caudell first thought a grimace of pain then he saw it was a grin however wry lincoln halfturned waved toward the imposing bulk of the white house behind him general do you want to step into my parlor with me seems we have a bit of talking to do hed been eloquent when talking to the soldiers with lee he sounded like a storekeeper inviting a customer in to haggle over the price of potatoes caudell was instantly suspicious of such a chameleonlike shift of style but lee said of course mr president im sure one of my men will hold travellers head as he dismounted three dozen men sprang forward for the privilege a colored servant brought in a pot of coffee and two cups on a silver tray sit down general do sit down lincoln said thank you mr president robert e lee took the chair to which lincoln had waved him lincoln poured the coffee with his own hands thank you sir lee said again lincolns chuckle held a bitter edge a fair number of generals have sat in that chair general lee but ill be switched if youre not the politest one of the lot still standing himself he peered down at lee i think this country would be a good deal better off if youd sat down in it some years sooner you honored me by offering me that command lee said having to decline it tore my heart in two when you declined it i think you tore the united states in two lincoln answered set against that your hearts a small thing i am in the end a virginian first mr president lee said you come out with that so coolly as if it explained everything lincoln said lee looked at him in some surprise he thought it did lincoln went on i take the viewi have always taken the viewthat the interest of the several states should count for more than the interest of anyone of them there we disagree sir lee said quietly so we do rather to lees relief lincoln sat down a goodsized man himself lee did not care to be towered over and lincoln was as tall as any of andries rhoodies friends he reached out a long arm to tap lee on the knee something i want you to think on general youve taken washington for the moment but can you keep it there are many more union soldiers around the city than confederates in it can you stand siege here lee smiled admiring lincolns audacity ill take the chance mr president the beef depot and slaughterhouse by the washington monument could alone subsist my army for some time and it is far from the only such source of supply in the city to us sir having come here we feel we are entered into the land flowing with milk and honey weve made do with very little in the past yes you can find milk and honey here i expect though youd better watch out that the sutlers and commissary officers dont adulterate em before they ever get to your men lincoln studied lee but where will you get more cartridges for those newfangled repeaters your men carry we have a sufficiency lee said more calmly than he felt that one sharp question was plenty to dispel any lingering doubts about lincolns ability the man understood what war required lee wondered if the army of northern virginia did have enough ammunition for another big fight the men had spent it like a drunken sailor throwing away money after six months at sea lincolns eyes bored into him he remembered that the federal president had been a lawyer before he took up politics he was practiced at sniffing out falsehood hiding behind a mask of rectitude lee said let me ask you something in turn mr president if i may are you prepared to destroy washington city to drive us out of it that is what you would have to do you know already we are looking to our own defense here would your countrymen support you in such an action especially at a time when confederate arms are gaining successes against other federal forces besides the army of the potomac my countrymen elected me to hold the union together general lee and that i shall undertake to do by whatever means necessary so long as there is any hope of this wars success lincoln said lee felt a slight chill as he gauged the big man in the velvetupholstered chair here even more than with general grant he at last encountered a northern man with strength of purpose to match his own and president daviss lincoln continued if the only hope of saving the union is to make this city into a funeral pyre and then immolate myself upon it that i shall do and let the voters judge come november whether i did right or wrong if he was bluffing lee was glad never to have met him at a poker table and yet the game they were playing now was poker on a grander scale with the fate of two nations pushed onto the table for stakes this time though lee knew he was holding aces he turned a new one face up drawing a telegram from his pocket and handing it to lincoln mr president you say you will carry on so long as you feel you can win the war here is a dispatch i received this morning which may shed some light on your chances of doing so to read the telegram lincoln slipped on a pair of goldframed spectacles much like lees own that was hardly surprising the two leaders were only two years apart in age and a mans sight grew long in the middle years regardless of whether he was born in mansion or log cabin the federal president peered over the rims of his glasses at lee this paper is genuinehe pronounced it genuwinegeneral you have my oath on it mr president lee had not thought of offering lincoln a false telegram had it occurred to him the stratagem would have been a good one but lincoln was more ready to counter deception than he was to offer it your oath i will accept general though those of few othersin gray or blueunder these circumstances lincoln said heavily so bedford forrest with thirtyfive hundred men has beaten our general sturgis with over eight thousand north of corinth mississippi has he not only beaten him but wrecked him mr president his men are in full flight toward memphis with forrest in pursuit from his report he has captured two hundred fifty wagons and ambulances and five thousand stands of small arms not that those latter are of much concern to us do you suppose you can keep his cavalry off general shermans supply line much longer do you suppose sherman can long survive with the railroads wrecked as forrests men are in the habit of wrecking them lincoln bent his head covered his face with his large bony hands it is the end he said his voice muffled i wish one of your rebels had shot me out there so i should never have to live past this black day dont think of it so mr president call it rather a new beginning lee said the confederate states never wanted more than to go their own way in peace and to live in peace with the united states no right cause impelled you to dissolve the union only fearmisguided fear i might addthat i would act precipitately against slavery i was willing to let it remain in place where it was and slowly to wither there mr president i hold no brief for slavery as you may know but i do believe the rights of a state to be of higher importance than those of the federalor confederategovernment this war has undermined the powers of the separate states north and south alike lincoln said both washington and richmond levy direct taxes and directly conscript men no matter how the governors moan and bellow like branded calves can any separate state hope to resist their power you know the answer as well as i lee stroked his beard lincoln had a point even his precious virginia by far the greatest of the confederate states followed first the will of the national government then its own he said i am but a soldier let those wiser in such matters settle them as seems best if you were but a soldier general lee we wouldnt be sitting here talking with each other right now lincolns mouth twisted in that melancholy grin of his and i wish to thunder that we werent his gaze sharpened again werent for those repeaters youve broken out with like a dogs new spring fleas i dont think we would be either if i knew where you were getting em id buy a batch for my own side i tell you that i believe you mr president lee meant it lincoln was an inventor of sorts hed once patented a device for getting riverboats across stretches of low water anyone in the north who came up with a new rifle or cartridge made a beeline for the white house hoping to impress him with it lee went on carefully as for our new rifles we do not import them from overseas they come from within the confederacy so say the rebels weve captured lincoln answered i own i find it hard to credit the rifles are better than any we make and you southerners havent a tithe of our factories so how did you turn out so many so fast the how of it is not important mr president lee could not discuss the rivington men and their secret with his nations chiefest enemywith the man indeed who was his nations chiefest reason for existing oddly though he found he wanted to of all the men hed met lincoln seemed least likely to call him a lunatic the federal president had a breadth of vision that might be wide enough to take in the notion of men corning back from lees brows came together again how could the man before him be capable of the outrages andries rhoodie ascribed to him lee shrugged that how was not important either what is important is that my men and i are here as i said before i believe we can stay here and that other confederate armies are likely to continue to win victories your war to subjugate the south has failed i will not give it up lincoln said stubborn still then the united states will give up on you lee predicted but the choice is not altogether in your hands sir when i leave the white house my next call will be at the british ministry to pay my respects to lord lyons since i shall be in the position to do that how can he fail to recognize the confederate states as a nation which has succeeded in winning its independence he did not sayhe did not need to saythat if great britain recognized the confederacy france and the other european powers would surely follow her leadand not even the stubbornest us president could continue war on the southern states in the face of that recognition lincolns long sad face grew longer and sadder even now though he refused to yield saying lord lyons hates slavery so do the british people britain recognizes the empire of brazil does she not despite its being a slaveholding land for that matter britain recognized the united states before the start of our unfortunate war and does still in spite of your continuing to hold slaveslast years emancipation proclamation was remarkably silent on the subject of northern negroes in bondage always sallow lincoln turned a couple of shades darker they are being attended to come victory all in the united states would have been free he cocked his head at lee and you have just claimed to be no great friend of slavery yourself general lee lowered his eyes acknowledging the hit the most i will say for it is that controlled by humane laws and influenced by christianity and an enlightened public sentiment it may be the most practicable means for blacks and whites harmoniously to live together in this land it is an evil sir an unmitigated evil lincoln said i shall never forget the group of chained negroes i saw going down the river to be sold close to a quarter of a century ago never was there so much misery all in one place if your secession triumphs the south will be a pariah among nations we shall be recognized as what we are a nation among nations lee returned and let me repeat my being here is a sign secession has triumphed what i would seek to do now subject to the ratification of my superiors is suggest terms to halt the war between the united states and confederate states lincoln refused to call lees country by its proper name as a small measure of revenge lee put extra weight on that name lincoln sighed this was the moment he had tried to evade but there was no evading it not with the commander of the army of northern virginia in his parlor name your terms general he said in a voice full of ashes they are very simple mr president that federal troops withdraw from such parts of the territory of the confederate states as they now occupy as soon as that is doneperhaps even while it is being donewe shall depart from washington city and usa and csa will be at peace simple eh lincoln leaned forward in his chair the picture of a man determined not to be cheated in a horse trade what about west virginia that is a delicate area lee admitted when virginia left the union its northern and western counties refused to go along federal guns had protected them in their secession from secession now the area was one of the united states in its own right lee could not doubt that was what the bulk of its people wanted even if virginia still claimed the territory he countered what of missouri and kentucky both states sent representatives to the confederate congress as well as to washington kentucky was the birth state of lincoln and of jefferson davis too while missouris civil war was as much neighbor against neighbor as north against south lincoln was right deciding borders wouldnt be simple well what about missouri and kentucky the federal president said asking me to leave the valley of the mississippi where we as yet remain supreme is hard enough but if you expect us to pull off our own soil so you can walk in you can think again sir emancipation is already far along there as wellyou may not want those states for you will have to fight a new war to restore their colored folk to servitude it was lees turn to sigh that might be true wherever the federal armies had gone but it was a worry for politicians and for the future nowthis sort of talk gets us nowhere mr president save to the spilling of more blood which is what i now seek to prevent will you undertake to remove your soldiers from all disputed territory but those two states and what you people call west virginia with the status of those areas to be settled by negotiation at a later date have you the authority to offer such terms lincoln asked no sir lee admitted at once as i said before i shall have to submit them to richmond for my presidents approval i was speaking informally in an effort to bring the fighting to a close as quickly as possible if you could arrange to reconnect the telegraph lines between here and richmond you would be able to treat directly with president davis without my serving as intermediary lincoln waved a hand reconnecting the telegraphd be simple enough lee knew that was so only for a nation with the abundant resources the united states enjoyed but held his peace lincoln continued still and all i think id sooner talk with you you have sense enough for a whole raft of presidents seems to me if he noticed hed included himself there he gave no sign of it as you wish mr president lee said my feeling is if the bloodshed once stops we can then sit down across from one another at a table and settle these remaining issues they may bulk large in your vision now but they are of small importance when set beside the main question of the war which is whether the south should be free and independent they look plenty big from over here but then what you rightly call the main question has been answered the wrong way lincoln shook his head and now i have to make the best of it for my country very well general lee if we cannot bring you backand it seems we cantwe shall have to learn to live alongside you id sooner do that talking than shooting so would i sir lee said eagerly so would every soldier in the confederate army and if i might make so bold as to speak for them very likely the soldiers in your army as well youre very likely right general how is it that soldiers are always so much more willing to pack in a war than civilians because only soldiers actually fight lee answered they understand how much of what is afterwards called glory is but memory trying to put a good face on terror and torment general lee i wish to heaven youd chosen the northern side lincoln burst out you see clear enough to have won this war for us before the south ever started turning out these cursed repeating rifles that have sent so many of our lads to their graves too young too many on both sides have gone to their graves too young lee said lincoln nodded at last the two men had found a point upon which they agreed without reservation lee stood to go lincoln rose from his chair in sections like a carpenters fancy ruler unfolding looking up at him lee added it is decided then you will order an armistice and withdrawal on the terms i outlined i will lincolns mouth twisted on the words as if they were pickled in vinegar would you be so kind as to put them in writing to prevent any misunderstanding lee reached into his waistcoat pocket i have pen and paper at least an order pad may i trouble you for ink lincoln waved him to a desk against the wall he bent to use the inkwell wrote rapidly when he was done he handed the pad to the president of the united states lincoln read rapidly through the couple of paragraphs they are as you said general will you be kind enough to lend me your pen he set his signature beside lees now let me have that second copy if you please lee tore off the original gave lincoln the sheet below it the federal president folded it and put it away without looking at it as if he had already seen more of the words on it than he cared to lee dipped his head to lincoln if you will excuse me you dont need to wait on my leave lincoln said with more than a little bitterness conquerors after all do as they please history has never recorded any man less anxious to be noted as a conqueror than i maybe so but history will also note you are one lee and lincoln walked together to the door of the reception room lincoln opened it gestured for lee to precede him through in the antechamber outside lees staff officers stood chatting amicably enough with a couple of brightlooking young men in civilian clothes all heads turned toward the general and the president no one spoke but a single question was visible in the eyes of all lee answered it we shall have peace gentlemen his aides shouted and clapped their hands the two men in civilian suits also smiled but more hesitantly their gaze swung to lincoln i see no good prospects remaining for the continuation of this war he said where to lee that was a matter for rejoicing lincoln sounded funereal lee imagined what he would have felt presenting his sword to general grant in a conquered richmond in deliberately lighter tones lincoln continued general lee let me present my secretaries mr john hay and mr john nicolay theyre good lads they should enjoy the privilege of meeting the latest hero hardly that lee protested he shook each secretarys hand i am pleased to make your acquaintance gentlemen pleased to meet you too general lee but id sooner have done it under different circumstances hay said boldly now see here sir walter taylor began lee held up a hand to head off his aides anger let him speak as he will major would you wish otherwise were your cause overthrown i suppose not taylor said grudgingly there you are then lee turned back to lincoln mr president if you will excuse me i should like to give the good news of ourhe searched for the least wounding way to put itour agreement that there should be an armistice to the brave men who have borne so much these past three years ill come with you if you dont mind lincoln said if this thing must be we ought to put the best face we can on it and let them see us in accord surprised but pleased lee nodded the crowd of ragged confederates on the white house lawn had doubled and more since he went in to confer with lincoln the trees were full of men who had climbed up so they could see over their comrades off in the distance cannon still occasionally thundered rifles popped like firecrackers lee quietly said to lincoln will you send out your sentries under flag of truce to bring word of the armistice to those federal positions still firing upon my men ill see to it lincoln promised he pointed to the soldiers in gray who had quieted expectantly when lee came out looks like youve given me sentries enough even if their coats are the wrong color few men could have joked so with their cause in ruins around them respecting the federal president for his composure lee raised his voice soldiers of the army of northern virginia after three years of arduous service we have achieved that for which we took up arms he got no farther with one voice the men before him screamed out their joy and relief the unending waves of noise beat at him like surf from a stormy sea battered forage caps and slouch hats flew through the air soldiers jumped up and down pounded on one anothers shoulders danced in clumsy rings kissed each others bearded filthy faces lee felt his own eyes grow moist at last the magnitude of what he had won began to sink in abraham lincoln turned away from the celebrating rebels lee saw that his hollow cheeks were also wet he set a hand on lincolns arm im sorry mr president perhaps you should not have come out after all you dont suppose idve heard them in there lincoln asked lee sought a reply found none he looked to the bottom of the steps where traveller remained calm in the midst of chaos with a last nod to lincoln he went down the stairway to his horse as hed told the us president he had another call to make in washington neither the stars and stripes nor the confederacys stainless banner flew over the building up to which lee rode no soldiers crowded in front of it to gape and point save the few who had followed him through the streets of the city and they were gaping and pointing at him rather than his destination nevertheless after the white house this nondescript twostory structure with the union jack on the roof was the most important place in the city for the south he walked up the slate pathway to the front door rapped once on the polished brass knocker and waited over the british ministry he had not even the rights of a conqueror his staff officers dismounted from their horses but did not presume to follow him not here the door opened an elderly very bald man in formal attire peered out at him you would be general lee he asked his accent was soft in a way different from lees virginia speech i am he lee said bowing i should like to pay my respects to lord lyons if i may he has been expecting you sir the elderly man said if you will come with me he led lee down a long hall past several chambers where clerks heads came up from their papers so they could stare at him then into a sitting room your excellency the famous confederate general robert e lee general lord richard lyons thank you hignett you may go the british minister to the united states got up from his overstuffed armchair lee already had his hand out i am delighted to meet you at last your excellency he said sincerely the south had been struggling to win british recognition since before the war with the union began general lee lord lyons murmured he was in his late forties with a round very red face dark hair and side whiskers and almost equally dark circles under his eyes an elegantly tailored suit came close to disguising his plumpness please make yourself comfortable general you are indeed the man of the moment thank you your excellency lee sat in a chair not far from the one from which lord lyons had risen as i have ah come to washington city i thought it fitting that i pay my respects to you since your government has no present minister in richmond lord lyons steepled his fingertips a state of affairs you hope will change i do your excellency either the confederate states of america are an independent nation or they are but a dependency of the united states no other earthly power claims the right to govern us and my presence here argues against the second interpretation of our status that i mentioned argues powerfully you are too discreet to say am i correctly informed that you visited president lincoln before you came here yes your excellency lee concealed his surprise and after a moment realized surprise was foolish it was the business of the british minister to be well informed may i enquire as to the results of that meeting lord lyons said lee briefly sketched the terms of the armistice agreement with lincoln lord lyons listened intently when lee was done the minister gave a slow nod he has in effect then conceded the independence of the confederacy in effect yes what choice had he sir our armies have in the current campaigning season been uniformly victorious this due in no small measure to the new repeaters with which you have equipped yourselves lord lyons interrupted he could not hide the keen interest in his voice behind a calm exterior lee smiled everyone was keen to find out where those repeaters came from he wondered what lord lyons would have made of the true answer he remained unsure just what to make of it himself but that was by the way yes your excellency with the aid of our new rifles we have halted or driven back the federals on all frontselse i should not be here conversing with you president lincoln rightly recognizedhe chose the word with deliberationthat it would be only a matter of time before we freed our territory and wisely chose to spare his soldiers the suffering they would have to undergo in struggles bound to be futile with these victories to which you refer the confederate states do seem to have retrieved their falling fortunes lord lyons said i have no reason to doubt that her majestys government will before long recognize that fact thank you your excellency lee said quietly even had lincoln refused to give up the warnot impossible with the mississippi valley and many coastal pockets held by virtue of northern naval power and hence relatively secure from rebel aksrecognition by the greatest empire on earth would have assured confederate independence lord lyons held up a hand many among our upper classes will be glad enough to welcome you to the family of nations both as a result of your successful fight for selfgovernment and because you have given a black eye to the often vulgar democracy of the united states others however will judge your republic a sham with its freedom for white men based upon negro slavery a notion loathsome to the civilized world i should be less than candid if i failed to number myself among the latter group slavery was not the reason the southern states chose to leave the union lee said he was aware he sounded uncomfortable but went on we sought only to enjoy the sovereignty guaranteed us under the constitution a right the north wrongly denied us our watchword all along has been we wish but to be left alone and what sort of country shall you build upon that watchword general lord lyons asked you cannot be left entirely alone you are become as i said a member of the family of nations further this war has been hard on you much of your land has been ravaged or overrun and in those places where the federal army has been slavery lies dying shall you restore it there at the point of a bayonet gladstone said october before last perhaps a bit prematurely that your jefferson davis had made an army the beginnings of a navy and more important than either a nation you southerners may have made the confederacy into a nation general lee but what sort of nation shall it be lee did not answer for most of a minute this pudgy little man in his comfortable chair had put into a nutshell all of his own worries and fears hed had scant time to dwell on them not with the war always uppermost in his thoughts but the war had not invalidated any of the british ministers questionssome of which lincoln had also askedonly put off the time at which they would have to be answered now that time drew near now that the confederacy was a nation what sort of nation would it be at last he said your excellency at this precise instant i cannot fully answer you save to say that whatever sort of nation we become it shall be one of our own choosing it was a good answer lord lyons nodded as if in thoughtful approval then lee remembered the rivington men they too had their ideas on what the confederate states of america should become viii mollie beans eyes flashed when she saw caudell you hear the latest of what that rascal forrest done no tell me he said eagerly nathan bedford forrests exploits were usually worth hearing and mollie being who she was usuallyas nowfound out about them before most people she said when the telegraph for the armistice got to him he made like it never did and took his boys hellforleather up into tennesseewrecked a big long stretch of the railroad that was feedin general shermans army some o them bluecoats is nearly starvin i hear tell after this past winter i know more about starving than those yankees are ever likely to caudell said but what did lincoln and the other federal bigwigs have to say about him breaking the armistice that way reckon they carried on some but with us here where we are what can they do but carry on mollie waved a hand along with a good part of the rest of a p hills corps the th north carolina was encamped in the white lot the big empty space between the white house and the stump of the washington monument the barracks they occupied had been intended for pennsylvania regiments on the way south now the shoe was on the other foot what with those fine barracks and rations from the bottomless federal depots caudell hadnt lived so well since he joined the army and seldom before mollie went on theyre callin him hitemagain forrest cause they say he wanted to hit the yankees one more lick to remind em they was whipped hitemagain forrest caudell said it slowly savoring the taste yup that does sound like him and thats about the best nickname ive heard this side of stonewall jackson with some dignity he added not that nathans a bad name thats right its just about the same as yours mollie laughed too bad it aint your bankrolls thats just about the same caudell laughed too ruefully too bad is right but if he made his money dealing niggers the way ive heard well its not anything id feel easy about doing for myself he knew that was hypocritical the confederate constitution enshrined the right to own slaves and trade them within the nations borders the southern economy rested on the backs of its black labor force but a lot of people who could never have stomached the butchers trade ate meat mollie waved again isnt this grand here i am a nobody from a nowhere town in north carolina and now ive seen richmond and washington city both whodve figured id travel so far must be close to two hundred miles down to rivington caudell nodded the army had expanded his life before the war outside of a couple of trips to raleigh hed spent his whole life inside nash county now hed been in several different states and eventhough recalling it still came hard sometimesa foreign country the united states whether in a foreign country or not washington was still the source of traditions he held dear as london once might have been to an early carolina colonist hed spent most of his offduty time wandering through the city rubbernecking and was far from the only soldier in gray to go off and see what he could see the white house secretaries had had to set up a regular tour taking confederates through the presidential mansion in companysized groups hed also walked over to the capitol federal senators and congressmen were beginning to return to washington though a fair number of the importantlooking men hed seen flinched from him and his comrades as if they were satans spawn set loose on earth the ordinary folk of washington city did better at taking their occupiers in stride their principal complaint against the rebels was that they had too little money and that in confederate currency lee had issued an order that made the locals take southern money in exchange for goods and services but he could not make them like it caudell had bought himself a drink at willards a couple of blocks east of the white house on the corner of fourteenth street and pennsylvania avenue lincoln and grant had each spent his first night in washington city at willards everyone who was anyone in federal washington frequented the hotel its bars sitting and dining rooms and corridors had probably seen more war business done than any other place in the city the white house not excepted that was why caudell went there willards fameor notorietyhad spread south as well as north he found his shot overpriced and the whiskey villainous is this what you served general grant he asked indignantly the bartender an irishman of impressive size glared down at him the very same johnny reb and i found himself not so particular as you caudell shut up from some of the stories hed heard about grants drinking the fellow might even have been telling the truth fighting joe hooker had also drunk at willards and given his name to the blocks south and east of it caudell stayed away from what the natives called hookers division confederates who did go in to visit such establishments as mme russells bake oven headquarters usa and gentle annie lyles place quickly learned to travel in pairs gamblers pickpockets flimflam men and the girls themselves preyed on soldiers in gray as readily as they had on soldiers in blue plenty of men came back without a cent a few did not come back at all outside of the monuments washington city left claudell disappointed so had richmond outside of capitol square they both seemed just towns intent on their own concerns for the leading cities of great nations somehow that was not enough rocky mount and nashville back in nash county were towns intent on their own concerns one day maybe hed get back to nash county and to his own concerns soon he hoped the confederate bands on the white house lawn struck up the starspangled banner general lee saluted the colorbearer who marched before the party of highranking federal officers coming to reclaim washington from the army of northern virginia the flag of the united states had been his not long ago and still commanded his respect the federals also had a band with them it returned the compliment by playing dixienot the souths official anthem but the tune most closely associated with it a short slim man with a closetrimmed light brown beard and three stars on each shoulder strap stepped out from among his comrades strode briskly up to the waiting confederate officers he saluted general lee his voice was quiet his accent western lee returned the salute general grant he acknowledged formally then went on we met once in mexico i believe sir though i confess to my embarrassment that your face does not seem perfectly familiar to me doubtless it is the beard i remember the day grant said i recognized you at once beard or no youre too kind when ive also gone all gray while you remain so brightly fledged lee said let me commend you on your excellent band grant shrugged his long cigar waggled at one corner of his mouth i care nothing for music im afraid i know only two tunes ones yankee doodle and the other isnt he brought the small joke out pat as if hed used it many times before lee laughed politely then turned serious once more please believe me when i express my sincere compliments on the skill with which you handled the army of the potomac general grant never in the course of the war did i face an abler opponent nor one who put more of his men into the battle grants pale blue eyes met and held his all at once he realized how much the federal commander still ached to fight had it not been for your repeaters general lee i maintain we should have been treading on the streets of richmond rather than here that may be so general lee said from what andries rhoodie had told him it was so but ulysses grant did not need to know that and the south did have those repeaters having rhoodie pop up in his thoughts made lee glance over to the rivington men who stood in a small group of their own on the white house lawn a few paces from the assembled officers of the army of northern virginia not all the men from out of time were there two had died in the fighting outside washington and another three were wounded confederate soldiers had carried one of them back to the surgeons who amputated his shattered leg the rivington men got their other two wounded fighters back to a physician of their own from what lee had heard confederate soldiers who saw their wounds thought they would lose limbs too yet here both of them stood with their comrades bandaged but whole their eyes were clear of fever too and fever killed more men than bullets the rivington men had also reclaimed the man upon whom the confederates had operated fever had already seized him the surgeons were sure he could not last long the doctor from out of time broke the septic fever though that rivington man was not here but by all accounts he would live all the confederate surgeons were still scratching their heads a few had already begged the rivington physician for lessons lees hand went for a moment to the vial of white pills in his waistcoat pocket in medicines did what they claimed to do lees thoughts returned to the ceremony shall we proceed sir but grant still had the recent battle on his mind if your gunners hadnt wrecked the long bridge we would have driven you out of washington city even after you penetrated our fortifications outside of town your men crossing in large numbers from virginia certainly would have made our task more difficult lee said you have brigadier general alexander to blame for their inability to do so he gestured toward the artillery commander of longstreets corps e porter alexander was an enthusiasticlooking officer of about thirty with sharp gray eyes and a full rather pointed brown beard he said blame my pair of rifled whitworth cannon general grant those two english guns were the only pieces i had with the range and accuracy to hit the bridge from my position shall we proceed sir lee asked grant again this time the federal commander gave a brusque nod lee turned to the confederate musicians gentlemen if you please the bandsmen struck up a brisk tattoo the confederate sentries who had patrolled the white house grounds since the army of northern virginia seized washington now formed themselves in two neat ranks their leader a lieutenant in a clean wellpressed uniform borrowed specially for the occasion saluted lee lee returned the courtesy then spoke formally to grant in recognition of the armistice between our countries and in recognition of the cooperation united states forces have shown in removing themselves from the territory of the confederate states it is my honor to return custody of the white house and through it of all washington to the usa i accept them back general lee on behalf of the united states of america grant saidhardly a fancy speech but well done in a plain sort of way the southern musicians fell silent after a moment grant remembered to signal to his own band they took up the same tattoo the confederates had abandoned lee wondered if grant noticed it was the same federal sentries in blue marched onto the white house lawn to replace the sentries in gray who had come away from the mansion may our two nations long enjoy peace and amicable dealings with each other lee said i also hope peace is maintained between us general lee grant said lee fought down a touch of pique even now the federal leaders remained reluctant to acknowledge the confederacy as a country in its own right back to basics then we shall return to virginia tomorrow my thanks to your engineers for having so quickly and competently repaired the long bridge we shant be sorry to see the army of virginia go immediatelygrant said the word as if it were spelled immejetlyand that is the truth sir we would have had you on your way sooner but but you were busy wrecking the fortifications on the virginia side of the potomac and removing your guns from them so we should have no opportunity to turn them against you lee finished when the commander of the army of the potomac ran down in the middle of his sentence grant nodded lee went on in your situation i should have done the same lee glanced back toward the white house wondering if president lincoln would come out to take part in the ceremony but lincoln as hed done since the day when washington fell remained inside rumor said his melancholia was at such a pitch that he spoke to no one but stayed alone all day in a darkened room lee knew rumor lied federal messengers went in and out of the white house at all hours of the day and night that was as well no less than the confederacy the united states would need a strong hand to guide them through the aftermath of war but for now the pain of loss was simply too much to let lincoln show himself in the southernheld federal capital good day to you general grant lee held out his hand grant shook it his grip was hard and firm though small he seemed strong lee nodded to the confederate band it began to pay dixie grant turned toward the confederate flag a colorbearer carried he removed his black felt hat thank you sir lee said glad grant at least would publicly salute the stainless banner if its to be done it should be done properly grant said echoing lincoln i wish it werent being done the federal band swung into the starspangled banner lee immediately removed his own hat in salute to the flag that had once been his those confederate officers who wore hats imitated their leader almost all of them had served in the old army under that flag many had fought in mexico and against indians alongside the federal officers behind grant those bonds were sundered forever now the music ended lee and grant exchanged one last salute the confederate officers left the white house grounds to return to their quarters many of them were staying at willards lee and his aides still slept in their tents which theyd set up near the state department building but even lee did not deny himself willards table the oysters were monstrous good he turned to walter taylor we shall go home now let the tents be struck the yankees had built a fort to cover the southern end of the long bridge lee stood on the earthen walls and watched the soldiers of the army of northern virginia file past bands playing flags fluttering in the breeze men singing and cheering the end of the war some of the soldiers tramped south to alexandria to take the orange and alexandria railroador that portion of it still intacttoward richmond others marched northwest along the road that paralleled the potomac headed for fort haggery across from georgetown though armistice had come confederates and federals still felt the need to take precautions against each other lee walked over to the post to which traveller was hitched he let walter taylor untie the horse then mounted he rode northwest himself his staff officers followed they kept a careful distanceahead hardly more than a mile away stood arlington on its commanding hill arlington the mansion in which hed been married arlington the great house in which his wife had lived and he too when duty brought him close to washington arlington from which mary custis lee had fled a week before virginia formally secededarlington which the federals had captured and used as their own for the three years since every minute brought lee closer every minute showed him more clearly how harsh the federals had been earthen forts scarred the grounds he had labored so hard to restore in the years just before the war endless stables for federal cavalry had gone up between the mansion and the potomac the horses were out of them now but the memory of their presence lingered still lee wished for hercules to cleanse the row on row of wooden sheds but even the demigod might have found it beyond his powers also deserted were the cabins and huts south of the stables no not quite deserted a black face peered out at lee from behind a wall then vanished again but most of the free negroes had fled their shantytown when washington fell for fear of being reenslaved in the aftermath of confederate victory irony there lee thought he had manumitted all the estates nearly two hundred bondsmen on his fatherinlaws death the west wind blew the stables stench away from him but a new miasma came from arlington itself a miasma compounded of sweat and filth and pus and suffering the federals had made his home into a hospital dwarfed by the heavy doric columns of the porch doctors in blue still hurried back and forth lee had exempted the place from the general federal evacuation of southern soil until the last wounded man could be moved without suffering arlingtons lawns had been sadly neglected under the northern occupation they were uncut unwatered and unkempt here and there not far from the mansion fresh raw upturnings of red virginia earth further marred what had once been a smooth and lovely expanse under that freshly turned soil lay federal soldiers slain in the wilderness at bealeton and he supposed in the fighting in and around washington city the confederate repeaters had filled all washingtons proper cemeteries to overflowing injured men who died here stayed here one of the hurrying federal doctors at last caught sight of lee when the man recognized him he stopped so short he almost stumbled then he came down the hill toward him at a trot he saluted as if lee commanded his own army sir i am henry brown surgeon of the st new jersey he wore captains bars and a haggard expression how may i help you may i show you throughyour home wounded men yet remain inside sir lee asked yes general perhaps to the number of a hundred the rest have either recovered sufficiently to be taken elsewhere or brown jerked a thumb in the direction of the new graves i cannot imagine your soldiers would wish to see me when i am the author of their pain lee said i would not inflict myself upon them many of them i think would be pleased if you visited one of browns eyebrows quirked upward as you may be aware sir you are held in considerable respect by the army of the potomac lee shook his head the surgeon persisted it truly would help restore their spirits i believe only if you are certain sir lee said doubtful still brown nodded vigorously lee said very well then i am relying upon your good judgment he swung down from traveller when his staff officers saw him head for the mansion they exclaimed and dismounted too they rushed after him charles marshall drew his sword venable and taylor took out pistols instead you mustnt go alone into that nest of yankees sir taylor protested i thank you for taking thought of my safety gentlemen but i doubt i am thrusting myself into a desperadoes lair lee said no indeed henry brown said indignantly flanked by his aides and the surgeon lee strode between the two central columns up onto the porch of his old home a startled federal sentry at the door presented arms to him he politely dipped his head to the man not long ago the fellow would have been overjoyed to kill him now he remained on confederate soil only because lee declined to evict his wounded comrades the sickroom smell almost palpable outside grew thicker still when the sentry opened the door to let lee go through a surgeon probing a wound looked up in surprise get on with it goddam you his patient gasped then he too saw who stood in the doorway no wait lee looked at the thin men who lay on cots in what had been his front room they stared back many of them with feverbright eyes his name ran in a whisper from bed to bed a young blond soldier his right arm gone at the shoulder heaved himself up to a sitting position you come to gloat he demanded lee almost turned on his heel to walk out of arlington then and there but before he could move another federal this one with only half a left leg said come on joe you know he aint that way i came to see brave men lee said quietly and to honor them for their bravery the war is over now we are countrymen no longer but we need be enemies no longer either i would hope one day for us to be friends again and hope that day comes speedily he walked from bed to bed chatting briefly with each man joe and a couple of others turned their heads away but as henry brown had predicted most of the men seemed eager to meet him eager to talk with him the question he heard oftenest was whered you rebs get those damned repeaters several men added as ulysses grant had wouldntve been for them wedve licked you the rifles come from north carolina he said over and over his usual answer true but incomplete as usual the federals found it hard to believe as usual they would have found the truth even harder one big highceilinged room after another lee gave all his attention to the broken men on their canvas cots they deserved it they had fought as gallantly as any southerner and kept up the fight as long as they could in the face of the aks overwhelming firepower concentrating on the soldiers also kept him from noticing how arlington itself had suffered but the brutal fact struck home no matter how he tried to avoid it hed never been good at selfdeception the mansionhis mansionhad till recently held far more wounded federals than now inhabited it their blood and other less noble bodily fluids stained rugs floors walls those floors and walls were also scarred and chipped from the rough use theyd taken since hed expected nothing better hed also expected much of the old furniture to be missing rich goods in the house of an enemy were fair game for soldiers but he had not expected the vandalism of what remained the destruction for destructions sake yankees had carved their initials into those bureaus and chests that were too heavy to carry off and had escaped being chopped up for firewood scrawls some of them filthy decorated the walls the sole relief lee knew was that mary was not at his side arlington had been her home before it was his seeing it now would bring her only grief the war had been cruel to her forced from arlington then from white house the family plantation on the pamunkeythe plantation had ended up as mcclellans base for his assault on richmond and white house itself burned to the ground now the south had victory but at what price only now did he think that he could have avenged the burning of one white house with the burning of another he shook his head rejecting the idea bandits and guerrillas made war that way civilized nations did not we must have a just and lasting peace gentlemen he told the wounded federals lying in the room where he and mary had so often slept together we must maybe the vehemence in his usually gentle voice touched the soldiers one of them said i expect we will general lee with men like you around to help make it moved in spite of himself lee said god bless you young man out this door here henry brown said pointing i do know my way doctor i assure you lee replied brown stammered in embarrassed confusion lee was embarrassed too at his own sarcasm never mind sir lead on at last the ordeal was over lee and his staff officers walked out of arlington to their horses which were cropping the grass they could reach the federal surgeon said thank you for your gracious kindness general the men will remember your visit for the rest of their lives as shall i thank you doctor i hope that by your aid and that of your colleagues those lives are long and healthy a good afternoon to you sir henry brown hurried back into arlington to resume his duties lee stood by traveller for several minutes without mounting his eyes never moving from the mansion at last charles venable asked hesitantly are you all right sir recalled to himself lee started slightly his fist came down on travellers saddle hard enough that the horse let out a startled snort his eyes were still on arlington too bad he said too bad oh too bad he climbed aboard traveller and rode away he supposed his staff officers followed for they were there when he needed them again but he did not look back the train puffed into manassas junction jerked to a noisy stop the thick black smoke that blew back into every car smelled strange wrong to nate caudell the engine was a big coalburning brute newly captured from the yankees not woodfueled like the locomotives the confederacy had been using all out boys captain lewis called weve got more marching to do the men of company d rose and part of company e with them after the fighting from the wilderness to washington city a single passenger coach was more than enough to hold a company as she stepped down from the train mollie bean said smoothest railroading trip i ever took no wonder caudell said crunching down onto gravel beside her this stretch of the orange and alexandria stayed in federal hands up till the very end of the war they didnt have to make their trains run on patches and prayers the way we did he stretched till something crackled in his back his seat had been too hard and too upright he supposed he should count himself lucky all the same some confederates were coming south on freight cars dont just stand there captain lewis said sharply form by squads i want you to look smart the company lined up behind the castalia invincibles banner which now more nearly resembled a lace doily than a proper flag so many bullets and shell fragments having pierced it in the late campaign its polished mahogany staff was new however as was the gilded eagle atop that staff the men had clubbed together to buy them in washington a minié ball had snapped the old staff in the fighting near fort stevens two squad leaders were also new edwin powell had taken a fourth wound outside washington city from this one unlike the others he would not rejoin confederate service it cost him his left arm and otis massey went into the trenches around the federal capital but he never came out again two veteran privates bill griffin and burton winstead took their places for that matter captain thorp of the chicora guards headed the regiment a leg wound had laid up colonel faribault bill smith and marcellus joyner the surviving regimental musicians got the th north carolina moving some people cheered as they marched through manassas junction some just stood and watched their faces expressionless the yankees had held the town for most of the war by the look of them a good many local shopkeepers hadnt let that stop them from getting fat almost everyone seemed better fed than the victorious soldiers of the army of northern virginia the men tramped southwest down the line of the railroad theyd gone less than a mile before caudell whistled softly when the yankees set out to tear up a train track they didnt fool around did they he said softly nope dempsey eure agreed surveying the line with a critical eye that theres what i call wreckin with a vengeance railroads were prime targets for soldiers north and south all through the war locomotives hauled more men and supplies faster than they could move any other way wrecking the enemys tracks was one of the best ways to keep him from doing what he wanted to do here the federals had torn up a tenmile stretch of their own track to keep the confederates from using the line against them after the battle of bealeton burning ties uprooting rails heating them in the flames and then bending themthat was all part of the game but the yankees had gone a step farther somehow theyd not just bent the rails theyd taken up but twisted them into corkscrews that lay in the tall grass and shrubs as if discarded there by giants when caudell spoke that conceit aloud dempsey eure said wish i had me the bottle them giants was openin with corkscrews that size reckon i could put walls inside an live like it was a plantation house thered be room and to spare thats certain i just wonder how long itll be till this stretch gets rebuilt caudell said but for tredegar iron works the south doesnt have any place that rolls track and a godawful lot of its been ruined dempsey eure worried less over the state of the confederacys railroads than that caudell hadnt cared for his joke snapping his fingers in annoyance he said your fret tin over things biggern you aint gonna change em none since that was true caudell didnt answer neither did he stop worrying night was falling by the time the th north carolina reached catletts station where the railroad became functional once more the regiment camped outside the little town not everything flammable had been burned a tumbledown barn furnished wood for campfires caudell reflected that one day soon the army would have to give over its free and easy ways of destruction that barn had undoubtedly belonged to a citizen of virginia caudell hoped he was a union man but whether or no his property was going up in flames soldiers gathered round the fires boiling coffee toasting hardtacks cooking up stews with salt pork and desiccated vegetables caudell ate till he was full filled his tin coffee cup three times hed started getting used to a full belly again after so long living on less he suspected the vast supply dumps in and around washington city could have fed the entire confederate nation not just the army of northern virginia the soldiers were still enjoying captured yankee rations he stuck a twig into the flames used its lighted end to get a cigar going he held the flavorful smoke in his mouth a long time savoring it it went so well with real coffee he tried to blow a smoke ring when he let it out but it emerged in a ragged cloud he lay back on his elbows with a smile failing usually annoyed him but not tonight get you somethin more to eat nate mollie bean said standing i could use a bit more myself no thanksmelvin ive had plenty there was so much of everything up in washington that i sometimes wonder why the north ever wanted us back seems they had aplenty just by themselves that drew mutters of agreement from everyone who heard it allison high said without our new rifles reckon the yankees mightve wore us down in the end like nate says they had them a heap more of everything else you always were a gloomy cuss allison william winstead said wedve licked em no matter what kind of guns we was totin wes toughern they are they were plenty tough enough bill caudell put in and again no one said no and there were always an awful lot more of them than there were of us im just awfully happy i had myself a repeater thats so nate cant argue it winstead said im going to see if i cant sneak mine back with me down to the farm itd make a better huntin gun than the one i got so long as i can keep it in cartridges you got that straight bill said kennel tant another farmer aint lookin forward to a oneshot muzzleloader again no indeed the guns and cartridges come out of rivington for heavens sake caudell said thats not a long trip for any of us i expect well be able to buy more ammunition there thatll take gettin used to havin to buy cartridges again allison high said he paused his long gloomy features visibly souring further wonder what them rivington menll charge for em silenceunhappy silencereigned around the campfire prices all through the confederacy had spiraled dizzily high in the army that did not matter so much food a little shelter of a sort and clothing sometimes were provided but when a man had to pay for them againcaudell thought about laying down fifty or seventyfive dollars for a hat when that was several months pay for a teacher the farmers who made up the vast majority of the castalia invincibles were lucky at least they would be able to feed themselves once they got home he wondered how he would manage someone else was thinking along with him dempsey eure said might could be ill stay in the army i only hope theyll want to keep you caudell said that brought on another break in the talk with peace at hand the army would shrink drastically still he doubted it would shrink to the tiny force the united states had had before the warhow could it with such a long border to defend against those same united states men without prospects men without families would want to stay in and some might be able to wouldnt mind another stretch myself mollie bean said still and all wouldnt be so easy she let her voice trail away caudell understood her hesitation soldiering now would be garrison duty most of it and how could she hope to keep up her masquerade under such circumstances on the other hand having known the true comradeship of men how could she go back to serving as a mere receptacle for their lusts if she couldnt stand that any longer though what could she do all good questions and he had answers for none of them or was that so you know melvin he said careful to respect her public façade of masculinity the better you read and cipher the more choices you have with your life the more different things you could do if you wanted to thats so alsie hopkins said me i dont know my letters from next week so i cant do much but farm course i never wanted to do much but farm neither mollie looked thoughtful youve taught me some nate i reckon i could do with more you still carry a primer in your knapsack two of em and a testament too he answered whip em out she told him caudell dug in his knapsack came out with a good confederate primer if one southern man can lick seven yankees how many yankees can three southern men lick was one of its arithmetic lessons whatd she ask him to whip out dempsey eure asked but he spoke softly so mollie would not hear and be hurt everyone in the castalia invincibles was fond of her she walked over sat down beside caudell and bent her head to the book the orange and alexandria railroad was broken again north of bealeton the regiment had to detrain and march over the recent field of battle the furrows plowed by shell and solid shot still tore the ground though sprouting grass and wildflowers were beginning to repair those gashes on the green body of the earth its like a different place now rufus daniel said a sight more peaceful without yankees allover it too so many yankees and confederates would never leave bealeton again humpedup dirt marked shallow common graves some of them had been dug too shallow from one a fleshless arm protruded the clawlike hand at the end of it reaching toward the sky dempsey eure pointed look at the old soldier beggin for his pay caudell snorted and you want to stay in the army dempsey so you can end up just like him well all end up like him sooner or later nate eure answered unwontedly sober there you are right sergeant chaplain william lacy said the questions that remain are the path one takes to reach that end and ones fate thereafter eure could not stay serious long preacher if its all the same to youid sooner take the railroad a lot of chaplains would have swelled up in righteous wrath and thundered damnation at him for his flippancy lacy made as if to grab the ak off a nearby soldiers back and aim it at the sergeant laughing caudell said go easy there chaplain youre a noncombatant a good thing you reminded me but lacy was laughing too laughing came easy on a bright summers day with the war well and truly won no one had laughed around bealeton back in may no one at all the regiment boarded another train south of the little town the wheezing locomotive that pulled it had served all through the war without much in the way of servicing nor had the rails seen enough repairs before the train got to orange court house it went off those rails twice dumping soldiers in wild confusion in the second spill one man broke an arm another an ankle hell of a thing takin casualties after the fightins over allison high said glumly could have been worse as rickety as this lines gotten caudell answered both men were panting along with everyone else they had shoved their car back onto the tracks by main force caudell contrasted this stretch of the orange and alexandria to the formerly federal track and engine north of manassas junction he shook his head just another sign of the abundance of northern resources he wondered how long the confederacy would need to rebuild and recover after three years of hard fighting the train rattled past orange court house then past the th north carolinas winter quarters some of the huts had been burned most of the others were torn down for their timber caudell watched the camp disappear behind him without regret that had been the hungriest winter of his life at gordonsville the train swung onto the virginia central line for the trip down to richmond the roadbed was so rough that here and there caudells teeth would click together as if winters cold had suddenly returned anybody want to put some money down on how often we derail before we finally get there rufus daniel asked the pool drew some lively action caudell bet on three times and shared the pot for winning an extra ten dollars confederate didnt hurt though he would sooner have had a twodollar yankee greenback or better still two dollars in silver he hadnt heard the sweet jingle of coins in his pocket for a long time the train stopped for the night just past atlees station a few miles north of the confederate capital captain lewis announced well lay over for a day here to let the whole army of northern virginia gather before all the regiments head for their home states again theyll hold a grand reviewwell all march through the streets and let the people cheer us i like that allison high said let em have a good long look at the poor skinny devils who did the fightin for em give em somethin to remember not that they will caudell waved his hand they may not remember us but i expect theyll remember our campfires glowing against the sky as far as the eye could see fires flickered every few feet thousands of fires caudell blinked a bit bemused artists would paint this moment one day the last bivouac of the army of northern virginia they should just be glad its our fires theyre seeing stead of the yankees rufus daniel said derisively he hummed a few bars from the northern battle hymn of the republici have seen him in the watchfires of a hundred circling camps daniel spat into the campfire and that for john browns goddamned body too again the talk ran far into the night the officers did not try to make the men go to bed they were going home soon too and instead of captains and lieutenants would soon become farmers and clerks friends and neighbors once more no more battles lay ahead only a triumphal parade the discipline of the field was fading fast the next morning the army woke not to the bugles blare or the rattle of the snare but to the wild bellow of steam whistles calling the soldiers to their trains company by company regiment by regiment they filed aboard one by one the trains puffed off toward richmond the one in which th north carolina rode made the trip without incident which cost caudell the banknote he had won the day before shouting officers in impossibly clean uniforms did their best to maintain order as the troops disembarked at the wooden shed which served as the virginia central depot they pointed northwest up broad street go on go on no not you sir wait your turn if you please now go come on boys captain lewis yelled just like we were back at old camp mangumlets show these richmond ladies how we can march there was a stratagem nicely calculated to get the best from the castalia invincibles caudell thoughtbut then lewis had always had that knack bands blared as the assembled soldiers marched up broad street blasting out tunes like the battle cry of freedom when johnny comes marching home and tramp tramp tramp the boys are marching the sidewalks were packed with people wearing their holiday best ladies in hoop skirts and bonnets and lace men with stovepipe hats that interfered with the view of those behind them some waved small flags the stainless banner the earlier stars and bars and confederate battle flags of every description red white and blue bunting decorated every building as did garlands of bright summer flowers the railroad tracks that ran down the center of broad street made caudell careful about where he put his feet the last thing he wanted was to stumble in front of such an enormous audience a man who fell here might not live it down for the rest of his life not with so many witnesses from his own county to keep bringing it up and reminding him about it because he worried more about his marching than where he was caudell hardly looked up for the first several blocks of the grand review when he did the th north carolina was tramping past the first african baptist church at the northeast corner of broad and college the large sprawling building had a slate roof no spire and a low iron fence and gate all around it despite the churchs name caudell saw no africans in front of it the thought made him pay more attention to the crowd richmond had a goodsized negro population most slave a few free but he spied hardly any colored faces a few grinning pickaninnies gaped at the parade that was all the black folk of richmond he suspected would sooner have come out for a parade of blue coats through their citys streets across the street from the african baptist church was the old monumental church a twostory building in the classic style surmounted by a low dome and fenced with stone below and iron bars above streamers ran from tree to tree in front of the fence small boys perched in the trees and cheered the passing soldiers caudell reached up to wave his hat to them then jerked down his hand feeling foolishhe still hadnt replaced that old felt hed lost in the wilderness capitol square was just a short block south of broad street but the bulk first of the powhatan hotel and then of richmonds city hall kept caudell from seeing as much of it as he would have liked across the street from the hotel stood the almost equally massive greek revival pile of the first baptist church eyesleft captain lewis said caudells head twisted as if on clockwork just past the city halla building as severely hellenic as the churchwas a reviewing stand on it stood president davis tall and supremely erect beside him in a coat much too large for his slim frame was his vice president alexander stephens stephens hardly bigger than a boy of fourteen looked pale and unhealthy and seemed to be holding himself upright by main force of will other civilian dignitariescongressmen judges cabinet members what have youcrowded the reviewing stand but caudell had eyes only for two gray suits in the midst of the black just below jefferson davis stood general lee his hat off in salute to the soldiers marching past another older man in fancy uniform a man with a high forehead rather foxy features side whiskers and an elegant imperial of mixed brown and gray was a couple of people away from lee thats joe johnston caudell exclaimed pointing by god youre right rufus daniel said is the army of tennessee here too then damned if i know caudell answered there was so much confusion at the train station that the army of the potomac might be marching along behind us and wed never know it all he could see of the parade was the couple of companies ahead of the castalia invincibles and twisting his neck the company right behind rufus daniel barked out a couple of syllables of laughter reckon wed find out right quick if there was bluebellies back there just for a moment his left hand slid to the sling of his ak caudell grinned and nodded he was home from washington city the only federal soldiers to have reached richmond arrived as prisoners of war the th north carolina passed the reviewing stand and the broad street methodist church with its immensely tall spire on down broad street they marched as captain lewis had asked of them they did the memory of their camp mangum days proud keeping their alignment and distance from one another with an ease that bespoke their two years of practice in the field their step was smooth and elastic the swinging of their arms as steady as the beat of a pendulum a middleaged woman threw a bunch of purple daisies caudell caught it out of the air if hed had a hat he would have put it in the band dempsey eure wore bright buttercups along with his turkey feather since he was bareheaded caudell reached over his shoulder and stuck the stems into the barrel of his rifle the woman clapped her hands thus ornamented caudell made his way past the depot of the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad and a block farther on the new and impressive richmond theater with its pilasters reaching from the second floor almost to the top of the building the railroad tracks continued down the middle of the street for close to another twenty blocks before they swung north toward the destinations the train lines name promised the crowds began to thin out by the time the tracks left broad street that was at the very edge of town provost marshals waved the men on out to camp lee they shouted pointing north and west caudell marched with a fresh will where better to end the grand review than a camp named for the souths grandest soldier the broad green expanse of camp lee lay about a mile beyond the point where richmonds buildings stopped another tall reviewing stand its boards still white and new stood at the western edge of the lawn a big confederate flag on an even taller pole flew beside it in front of it were other banners mostly of red white and blue captured federal battle flags caudell puffed up with pride when he saw how many there were hills corps heths division a provost marshal said yall go this way along with the other units in henry heths division the th north carolina went this way caudell found himself off to the left of the reviewing stand but close enough to the front that he might be able to hear at least some of what a speaker on that stand had to say before any speaker spoke though the grounds had to fill turning his head this way and that caudell saw the whole army of northern virginia arrayed to the left of the reviewing stand hills corps ewells and longstreets too then a provost marshal bellowed bishop polks corps over here sure enough the army of tennessee had also come to richmond to join the review who cares allison high said just means we have to stand here twice as long while they get wherever theyre supposed to go it wasnt quite twice as long for only part of the army of tennessee seemed to be here after all the rest of it caudell supposed was likely to be in tennessee reclaiming land that had been under the federal thumb for most of the war even so the sun had sunk low in the northwestand from where caudell stood almost directly behind the reviewing standwhen jefferson davis robert e lee and joe johnston rode down the aisle between the army of northern virginia and the army of tennessee the two armies shouted themselves hoarse each trying to outcheer the other the army of northern virginia outnumbered its rival and so had the better of that contest the president and his generals waved from horseback acknowledging the salute the three men ascended the reviewing stand together quiet came slowly and incompletely the lean hard soldiers who had done so much endured so much behind their tattered battle flags were not the sort from whom to expect perfect discipline or perfect courtesy lee and johnston understood that they had stopped a couple of steps below president davis now they bowed first to each other and then up to him his answering bow deeper than theirs went not to them but straight out to the soldiers they had led the men raised another cheer their high shrill war cries split the air we shall hear the rebel yell no more davis said which brought fresh outcries and shouts of no he held up a hand we shall hear the rebel yell no more for we are not rebels nor have we ever been we are free and independent southern men with our native southern yell the president could not go on after that for some time caudell yelled at the top of his lungs but could not hear his own shout for the cries of the two great confederate armies rolled through his head loud as the noise of the battlefield his ears rang when the cheering finally faded away and fresh yips and yowls kept breaking out somewhere in the assembled hosts every few minutes as a result he heard daviss speech not as a complete and polished oration but as a series of disjointed phrases a sentence here a paragraph there we showed ourselves worthy of the inheritance bequeathed us by the patriots of the revolution we emulated that heroic devotion which made reverse to them but the crucible in which their patriotism was refined our highspirited and gallant soldiers i congratulate you on the series of brilliant victories which under the favor of divine providence you have won and as the president of the confederate states do heartily tender to you the thanks of the country whose just cause you have so skillfully and heroically served driven the invader from your soil and wrung from an unscrupulous foe the recognition of your birthright community independence you have given assurance to the friends of constitutional liberty of our final triumph in the struggle against despotic usurpation repeated cheers rose as long as president davis promised the soldiers before him he did not content himself with that however but went on to speak of the confederacy in the abstract after the war of the revolution the several states were each by name recognized to be independent but the north willfully broke the compact between the independent states and claimed its government to be not such a compact but set up over and above the states perverting it into a machine for their control in domestic affairs the creature was exalted above its creators the principals made subordinate to the agent appointed by themselves thus our states dissolved their connections with the others and thus our glorious confederacy was born caudell heard that part clearly for the men stood quiet through it it was an appeal to the intellect not to the passions had he been standing in that place on this occasion he thought he would have left it out every word of it was true but it was not what the soldiers needed to hear now davis thought too much felt too little he seemed to sense that himself and why nothe had been a soldier before he turned to politics he did his best to reach a strong conclusion no one may successfully undertake the gigantic task of conquering a free people this truth always so patent to us has now been forced upon the reluctant northern mind mr lincoln discovered that no peace was attainable unless based upon the recognition of our indefeasible rights for that i have to thank the indomitable valor of our troops and the unquenchable spirit of our people god bless you all again caudell cheered as loudly as anyone realizing the independence of the confederate states was a heady moment one he still sometimes had trouble believing had truly come but in thanking soldiers and people jefferson davis had omitted one factor that also played a major part in freeing the south the rivington men and their repeaters caudell wondered if they resented remaining unmentioned and unpraised the applause faded died the men of the armies of northern virginia and tennessee stood in the deepening twilight talking with their friends and comrades of what theyd done today well nate its all over now mollie bean said what the hell comes next i wish i knew he answered for himself he had a pretty fair idea he would go home and do his best to put his life back together the way it had been before the war came for mollie though that choice looked grimmer captain lewis answered the question for the short term well stay here at camp lee tonight rations are supposed to come tomorrow morning and then theyll start mustering us out the captain caudell noticed hadnt said anything about rations for tonight that failed to surprise him once the army of northern virginia got down below bealeton again it had returned to the care of the creaky confederate commissary department he shrugged he wouldnt go hungry as he still had his last three or four hardtacks from washington they were stale by now but hed eaten much worseand much less going back to worrying over how fresh his food wasas opposed to whether hed have anywould be strange mollie said when we get a fire goin nate will you spend some time with me by it with them books of yours sure i will melvin he answered youve learned a lot since you took up your studies in earnest he meant every word of that he wished his students who were half mollies age showed half the intensity she displayed her lips curled back in something that was not a smile it pulled the skin tight against her bones let him see for a moment how she would look when she was an old woman she said i shouldve done more sooner now its about too late its never too late he said she shook her head apparently determined to be gloomy he persisted you have the trick of reading now to hold it all you need to do is keep on reading and not let it lie fallow its just likehe groped for a comparison that would make sense to herlike stripping and cleaning your ak that was hard at first but you kept practicing till you got the knack now you dont even have to think about it anymore maybe she said anything but convinced youll see instead of a primer he got out his pocket testament that evening mollie protested but he said try it see if im not right he opened the little book pointed to a place start right here i cant do it but mollie bent her head close to the tiny print of the testament and began to read jesus took bread and blessed it and brakewhy dont it say brokeit and gave it to thethe disciples and said take eat this is my body and he took the cup and gave thanks and gave it to them saying drink ye all of it for this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the reuhremission of sins her face lit up in that special way she had just for a moment she outshone the campfire goddam i did it yup caudell said smugly almost as pleased as she was you stumbled a couple of times on the harder words but that can happen to anybody it doesnt matter anyhow what matters is that you read it and you understood you did didnt you i surely did she answered i surely did caudell had been reading since he was a little boy he took literacy for granted not for the first time since hed joined the army he saw how much it meant to someone who came to it late once started now mollie did not want to stop not even when the campfire died into red embers and caudell yawned until he thought his jaw would break almost everyone else was asleep by then some men wrapped in blankets more simply lying on the grass under the stars that was no hardship not on a fair warm night caudell thanked heaven the war had not lasted into another winter the men would have been without blankets then too finally he could hold his eyes open no more melvin he said why dont you just keep that little testament that way youll always have something to read a book of my own a testament of my own to keep in the faint firelight mollies eyes were enormous she glanced this way and that when she saw no one close by was paying any attention she leaned over and gave caudell a quick kiss her voice sank to a throaty whisper we werent right out here in the open nate id do bettern that instead of rising to the occasion he yawned again even more gigantically than before right about now i think im too worn to do any woman any good or myself either he said whispering too mollie laughed not one man in tend admit as much no matter how true it was mostd sooner try and then blame you when it turned out they couldnt she shook her head as if at a bad memory then kissed him again might could be well find us another chance before too long nate i hope so you sleep good now you hear i will memollie he risked her real name thanks as he rolled himself in his blanket he wondered if they would find another chance they wouldnt be thrown together anymore not with the th north carolina mustering out he would go back to teaching and shehe didnt know what shed do he hoped it would be better than what shed come from and that the letters hed taught her would help make it so he wriggled to get comfortable the grass was soft against his cheek but his longlost hat would have made a better pillow he twisted again turned his head back toward the fire there sat mollie bean stubbornly reading the bible just as troops had filled broad street in the grand review the day before so now they filled franklin street then marching out of richmond they had moved briskly now coming back into the city they advanced at a snails pace nate caudells stomach growled the promised morning rations had never arrived at camp lee somehow that seemed fitting the army of northern virginia had always been able to fight staying fed was another matter altogether well no matter he thought when his point on this long slow line reached mechanics hall at last some war department clerk would officially sever his connection with the confederate army maybe he said dreamily theyll even pay us off as they let us out allison high snorted this heres just gettingout day nate not the judgment day they aint paid us in so long reckon they forgot theyre supposed to besides way prices are what they owe us aint worth worryin over anyhow dempsey eure added they owe us more than money caudell said they wont remember that either not longern a few months high answered caudell wanted to contradict the cynical sergeant but found he couldnt the guess seemed only too likely slowly slowly they inched toward capitol square some people came out to look at them but only a handful compared to the day before a teamster driving an immense wagon from the back of the near wheeler of his sixmule team had to pull to a stop when the soldiers blocked his path down fifth street he swore loudly at them allison high let out a grim chuckle some of them bastards wont remember longern a few minutes let alone months rufus daniel dealt with the foulmouthed teamster more directly he unslung his ak and pointed it at the man you just want to be a little more careful who youre cussin around dont you friend he asked in a pleasant voice the teamster suddenly seemed to realize daniel was far from the only man there with a rifle he opened his mouth closed it again sssorry he managed at last when the soldiers finally cleared the way he snapped his whip over the mules backs jerked the reins with unnecessary ferocity the wagon rattled through the castalia invincibles bayed laughter after it they crawled past sixth street past seventh the sun climbed ever higher into the sky sweat poured down caudells face when he wiped his forehead with his sleeve the wool turned a darker shade of gray i might not shoot a wagondriver he said but i do believe id kill a man for a tall glass of beer as if in answer to that irregular prayer four ladies came out of one of the fine houses between seventh and eighth a black woman pushed the oldest lady in a wheeled chair that lady had on her lap and the other white women carried trays filled with glasses of water they all came up to the castiron fence in front of their house you must be hot and thirsty young men the woman in the wheeled chair said come help yourselves soldiers crowded against the fence in the blink of an eye caudell was close enough and quick enough to get a glass he downed it in three blissful swallows thank you very kindly maam he said to the woman from whose tray hed taken it she was not far from his own age attractive if rather sternfeatured and wore a maroon satin dress that like the house from which shed come said she was a person of consequence emboldened because he was sure hed never see her again caudell plunged do you mind if i ask whose kindness im thanking the woman hesitated then said my name is mary lee first sergeant caudells first thought was mild surprise that shed read his chevrons his second when he really heard her name was hardly a thought at all he automatically stiffened to attention nor was he the only one every man whose ears caught the name lee straightened up at the mere sound of it maam thank you maam he stammered there now youve gone and frightened them said the youngest lee daughteractually she was hardly more than a girl oh hush mildred mary lee said sounding like every elder sister in the world she turned back to caudell after you brave men have done so much for your country helping you now is our privilege and the least return we can make the woman in the wheeled chair nodded vigorously my husband never fails to marvel at the spirit the soldiers under his command showed an through the war even when things looked blackest she turned her head so she could look up at me servant behind her julia fetch the tray of cakes now if you please yes mistiss the black woman said she walked back to the house vanished inside by then the soldiers ahead of the castalia invincibles had advanced several yards the men shouted for them to move up too where before caudell had cursed the line for moving too slowly now he cursed it for moving too fast he had to go on company e enjoyed the lee ladies cakes caudell tried to stay philosophical he hadnt expected to meet marse roberts daughters and did his best to be satisfied with that the line froze up again between eighth and ninth streets philosophy had trouble competing with an empty stomach caudell wished hed gotten to eat one of those cakes at last though he and his comrades snaked into mechanics hall advanced toward the desks in the foyer signs above those desks read ab cd ef gh and ik caudell got into the appropriate line name and company asked the clerk behind the cd desk nathaniel caudell mr uh caudell read the mans nameplate jones caudell nathaniel john beauchamp jones meticulously lined through his name he reached over to a pile of paper handed a sheet from it to caudell this is your railroad pass home to be used within five days time you will be required to turn in your rifle and ammunition at the station before boarding your train he glanced at caudells sleeve first sergeant eh he took a paper from another stack wrote a number on a blank line here is a warrant for two months back pay which will be honored at any bank in the confederate states of america your nation is grateful for your service unlike mary lee jones sounded as if he were parroting a memorized phrase even before caudell turned to go he called out next caudell looked at the sum for which his pay warrant had been issued forty dollars confederate wouldnt go far and hed been owed four or five months pay he couldnt remember which not two still he supposed he was lucky to get any money or even the promise of money at all he stuck the warrant in a trouser pocket went back out onto franklin street the line of waiting men in gray still stretched northwest up the street as far as the eye could see a couple of fellows in another uniform the mottled greenbrown of the rivington men sat on the steps of the building across from mechanics hall and watched the thick slowly advancing column their red and white banner with its spiky black symbol flew atop that building alongside the confederate flag as caudell started down the stairs of mechanics hall the rivington men solemnly shook hands ix robert e lee rode traveller up twelfth street toward president daviss residence up in the most literal sense of the word for the greek revival mansion stood on the tip of shockoe hill north and east of capitol square jefferson davis met him in front of the gray building that despite its color had come to be known as the confederate white house lee dismounted traveller swung his head down and began to crop the grass beside the walkway good morning good to see you general davis said as the two men shook hands the president turned his head called jim come and see to general lees horse all at once he looked nonplused an unfamiliar expression for that stern countenance to bear thats twice ive done that this month alone and it was january when jim ran off and mrs daviss maid with him he raised his voice again moses a plump black man came out of the mansion took competent charge of traveller lee followed davis to the porch the blackpainted iron banister was rough under the palm of his right hand as he climbed the stairs come into the parlor the president urged standing aside so lee could precede him another slave brought in a tray of coffee rolls and butter lee broke a roll but sniffed at the butter before he began to spread it he set down the knife i believe i shall have it plain today he said davis also sniffed at the butter dish he made a sour face im sorry general impossible to keep it fresh in this climate i know ive found that too its of no consequence i assure you lee ate the roll drank a cup of coffee by the taste the brew had some of the real bean in it with the armistice commerce was beginning to revive but he also noted the sharp flavor of roasted chicory root times were still far from easy he leaned forward in his seat how can i help you today mr president davis fiddled with the black silk cravat under his wing collar he leaned forward too set his halfempty coffee cup on his knee despite the armistice between ourselves and the united states general many points of disagreement obviously remain the most urgent of them being precisely where our northern boundary shall rest yes that is a pressing concern lee said indeed davis smiled thinly at the understatement mr lincoln and i have agreed to appoint commissioners to settle the matter amicably if that proves at all possible the smile disappeared i sent commissioners to washington from montgomery before the war began to settle our points of difference with the federal government not only did he then refuse formally to treat with them he and secretary of state seward led them to believe all would be peacefully resolved when in fact they were planning the resupply and reinforcement of fort sumter this time i expect no such games i should hope not lee said and that is why i bade you join me here today davis went on to ask if you would be kind enough to serve as one of my commissioners your colleagues would be mr stephens and mr benjamin i want to have one military man as a member of the commission and a man in whose judgment i may implicitly rely i am honored by the trust you repose in me mr president and pleased to serve in any capacity in which you think i might be of assistance to the nation lee said has president lincoln also appointed commissioners he has davis said his mouth tightened and he did not seem pleased about going on finally lee had to prompt him who are they mr seward mr stanton the secretary of war davis stopped again he got the last name out from between clenched teeth for his third commissioner lincoln has had the infernal gall to propose ben butler has he lee said dismayed it is an insult it is indeed davis said butler an accomplished lawyer and democratic politician before the war had turned into the worst sort of political general once fighting broke out in virginia he had started the practice of treating escaped southern slaves as contraband of war as federal proconsul of new orleans he had insulted the citys women and made himself so loathed that the confederacy vowed to hang him without trial if he was captured sighing the president went on i wish wed caught him as he was retreating from bermuda hundred then if wed found enough rope to go round his fat neck wed have been rid of him for good but with the war ended lincoln has conferred diplomatic immunity upon him and molesting him would only rouse fresh hostilitieswith the onus of guilt for them upon us lee sighed too your reasoning is cogent as always very well ben butler it shall be are we to go to washington or will the federal commissioners come here the latter davis answered as we were the victors theirs is the obligation to acknowledge that victory by visiting us the telegraph will keep them adequately connected to mr lincoln moreover i entertain the hope that butler will lack the courage to reenter a nation he has done so much to defile thereby removing from us the requirement of treating with him by the doleful tone in his voice he found that unlikely so did lee though uncertain how much courage butler possessed he knew the man was long on effrontery he asked when will the two gentlemen and mr butler arrive davis smiled at his choice of words in three days time ive arranged for them to stay at the powhatan house and for an armed guard to ensure nothing unfortunate befalls mr butler the forms must be observed after all your discussions themselves will take place in the cabinet room which being but one floor below my own offices will enable me to quickly form a judgment as to any disputed points very good mr president lee said nodding davis was a man to keep a close eye on everything that was done in his administration lee went on mr benjamin must be pleased to have more activity in his sphere these days than was formerly the case oh indeed davis said along with the european powers the emperor maximilian has sent a minister from the city of mexico and dom pedro of brazil has also extended to us his nations recognition as our social institutions are so like those of brazil i find that last recognition long overdue but i shall take no public notice of the delay have you specific instructions for the adjustments we are to seek from the united states lee asked i did not object to the armistice terms you proposed to lincolnas a starting point for our discussions as to how much more than that starting point the federals prove willing to yield well general on that we shall have to await events the rivington men who have always been uncommonly well informed seem to be under the impression that they may well surrender both kentucky and missouri as well as specie payments to serve as an indemnity for what they worked upon our country which after all bore the brunt of the recent fighting kentucky and missouri that was not the impression mr lincoln created in me quite the opposite in fact lee frowned he wondered how muchhe wondered just whatthe rivington men had told jefferson davis though dealing with his own president he felt the need to be circumspect in finding out he said the rivington men know a great many things mr president but they do not know everything there is to know i sometimes wonder davis fell silent he cocked his head slightly to one side as if studying lee then he murmured four words two oh one four lee grinned in genuine admiration it was all he could do to keep from clapping his hands had he not learned the secret of america will break the numbers would have been meaningless to him as it wasso mr president they have also told you theyre from a time yet to come and given proofs you find convincing they have jefferson daviss features were too stern too disciplined to be very expressive but a tiny widening of his eyes an easing of the tension that pulled as if with purse strings at the corners of his mouth showed his relief i wondered if i was the only one to whom theyd entrusted their secret so did i lee admitted i am glad to learn otherwise but did they not tell you sir that while they came from the future it was a future wherein the federals overcame us a future they traveled back here to prevent davis nodded his wide thin mouth narrowed again yes and of many evils that would arise there thaddeus stevens he spoke the abolitionists name as if it were a curse if nothing else they have kept that evil from overfalling us for which alone we should be in their debt all true mr president they helped me greatly by their foreknowledge of the course grants thrust into the wilderness would take but once i and others began to act upon that foreknowledge and change what would have been the world grew apart from what they knew andries rhoodie said as much to me they now see through a glass darkly even as other men they cannot know then it seems to me upon what terms mr lincolns commissioners will settle with us davis reached up to stroke the graying tuft of hair under his chin i see the point you are making general it is well taken nevertheless they remain astute men and their considered judgments worthy of our closest attention certainly sir again choosing his words carefully lee added any group within our confederation which found itself possessed of such power as the rivington men enjoy would be worthy of our closest attention lest they seek to dominate it you mean davis said lee nodded so did the president rather grimly that thought has crossed my mind often in the small hours when i would be better off asleep when the north remained our chiefest foe it was a little worry now it is a larger one i am glad to find that a man of your quality shares it i gain confidence that at need i shall be able to pass on the burden to someone already familiar with it sir lee said not quite catching the presidents drift daviss eyes bored into his you know that under the terms of the constitution of the confederate states i am limited to a single sixyear term after the elections our nation must have at its head someone able to rise above faction and lead us all i can think of no one more likely than you to meet that requirement and additionally to meet whatever challenge the rivington men may present i chose you as a commissioner not only for your undoubted and unmatched abilities but also to help keep you in the public eye between now and our election day one thing i have learned is that the people forget too soon you are serious lee said slowly he had not been so startled since the day when general mcclellan relying on a captured set of confederate orders abandoned his usual indolence and broke through the south mountain gap to force the battle of sharpsburg this surprise was almost as disagreeable as the other had been i have never taken an interest in politics mr president nor ever cared to i was trained as a soldier myself as you know perfectly well i would tena hundredtimes rather have commanded troops in the field than spent my days wrangling with a recalcitrant congress over the minutiae of legislation whose urgency in the situation in which we found ourselves should have been apparent to anyone this side of raving idiocy a state to which i frequently thought congress was striving to reduce me but i remained where fate and duty placed me and i entertain no doubt that come the time you will do the same may that cup pass from me lee said you know what passed with him who first made that prayer and how when the hour came he drank the cup to the dregs the president smiled his thin wintry smile weve known each other better than half our lives since the west point days when we were youths learning to be soldiersand to be men now that we are become what once we aspired to be how may we fail to recognize that which is required of us give me battle any day lee said battle you shall have even if it be battle without flags or cannon that if nothing else this office holds lee still shook his head davis did not press him further the president was not always an adroit politician his own passionately clear view of affairs made him have trouble compromising with those who held differing opinions but lee knew davis had hooked him as neatly as if he were a crappie in a gravelbottomed stream just as a crappie would go for a worm so lee leaped high when his duty was invoked oh but the hook was barbed barbed i think i should sooner face the frying pan than the presidency he muttered of course davis said taking the privilege of the last word for the presidency is the fire with a screech of iron against iron a deepthroated bellow from the steam whistle and a series of jerks as cars came together as closely as their couplings would allow the southbound train pulled to a halt nate caudell wiped his face with his sleeve with the windows shut the passenger car was a stinking sweatbox with them open so much smoke poured in that all the soldiers would have taken on the look of a traveling blackface minstrel show a brakeman stuck his head into the compartment shouted rivington alf out for rivington half an hour layover mollie bean got to her feet this heres where i leave good luck to you melvin yall take care now you hear we uns will miss you whether she was called melvin or not her disguise could not have held up much longer not from the way the castalia invincibles hugged her as she walked to the front of the car caudell got off at rivington too though he intended to board again for he was traveling through to rocky mount he told himself he just wanted to stretch his legs and to get a look at the town from which the marvelous confederate repeaters had sprung but somehow he was not surprised to end up walking beside mollie im sorry you chose to stop here he said after a little while on account of what im likely to be doin you mean she asked he felt himself reddening but had to nod mollie sighed readin and cipherin or no i couldnt set on anything else that seemed promisin if you know what i mean she looked up at him or was you maybe thinkin of takin me along with you caudell had thought of it more than once being with mollie as a soldier as a companion made him think differently about herand in many ways more of herthan any other woman hed known butshe was still a whore he could not make himself forget that mollie i he said and could not go on never mind nate she set a hand on his arm i shouldntve asked you i know how things are i just hopedoh shitfire the more she sounded like a soldier the harder the time he had remembering she was anything else she forced animation into her voice will you look at this place dont hardly seem like the same town i left two years ago caudell looked the train tracks ran down the middle of what passed for rivingtons main street the train station was of familiar southern type with clapboard walls an eightfoot roof overhang on either side to keep off the rain and unloading doors for freight and passengers but everything was freshly painted and almost preternaturally clean two negroes with longhandled mops went around swabbing off soot as caudell watched several others picked up trash and tossed it into sheetmetal bins hed never seen anything like that before anywhere just west of the station stood a row of warehouses that were plainly new the pine boards from which theyd been built were a bright unweathered straw color sentries wearing the motley greenbrown that was the uniform of the rivington men and carrying aks walked a beat around the warehouses they looked alert and dangerous and measured caudell with their eyes when he glanced their way they did not seem much impressed which irritated him what sort of action had they been through never seen them before mollie said caudell wondered if she meant the warehouses or their arrogant guards she pointed to the corduroyed road that ran west from the new buildings until it disappeared into the pine woods that grew almost to the edge of town that theres new too wonder where it goes never knew anybody to live out that way fancy road to go nowhere caudell said corduroying was expensive have to ask at the excelsior mollie nodded toward a rather shabby hotel a few doors down from the station it hadnt been repainted any time recently neither had the general store the baptist church or the blacksmiths shop nearby they seemed reassuringly normal but beyond them was another hotel that dwarfed the old excelsior it was smaller than the powhatan in richmond but not much in bold red letters above the doorway its sign said notahilton whats a notahilton mollie said her eyes wide thats new since i left so are the bank and the church by it damned if i know what a notahilton is caudell answered shall we wander over and find out wouldnt want you to miss your train nate fellow said half an hour just because he said it doesnt make it so half an hour train time is usually an hour and a half if youre not railroading despite his confident words caudell glanced back toward the train the local negroes certainly seemed more diligent than the ordinary run of slaves he supposed he oughtnt to have been surprised if the rivington men worked niggers hard in the army they would hardly let them slack at home but his eyes opened wide at the vim with which a crew of four black men hauled wood from a covered rick and tossed it into the tender at the care with which another slave this one hardly more than a boy oiled the trucks under each car in his experience most niggers would not have bothered to lift the oil can as they went from one car to the next they would let a stream of oil spill onto the ground though it had cost a dollar and a half a gallon even before the war this negro wasted not a drop few white mechanics would have been so fussy caudell stuck his hands in his trouser pockets one hand closed on his pay warrant he took it out i know what i can do fast though turn this into money lets try your new bank instead of the notahilton i got one of them too mollie said lets go first rivington bank proclaimed the gilded sign above the entrance three clerks waited behind a high counter a guard stood inside he nodded politely to caudell and mollie caudell nodded back also politely the guard carried a repeater with the safety off and wore greenbrown he looked like a combat soldier how can i help you gentlemen asked the clerk whom caudell and mollie approached he had an accent like benny langs caudell passed him the warrant forty dollars yes sir with pleasure he opened a drawer on his side of the counter took out two big gold coins a tiny gold dollar two silver dimes and a large copper cent then passed them across the polished marble here you are caudell gaped at the coins gold he said his voice a startled croak yes sir of course the clerk said patiently forty dollars is grains or two ounces thirty grains these are one ounce apiece he picked up the big coins let them ring sweetly against the counter they were like no coins caudell had seen before with the profile of a bearded man on one side and an antelope on the other but below the antelope were magic words oz gold fine the clerk went on thirty grains of gold comes to which is your balance here inever expected gold at all caudell said just banknotes no matter how big a lie that fine was he had to come out ahead on this deal he also abruptly understood why the first rivington bank needed a guard with an ak the clerk frowned at him this is rivington sir we deal properly here especially to soldiers his eyes dared caudell to challenge him all at once caudell was convinced his gold was the real thing he scooped it up pay me too mollie passed the rivington man her warrant twentysix dollars private makes grains which is the clerk thought for a moment a trifle more than an ounce and a third he took out another of those oneounce coins another one smaller but otherwise identicalhere is a quarterounce piece a gold dollar three quarters and after another pause for thought a onecent piece that should do it mollie and caudell both shook their heads in disbelief as they left the bank gold mollie whispered i got me a bit of a stake me too caudell said rivington men might trade gold dollars for confederate dollars one for one but no one else did forty dollars in gold would take him a long way lets go spend some of it and have ourselves a drink at that notahilton that sounds right good to me mollie said but just then the steam whistle let go with a blast that rang through the town oh goddam she kicked at the dirt began to turn away i guess they mean that half an hour after all caudell said regretfully then he had an inspiration tell you what mollie one of these days soon you go on into that notahilton find out what its like then you write me a letter and tell me about it ill write back i promise i will that way we can stay friends even if were far apart write a letter mollie looked more frightened than she ever had marching into battle nate you learned me some readin but writin you can do it i know you can in fact ill write you first so youll know where i am im not sure whether im going to stay in nashville or head on up to castalia and i expect to hear back from you do you understand he did his best to sound like a first sergeant i dont know nate well maybe if you do write first i can try and answer you back if you do if you dont want to forget you ever knew me the minute that train rolls out of here he read in her eyes he wondered how many lies she had heard over the years and from how many men ill write he promised the train whistle wailed a second warning caudell scowled they did mean it he hugged mollie hard it would not have seemed out of place to an onlooker even had she been only a fellow soldier through her shirt though her small firm breasts pressed against him she hugged him too good luck to you he said to you too nate the whistle wailed again mollie pushed him away go on you dont want to miss it he knew she was right he turned and trotted toward the train he didnt look back until just before he climbed aboard mollie was walking not to the notahilton but into the old excelsior he shook his head stared down at the dirty parquet floor of the passenger car the train jerked began to roll very soon the bulk of the station hid the hotel from sightvery soon but not soon enough rocky mount the brakeman yelled as the train wheezed to a stop onehour layover rocky mount caudell climbed to his feet allison high stood too held out his hand i wish you well nate and thats a fact he said thank you allison and the same to you caudell walked to the front of the car shaking a few more hands as he went allison high sat back down he wouldnt get off until wilson down in the next county caudell jumped down leaving the train for the last time made leaving the army seem real he looked around save for the sign that told what town it belonged to the station might have been cut from the same mold as rivingtons cut from that mold and then left out in the rain for eighty or a hundred years it was weatherbeaten two of the windows had empty panes the decorative wooden latticework that edged the roof was broken in half a dozen places he looked north toward the mound on the far side of the falls of the tar river where rocky mount had first begun to grow he had a clearer view than he really wanted the year before federal raiders had burnt most of the cotton mills and cotton and tobacco warehouses that stood between the vain station and the older part of town here a wall stood there a few charred timbers the odor of burnt tobacco still hung in the air off to one side lay the fine house that belonged to benjamin battle who owned the mills somehow it had escaped the flames seeing that caudell clicked his tongue between his teeth them as has gits he muttered to himself he seldom let such uncouth southernisms pass his lips but nothing more refined seemed appropriate he walked over to the station the stationmaster a tall thin dour fellow in his sixties peered out at him through one of the glassless panes they had a few seconds staring contest before the stationmaster unwillingly said hep you sojer whens the next stage for nashville caudell asked now the stationmaster smiled exposing pink gums and a few yellowed stubs of teeth just set out an hour or so ago he said with malicious satisfaction aint gonna be another one fo two days might could be three damnation caudell said the stationmasters smile got wider caudell wanted to knock out the teeth he had left hed done some huge number of dozenmile hikes in the army and plenty worse than that but the thought of returning to civilian life with one was less than appetizing he turned away from the window the stationmaster chuckled till he started to cough caudell hoped hed choke another train this one coming up from the south let its whistle squeal as it pulled into rocky mount caudell walked over to the east side of the station to have a look at who was coming in a few small boys and old men joined him idlers he thought for the moment he was an idler himself he gaped at the skeletal faces pressed against coach windows at the rags and tatters that covered those emaciated bodies who were these victims of disaster and how could his fellow spectators take the sight of them so calmly then an old man remarked mo yankee prisoners headin home and caudell noticed that most of the train passengers rags were or might once have been blue he shook his head in mute horrified sympathy the men of the army of northern virginia had gone hungry the memory of that hunger would stay with him an his life but these men had starved now he understood the difference he also felt ashamed that his country could have let them suffer so but with everything scarce was it any wonder the confederacy had seen to its own first only a couple of men got off the train to stretch their legs perhaps only a couple of men had the strength to do so one of them spied caudell the man looked in better shape than most of his comrades even his uniform was hardly more ragged than the first sergeants hello johnny reb he said with a nod and a grin howre they hangin hello caudell answered rather more hesitantly casting about for something more to add to that he asked whered they catch you yank bealeton just this past spring the federal said he jerked a thumb back toward the train otherwise id look more like these poor devils bealeton caudell exclaimed i was there in hills corps were you we fought some of hills men matter of fact i was leading the th pennsylvania there in the ix corps im henry pleasants i ami used to be i guess i meana lieutenant colonel pleasants tapped the silver oak leaf on his left shoulder strap the right strap was missing he stuck out his hand caudell shook it gave his own name he said we went up against ix corps troops but they were niggers they fought better than i thought they might but we chewed em up pretty good that would have been ferreros division pleasants said they were all colored troops i was under brigadier general potter he shook his head ruefully he was somewhere not far from caudells age with dark hair very fair pale skin and a scraggly beard that looked new he went on worse luck for the country you chewed up the whole army of the potomac pretty good you and those damned repeaters of yours i wouldnt say its worse luck for the country caudell retorted no i dont suppose you would pleasants chuckled he seemed a man well able to take care of himself under any circumstances and since your side won the history books wont say that either but i do its too damn bad so there caudell laughed he found himself liking this cheerfully defiant northerner tell you what yanksuppose i buy you a drink and we can argue about whats good and whats bad for a drink mr first sergeant nate caudell sir ill argue or not just as you please where shall we go caudell thought about asking the sour stationmaster decided not to bother well find a place his confidence was soon rewarded of the three or four rebuilt buildings by the station two proved to be taverns he waved his new friend toward the cleanerlooking one pleasants glanced back toward the train which did not seem likely to go anywhere any time soon he ran a hand through his hair damned if i see how you people ever managed to get from here to there ive been on three different gauges of track since i set out from andersonville your locomotives are all fixing to die and your tracks and beds are wearing out even though theyre on flat easy ground disgraceful if you ask me we manage caudell said shortly he eyed the northern man you sound like you know what youre talking about damn well ought to it was amazing how well pleasants could preen in such a shabby uniform i was a railroad engineer for years before i went into mining instead but to hell with that are we going to stand out here gabbing all afternoon or will you buy me that drink when caudell set his two silver dimes in front of the taverner they bought him a quart jug one drink turned into several the whiskey hit caudell hard hed stayed mostly sober in the army he stared owlishly across the rickety table at pleasants why the devil do you want to go back north at all henry you yankees you have engineers of this and engineers of that coming out of your ears you stay down here you could write your own ticket not much mining in this part of the state but the railroads are crying for somebody who knows what hes doing pleasants stared back for a little while before he answered he was feeling his load too you know nate thats tempting it truly is but i have me a train to catch he got up and wobbled toward the door caudell followed they took a couple of steps in the direction of the station before they noticed the train was gonepossibly long gone by the way the sun had become a sullen red ball just above the horizon its an omen thats what it is pleasants declared here im meant to be he struck a pose staggered and reeled into caudell they both laughed then went back to the tavern the fellow who ran the place admitted he had rooms above the bar for a gold dollar caudell got use of one of those rooms a promise of breakfast his two dimes back and ten dollars in confederate paper he also got a thin tallow candle hardly more than a taper in a pewter holder to light his way up the stairs the room had only one bed and that none too wide neither man cared caudell set the candle on the window while they undressed then blew it out straw hissed and whispered as he and pleasants lay down next thing he knew it was morning he used the chamber pot splashed water from the nightstand pitcher on his face and hands pleasants who was still in bed looked up at him accusingly you sir snore sorry caudell splashed himself again the water was pleasantly cool and took the edge off the ache behind his eyes if pleasants was similarly afflicted a night spent with a bed companion who snored must have been grim sorry he repeated more sincerely this time a big plate of ham and grits and corn bread and honey further eased their pain pleasants was whistling as he went outside he pointed back to the train station this miserable excuse for a railroad is the wilmington and weldon am i right by his tone he knew perfectly well he was right caudell started to be offended the wilmington and weldon and its continuation up to petersburg had been a confederate lifeline carrying supplies from the blockaderunners at the port up to the army of northern virginiaand sending rifles ammunition and desiccated meals from rivington as well from necessity it had received such care as the south could give then he remembered his one short trip down to manassas junction on a line recently northern by pleasantss standards this was a miserable excuse for a railroad pleasants went on then i suppose i have to i make my way to wilmington to hire on that would behmma hundred miles maybe a hundred ten he seemed to have consulted a map he kept in his head here caudell gave him the change from the night before this will help you get there henry the south needs more men like you than it has pleasants took the money the south needs more men like you too nate he said soberly ill pay you back every cent of this i promise he clapped him on the shoulder dont fret over it caudell said his voice gruff with embarrassment i shall fret over it by what you said youll be in these parts for a while in nashville orwhat was the name of the other towncastalia that was it i expect the postmaster will be able to track you down youll hear from me sir he started for the station caudell went with him not long after pleasants bought his ticket a southbound train chugged into the station more discharged confederate soldiers got off but none from caudells company some stared at the warm goodbye one of their kind gave an obvious yankee but no one said anything about it caudell decided to walk to nashville after all he had only the pair of oneounce gold coins from rivington in his pockets and doubted a stage driver would be able to make change for his passage almost easier he thought to be honestly poor the walk at his own speed instead of to the tap of a drum was pleasant enough tobacco alternated with corn in the fields by the side of the road along with forests of pine and maple squirrels wearing confederate gray chattered in the branches of the trees caudell closed his eyes stopped in the middle of the road he had gone faraway done things dark and terrible things hed never imagined when he set out for raleigh to be a soldier seen the marvelsand behind the marvelsof two nations capitals now he was home and safe the realization soaked into him warm as the sun that beat down on his head he never wanted to leave nash county again he walked on after another mile or so he passed a gang of blacks weeding in a tobacco field they did not notice him their heads were down intent on the work hoes rose and fell rose and fell not quickly but at a steady pace that would finish the job soon enough to keep the overseer contentedthe eternal pace of the silver hed grown used to faster rhythms he also remembered from his dealings with the rivington men and from what hed seen in rivington itself that slaves could be made to work to those rhythms but why bother things got done either way slowing down was part of coming home too and as for slowing down he would have screamed at the castalia invincibles for ambling along as he was doing he did not get to nashville until late afternoon maples and myrtles lined and shaded the road which took the name first street for its short journey through the town though born and raised in castalia caudell had spent most of his adult life here the county seat and the surrounding farms boasted enough children to keep a teacher busy but how small the place looked now that he was seeing it with his traveled eyes a wellthrown stone would fly from one end of nashville to the other not even a hotel what point to one since the railroad had passed the town by old raeford liles ran the post office as part of his general store on the corner of first and washington the post officecaudell remembered a promise he had made he walked in a bell above the door jingled the grocer looked up over the rims of his halfglasses a grin split his whiskery wrinkled face good to have ye back with us nate tell me what the war was like filthy boring hungry terrifying past any nightmare how to explain all that to the eagerly waiting old man to show him the stuff from which his imagined glory was distilled at his first bump against it caudell saw the problem was as impossible as squaring the circle another time mr liles he said gently for now have you any writing paper matter of fact i do the storekeeper answered got in some a few months back and it dont move what youd call quick even got envelopes if you need one he looked over his glasses at caudell again this time slyly you find yourself a sweetheart up in virginny no caudell shook his head at the very idea no matter how many times hed bedded mollie bean comrade friend bed partnerall that certainly but sweetheart if shed been his sweetheart he told himself hed have brought her to nashville he borrowed a pencil to write her a note that said where he was got money to pay or we gonna have to do some kind of swap by his tone raeford liles expected the latter his reading glasses magnified his eyes they got bigger still when caudell took out one of his oneounce gold coins he rang it on the counter bit it weighed it in an apothecarys balance goddam its real he remarked when he was satisfied at last gonna have to dig some to change it itd be hmm close on twenty gold dollars eh call it nineteen and three bits if thats all right with you caudell had already made the calculation square enough mr liles all right dont you go away i got to retreat to the plunder room the grocer shuffled into the back of the store where he remained for some time he emerged at last with a gold eagle and enough silver to make up the other nine dollars and change wouldnt give this for them asswipes the govment calls money but you give me straight goods you get straight goods back thanks caudell shoved two silver halfdimes back toward him ill have a postage stamp too if you please while liles got it he wrote mollie beans name on the envelope sealed the note inside lilies smiled knowingly when he saw the addressee caudell had been sure he would but somehow it annoyed him less than hed expected gentlemen robert e lee bowed as he entered the cabinet room on the second floor of the former us customhouse general lee his fellow southern commissioners both rose from their seats to return the compliment lee was struck by how odd they looked standing side by side vice president stephens was short gaunt gray and soberlooking secretary of state benjamin tall portly darkhaired though a year older than stephens and only four years younger than lee and wearing his usual bland smile a smile that claimed he knew more about matters of state than any other three people living he said join us general our federal counterparts as you see are not yet arrived lee took a seat leaned back against green baize note paper pen and inkwell waited his use but he wished hed thought to ask that a map be brought to the cabinet room a confederate captain commander of the armed guard assigned to the federal peace commissioners strode into the cabinet room the honorable william h seward us secretary of state he announced the honorable edwin m stanton us secretary of war polite neutrality left his voice scorn replaced it major general benjamin f butler the three northern men came in lee benjamin and stephens rose to greet them as they had decided beforehand the confederate commissioners bowed to lincolns emissaries then sat down again thus avoiding the issue of whether or not to shake hands with ben butler one of sewards eyebrows rose slightly as he bowed in return but he made no comment though a new yorker he looked hewn from new england granitemost especially the majestic promontory of his nose which dominated his long thin cleanshaven face stanton was younger shorter stouter with a thick curly beard and a look of driving energy he made lee think more of the highpriced lawyer he had been than the cabinet member he was now ben butler came last the uniform of a union major general still stretched over his short corpulent frame with his mustache curling down over each corner of his lips he reminded lee of nothing so much as a sagging walrus his wattled jowls sagged the sacks under his eyessacks as big and dark as carpetbagssagged onto his cheeks which also sagged themselves the fringe of hair that wreathed his bald crown sagged greasily onto his neck even his eyelids sagged but the eyes they halfconcealed were sharp and dark and full of calculation he was no soldierhed proved that in several fightsbut he was not the buffoon he looked either before the war hed been an even fancier lawyer than stanton the federal commissioners sat down across the mahogany table from their southern hosts after a couple of minutes of chitchat meant to be politebut during which the three confederates managed to avoid speaking directly to butlerseward said gentlemen shall we attempt to repair the unpleasantness that lies between our two governments had you acknowledged from the outset that this land contained two governments sir all the unpleasantness as you call it would have been avoided alexander stephens pointed out like his body his voice was light and thin that may be true but its moot now stanton said lets deal with the situation as we have it shall we otherwise useless recriminations will take up all our time and lead us nowhere it was if i may say so useless recrimination on both sides which led to the breach between north and south you speak sensibly mr stanton lee said stephens and benjamin nodded so did the other two federals down from washington city he went on our chief difficulty will be to keep the bitterness engendered by our second american revolution from poisoning further relations between the two countries which now comprise the territory formerly held by the united states of america butler said we have recognized your confederacys independence general leerecognized it at rifle point i concede but recognized it nonetheless he paused to draw in a wheezy breath further in exchange for your withdrawal only from our capital we have removed our forces from the entire broad reach of territory under our control this past june withdrawing to the line you yourself proposed sir i question the propriety of entering into these further negotiations for any purpose whatsoever judah benjamin turned to lee if i may sir lee raised one finger of his right hand as a sign for the secretary of state to continue benjamin did in the deep rich tones of a trained orator mr butler will surely be aware that in a republic soldiers have not the authority to set down final terms of peace nor did general lee presume to do so he merely arranged a halt to hostilities so that peace might afterwards be established thus we are met here today so we find out how much you rebs can jew out of us you mean butler said coarsely a slow flush mounted to benjamins cheeks lee was outside of his profession a peaceful man but he knew that had anyone touched his own honor so he would have continued the conversation only through seconds but benjamin had risen to prominence despite a lifetime of such abuse his voice was calm as he replied mr butler will please remember that when his halfcivilized ancestors were hunting the wild boar in the forests of saxony mine were the princes of the earth oh bravo mr benjamin stephens said softly edwin stanton coughed and spluttered and looked away from ben butler even sewards craggy features found room for a small smile as for butler his countenance changed not a jot it was as if hed tried to anger benjamin not out of hatred for his race but solely to gain an edge in these talks studying him lee concluded that was exactly why hed done it no not a buffoon he decided a dangerous man the more so for being in complete control of himself shall we continue seward said after a moment perhaps the simplest way would be to set forth the points remaining at issue between us and then to seek to settle them one by one not letting failure over anyone deter us from reaching agreement on such others as lend themselves to it a reasonable plan alexander stephens said where butler had been personally inflammatory the confederate vice president was politically so there is to begin with the matter of maryland edwin stanton jerked as if stuck by a pin his face turned red no by god he shouted pounding the table with his fist maryland belongs to the union and we will fight again sooner than yield it for one thing with it goes washington city we had washington sir judah benjamin interjected stanton ignored him for another despite any troubles we may have had there at the outset of the war the people of maryland stand foursquare behind the united states they shall not willingly submit to your rule lee suspected that was true maryland my maryland notwithstanding the army of northern virginia had received scant aid or comfort from that states inhabitants in either the sharpsburg campaign or the more recent invasion that had led to the capture of washington despite some thousands of slaveowners maryland was in essence a northern state he said let us set maryland aside for the time being merely noting now that its status has been questioned perhaps it may be included in some larger agreement solving the status of all disputed border states very well general i did but raise the question stephens said as secretary seward so wisely stated we should proceed to settle what we can there are for example the thirtyeight northwestern counties of virginia which have been illegally included among the united states under the name west virginia illegally seward raised a tufted eyebrow how can a nation founded on the principle of secession fail to acknowledge the applicability of the principle when employed against it surely you would not be branded hypocrites before the world successful hypocrites seem to bear up under the opprobrium remarkably well benjamin said his habitual smile perhaps a hairsbreadth broader but let us continue to layout the territories whose possession remains at issue or rather the states we have not yet mentioned kentucky or missouri both sets of commissioners leaned forward both nations had strong claims to both states though federal forces were currently in possession of them ben butler said given the pleasant time your armies are having farther south in the valley of the mississippi it will be a long time before you see missouri mr benjamin now he addressed the confederate secretary of state as if completely indifferent to his religion he managed to be unpleasant nonetheless not all the negro regiments the federals had raised while occupying louisiana mississippi arkansas and tennessee had gone north with their white comrades upon the armistice some stayed to carry on the fight lincoln predicted as much lee remembered he said it would take a war to return slavery to those parts bedford forrest bas beaten the niggers at sardis and grenada stephens said he is advancing on grand gulf now i expect he will manage to hit em again as people say his laugh sounded like the wind ruffling dry grass but he did not ruffle butler he may well defeat them in the field orphaned as they be the fat political general admitted what then did you not recently call the territory north of the rapidan mosbys confederacy you shall presently face the prospect of subduing a nigger union down there and may you have the same joy of putting it down as we did with mosby obnoxious as butler was lee began to see why aside from his political connections lincoln had chosen him as a peace commissioner born with an eye toward his own advantage he sought advantage for his country with a like singlemindedness lee said thus far we appear to have more problems than solutions for them shall we continue to set them forth so they all lay on the table at once we may as well seward said though i hope we shant provoke ourselves into a new round of fighting because our difficulties appear insuperable the state of texas borders both the indian territory and new mexico territory alexander stephens said significantly good luck sending another expedition to new mexico stanton replied we can bring men down from colorado faster than you can get them across the west texas desert we showed you that two years ago you are likely to be right there sir lee said stanton he noted made no such claim for the indian territory north of texas the war there had not ended with the armistice for the indian tribes roused to battle by the union and confederacy could not be checked so easily by the great white fathers commands only chaos ruled the territory now are there any other territorial questions at issue between us judah benjamin asked stanton said there had better not be for weve gone from the atlantic to the rio grande wherever we touch we disagree so it would appear the confederate secretary of states smile never wavered that leaves the question of the amount of indemnity owed to us for the destruction us forces wreaked upon our land i would saywhich meant as everyone at the table knew that jefferson davis would saytwo hundred million dollars seems an equitable sum you may say it if you like seward replied i gather that your constitution derived as it is from our own guarantees freedom of speech collecting what you claim is another matter altogether hell will freeze over before you rebs see two hundred million dollars stanton agreed a quarter of that sum would be extravagant we may not have to wait for the devil to get chilblains nor anywhere near so long benjamin said silkily today is september after all in two months you northerners will hold your presidential election would mr lincoln not like to have a treaty of peace to present to the people before november the three federal commissioners looked glumly across the table at him defeat had turned northern politics even more chaotic than they had been in the thenunited states during the fourcornered presidential race of lees seizure of washington had delayed the republican convention in baltimore but when it finally convened it renominated lincoln and hannibal hamlinwhereupon the radical republicans secededboth northern papers and the richmond dispatch used the word with perhaps different flavors of irony attached to itfrom the party and put forward as their candidate john c fremont who as general in missouri had tried to emancipate that states slaves in only to see his order overruled by lincoln they chose senator andrew johnson of tennessee to run with him johnson still stubbornly refused to admit that his state no longer acknowledged the authority of washington dc the democrats were in no better condition meeting in chicago they had just finished choosing governor horatio seymour of new york as their presidential candidate with clement vallandigham of ohio for a running mate and general mcclellan disappointed at failing to gain the nomination was vowing that he like fremont would mount an independent campaign that second split gave lincoln a ray of hope but only a faint one judah benjamin rubbed it in perhaps we should wait to see how your patron fares come november gentlemen a democratic administration might well prove more reasonable any administration with vallandigham in it was likely to be reasonable from a southern point of view he had favored accommodation with the confederacy even when its prospects looked blackest but ben butler said no matter what happens in the election i remind you that abraham lincoln shall remain president of the united states until march proximo a point well taken lee said though reluctant to agree with butler on anything he found a halfyears delay unconscionable the sooner peace comes the better for all north and south alike a man bolder than i would be required to presume to disagree with general lee alexander stephens said let us continue then lee could not tell what went on behind judah benjamins smiling mask but benjamin did not say no secretary of state seward said having set forth the areas where we disagree i think we would be hardpressed to do much more today in any case i should like to telegraph a statement of your position to president lincoln and to receive his instructions before proceeding further may i propose that we adjourn to meet again on wednesday the seventh lee found both stephens and benjamin looking at him it should not have been that way the other two commissioners outranked him by virtue of their places in the civil government but they were looking at him he would not show annoyance in front of the men from the united states that seems satisfactory to me he said adding we shall also have to consult with our president as to our future course simple enough for you stanton said we though are like dogs tethered by a wire leash his voice had a rumble in it that made it sound like a growl lee smiled at the conceit butler said better dogs tethered by a wire leash than a dog running loose from a wire leash as forrest did last june i trust the gentlemen in this room will not permit general butlers opinion to go beyond it lee said quickly butler was no gentleman hed made that plain by his every action during the war and again by his slur aimed at judah p benjamin but nathan bedford forrest by all accounts was no gentleman either if he heard what butler had called him he would not bother with the niceties of a formal challenge he would simply shoot butler downlike a dog the federal commissioners rose bowed their way out when they were gone alexander stephens said if you will forgive me general mr secretary i shall leave the consultation in your no doubt capable hands the president and i while always preserving our respect for each other have not been in agreement often enough of late for us to find it easy to speak together without friction good day to you both i shall see you on wednesday getting out of his chair took a struggle but he managed and walked out of the cabinet room benjamin and lee walked up the flight of stairs to jefferson daviss office ironic is it not the secretary of state said that four years ago benjamin butler did everything in his power to gain davis the democratic nomination for the presidency i wonder where we should all be today had he succeeded somewhere other than here is my guess lee answered admiring the dispassionate way in which benjamin spoke of the man who had insulted him he also wondered if benjamin knew the true origins of the rivington men his own thoughts since the day when andries rhoodie set forth those origins to him had frequently dwelt on the mutability of history before he could find a way to ask that would cover him if the answer was no he and the secretary of state reached the presidents door davis listened to their report then said about as i expected maryland would cost us another war to win and would make the united states our eternal enemy even if we took it likewise virginias departed counties he did not mention the troubles lee had had in what was now west virginia early in the war every confederate general there had come to grief i think we will win the indian territory in the end for whatever it may prove to be worth benjamin said as to what who can say kentucky was worth little when i was born there davis frowned i should like to gain possession of new mexico and arizona and california with it a railroad across the continent will surely come soon and i would have it come on a southern route but again that will prove difficult the federals currently hold the land and we should be hardpressed either to conquer it or given the present unfortunate state of the treasury to buy it from them even if they were willing to sell perhaps we shall be able to make arrangements with the emperor maximilian for a route from texas to the pacific coast of mexico better that a transcontinental railroad should lie entire within our own territory benjamin said not if we have to fight to make a thousandmile stretch of that territory our own lee replied stanton had the right of it earlier today our logistics are poor and we have as yet few repeaters in the transmississippi besides which no war with the united states would remain confined to the western frontier jefferson davis sighed i fear you are probably right sir and even with the repeaters we desperately need to restore ourselves before we contemplate further combat very well if we cannot talk the federals out of new mexico and arizona we shall have to go on without them the same cannot be said of kentucky and missouri the united states will not yield them lee warned lincoln said as much when i was in washington city and his commissioners were not only firm but also vehement on the subject this afternoon i shall not tamely yield them to the north either davis said with them we should be a match for and independent of the united states in all respects without them the balance of power would tilt the other way we should find especially valuable the manufactories which have sprung up in louisville and elsewhere along the ohio i reluctantly infer from the war that we may not remain a nation made up solely of agriculturalists lest in a future conflict the united states overwhelm us with their numbers and their industries we have the rivington men to set against their factories benjamin said but for the rivington men i gather we should have been overwhelmed he does know then lee thought davis said the rivington men are with us but not of us against the day when their purposes and ours might diverge i would have the confederate states capable of proving a match for and independent of them as well as of the north that seems a wise precaution benjamin agreed davis was not really interested in the rivington men at the moment the talks with the united states were his principal concern he pulled the conversation back toward those talks how did the federals take the demand for two hundred million noisily benjamin answered which made the president laugh the secretary of state went on stanton claimed a fourth of that would beextravagant was the word he used which means the united states might pay that fourth or more davis said even fifty million in specie would be more backing than our paper now enjoys and would greatly boost confidence in that papers value which in turn would help bring prices down to a more realistic level gentlemen i rely on you to wring as large a sum from the northern coffers as you may we shall mr president lee said i have perfect faith in your abilitiesand also in those of mr stephens though we are often at odds with each other jefferson davis said almost a mirror image of the words the vice president had used to describe their relationship davis continued now i must needs return to these other matters of state particularly this latest note from the british minister regarding our prospective participation in the naval patrol off the african coast to interdict the slave trade you have seen it mr benjamin yes sir benjamin said i do not care for its tone having recognized us the british ought to use us with the politeness they grant to any other nation our constitution forbids the importation of slaves from africa which should suffice to satisfy them but evidently does not in any case we unlike the united states have not the naval force to permit us to comply with the ashburton treaty a fact of which the minister cannot be unaware but with which he chooses to bait us daviss lip curled in scorn judah benjamin said the nations of europe continue to abhor our policy try as we will to convince them we cannot do otherwise mr mason has written from london that her majestys government might well have been willing to extend us recognition two years ago were it not for the continuation of slavery among us so lord russell assured him at any rate m thouvenel the french foreign minister has expressed similar sentiments to mr slidell in paris slavery lee thought in the end the outside worlds view of the confederate states of america was colored almost exclusively by its response to the souths peculiar institution never mind that the us constitution was a revocable compact between independent states never mind that the north had consistently used its numerical majority to force through congress tariffs that worked only to ruin the south so long as black men were bought and sold all the high ideals of the confederacy would be ignored president davis said the free factory worker in manchester or parisyes in boston as wellis free only to starve as mr hammond of south carolina put it so pungently in the chambers of the us senate a few years ago every society rests upon a mudsill of brute labor from which the edifice of civilization arises we are but more open and honest about the nature of our mudsill than other nations which gladly exploit a workers labor but when he can no longer provide it cast him aside like a used sheet of foolscap nothing but the truth there lee thoughtbut also nothing that would convince anyone who already opposed slavery as did the vast majority of countries and individual men and women outside the confederate states diffidently he said mr president now that we are no longer at war with the united states would it not be possible to fit out a single naval vessel for duty off the african coast the symbolic value of such a gesture would it seems to me far outweigh the cost it would entail daviss eyes flashed lee read et tu brute in them then calculation replaced anger judah benjamin said if that be feasible mr president it would go some way toward accommodating us to the usages of the leading powers and how far did those powers go toward accommodating us before we assured our own independence davis said his voice bitter with remembered slight not a single step as i recall confident in their strength they despised us britain chief among them and now they expect us to forget not likely sir by god in no way do i advise you to forget sir benjamin said i merely concur with general lee in suggesting that we demonstrate acquiescence where we may against a time when we are in a position to be able to give concrete evidence pf our displeasure davis drummed the fingers of his right hand on his desk very well sir enquire of mr mallory at the navy department as to the practicability of doing as general lee suggested then prepare a memorandum detailing for me his response if the thing can be done i shall communicate to the british our willingness to do it there are times i confess when i believe our lives would have been simpler had no negroes ever been imported to these shores but then we should only have required some other mudsill upon which to build our society futile to pretend now that the black man is no part of our confederacy lee said and as he is such a part we shall have to define his place in our nation one reason we fought the late war was to define the black mans place in our nation or rather to preserve our previous definition of his place benjamin said do you now feel that definition to be inadequate preserving it may yet prove more expensive than we can afford lee said thanks to the federals the negroes of parts of virginia the carolina coast tennessee and the mississippi valley have had a year two three to accustom themselves to the idea of being free men and women general forrest maygeneral forrest had betterdefeat their armed bands in the field but can he at the point of a bayonet restore their previous habit of servility for some time none of the three men in president daviss office spoke davis scowled at lees words even benjamins customary smile slipped lee himself felt rather surprised for what hed said took him farther than hed consciously intended to go but a smoldering slave insurrection no doubt aided and abetted from the united states was every southern mans worst nightmare he glanced toward jefferson davis tell me sir if earlier in the war you found us forced to the choice between returning to the united states with all our institutions guaranteed by law and carrying on as an independent nation at the cost of freeing our negroes which would you have done when the delegates of the southern states met in montgomery general we made a nation davis said firmly lee gave him credit for not hesitating to preserve that nation i would at need have taken any steps required up to and including carrying on a guerrilla war in the mountains and valleys of the interior against federals occupying an our settled places any steps required sir any at all lee nodded thoughtfully no one who once met president davis could doubt that when he said a thing he meant it i am relieved it did not come to that mr president he stroked his gray beard i fear i am too old to have taken up the bushwhackers trade as am i but at need i should have learned it davis said where now judah benjamin asked shall forrest continue unchecked with fire and the sword or will you offer the negroes in arms against us an amnesty during which they may peacefully return to our fold as what as free men davis shook his head that would create more troubles than it solves by offering our negroes incentive to rise up against us and once risen to continue their insurrection in the hope of so impressing us by their spirit that we yield them what they seek no let them first see that fire and the sword remain our exclusive province and that they may not hope to stand against us once they grow convinced of that a show of leniency is likelier to produce the results we desire as you think best mr president benjamin replied jefferson davis turned to lee how say you sir i say that the prospect of armed negroes stubbornly resisting so able an officer as general forrest and the performance of the colored regiments which confronted the army of northern virginia trouble me profoundly lee answered that the one group shall be defeated as the other was is hardly open to doubt but if the negro makes a proper soldier can he continue to make a proper slave davis tried to make light of what hed said dont tell me you are turning abolitionist sir that is not a word to use lightly to a southern man mr president lee said biting his lip thinking of general cleburnes memorial that had urged the arming and emancipation of certain black men and also of general hills loathing of the institution of slavery he felt he had to add if i were i should hardly be the only confederate officer to hold such sentiments daviss mouth twisted but after a few seconds he had to nod judah benjamin sighed loudly we left the united states not least in the hope that the negro problem would vex us no further once we were free and independent and yet we have it with us still and now no one to blame for it but ourselvesand the negro of course that gnomic observation effectively ended the meeting x when lee returned to the rented house on franklin street that evening he was in a dark and thoughtful mood the sight of the black serving woman julia who opened the door for him did nothing to ease his mind evenin marse robert she said yo wife and daughters they already eatthey don expec you be so late plenty o chicken n dumplings left over though thank you julia he stepped into the front hall took off his hat hung it on the hat rack then after taking a couple of steps toward the dining room he paused and turned back somethin wrong marse robert julia asked the candle she held highlighted the frown lines on her face she said quickly hope i aint done nothin to displease you he hastened to reassure her no julia not at all but he still did not go in to have supper when he spoke again he was as cautious as he had been while addressing president davis julia have you ever thought you would like to be free the candlelight with its exaggerated shadows played up her shift of expression or rather her shift to the lack of expression slaves used to conceal themselves from their masters reckon everybodyeverybody colored i meanthink about that now and again suh her voice likewise yielded him nothing he persisted what would you do if you were free dont rightly know what i could do marse robert dont have much book learnin much dont have none julia kept studying lee from behind the cautious mask her face wore she must have decided he meant what he said for after a moment she went on wouldnt mind findin out what free was like i tell you that suh i thought as much it was the answer lee would have given were he in julias shoes it was he thought the answer anyone with spirit black or white man or woman would give if you were free would you be willing to stay on here with my family and work for wages thats what i got to do to be free thats what i do julia answered at once lee saw he had made a mistake no no julia you misunderstand i aim to free you and will whether you say yes or no but as you have no other situation i wanted you to know you could continue to find employment in this house god bless you marse robert the candle flame reflected from the tears in julias eyes then as the reality of what hed promised sank in she began to think aloud if i be free soon maybe i learn to read who knows what i do if i be free learning their letters was against the law for blacks in virginia as it was in most of the confederate states lee forbore to mention that for one thing the law was observed less rigidly for free negroes than for slaves for another julias desire to learn bespoke the sort of drive she would need as a freedwoman what he did say was a commonplace i gather my ladies are still in the dining room yes suh marse robert i go tell them you here julia turned and fairly raced toward the back part of the house her shoes clattering against the oak floorboards lee followed more slowly his wife and daughters were chatting around the dining room table when he came in julia had already hurried in and then out past him once more mischief in her voice his youngest daughter mildred said good heavens father what did you tell her that youd sell her south if she didnt move quicker his daughter mary and his wife smiled agnes did not but then agnes seldom smiled normally lee would also have smiled he had trouble imagining the enormity julia would have to commit to make him even imagine selling her south good servants who worked for good masterswhich without false modesty he knew himself to bedid not have to worry about such things but that the joke could be made at all spoke volumes about the institution of slavery now he answered seriously precious life i told her i intended to free her like her daughters mary custis lee stared at him did you she said her voice was sharp and with some reason the money to buy julia had been hers income from the estates currently in such disarray before the war that income had been vastly more than his own moreover in her invalid state she required near constant care why on earth did you decide to do that father mary lee echoed her mother what shall i do without her mary custis lee added lee chose to respond to his daughters question first because my dear i have seen that try as we may we cannot escape the conclusion that the day for slavery is past we fought our great war for independence just completed so that our states could govern themselves as they thought best and we have won it and so brook no interference in our institutions from the north or washington city well enough but the world beyond our borders has not ceased to be nor to despise us despite that independence he mentioned lord russells remark to james mason his eldest daughter bristled if washington has no business meddling in our affairs still less does england that may be so yet when virtually all the world abhors ones practices one has to wonder at the propriety of those practices and the bravery the northern colored troops displayed made me wonder at the justice of continuing to hold their race in bondage but the final straw for me is the struggle the former yankee negro regiments of louisiana and the other states of the mississippi valley continue to wage against general forrest but father so many people think forrest a hero for putting those black men down agnes said let them think so who will but the negroes still under arms in mississippi and louisiana must surely know their cause is doomed general forrest is a most able commander and has behind him the full weight of the confederacy yet the negroes continue to fightas would i in their place to show such spirit they must be men like any others from which it can only follow that enslaving whites were as proper as doing so to blacks no one would uphold that proposition mary lee said this is all very pretty and all very logical robert but who shall care for me if julia is set at liberty mary custis lee said i expect she will but for wages he answered perry has served me so for years his wife sniffed but said if your mind is quite made up it is he said firmly i do not presume to judge others but i find i cannot in good conscience continue to own human beings who i am become convinced are inferior to me by circumstance alone rather than by birth very well mary custis lee surprised him with a smile my father would have approved i suppose he would lee reflected that his fatherinlaw had enjoyed the services of a couple of hundred slaves while alive and emancipated them only in his will when he could make use of them no more it was magnanimity of a sort but to lees mind not enough he also thought of jefferson daviss remark that he would have pursued southern independence even if that meant going into the hills and fighting for years and of his own reply that he was too old to make a bushwhacker plenty of desperate exunion negroes were of a proper age to learn that trade and plenty more blacks who might not themselves fight would quietly support those who did before the war slave revolts in the south had been few and small and soon stamped out those days were gone the confederate states had won one civil war no matter how fiercely forrest fought another was just beginning he laughed at himself he had never imagined taking up arms against the united states of america and now having done so he saw no better way to serve the new country he had helped create than to become an abolitionist talks with the federal commissioners dragged on the smaller issues resolved themselves in exchange for the confederates abandoning claims to new mexico the united states yielded the indian territory judah benjamin had predicted as much after the first meeting lee wondered why what seemed so obvious took so long to decide you will never make a diplomat general lee despite your many accomplishments and virtues benjamin said his constant smile widened slightly to show real amusement had the united states quickly conceded the indian territory to us we should have been emboldened to press harder on the issue of missouri by the same token had we given up new mexico without a struggle the federals might well have perceived that as weakness and so been less inclined to see reason over the indian territory put that way the negotiations reminded lee of a campaign of attrition the sort grant seemed to have had in mind against him in the spring of attrition was not his style whether he faced an enemy in the field or a difficulty in his life he always aimed to overcome it with one bold stroke though it had failed grant attrition worked at least to a point for seward stanton and butler by making it clear that the united states were willing to fight over maryland and west virginia they convinced jefferson davis to yield them lee concurred in that decision having fought in both states hed seen that their people favored the union kentucky and missouri were something else again the united states were willing to fight to keep them but the confederacy was equally willing to fight to acquire them tempers on both sides ran high lee looked for the bold stroke that might cut through the knotty problem at length the idea for such a stroke came to him he set it before president davis davis generally preferred directness himself and after some initial hesitation gave his assent then lee waited for the proper moment to let it loose that moment came in late september after a series of fiery speeches by fremont seemed to put lincoln on the defensive even among republicans all three of the federal commissioners came to a negotiating session looking worn butler who had begun the war as a democrat these days had one foot and a couple of toes of the other in fremonts camp stanton a lincoln loyalist was gloomy to find so hard a road ahead of his patron and seward who had first sought the presidency himself and then tried to dominate lincoln while secretary of state had the appearance of a man who wondered yet again how fate could have allowed that gangling bumpkin to overcome him seeing the men across the table from him in the cabinet room thus distracted lee said my friends i think i have found a way to simply settle our difficulties concerning the disputed states of kentucky and missouri surely you will agree that our two great republics ought to be able to resolve our problems in a spirit that accords with the principles we both espouse which principles are those stanton asked the ones which proclaim that one man ought to be able to buy and sell another we do not espouse such principles general lee lee did not show the frown he felt that he privately agreed with stanton only made more difficult the public position he was required to maintain he answered the principle that government is based upon the consent of the governed and so ben butlers voice was filled with a lawyers professional scorn i presume the negroes of your dominions have consented to your domination of them they have the same franchise among us as in most of the northern states judah p benjamin replied he gave lee a courteous nod pray continue sir thank you mr secretary lee looked across the table at the commissioners from the united states gentlemen here is what i propose let the citizens of the two states in question decide the matter for themselves in a fair vote not to be influenced by force or the presence of troops of either the united or confederate states president davis will pledge the confederate states to abide by the result of such an election it is his sincere hope that president lincoln will also concur with what is after all the most equitable solution possible to the dilemma confronting us equitable william h seward accomplished more with a slightly raised eyebrow than butler had with ostentatious scorn how do you presume to speak of equity sir when you call for the withdrawal only of federal forces and of none of your own how do you presume to speak of equity when by holding down these states through force of arms you prevent them from exercising their sovereign rights lee returned ben butler sniffed just another of the worthless schemes you confederates keep inventing and advancing no sir judah benjamin said my predecessor as secretary of state mr r m t hunter set forth a similar proposal in letters of february to messrs mason and slidell in london and paris respectively we have been willingindeed eagerto put our faith in the will of the people most directly affected by the choice involved the united states continually proclaim their adherence to democracy have they less affection for it when it might bring a result contrary to their desires certainly we do stanton said so do you or youd not have bolted the union when the last election went against you that shot had some truth to it vice president stephens showed as much by ignoring it in his reply gentlemen of the united states in simple justices name we request that you transmit to president lincoln the proposal general lee advanced and at your earliest convenience return to us his response as you are aware he has empowered us to act as his plenipotentiaries in this matter seward said lee sensed that the federal secretary of state was unwilling to do as stephens had asked throughout the war lincoln had despite his determination to return the south to the united states occasionally shown flexibility as to how that return might come about he had also continued to believe against all evidence that considerable prounion sentiment remained in the seceded states if he also exaggerated the two border states affection for rule from washington lees was a notion to which he might be inclined to listen lee had counted on that when he put it forward prodding he said surely you gentlemen cannot fear your president would overrule you that earned him a glare from stanton a basilisklike gaze from butler and sewards usual imperturbability seward said since this appears to be a condition upon which you insist we shall do as you require he got to his feet accordingly there seems little point in continuing todays discussions would you be so kind as to prepare your formulation in writing in order to eliminate the risk of misapprehension on our part of what you have in mind lee drew from an inside coat pocket a folded sheet of paper which he presented to seward i have taken the liberty of doing so in advance of your gracious acceptance eryes of course seeming faintly nonplused seward skimmed the paper to make sure it was what lee had said it was then nodded and leaned sideways to store it in the carpetbag that sat to the left of his chair as he did so alexander stephens put in general lee is too courteous a gentleman to ask you to consider whether you find this proposition of his preferable to the prospect of renewed conflict against repeating rifles but i would have you remember that possibility and the from your perspective unfortunate results of the last such series of meetings those results are seldom far from our thoughts i assure you seward said icily stanton ground his teeth the sound was quite audible lee had heard of such a thing but never before actually heard the thing itself yet another surprise if but a tiny one in a year filled with marvels but ben butler said if you southerners were so hot to return to the fray mr vice president you would have dispensed with these polite conversations and fired your terms at us from the barrel of a gun as you choose to do otherwise i will thank you to follow the example of your courteous general and refrain from such threats henceforward butler was so distinctly homely as to be a caricaturists dream so in an utterly different way was his master abraham lincoln lee found him thoroughly repulsive to say he was corrupt weakened the word though somehow hed kept anyone from proving he had sticky palms he made a laughable soldier but in a battle of wits he was far from unarmed and he visibly heartened his fellow commissioners as they took their leave of benjamin stephens and lee now we wait lee said having waited for the precise instant so often in the field having waited for the right day on which to present his proposal he remained prepared once more to quench his iron will in the tempering bath of patience judah benjamin said with the federals all factions lincoln may find himself too distracted to give us a sensible reply any time soon last i heard mcclellan was calling for an invasion of the canadas presumably to acquire for the united states territory to recompense them for that which they lost on our achieving independence the invasion might well succeed too with any general save mcclellan at its head stephens said the three confederate commissioners laughed none too kindly benjamin said better than any soldier since quintus fabius maximus he deserves the title cunctator but fabius delaying tactics served his own state while those of mcclellan aided only us lee was by nature charitable here his charity stretched no farther than silence for benjamin spoke manifest truth a vigorously conducted campaign up the peninsula might well have resulted in the fall of richmond two years before the rivington men arrived with their aks for that matter a vigorously conducted union assault at sharpsburg later in almost surely would have destroyed the army of northern virginia but in matters military the words vigorous and mcclellan did not belong in the same sentence curious how hes still a hero to so many northern soldiers stephens remarked well why not benjamin said their war failed to give them a true hero we were more fortunate he was looking straight at lee for his part lee looked down at the elaborate floral pattern of the carpet he had always known respect from within the military community and in the late war had done his best to continue to earn that respect he had never anticipated the wider admiration that had come his way admiration which led jefferson davis to urge him to run for president admiration which made a worldly sophisticate like judah p benjamin call him hero without apparent irony he still did not know what to make of such admiration the mention of fabius reminded him of the practice during a roman triumph of having a man stand beside the officer being honored and whisper remember you are mortal the romans had been a solidly practical people he needed no outside reminders of his own mortality the pain in his chest that sometimes came when he exerted himself too strenuously told him all he needed to know the white pills from the rivington men helped keep him in the field but against the years everyone campaigned in vain he rose bade his colleagues farewell went downstairs and out into the street to his relief the constant steambath heat of summer was beginning to ease a colored attendant seeing him emerge dashed away to the nearby stables and soon returned with traveller here you is marse robert thank you lysander lee said the slave grinned widely at having his name recalled he of course had no way to know such recall was but one of the thousand small tricks by which an officer won his men to him it was lee had heard also a politicians trick the thought vaguely disturbed him he did not care to become a politician yet if that became his duty swinging up onto traveller swept away such profitless musing he rode west toward the rented house in which he was living traffic remained busy but without its wartime urgency fewer soldiers fewer rumbling supply wagons crowded the streets ladies had room to stroll without putting their hoop skirts in danger of being crumpled gentlemen had the leisure to stop and admire the ladies and to tip hats to them as they passed lee smiled both at the byplay he watched and at the way of life a confederate victory had preserved something precious would have gone out of the world had the south lost angry shouts the pound of running feet a yell with words to it get the filthy nigger a shabbily dressed black man dashed across franklin from eighth street almost in front of travellers nose the horse snorted and reared lee had hardly begun to fight him back under control when at least a dozen whites many waving clubs came pounding after the negro nothing will anger a professional soldier faster than the sight of a mob raw force turned loose on the world without discipline halt lee shouted tossing his head in a perfect fury of rage two of the white men at the head of the baying pack wore pieces of confederate uniform the abrupt command and the tone in which it was given brought them up short others tumbled into them but at the very front a fellow in the overalls and leather apron of a blacksmith brought down the negro with a flying tackle even he though did not hit the black man with the hammer he carried in his right hand whatingodsnameisgoingonhere lee demanded biting off the words one by one he glared at the men before him now they looked sheepish rather than vicious several like the one who had tackled the negro were smiths others by their clothes day laborers who hadnt labored many days lately but one was a policeman and another lee saw with a touch of disquiet wore the mottled tunic and trousers of the rivington men that fellow set hands on hips and insolently stared back at lee ignoring him for the moment lee asked the policeman you sir were you seeking to quell this unseemly disturbance from the ground the negro answered before the policeman could he werent doin no such thing suh he leadin em on you deserve everything youll get you the white man sitting on the black raised his hammer as if to strike then he met lees eyes the sword lee carried was a purely ceremonial side arm part of his dress uniform one blow from that hammer would have snapped it in two in any case the sword stayed in its sheath but lees presence was a stronger weapon than any sword the smith lowered the hammer as carefully as if it were a fused shell perhaps you will do me the honor of explaining why you have chosen to run wild through the streets of richmond lee said with ironic courtesy the smith flushed but answered readily enough to teach this here nigger a lesson thats why he works so cheap he takes my customers away hows a white man supposed to make a living if he has to work alongside niggers two or three other blacksmiths growled agreement so did the day laborers the policeman and several members of the crowd that was rapidly gathering to watch the proceedings the only black face to be seen was that of the fellow the smith was sitting on let him up lee said impatiently when the smith did lee asked the negro what have you to say for yourself ise a free man suh i done bought myself out jus befo the war start spend all my time since down to the tredegar iron works doin what smifs do since the shootin stop things get right slow there an they don give me nough work to keep busy so i set up fo my own self jus tryin to git along suh thats all i do are you willing to work for less than these men here lee asked the negro smith shrugged don need muchjus tryin to git along like i said he showed a flash of spirit sides ifn i charge as much as they do they call me an uppity nigger say is actin like is as good as they is thats how things be suh lee knew that was how things were he turned to the smiths who had tackled the negro is what this man says true hes done you no harm he aided his countryand yoursall through the war and you seek to take the law into your own hands against him reckon what he says is true enough the white man looked down at his feet so he would not have to face lees wrath but he stubbornly went on who says hes done me no harm hes stealing my livelihood goddam it i got my own family to feed am i supposed to drop down to nigger wages myself to stay even with this black bastard dont seem right nor fair to me when has general lee ever had to worry about whats fair or right for ordinary whites the rivington mans halfbritish halfharsh accent was as out of place on the richmond street as his mottled clothes but he seemed to speak for many in the crowd he has more houses has more land than he knows what to do with not for the likes of him to worry about a kaffniggertaking his work away so where does he get the right to stand up on the mountaintop and tell us we can do nothing about it thats the truth by god someone said so it is somebody else echoed what lee had were more debts and obligations than he knew what to do with nobody here would care to listen to that though or believe it if he heard it the rivington man knew how to swing folk his way and went about it ruthlesslyno one native to richmond would have attacked lee headon as he did lee knew he had to reply at once or lose the authority his position brought him this would be closer to the rough and tumble of the battlefield than to his polite if sometimes savage exchanges with the federal commissioners he said poor men have more to fear when the laws go down than the rich for they are less able to protect themselves without law you had all better shiver when you see a policeman rioting rather than putting down a riot for he may well come after you next or stand aside when someone else does the policeman a great many eyes suddenly upon him did his best to sink into the dirt of franklin street lee continued no one not even the men pursuing him claims this negro broke any law or in fact did anything wrong will they come after you next sir if they dont care for your prices he startled a man in the crowd by pointing at him or you or you he pointed twice more got no reply the rivington man started to say something lee interrupted him glaring at the men in confederate gray your comrades gave their lives and gave them gladly so we could live under laws of our own choosing do you choose now to live without law altogether i should sooner have surrendered to abraham lincoln and lived under washington citys rule than subject myself to no rule at all you make me ashamed to call myself a virginian and a southerner his troops had always feared his displeasure more than any minié ball one of the former soldiers choked out sorry marse robert another simply turned on his heel and walked away which seemed to be a signal for the whole crowd to start dispersing the rivington man still uncowed said i never thought anyone who called himself a virginian and a southerner would take the black mans part over the whites people will hear of this general lee i shall make sure people hear of this was what he meant say what you will sir lee answered being without ambition for any post other than the one i presently hold which was true and more than true no matter what jefferson davis had in mind for himi fear no lies while the truth will only do me credit the rivington man stamped away without replying the soles of his heavy boots left chevroned patterns in the street lee had noticed that before absently he wondered how such gripping soles were made they were plainly superior to smooth leather or wood one more trick from the future he thought he rather wished the future had been content to take care of itself and leave his own time alone wishing did no good he flicked travellers reins and rode on custis lee tossed a copy of the richmond sentinel on his fathers desk whats all this in aid of he asked pointing to a story most of the way down the righthand column of the front page by the way it reads you rode with john brown instead of bringing him to justice let me see my dearboy lee bent close to read the small sometimes smeared type when he was finished he broke out laughing from this alone any man would think me worse than a radical republican wouldnt he but since people know perfectly well that i am no such creature i trust they shall not judge me by this alone i would hope not custis agreed but what gave rise to such acuriosity shall i sayin the first place something must have i suppose besides a reporters malice malice there was but not a reporters lee briefly explained the germ of truth behind the sentinel story i didnt think youd say lincoln would have made the southern confederacy a better president than jeff davis his son remarked it doesnt sound like you somehow he laughed too at the size of his own understatement it doesnt much does it the rivington man who gave the sentinel the story laid things on far too thick for anyone of sense to take the piece seriously but lees laughter soon dried up had the rivington man not been present the affair would have gone unreported as indeed it should have for that matter i wonder if he did not instigate the whole affair he tried his utmost to incite the crowd against the free nigger and against me for taking the poor wretchs part it is not the first disagreement on the subject i have had with the men of america will break custis lee also grew serious his features fleshier than his fathers were well suited to sober consideration he said they are dangerous enemies to have ive watched them ever more closely since you set me the task this past february for one thing they spend gold freely and in a nation as strapped for specie as is ours that alone grants them influence disproportionate to their numbers so i have heard lee said for one thing implies for another what else have you heard as will not surprise you they line up behind those hardest on the negro question custis shook his head try as we will to escape it it remains with us doesnt it father a bill was recently introduced in the house of representatives calling for the reenslavement or expulsion of all free negroes in the confederate states congressman oldham of texas who wrote the bill bought a fine house hereaboutsnot far from yours as a matter of factand paid gold for it and senator walker of alabama who was thought certain to oppose the legislation has been unwontedly quiet about it i had to undertake some little digging to find out why but i managed enlighten me please lee said when custis fell silent it seems custis said raising one eyebrow the rivington men somehow obtained a daguerreotype of senator walker enjoying the ah intimate embraces of a woman not his wife their threat to reproduce the photograph and spread it broadside through montgomery was plenty to gain his silence not what one would call a gentlemanly tactic lee observed no but damned effective custis chuckled it must have been a damned languorous embrace too for them to have held still long enough for the camera to capture them and how could they have failed to notice that camera and the man behind it the rivington men brought us something new in the line of rifles why should they not also have cameras better than ours lee spoke casually but the words seemed to hang in the air after they left his lips the repeaters the desiccated foods the medicines the rivington men brought from were marvels here and now for he and his fellows saw them apart from their proper context but in they had to be ordinary of what else might that be true of almost anything was the only answer that came to lee the thought worried him if the rivington men could pull wonders out from under their hats whenever they needed one how could anybody keep them from doing whatever they wanted he came up with no good answer to the question you see father they can be dangerous custis persisted i never doubted it my dear boy lee wondered if some man in mottled clothing had followed him around with an impossibly small camera hed always had an eye for pretty women and with his wife both ill and no longer young he might well have been thought likely to commit an indiscretion but duty ruled his personal life as sternly as his public one his hypothetical photographic spy would have gone home disappointed what now father custis asked pass on what youve learned about congressman oldham and senator walker to the president lee said that is something he needs to know and you may not have uncovered all of it i shall inform him directly custis promised he reached across the desk set a hand on his fathers arm a little surprised and more than a little touched the elder lee looked into his sons eyes concern in his voice custis said you take thought for yourself as well the rivington men are unkind to those who choose to stand against them they may choose means more direct than this he tapped the copy of the richmond sentinel in any case they are but a handful among us and not worth my worry lee said if i allow them to turn me aside from my own purpose they shall have beaten me custis nodded reassured lee however found himself less easy of mind not more after his bold words the rivington men might be a handful but they were a handful with powers the more dangerous for being so largely unknown he would not walk soft on their account but he would not close his eyes to them either sit down my friends judah benjamin said as the federal peace commissioners came into the cabinet chamber he vice president stephens and general lee waited for lincolns representatives to take chairs before they seated themselves then benjamin went on am i to understand you have at last a reply to our proposal for elections in kentucky and missouri we do william h seward said took you or rather mr lincoln long enough alexander stephens observed acidly your election is less than three weeks away you and mr benjamin both served as us senators seward said you understand that reaching a decision of such importance cannot be hurried leeand no doubt his colleagues with himalso understood the decision whatever it was had been timed to furnish lincoln the greatest possible political advantage no one however was crass enough to say so straight out and what conclusion has your principal reached sir benjamin asked when seward showed no sign of announcing that conclusion without being urged to do so the us secretary of state said regretfully i must inform you that the president declines your suggestion he still maintains the position that the federal union is indivisible and cannot in good conscience acquiesce to any plan which involves its further disruption that is his final word on the subject lee sat very still to keep from showing how disappointed he was he saw war clouds rising over the two states still in dispute he saw trains setting out from rivington trains full of aks and metal cartridges he saw the men of america will break further cementing their influence over the confederate states in battle their aid would be a sine qua non against the richer north i wish mr lincoln would reconsider he said seward shook his head as i told you general i have given you his final word have you any further propositions to set before him when none of the confederate commissioners replied he got to his feet a very good day to you then gentlemen with stanton and butler in his train he swept out of the chamber how can our nation bear another war so soon lee groaned it may not come to that general lee judah benjamins perennial smile grew broader having lost the war lincoln must show as much strength now as he can his final word may seem much less so after the eighth proximo if he wins the election he will no longer need to posture before the voters and so may be more inclined to see reason and if he loses he may consent for fear the democrats will offer us greater concessions come march lee stroked his beard as he considered that after a few seconds he bowed in his seat to the confederate secretary of state were my hat on sir i would take it off to you i see yet again that in matters political i am but a babe in the woods deception is an essential element of the art of war yes but in your sphere it seems not only essential but predominant you manage nicely general despite your disturbing tincture of honesty benjamin assured him the proposition the federals are considering came from you after all honesty is not always a fatal defect in a politician alexander stephens added sometimes it even becomes attractive no doubt by virtue of its novelty the two veterans of the political arena chuckled together benjamin deeply from his comfortable belly stephens with a few thin dry rasps the vice presidents eyes flicked over lee who wondered if stephens knew of jefferson daviss plans for him and if so what he thought stephens might well have wanted the presidency for himself and resented lee as a rival if he did he gave no sign all he said was as no further progress seems likely before the united states hold their elections we may as well recess until those results are known unless one of you gentlemen objects i shall so communicate to the federal commissioners judah benjamin nodded so did lee saying by all means nor will i be sorry to gain a further respite after so long in the field i find being in the bosom of my family exceedingly pleasant indeed if you will be kind enough to excuse me i shall head for my house this very moment again no one objected nate caudell hurried into the nashville general store raeford liles looked up at the tinkle of the doorbell oh mornin nate what can i do for you today you can sell me a hat by god caudell ran his hands through his hair and beard already wet they came away wetter rain drummed on the roof the door the windows i lost my last one up in the wilderness and ive been without ever since what dyou have in mind liles pointed to a row of hats on hooks up near the ceiling a straw maybe or a silk stovepipe to get duded up in no thanks to both of those mr liles all i want is a plain black felt same as the one i lost say that one here if it fits me and you dont want half my next years pay for it they haggled amiably for a while caudell ended up buying the hat for thirteen dollars in banknotes confederate paper had gone up now that the south was no longer at war he knew he could have had the hat for a silver dollar and a little change but like most people he spent specie only when he had to he jammed the hat down low on his head braced himself to brave the rain again dont go yet liles said almost forgoti got a couple of letters for you here he reached under the counter handed caudell two envelopes then he cocked his head and grinned this here mollie bean up in rivington you courtin her pretty gal i bet shes a friend mr liles how many times do i have to tell you caudells cheeks heated his flush must have been visible even in the dim store for raeford liles laughed at him that only made him blush harder to give himself a moment in which to recover he looked at the other envelope it was from henry pleasants down in wilmington caudell grinned when he saw the engineers name pleasants had indeed been snapped up by the wilmington and weldon railroad at a salary a good many times the one caudell made for teaching school he opened the letter quickly read through it sure enough everything was still going well for henry i expect to escape my rented room here before long and buy myself a proper house caudell could not evade a pang of jealousy at that he was living in a rented room on joyner street and had no prospect of escaping it pleasants went on i do wonder that you carolinians ever built a railroad at all or kept it running once built with your dearth of men trained not only in the mechanic arts but also in any sort of skilled labor i have written to several miners in pennsylvania some of whom i knew before the war others who served in my regiment urging them to come hither i hope they take me up on this soon while travel arrangements between usa and csa remain pleasantly informal caudell hoped so too as pleasants said the south needed every sort of skilled workman the engineers last phrase brought him up short proud as he was of belonging to an independent nation he kept encountering implications of that independence which hadnt occurred to him one of these days and probably one day soon he would need a passport if he wanted to visit pennsylvania the last time hed gone into that state his only passport had been a rifle he folded pleasantss letter returned it to its envelope and put that envelope and the one with mollie beans letter in a trouser pocket raeford liles chuckled knowingly you aint gonna read that there one where anybody elses eyes might light on it is you must be from your sweetheart i says oh shut up mr liles caudell said which only made the storekeeper laugh harder giving up caudell went out onto muddy washington street he ran a block to collins street almost fell as he turned right ran two more blocks and turned left onto virginia then right onto joyner the widow bissetts house was the third one on the left barbara bissetts husband jackson had died in camp the winter before now she rented out a room to bring in some money her brother and his family shared the house with her and her boarder so everything was perfectly proper and above reproach but caudell would have had no interest in her even had the two of them been alone there together she was large and plump and inclined to burst into crying fits for any reason or none he would have sympathized if he thought she was mourning her lost jackson but shed been like that before the war too once inside his own upstairs room he took both letters from his pocket the rainwater had blurred henry pleasantss fine round script on the envelope but the paper inside remained dry and pleasantss letter had shielded mollies from the wet her hand was anything but fine and round but this was the fifth or sixth letter shed sent and with each her writing grew more legible he opened the envelope and drew out the single sheet of the letter pleasants had gone on for three pages dear nate he read i hope you is wel sinse i last rote got this hear paper at the notahilton wich sels like it was a ginral stor but rivington is a cawshun al ways as you seen for your ownself i bin out to benny langs hous wich is one of the ones out in the woods like we saw when you was there he dident reckonize me on a count of i was warin a dres in sted of my old youniform caudell clicked his tongue between his teeth and made a sour face mollie didnt say why shed gone out to benny langs place but he could paint his own mental pictures he didnt care for them scowling still he read on the hous is poorlyafter a moment he realized mollie meant purelyremarkabul benny lang he dont us lanterns or even gas lights he has a thing ware you pres a nob on the side of the wal and a light corns on up top i ast him how do you do that and he laffs and tels me eleksity or som thing like that wat ever it may be wat ever it may be it is the best light for night time you cood think of ever in yor born dayes its more remarkabul than the ak if you ask me caudell whistled softly after those repeaters desiccated meals and gold paid dollar for dollar for confederate paper he supposed he shouldnt have been surprised by anything that came from rivington but a fine light that went on here if you pushed a knob there he wondered how electricityif that was what mollie was trying to writecould do that so far as he knew it had no use past the telegraph her letter continued may be on a count of this light making night into day wich sounds like good book tauk and giving him time to read benny lang he has hole cases ful of books may be one of them tauks about eleksity if i get the chans i wil try to find out on a count of it sounds like a thing worth noing yor true frend al ways m bean nc a reliable light by which to read at nightthe notion roused pure seagreen envy in caudell even on a gloomy rainy day like today reading in front of a window was jess than comfortable reading at night with ones head jammed down close to both book and a dim flickering smoky candle brought on eyestrain and headaches in short order though he had scant use for abraham lincoln the stories of how the us president studied law by firelight raised nothing but admiration in him to sit down with a law book in front of a fire night after night after night after a hard days work each day took special dedicationand perhaps special eyes as well he wondered how lincoln could see at all these days he also wondered whether lincoln could possibly be reelected after leading the united states into a losing war with both democrats and republicans split the north was growing more parties than it knew what to do with caudell read newspaper reports of their bickering with detached amusement as if they were accounts of the unsavory doings of an exwifes kin not for the first time he thought the confederacy well free of such chaos where the north had too many parties the south had none the war had been too allconsumingly important to let such organized factions develop he hoped they would not emerge now that peace had taken the strain off his country writing in bad light was no easier than reading but he sat down on his bed to compose replies to pleasants and to mollie bean he knew no better way to spend a saturday afternoon and also knew that if he did not answer now he probably would not get another chance until next saturday he would be at church tomorrow and teaching school from sunup to sundown the rest of the week i hope you are well he wrote to mollie i hope you are happy in rivington with all its wonders in his minds eye he saw her on a bed with benny lang maybe under the sunlike glare of one of the lights shed described he shook his head even imagining anything so shameless embarrassed him and left him wishing he were there instead of the rivington man thinking about the light helped him pull his pen back toward the impersonal if you learn more about eleksity and how it burns in the lamps there let me know if the rivington men will sell it outside their town it sounds better than whale oil or even gas and tell me more about these books you mentioned are they just print on paper like our own or are they filled with colored plates to go along with the words if even the lights in a rivington mans house were something special what would his books be like caudell chose the fanciest thing he could think of and smiled at the power of his own imagination he went on your letters keep getting longer and more interesting i hope to have many more of them and hope that you now and then remember the wide world outside rivington he hesitated then added i also hope to see you again one day your friend always nathaniel n caudell he looked down at that last line wondering whether he ought to strike it out mollie might think he meant only that he wanted to have her again or she might show up on the doorstep of the widow bissetts house either in tarts finery or in her old confederate uniform he wondered which would stir up the greater scandal but in the end he decided to leave the sentence alone it was true and mollie had sense enough not to read too much or too little into it he waited until the ink dried then folded the letter and put it in an envelope he thought about going back to raeford liless store to post that letter and the one to henry pleasants but only for a moment monday would do well enough if the rain had let up by then lightning cracked while it lasted it lit his room with a hot purple glare and turned every shadow black as pitch he blinked afterimages dancing inside his eyes and wondered if the eleksity lights were that bright he hoped not too much light could be as bad as too little thunder boomed overhead he set the letters on top of the chest of drawers by the wall opposite the bed then went back and lay down the rain kept coming another bolt of lightning lit up everything in harsh relief then died thunder growled again childrennot a few grown men and women toowere afraid of it hed had his own anxieties until gettysburg and the wilderness and the ring of forts around washington after a few cannonadings thunder was nothing to worry about he pulled his new hat down over his eyes so the lightning would not bother him anymore inside of five minutes he was snoring boys and a few girls their ages ranging from five up toward full adulthood crowded the benches of the nashville north carolina schoolhouse the building on alston street several blocks south of washington was near the edge of town and hardly deserved to be called a schoolhouse at allschoolshed would have been a better word for it the walls were timber the roof leakedthough the rain was done wet muddy spots remained on the floor as reminders of its recent appearance get away from there rufus caudell shouted at a small boy who was about to jump in one of the wet places rufus sulkily sat back on his bench sighing caudell stood between two of his older students who had a geometry problem chalked on their slates if these two angles are equal the triangles have to be congruent one said are the angles equal caudell asked the youth nodded how do you know because theyrewhats the name for them vertical angles thats what they are thats right caudell said approvingly so you see that before he could point out what the budding euclid was supposed to see a girl gave a piercing shriek bored with sitting on his bench rufus had yanked her braids caudell hurried over he habitually carried a long thin stick hed been using it to point to the figures in the geometry lesson now he whacked rufus on the wrist with it rufus howled he probably made more noise than the girl whose hair hed pulled but it was noise of a sort the students were used to ignoring without breaking stride caudell went back and finished the interrupted lesson then he walked over to three or four nineyearolds you have your spelling words all written down he asked take out your old blue backs and well find out how you did the children opened their websters elementary spellers checked the scrawls on their slates against the right answers write the proper spelling of each word you missed ten times caudell said that would keep the nineyearolds busy while he taught arithmetic to their older brothers and sisters he also thought fleetingly that mollie bean could have done with some more work in the elementary speller from arithmetic he went on to geography and history both of which came from the north carolina reader of calvin h wiley a former state school superintendent had everyone in the state been as heroic and virtuous as wiley made its people out to be north carolina would have been the earthly paradise the discrepancy between text and real world did not bother caudell school books were supposed to inculcate virtue in their readers he went over to his youngest students said let me hear the alphabet again the familiar chant rang out a b c d e f g mr caudell i got to pee rufus interrupted go on outside caudell said sighing again you come back quick now mind or ill give you another taste of the switch rufus left hastily caudell knew the odds of his return were less than even money and by tomorrow morning he would have forgotten all about being told to come back well that was what the switch was for to exercise his memory until it could carry the load for itself for a wonder rufus did return for a bigger wonder he recited the whole alphabet without a miss knowing he wasnt likely to get a bigger surprise that day caudell announced a dinner break some children ate where they sat othersthough not as many as in springwent out to sit on the grass the youths to whom hed taught geometry came up to him while he was eating his sowbelly and hoecakes tell us more about how you all got into washington city mr caudell one of them said the down was beginning to darken on their cheeks and upper lips they wondered what theyd missed by staying home from the war had it gone on another year or two they would have found out having seen the elephant caudell would willingly have traded what he knew for ignorance jesse william it was dark and it was dirty and everybody was firing as fast as he could us and the yankees both he said finally we fought our way through their works and then into the city i tell you pieces of it i dont remember to this day youre just doing things in a fight you dont have time to think about them the two boys stared at him in admiration the smaller children listened too some of them trying not very well to pretend they werent doing any such thing but you werent afraid were you mr caudell jesse asked obviously confident of the answer they made you first sergeant so they mustve known youd never be afraid one of the reasons caudell had been made first sergeant was that the man in that position did much of his companys recordkeeping and so needed to have neat handwriting he wondered what jesse and william would say to that their idea of war did not include such mundane details he answered anybody who isnt scared when people shoot at him well hes a fool if you ask me the youths laughed as if hed said something funny they thought he was being modest he knew he wasnt as with raeford liles he faced a chasm of incomprehension he could not bridge he finished his last hoecake wiped his hands on his pants went out behind a tree himself then walked back into the schoolroom and resumed lessons he sometimes thought that if he ever quit teaching he could join a circus as a juggler with a roomful of children of all different ages he needed to keep busy the ones he wasnt actually instructing at any given moment when the eightyearolds were doing addition in davies primary arithmetic the twelveyearolds were parsing sentences from bullions english grammar meanwhile jesse and william practiced their elocution william putting fire into patrick henrys give me liberty or give me death jesse giving william yanceys tribute to jefferson davis on daviss becoming provisional president at montgomery less than four years before the man and the hour have met william declared loudly some of the younger children clapped caudell dismissed his clutch of scholars about half an hour before sunset to let the ones who did not live in townthe vast majorityfind their way home to their farms before it got dark a few local childrencolonel faribaults sons the daughter of the justice of the peacedid not attend his school because they were off at fancy expensive private academies far more stayed away because they worked in the fields all day long all year long that saddened him many of those children would still be living when the twentieth century rolled around and would have not a letter to their names of course if they came to school instead of working in the fields they might be less likely to be living still in that distant day for small farms needed every hand they could get just to make ends meet after his students were gone he straightened up benches and cleared away trash he shut the door behind him a door whose lock had long since rusted into uselessness little inside was worth stealing anyhow the school boasted neither blackboard globe charts nor much of anything else in the way of equipment caudell looked back over his shoulder as he walked up alston street yup im about it he said to no one in particular he kept on walking the bell jingled as caudell went into the general store today mr liles he demanded are we ever going to find out who won up north a week and a half after the election its results remained in doubt finally though finally raeford liles grinned at him got me a couple copies of thursdays raleigh north carolina evening standard one o the raleigh constitution an even one o the wilmington journal you jus go ahead an take your pickthey all tell what you want to know about time caudell said give me an evening standard then he slapped seven cents down on the counter the storekeeper gave him his paper the headline leaped out at him horatio seymour elected president of united states in slightly smaller letters a subhead proclaimed black republicans repudiated at polls caudell took a deep breath so they turned him out did they looks that way liles agreed cheerfully the more of the story caudell read the more misleading that subhead looked hed already known the election was very tight with most of the results in at last it looked close as a minié ball cracking by ones head lincoln in fact had taken twelve states to seymours ten mcclellan won tiny conservative delaware and his home state of new jersey while fremont prevailed only in radical kansas but seymour won the states that counted among them new york ohio and pennsylvania gave him of his electoral votes while lincoln garnered mcclellan and fremont but out of more than four million votes cast seymour led lincoln by only thirtythree thousand liles had been reading the papers too he remarked cant see how even the damnfool yankees came so close to electing that stinking republican twice wasnt oncet enough for em hed just go an start a war with somebody else i dont know mr liles caudell thought back to that mad morning when hed ended up on the white house lawn like almost all north carolina hed despised lincoln whod won not a single vote in the state in but the man who came out to talk to the army that had defeated his own deserved more respect than the south had given him i dont know caudell repeated there was something about him bosh the storekeeper said positively now this here seymour might could be hell keep the niggers in line much as a yankee can anyways ifn he manages that reckon well get on with him all right hope so i truly do so do i mr liles caudell looked down to the newspaper again accounts of the northern elections took up most of the front page in the lower righthand corner though was a story about nathan bedford forrests continuing war against the remnants of the colored union regiments in the mississippi valley of late theyd been reduced to guerrilla raids rather than standup battles but forrest had bagged a whole band near catahoula louisiana and hanged all thirtyone men caudell showed raeford liles the article were having enough trouble keeping our own niggers in line i seen that story liles took off his glasses polished them on his apron set them back in place you ask me thats just what niggers in arms is askin for an i aint sorry to see em get it an if hitemagain forrest hits em a few more licks like that one there god damn me ifn i wouldnt be right pleased to see him president oncet jefferson davis steps down i hadnt even thought about that caudell said slowly the confederate presidential elections were still almost three years away that seemed like a very long time but really wasnt not when caudell had been thinking only a few weeks before about the onset of the twentieth century after a pause he went on first man id care to see in richmond if he wants the job is general lee he wouldnt be bad either i suppose liles admitted not bad to any man who had served in the army of northern virginia faint praise for robert e lee was not nearly praise enough theres not a man in the confederate states whod be better and thats counting hitemagain forrest too mmmmight could be youre right nate but i do hear tell hes too soft on niggers i dont think so caudell said though hed settled back as best he could into his prewar way of life some of the things hed seen while on active duty refused to go away georgie ballentine running off because the rivington men wouldnt trust him with a rifle the colored troops at bealeton holding their ground under murderous fire until flesh would stand no more this whole business of niggers isnt as simple as it looks bosh raeford liles said only thing wrong with niggers aside from theys lazy is they costs too much i was thinkin maybe id buy me a buck one o these days help around this place some but lord jesus the money it takes now that cottons movin again the cost of prime hands done went through the roofplanters is biddin against each other so as they can harvest the most crops poor storekeeper like me cant stay with em everything is dear these days caudells smile went from sympathetic to wicked that goes for things in this store too you know will you listen to the whippersnapper liles raised aggrieved eyes to heaven do i look like a man doin any moren just scrapin by now that you mention it yes you want to talk about just scraping by you try living on a schoolteachers salary for a while no thank you the storekeeper said at once my pa he learned me to read and write and cipher back before you were born i got nothin against you in particular nate you know that but thats the way it ought to be you ask me im not nearly sure its the states business to go schoolin folks its liable to set all sort o silly ideas loose times are more complicated than they used to be caudell said and more ideas are running around loose than there used to be what with the telegraph and the railroad and the steamship it sort of has to be that way people ought to know enough to be able to deal with them maybe so maybe so raeford liles sighed things were sure enough simpler when i was a boy and thats a fact caudell suspected every generation ever born had said that and also suspected that when he was old and gray he would look back fondly on the days before the confederate states gained their freedom but raeford liless lifetime had seen an uncommon amount of change and the next years would see more and one in four adult white men in north carolina could not read or write not everybody has a father willing to work as hard as yours mr liles we ought to give some of the others a hand the hands in my pocket takin out taxes liles complained then he brightened could be worse i reckon if them damn yankees had won likely theyd try taxin me to school niggers he laughed at the very idea so did nate caudell xi the three federal peace commissioners filed glumly into the confederate cabinet room lee judah benjamin and alexander stephens rose to greet them lee kept his expression sober as he sat to avoid even the appearance of gloating the people of the north have spoken benjamin observed his voice was suave but that served only to plant the barb more deeply oh go to the devil edwin stanton snarled the secretary of war looked tired and drained and sounded bitter i admired president lincolns statement of concession lee said trying still to soften the moment he was wise to urge your country to unite behind the new leaders the citizens chose with malice toward none with charity for all the phrase deserves to live lincoln deserved to win stanton retorted id sooner see horatio seymour making phrases for the ages so he may alexander stephens said come next march he will have his chance i wonder whom he will name as his representatives in these discussions perhaps no one william h seward said the confederate commissioners leaned forward in their chairs as the us secretary of state continued perhaps we shall succeed in resolving all outstanding issues between us before president seymour is inaugurated lincoln could have resolved them at any time up to this point lee said indeed his dilatory approach to these negotiations has upon occasion disappointed me it also cost him twentytwo electoral votes as both kentucky and missouri favored seymour judah benjamin added even if theyd both gone confederate it wouldnt have been enough to turn the election worse luck ben butler said after a quick calculation as may be seward waved a hand to put an end to side issues president lincoln has directed me to inform you gentlemen that he is now willing to abide by the results of elections in the two disputed states upon the model advanced by general lee and suggests as the date for said elections tuesday june he also suggests that we fix ninety million in specie as the amount of composition due the confederate states half of said amount to be paid before march the other half within thirty days after the elections in kentucky and missouri well judah p benjamin said lee glanced over at the confederate secretary of state with considerable respectagain he had guessed which way events would go well benjamin said again as if gathering himself finally he managed something more coherent most constructive gentlemen i hope you will forgive us if we request an adjournment until tomorrow so that we may consult with president davis he wont get more from us stanton said gruffly by his tightly clenched jaw he regretted richmonds getting so much no not from you certainly by stopping there alexander stephens let the federal commissioners worry about just how much horatio seymour might surrender to the south lee broke in as secretary benjamin has said this is a matter that requires the presidents decision shall we meet here again tomorrow at our usual hour the men from the united states left the confederate cabinet room their feet dragged across the carpet to lee they seemed more like beaten men now than when they had first begun these negotiations even their own countrymen had repudiated their policies the confederate commissioners went up to jefferson daviss office this time alexander stephens accompanied his colleagues davis looked up from the papers on his desk something of importance has occurred for you to be here so soon he said when he saw stephens his eyes widened something of importance has occurred for you to be here at all sir something has indeed mr president stephens told of sewards concession ninety million davis plucked at the hair under his chin as he did when thinking hard we have no hope of wringing more from lincoln of that i am sure but from seymour who knows what we might get both border states perhaps without the necessity of military action or the risks of the ballot box i think that highly likely mr president stephens said vallandigham might as well speak our counsel straight into seymours ear judah benjamin nodded davis turned to lee who stood in silence may i hear your opinion general yes mr president lee paused for a moment to marshal his thoughts whether or not we may hope for more from presidentelect seymour than from president lincoln strikes me as moot the united states have accepted a proposal we ourselves advanced how can we honorably impose further conditions upon them now let us have peace sir let us accept the composition they offer let the voters of the two states at issue choose under which flag they would sooner live you feel strongly about this davis said i do sir as the proposal involved was originally mine i feel it touched upon my own honor as well as that of the nation lee took a deep breath if you seek to impose further conditions upon the united states i shall have no choice but to tender my resignation from the army of the confederate states of america almost he hoped jefferson davis would force him to resign when hed left the us army in hed wanted nothing more than to go home and plant corn and he had had enough of war war on a scale beyond any hed imagined in the second american revolution to last him the rest of his life judah benjamin essayed a chuckle you cannot be serious sir try me lee said benjamins habitual smile contracted we could squeeze the federals for more davis said but he was talking to himself rather than to lee having known lee for upwards of thirtyfive years he knew also that lee would keep his promise still to himself the president continued but that would make the next war inevitable a prospect i confess i do not relish he looked to benjamin and alexander stephens does general lees resolve impress you as it does me general lees resolve has always impressed me stephens said let us accept the terms offered then and may almighty god grant that they prove best for our country davis said lee benjamin and stephens spoke together amen i have the honor to inform you that president davis accepts in all its particulars the proposal you put forward yesterday lee said when the us commissioners returned to the confederate cabinet room the next morning in all its particulars edwin stanton stared as simple as that youre not going to try and squeeze more out of us unwittingly he used the same word as had jefferson davis as simple as that lee repeated what he had said to the confederate president the day before let us have peace sir president lincoln predicted you would say as much william seward said to my embarrassment i must confess i disagreed with him sometimes however one is happier to be proved wrong than right i also find myself surprised ben butler said lee believed that butler was not the sort to settle for less than the most he could get the politicianturnedgeneral went on even with acceptance of these terms by both sides certain practical details remain to be settled ah alexander stephens made a small interrogative noise lee tensed in his chair if the practical details butler set forth proved impractical peace between united states and confederate states might yet fall through butler said as the united states shall have to withdraw their troops from the two states contested between us president lincoln requests that confederate forces simultaneously withdraw to a distance of at least twenty miles from the northern borders of tennessee and arkansas so as to ensure that you do not attempt to seize the disputed territory by a coup de main stephens and judah benjamin looked to lee this time it did not bother him as the issue was a military one he said i see no objection so long as the federal withdrawal continues as agreed if it should falter we shall do as seems best to us butler nodded impatiently as if that went without saying to him it probably did he always looked out for his own interest first he went on the president proposes leaving behind one thousand soldiers five hundred in each state to serve to guarantee the fairness of the election and the count he held up a hand to forestall objections he will undertake to furnish in advance a list of their names to whomever you may designate and will accept a like number of southern troops in kentucky and missouri for the same purpose their names to be similarly provided to our designee the three confederate commissioners leaned close to one another murmured among themselves at length alexander stephens said subject to the concurrence of president davis we agree is there more yes one thing butler said he proposes that each side send into the disputed states a single highranking official to serve as election commissioner and to be fully empowered to act for his government in all matters pertaining to the elections such a person obviously must be acceptable to both sides butler smiled displaying for a moment yellowed teeth beneath his mustache i gather therefore that i am not to be considered as the federal representative president lincoln directs me to say he would raise no objections were your government to name general lee to this position me to his annoyance lees voice broke with surprise why me i am no politician to properly oversee an election that may be exactly why stephens sent a suspicious look toward ben butler perhaps mr lincoln has in mind machinations which a man who is moreseasoned shall we sayin politics might easily note and forestall but which because of general lees probity he might fail to detect ben butler threw back his head and laughed raucously if i were the one choosing the election commissioners thats just why id pick someone like lee lee bristled to select someone for the express purpose of taking advantage of his honesty would be a butler trick through and through the fat lawyer continued it is not however president lincolns intention as witness his suggestion for general lees federal counterpart he advances for your consideration the name of general u s grant whose political naïveté will be no secret to you lee knew nothing of general grants politics whether naive or otherwise his only concern for grant had been as a soldier he turned to stephens and benjamin whose expertise lay in matters political he is certainly no radical republican judah benjamin admitted pursing his plump lips he might well be a shrewd choice in fact for seymour when he takes office would be unlikely to replace him as an opponent he struck me as direct and forceful lee said nor do i know of anything in his personal life which might disqualify him actually he had heard grant drank to excess on occasion but that was lincolns worry not his you are then willing to adhere to these conditions for the vote in kentucky and missouri seward said we shall lay them before president davis lee said after a glance at his colleagues he continued adding as our opinion that he should look upon them favorably he looked at benjamin and stephens again they nodded they kept looking back at him too he needed a moment to figure out why when he did he sighed and said if the president is of the opinion that i am the proper man to represent the confederacy in the two disputed states i shall of course undertake that duty oh capital edwin stanton said butler smiled his oleaginous smile seward unbent enough to dip his head in approval butler passed to the confederate negotiators a writtenout draft of lincolns proposal however murky his thoughts his script was flowing and clear lee stephens and benjamin made the bynowfamiliar trip to jefferson daviss office once more the president heard them out read through the paper then turned it sideways as if scrutinizing it from a new angle might reveal some hidden pitfall not seeming to turn one up he asked his commissioners you gentlemen are inclined to agree to these terms we are lee said firmly the vice president and secretary of state echoed him let it be so then davis said he looked down at the paper again set a hand over his eyes his fingers were long and thin and pale the fingers of a violinist or a concert pianist i never dreamt when i first ascended to this position that the road to peace would be so long or require so many sacrifices but i thank god we have successfully traversed that road to its promised end lee also briefly bent his head in a thankful prayer when he raised it again he asked will you also post me to the disputed states as lincoln suggests mr president davis pursed his thin lipsmy only concern there is that lincoln has throughout his administration demonstrated himself to be a politician with few scruples when it comes to reaching his ends our interests in kentucky and missouri might be better served by someone of ah similarly elastic principle if he intended chicanery he would have proposed as his own nominee there someone other than general grant who is not himself a political man lee said nor would he have set the date for the election three months after the end of his own term and finally a bold man indeed would be required to plot deceit when the white house now lies within range of confederate artillery all cogent points especially the last davis admitted i am to infer then that you desire the position yes so long as you believe i can properly fill it lee said the proposal after all was mine i should like to help bring it to fruition the president leaned forward extended his hand to lee on to kentucky then and to missouri kentucky mary custis lees voice betrayed her dismay missouri you need not say them as if they were the ends of the earth my dear mary lee essayed a small joke texas now texas is the end of the earth the joke fell flat with the war over i had hoped you would be able to stay here in richmond with me and with the rest of your family his wife said youd hoped in other words that id be able to carry on my soldiering from behind a desk lee thought but the thought brought no anger with it how could mary be blamed for wishing they might stay together gently he said true the war is over but i still wear my countrys uniform he touched the sleeve of his gray coat you knew that when you married me all those years ago youve always managed very well oh indeed very well she said bitterly where he had touched his coat she set her hand on the arm of the wheeled chair that confined her lee flinched as he would not have under enemy fire mary had not been a cripple during earlier separations the war had cost her what was left of her health he offered what comfort he could i am not going into battle only to oversee peaceful elections and i shall be back in richmond for the summer another half a year gone forever he pulled a dining room chair close sat in it so he could talk without looking down at her for better or worse my dear i am a soldier as you have known these many years the idea is not one to which you must suddenly accustom yourself and i have my duty and shall not turn aside from it not even for those who love you his wife said he bent his head and did not answer it was after all the truth mary lee sighed as you say robert i know i am a soldiers wife sometimes though as in these past few months peace it is pleasant to try to forget dear mary we have no peace only an armistice which may be broken at any time should the united statesor ourselvesfind that advantageous if heaven grant i hope to help forge a true peace a lasting peace were anything less in my mind i assure you that i should not have accepted this posting so you say so you may even believe his wifes voice remained sharp but the anger had gone from her face leaving behind only resignation i am still of the opinion that if jefferson davis commanded you to campaign in hell to fetch a coal to light his cookstove you would make your goodbyes to me as you always do and set off without any thought past the fact that you had been ordered maybe i would lee thought about it he started to laugh likely i would i suppose i trust i would return with that coal though or at least give old nick a fight for it worth his remembering that at last won him a smile from mary im certain you would one of the lamps in the dining room flickered and went out filling the chamber with shadows and the odor of cooling oil mary asked how late has it gotten to be half past ten lee answered after a look at his pocket watch late enough she declared will you assist me upstairs of course let me go up with a light first he rooted through a sideboard drawer until he found a candle which he lit at a lamp that still burned he took it up to their bedroom where he lit two more with it then quickly went downstairs again the house was very still his daughters and julia had already gone to bed the wheels of marys chair rumbled over the floorboards as he pushed her to the stairway leaning some on the banister and more on him she made her way to the second floor he steered her to the bedroom she sat down on the bed while he took out a nightdress held it up for her approval yes that will do she said he helped her out of the confining tightwaisted dress and petticoats she wore during the day from long practice he dealt with her clothes as readily as with his own thank you she told him ill miss your touch when youre gone will you he said at that moment as much by chance as anything else his hand happened to lie on her left breast it was not in the abstract a breast to kindle passions the years and a succession of hungry babes had had their way with it but his wifes flesh remained dear to him their long separations made each return seem like a new honeymoon of itself something in his voice changed shall i blowout the candles she understood him after thirtythree years of marriage she generally understood him if you think you will be able to get that nightdress onto me into the dark she answered i expect i shall he said he got up and blew out two of the three candles then paused thoughtfully took a nightshirt from its drawer and set it on his bed the room plunged into blackness as he blew out the last light afterwards he felt the sharp twinge in his chest that came with exertion he reached over to the nightstand for the bottle of little pills from the rivington men he put one under his tongue the pain faded the bottle did not rattle as he put it back he remembered it had been all but empty as sleep took him he reminded himself to get more nitroglycerine from them before he set out on his travels their arrogance was disagreeable but their abilities helped justify it as the crow flies louisville is about miles from richmond lee was no crow he had to take the railroad which made his journey almost twice as long the virginia and tennessee train squealed and skidded along tracks slick with winter ice as it fought its way down to chattanooga that journey alone was as long as the crows flight to louisville in the bad weather it took three days lee was glad to layover for a couple of days and recover his strength i wish some ingenious southerneror even yankee come to thatwould invent a railroad car in which it was possible to lie down and get some decent sleep he said to charles marshall sitting bolt upright all the way from richmond had left him sorer than he would have been from the same amount of time in the saddle major marshall was younger and sprier but the journey had taken its toll on him too he nodded as vigorously as the crick in his neck would allow we have smoking cars and dining cars and cars with washrooms why not sleeping cars theyd let a man ride the rails as the rails could be ridden rather than his being forced to pause every few hundred miles or perish a white man drove lee and marshall from the railway station to a hotel their locomotive chugged off to the train shed a long stone and brick building with a curious curved roof and a halfstory lengthwise arcade mostly devoted to windows poised atop that two more whites at the hotel manhandled the luggage into the lobby lee watched them with more than a little curiosity in a southern town he would have expected slaves to do the hauling the driver noticed his repeated glances aint many niggers left hereabouts he said most of em went north with the yankees when they pulled out and the ones thats left theyre still actin like they was freeeeemancipated they calls it an they wont work lessn you pay em a lot of folks theyd sooner give cash money to whites you havent tried forcing them back into bondage marshall asked hed accompanied lee because being a lawyer he was the most politically astute of the generals aides a couple men what tried that they ended up dead and their niggers run off to join the bandits in the hills the driver answered morosely makes some folks reckon its more troublen its worth lessn hitemagain forrests got his army in town once a man has been some while free its hard to take that from him again even with an army at ones back lee said the driver gave him an odd look but finally decided to nod from chattanooga the railroad crossed the tennessee river at bridgeport and swung down briefly into alabama at stevenson lee and marshall switched to a nashville and chattanooga railroad train for the trip northwest to the capital of tennessee the farther north and west they got the longer the land had lain under federal handsand the fewer negroes they saw lee wondered how many lurked in the barebranched forests clutching springfields and wondering if this particular train was worth attacking sometimes when the train would stop at a town lee got off and walked about for a few minutes whenever he did men in worn coats of gray or butternut came up to shake his hand or just to stare at him it made him uneasy he wondered how politicians so easily went out to press their constituents flesh then he wondered how if the confederate presidency came his way he would manage himself from nashvilles station and train shedwhich by contrast to chattanoogas were solid and square with crenelated walls and with towers at each cornerhe rode north into kentucky the stars and stripes still flew there not the stainless banner kentuckys own blue flag was also prominently displayed as if to show that the people there thought of their own homes first ahead of both nations competing for their allegiance to lee who had chosen virginia over the united states that was as it should be men in pieces of confederate uniform still came to see him at every stop but so did men who wore blue coats kentuckys sons had fought on both sides in the war more of them in fact for the union than the confederacy the north after all had held the state through almost the whole of the war the federals seemed as curious about him as did their brothers and cousins who had fought for the south you rebs gonna invade us again if we vote to stay in the us of a a fellow wearing corporals stripes on a blue coat asked at bowling green where confederate general albert sidney johnston had made his headquarters back in the days when the war was young lee shook his head he tried to put albert sidney johnston killed at shiloh out of his mind no sir we shall not we intend to abide by the results of that vote whatever it may be so long as it be free and fair reckon you cant say plainern that the excorporal remarked i heard tell you was a devil of a fightin man but i never heard you was a liar at munfordsville another thirty or forty miles up the louisville and nashville railroad two groups of former soldiers one in gray the other wearing blue approached lee at the same time they glared at each other some of them carried pistols on their belts they all wore knives lee was about to turn and go back into his coach in the hope that that would end the confrontation then one of the bluecoats surprised him by starting to laugh tell us all what amuses you sir lee said cordially including himself the veterans in gray and the other exfederals with a broad wave the union man carried himself like a young officer he spoke like one too i just happened to remember our lovely states motto general lee which is lee asked wondering what a motto could have to do with anything then with relish the bluecoat quoted it united we stand divided we fall he waved too encompassing the rival groups at the train station and by extension all the disunited groups in a most disunited state lee laughed loud and long the exconfederates followed his lead as hed thought they might then the men who had fought for the north laughed too after that whatever trouble there might have been evaporated he chatted with both groups until it was time for the train to pullout then as he turned to leave he said see here you are my friendsfraternizing again the men chuckled one of them a lean muscular fellow in ragged butternut said you officers wasnt supposed to know about that oh we did said the former federal whod known about kentuckys motto thus confirming lees impression of him he added sometimes we knew when to look the other way too which drew more chuckles if we fraternized even in the midst of war as we did surely we shall contrive to get along with one another now that peace is here lee said without waiting for an answer he returned to the train as it jerked into motion he looked out the window at the men who had so recently fought each other they went on talking together amiably enough lee took that to be a good omen louisville on the southern bank of the ohio was a big city before the war it had held people to richmonds though becoming a national capital was swelling the latter town these days as lee got down from the train a man jumped in front of him pencil and notebook poised fred darby louisville journal general lee the fellow said rapidly how does it feel sir to enter a town confederate armies never succeeded in reaching i am not here as a conqueror lee said that the united states and confederate states went to war once was disastrous a second conflict would be catastrophic rather than fight again the two nations have agreed the justest course is to let the citizens of kentucky and missouri choose which nation they prefer my role here like general grants is to serve as an arbiter of that process to ensure that it takes place without coercion of any sort what do you think kentucky ought to do with its niggers general darby said that question again lee thought wherever he went it went with him that is for your people to decide he answered negroes may be either slave or free in both the usa and the csa wed have to be a slave state if we voted for the south wouldnt we so the confederate constitution states yes lee admitted reluctantly does that mean the niggers who were freed here during the warand there were a lot of emwould have to go back to being slaves the reporter asked by no means lee said firmly this time again barring legislation from richmondhe thought of congressman oldhamthat would be a matter for your own legislature as i am sure you are awarethough sure of no such thing he was unfailingly politethere are free negroes in every state of the confederacy many thousands of them in some states darby scribbled in his notebook general lee let me also ask you if you please sir not now lee said holding up a hand having just arrived after some days of travel i would prefer not to be interviewed here in the train station i expect to remain in kentucky and missouri until june surely we shall speak again the reporter started to ask his question anyhow lee shook his head charles marshall came up beside him his face stern darby finally seemed to get the message with a halfdisappointed halfangry scowl he hurried away the nerve of the damned yankee marshall grumbled president davis would have no business interrogating you so let alone some brash reporter he is but doing his job major as we do ours lee grinned wryly i will admit to not being sorry he is now doing it somewhere else in the ride to the galt house on the corner of second and main louisville seemed very much a northern city in that the vast majority of the people on the streets were white of the few negroes lee saw several wore the remnants of union uniforms a couple of them turned to stareand to glareat his gray coat and charles marshalls general grant was standing in the hotel lobby when lee came in he walked over to shake lees hand one glance at the map and i knew i would beat you here sir he said the railroad line from washington to louisville is much more direct than that from richmond i would have arrived sooner still if all the line of the baltimore and ohio ran north of the potomac but even so i got in day before yesterday as you say general you enjoyed the shorter route lee hesitated then added i must say sir that i am happier to be meeting you again in this fashion than i was during the late war im a great deal happier to see you like this thats certain grant said puffing smoke from his cigar and ever so much better here than in the melancholy circumstances that surrounded us at washington shall we dine together lieutenant colonel porter my aide is here with me i hope he might join us of course if i may bring major marshall here lee answered he waited for grant to nod then continued perhaps you will give us an hour in which to freshen ourselves if it suits you we shall meet you here athe glanced at a clock on the wall its pendulum swung away the secondshalfpast seven very good sir grant said they shook hands and went their separate ways grants aide horace porter was a toughlooking fellow in his late twenties with dark wavy hair stem eyes set in a forwardthrusting face and a sweeping mustache set above a narrow strip of chin beard pleased to make your acquaintance gentlemen he said when lee and marshall came down from their secondfloor rooms as we are on neutral ground here shall we proceed to the dining room together an admirable suggestion lee said with a smile once seated grant said i have often stayed at the galt house my wife and i both have relatives in and close by louisville in summer the terrapins from the ohio are very fine here but at this time of year wed best stick to beef and potatoes his dinner companions accepted the suggestion when the roast arrived grant cut a piece for himself but sent it back to the kitchen for more thorough cooking i cant abide bloody meat he explained or blood of any sort come to that an odd quirk for a general lee said grant chuckled in selfdeprecation so it is but i expect we all have our crotchets the colored waiter brought back his beef it was black on the outside and gray on the inside it had to be as tough as shoe leather and taste like it too but he ate it with every sign of enjoyment porter drank two glasses of whiskey lee and marshall shared a bottle of wine despite rumors about grants tippling he stuck to coffee once the main course and the plum pudding that followed had been cleared away lee said general if i may make so bold as to enquire how do you view your role and that of your men here grant paused for thought before he answered he had a pokerplayers face one that revealed nothing unintended more that of policeman than soldier i believe to keep either side from doing too much in the way of smuggling rifles to keep this a political fight and not a new outbreak of civil war and to keep the election as honest as may be and you sir lees glass still held a little wine he raised it in salute to grant we shall get on capitally sir i could not have hoped to combine accuracy and succinctness so we would do well to cooperate if we hope to maintain the fragile peace here and especially in missouri porter said his flat pennsylvania accenthis father was a former governor of the statecontrasted with both grants western speech and the soft virginia tones of the confederate officers both states already hold enough rifles and to spare to break out in fresh fighting even were no new weapons smuggled across any borders quite true lee said remembering blue coats and gray at munfordsville having spent so much time at war we soldiers deserve a spell as peacemakers and peacekeepers would you not agree id toast you sir if i had strong drink before me grant said i am pleased to accept the spirit of the toast without the spirits lee said charles marshall raised an eyebrow horace porter snorted and then tried to pretend he hadnt and grant chuckled just as if less than a year earlier the four men hadnt done their best to slaughter one anothers armies it was in fact a most convivial evening a sunbeam stealing through the window woke lee up he left his nightcap on when he got out of bed the fire in the fireplace had died during the night and the room was almost as cold as his rent outside orange court house had been the winter before after a good satisfying stretch he walked over to the sideboard where his uniform hung everything happened at once then a rifle roared the window by which he was standing blew in showering him with splinters of glass a bullet buzzed past his head and smacked into the opposite wall he instinctively ducked though even as he did so he knew the motion was useless he made himself straighten ran the two steps to the window by the sound the rifle had been a springfield whoever was firing would need time to reload time in which he could duck only later did he think two gunmen might have waited outside the outer air was even colder than that in his room he stuck out his head looked up and down the street a man was running away fast as he could go a couple of other people pursued him but only a couplethe hour was too early for many people to be out and about a rifle lay against the front wall of the bakery that lay opposite the galt house on second street charles marshall pounded on the door general lee are you all right yes thank you major lee let his aide in to prove it on his way back to the bed he started to hop no not quite i fear i seem to have cut my foot on some of this glass a maid will have to sweep it up you have some in your beard too marshall said lee ran his fingers through it sure enough glittering shards fell down the front of his nightshirt marshalls voice rose with outrage as the full import of the situation sank in someone tried to kill you sir so it would appear lee said by then the hall outside his door was full of staring chattering people among them a popeyed horace porter he spoke to them i am grateful for your concern my friends but as you see i remain uninjured major would you be so kind as to shut that so i can get properly dressed marshall obeyed although to lees secret annoyance he stayed inside himself who could want to harm you sir he asked as lee buttoned his trousers there are undoubtedly a goodly number of northern men who have little cause to love me lee replied as he pulled on his boots he reflected that some men from the south also failed to look on him with affection but no an assassin from the rivington men would have used an ak at close range not a springfieldand with the automatic fire from an ak would have been far more likely to accomplish what hed set out to do charles marshall put his head out the window he whistled softly at that range you were very lucky sir he paused looked out toward where the rifle lay his tone turned musing or perhaps from the position this murderer took the reflection of the sun against the glass here helped throw off his aim let me see lee also gauged the angle yes it could well be sobut that is also luck of a sort is it not shouts came from the direction in which his assailant had fled he turned his head that way of themselves his eyebrows shot up good heavens major they seem to have caught him quick work there he drew back so his aide could have a look behind his spectacles marshalls eyebrows also rose its a nigger by god he exclaimed is it lee displaced marshall again sure enough the man being dragged along in the middle of the crowd was black he saw lee looking at him started to shout something one of his captors hit him just then so his words were lost lee left the window and went out into the hall which was still crowded with people but not the mad crush it had been a few minutes before general grant caught his eye i hear you were shot at grant said lee nodded grants mouth shaped a thin smile not how id care to be awakened for breakfast as long as youre up though shall we go have some an excellent suggestion lee said liking the way the federal general made no undue fuss about the incidentbut then grant had earned a reputation for coolness under fire breakfast however proved next to impossible lacking grants sangfroid a stream of local dignitariesmayor sheriff lieutenant governor of kentucky along with a couple of others whose names and titles lee failed to catchcame up to him and expostulated over the horror of what had just happened how he should not deem it in any way an expression of how true and honest kentuckians felt about him or the confederacy and on and on the excited locals all but rent their garments lee answered as patiently as he could meanwhile his ham and eggs sat on the plate in front of him untouched and getting colder by the minute the officials ignored grant who drank cup after cup of black coffee sliced up a cucumber dipped the slices into vinegar and ate them one after another methodically until they were all gone it was not the sort of breakfast for which lee would have cared but at least grant got to eat it when what seemed like the sevenhundredth uninvited guest approached the table even lees glacial patience started to slip his hand tightened on the fork he had finally managed to pick up as if he intended to stick it into this importunate fellow instead of his ham but the man proved to have news worth hearing found out why that crazy nigger took a shot at you general ah lees grip on the fork relaxed tell me sir interest also sparked in grants eyes he was yellin an cussin and carryin on about how if you hadnt gone and took washington city the federals wouldve won the war and set all the niggers down south free i suspect there may be some truth in that lee said no doubt general grant will concur no doubt at all grant said promptly and lee remembered first how much the federal commander had wanted to go on fighting and then what the outcome of that fight would have been without the intervention of the rivington men grant continued that does not give that negro or anyone else the right to go shooting at general lee now though for better or worse the war is over what will they do with him lee asked try him and hang him i expect the kentuckian answered with a shrug oh he said one other thing general lee he said you must own a rabbits foot off a rabbit caught in a graveyard at midnight or else he never would have missed you morning sun is a likelier reason than anything from the black of night said lee who had no such charm he explained how the wouldbe assassin had picked a poor spot from which to fire the kentuckian laughed aint that just like a fool nigger he made as if to clap lee on the back for his escape but thought better of it lee was not a man to inspire casual familiarity from strangers leaving his gesture awkwardly halfcompleted the fellow departed lees breakfast was ruined but he ate it anyhow a bad breakfast was far preferable to the prospect of no breakfast at all ever again during the next few months lee traveled all through kentucky and missouri he ran up more miles faster than he ever had on campaign but then but for that one negro no one was shooting at him now grant traveled even farther especially in missouri missouri had no direct train connections with kentucky tennessee or arkansaslee had to travel by coach from columbus kentucky to ironton missouri where the st louis and iron mountain railroad reconnected him with the rail network grant on the other hand could reach st louiswhere he had once livedquickly and easily by way of the ohio and mississippi across indiana and illinois and made several trips there lee was pleased at how well both sides held to their pledges of keeping soldiers out of the disputed states that did not mean no one invaded kentucky and missouri however every politician northern and southern who could stand on a stump and put one word after another or ten thousand after another ten flooded into the two states to tell their people just why they should choose the united states or the confederacy listening to a proconfederate orator thunder abuse at the north at a torchlight rally one night in frankfort charles marshall made a sour face and said anyone can tell he spent the war safely far away from the firing lines had he ever faced the yankees in battle he would own far more respect for their manhood than he currently displays how right you are lee replied as appalled as his aide at the oratory the speaker had just called the northerners coldblooded fatfaced niggerloving moneygrubbers lee went on i confess to a certain amount of embarrassment at representing the same nation as does this eloquent fellow to emphasize his distaste he turned half away from the shouting gesticulating man up on the platform i know what you mean sir but marshall as if drawn by some horrid fascination kept watching the orator red light from the torches flickered off his spectacle lenses even if he wins votes he also sows hatred just so lee said for example have you seen this he took out a pamphlet and handed it to marshall his aide held it close to his face so he could read it in the torchlight what miscegenation is and what you may expect if kentucky votes union he quoted he gave the pamphlet a bemused look the cover isstriking that is one word which may truthfully apply to it lee admitted the pamphlet showed a black man his nose and lips grotesquely exaggerated embracing a white woman and tilting her face up for a kiss we are fortunately not responsible for this document you will note the learned lawyer mr seaman had it printed in new york by the look of the thing the learned mr seaman merely by existing besmirches the legal profession marshall held the pamphlet between thumb and forefinger as if to minimize his contact with it are the contents as lurid as the cover easily lee said and many of our speakers though it did not originate with us distribute it broadside as a warning against what may come should the republicans gain the upper hand again it may perhaps be effective but i find it repugnant the yankees have hardly been kind in what they say about us marshall said can we afford to indulge such scruples lee merely looked at him until he hung his head i am disappointed in you major can we afford not to indulge them regardless of whether we ultimately find ourselves in possession of kentucky and missouri we shall have to live with ourselvesand with the united statesafterwards poisoning the air with lies will not make matters easier you view these matters from a higher plane than i have reached marshall said still sounding ashamed you truly would not mind if the disputed states chose the union over us would you sir i hope they see the confederacys merits as i have lee replied after some thought but i would sooner see them go willingly with those people than unwillingly with us that after all is the principle upon which we formed our nation and for which we fought so long and hard thatnot this he took the pamphlet from charles marshall let it fall and ground it beneath his boot heel major marshall thrust a telegram into lees hands you must see this directly sir thank you major lee unfolded the flimsy paper the words on it leaped out at him march us lieutenant adam slemmer captured two men with a horse train of aks and cartridges this date tompkinsville kentucky please advise richard ingom captain csa election observers lee wadded up the telegram and flung it against the wall those goddamned fools he ground outwho else would be running repeaters but the men from rivington his head tossed like an angry stallions do they think they are lords of the earth to arrogate to themselves the authority for such an action where the devil is tompkinsville major just north of the tennessee border sir southeast of bowling green its not on any railroad line marshall must have expected and prepared for the question for he answered as quickly and certainly as if lee had enquired about the location of richmond we can get to bowling green quickly then well hire horses there and ride for tompkinsville telegraph ahead to captain ingom that we are on our way and on no account to allow rifles or prisoners to proceed until we arrive ill head directly for the telegraph office sir marshall hurried away two days later the two grayclad men reined in their blowing horses in front of tompkinsvilles only hotel lee felt his years as he dismounted he hadnt ridden so hard for so long since his indianfighting days in the west he was not surprised to see general grant leaning against one of the columns of the hotels false front touching the brim of his hat to grant he said the stableman at bowling green told me youd got there before us sir i wish i could have done as well at bealeton sir grant replied by the sound of his voice he would be mentally refighting his battles against lee the rest of his life he went on ive not been here long myselfno more than a couple of hours then you will already have spoken to your lieutenant slemmer so i have seems he and his companion lieutenant james porter were riding a bit south of here when they came upon two men leading several heavily loaded horses becoming suspicious they got the drop on the men and forced them to reveal what the loads were your pestiferous repeaters and ammunition for same they brought the men and horses here to tompkinsville where your captain ingom who happened to be in town was fully acquainted with the situation generous of you lee said had ingom not seen the northern men bringing in their prisoners he suspected he would never have heard of the incident but that was what the observers were for to make sure both sides played by the rules to which theyd agreedrules that frowned on gun running lee asked have you yet questioned these men no sir when captain ingom told me he had notified you and you were on your way i decided to wait until you got here the men and horses are under guard at the livery stable down the street will you join me lee inclined his head by all means and let me express my thanks for your scrupulous observance of the proprieties obtaining in this matter anything else would only cause more trouble i thought grant said in the stable a federal lieutenant held an army colt revolver on two men sitting glumly in the hay sure enough they both wore the mottled caps coats and trousers of the rivington men on your feet you the lieutenant barked his captives made no move to obey until they saw lee and grant then they stood slowly as if to show they would have done the same thing without being ordered one of them swept off his plain ugly cap in a gesture that made it seem a cavaliers plumed chapeau general lee he said bowing allow me to present my comrade willem van pelt mr de buys that smooth bow so like jeb stuarts brought the rivington mans name back to lee you know this fellow grants voice was suddenly hard and suspicious to my mortification i do ignoring the proffered introduction lee growled what the devil are you doing here mr de buys konrad de buyss eyes were wide and innocent a catamounts eyes were innocent too just before it sprang lee wondered how the northern soldiers had got the drop on a warrior of his quality the rivington man said we were just coming up to sell a few guns general sporting guns you might say is anything wrong with that is anything wrong with pouring oil on a fire lee retorted de buys still looked innocent his comrade willem van pelt was big and stolid and seemed stupid lee would have bet that was as much a façade as de buyss innocence to whom were you going to sell these rifles grant asked oh there are always buyers de buys said airily no doubt lee said he could picture the sort of men de buys had in mindraiders to sweep down on little towns before the election or on the day and to make sure the folk there voted the right way he turned to grant will you step outside with me for a moment sir they stayed outside longer than a moment when they returned lee said mr de buys general grant here has graciously agreed to buy every one of your repeaters and their accompanying cartridges that got through the fronts both rivington men held up as shields against the world willem van pelt spoke for the first time no way well sell to his bloody sort oh but gentlemen he will give you a finer price than you could hope to receive from anyone else lee said grant nodded thats right he reached into a trouser pocket took out a silver dollar and tossed it at konrad de buyss feet there you go for the lot of em an angry flush mounted de buyss cheeks be damned to your dollar and to you too youd best take it grant told him with it you and your friend there can ride back to tennessee without it you go north under guard for more questionsa lot more willem van pelt worked his jaw and tensed as if to make some sort of move the federal lieutenant an alert young man swung his revolver toward the rivington man easy willem konrad de buys said setting a hand on van pelts arm he swung his hunting cats gaze toward lee so youd sooner work with the yankees than with us eh general well remember that i promise you the united states have business in kentucky and missouri till june and have handsomely kept their agreements with us you sir do not belong here not if you are running guns now get your horses and go and count yourselves lucky to have that opportunity lee turned to grant perhaps your lieutenants will ride with them a ways to ensure that they do cross the border then to de buys in tones of palpable warning you personally and your colleagues shall be held responsible for the safety of the two federals grant chuckled it seems you neednt fret over that general not when my lads captured these fellows in the first place they never would have if they hadnt come on us when i was in the bushes with my pants around my ankles konrad de buys growled grants chuckle turned into a laugh lee laughed too but was inclined to believe the rivington man with or without their marvelous repeaters his kind were uncommonly dangerous and de buys himself more so than most remember what i told you lee said sternly and was relieved to see both rivington men give grudging nods they and the federals rode south from tompkinsville that afternoon grant stayed in town to await the lieutenants return so he and they could start the repeaters on their journey northwards lee and marshall set off for bowling green as they rode out of tompkinsville marshall said are you sure it is expedient sir just to give some dozens of repeaters to the yankees like that did i believe they had none major i assure you i should never have done so lee answered but they surely possess samples aplenty whether seized from prisoners or taken from beside corpses as our men used to take springfields to replace the smoothbore muskets theyd been issued and by ceding the guns i kept the rivington men out of northern hands as they know about a good many things besides aks i count them as more important than the rifles ah put that way i see your point marshall ran a hand through his wavy blond hair they do sometimes seem all but omniscient dont they yes lee said shortly that was what worried him about the men of america will break after a moment he added omniscient they are not however for i can think of one thing they surely do not know whats that sir marshall sounded genuinely curious not to meddle in our politics lee booted his hired horse into a trot marshall matched him to keep up they rode some time in silence people argued even as they filed into the louisville park it was good friday under other circumstances many of them would have been in church but church would be there easter sunday and the sunday after that and the year after that they might never hear a presidentor rather a recent expresidentof the united states again us flags flew at all four comers of the speakers platform they still displayed thirtysix stars though eleven states had left the union for good and two more were wavering some of the people in the crowd waved the old banner too but others carried one of the several versions of the confederate flag already the rival factionalists were beginning to push and shove each other charles marshalls spectacles lent him a supercilious air as he stood at the edge of the swelling throng perhaps that was no accident for his voice held a definite sniff considering where he took his country lincoln has considerable nerve to show his face in kentucky and urge it to follow his lead lincoln has considerable nerve lee said and this is after all his birth state but i question his political wisdom in coming hereseymour and mcclellan both outpolled him in this state seymour by an enormous margin so how can he hope to sway any substantial number of voters a year before he would never have thought to make such political calculations his life had been simpler then his only problem the straightforward one of beating back the army of the potomac when it began to move with all his soul he longed for those simpler days but he knew it would take another war to bring them back and that was too high a price to pay marshall started to say something but his words were lost in the peculiar roar half cheer and half hiss that went up from the crowd it reminded lee of a locomotive with a bad boiler the man who produced that frightening mixture of hate and adulation stood on the platform unmistakably tall and unmistakably lean and waited for the tumult to ebb at last it did americans lincoln said and with a single word drew all attention to himself for no one whether staunch union man or backer of the confederacy denied himself that proud title lincoln used it again americans surely you know i should rather have given up an my lifes blood sooner than see my beloved nation tom in two we can fix that for you by god a heckler yelled and a savage chorus of jeers arose lincoln spoke through them both sides in the late conflict spoke the same tongue prayed to the same god that he chose to grant victory to the south is a fact i can but strive to accept understand it though i do not for the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether i bear no animus against the men i still believe my brethren nor have i ever it dont work both ways the leatherlunged heckler shouted lee thought the fellow wrong though during the simpler days of the war he would have agreed with him lincoln truly saw one nation rather than a federation of sovereign states and acted on that belief misguided and mistaken though lee believed he was now he continued you have rejected me as well you might have seeing how i failed to preserve the union i swore to protect and defend but i am only one small man do with me as you see fit it will be no less than i deserve but i pray you men of kentucky with an my heart and an my soul and all my minddo not reject the united states of america more catcalls rang out along with scattered cheers lincoln ignored both lee had the odd feeling that he was talking to himself up there on the platform talking to himself yet at the same time desperately hoping others would hear important principles mayand mustbe inflexible we all declare for liberty but we do not always mean the same thing by it in the united states liberty means each man may do as he pleases with himself and his labor in the south the same word means some would do as they please with other men and that which they produce to the fox stealing chickens from the farmer looks like liberty but do you think the fowl agree just like honest backwoods abe to talk about foxes and hencoops charles marshall said a sneer in his voice lee started to nod but thought better of it yes the image was not one he could imagine hearing from jefferson daviss lips but it illuminated the point lincoln had made just before more vividly than might many a polished phrase and that point was far from a bad one lee had the uncomfortable feeling of being more in sympathy with his countrys foes than with such friends as the men of america will break lincoln said men of kentucky men of america if you vote to go south you vote to forget washington and patrick henry jefferson and nathan hale jackson and john paul jones remember the nation your fathers joined remember the nation so many of you fought so bravely to defend god bless the united states of america some cheered more lee thought booed he found no small irony in the fact that three of lincolns american heroes washington patrick henry and jefferson had been slaveholding virginians martha washingtons blood ran in the veins of his own wife and the south revered the founding fathers no less than the north he remembered coming into richmond on washingtons birthday and finding the war department closed and for that matter washington on horseback appeared on the great seal of the confederate states this time he had no sympathy for lincolns claims the former us president descended from the platform here and there instead of dispersing men held their ground and argued with one another standing nose to nose while they shouted and waved their arms but no riot followed lincolns speech given the volatility of louisvilleof all kentucky and missouri toolee knew only relief over that marshall in his wake he strode through the thinning crowd toward lincoln he was a tall man himself and lincoln especially after resuming the stovepipe hat he had shed while speaking possibly the tallest man in the park the expresident was easy to keep in sight lincoln soon spotted lee he waited for him to come up mr president lee said inclining his head not anymore lincoln said and we both know whose fault that is dont we the rivington mens lee thought without them from what theyd said lincoln would still be president and president of a nation intent on taking vengeance on the unsuccessfully seceded southern states yet he did not sound bitter he seemed wryly amused as if talking of the worlds vagaries with a friend try as he would lee could not see in this elongated homely man the ogre andries rhoodie had described but all that was by the way lincoln dwelt in the white house no more and the nightmare future would not come to pass lee asked what do you plan to do now sir till the election i aim to go through kentucky and missouri like satan going up and down in the world and do everything i can to hold em in the union lincoln said and poked more fun at himself by adding not that some of the people in both states dont already figure me for the devil i expect after that his voice trailed away after that i suppose ill go home to springfield practice law and get old when i was younger i never thought id escape obscurity so going back to it should be easy enough maybe one day when all this fuss has died down ill write a book about how everything would have turned out for the best if it hadnt been for bobbie lee you will i hope forgive me sir for holding the opinion that these matters have turned out for the best lee said you dont need my forgiveness general though youre polite to ask for it even under your southern constitution every man may hold what opinions he likes eh candide believed to the end that this was the best of all possible worlds lincoln let out a wry laugh what does what i think matter anyhow im going back into the shadows but you general your future stretches out ahead lit with torches and paved with gold hardly that sir lee said no where else for the noblest virginian of them all but at the head ofof his country lincolns mouth twisted even now going on a year after the south had won its independence acknowledging the confederacy pained him lee also wondered whether he meant the crib from shakespeare as compliment or sarcasm he answered i am proud to serve my state and my nation in whatever capacity they choose for me lincoln looked down at him as always he found that disconcerting he was used to holding the high ground in conversation serving a country is all very well general but when the time comes will you be able to lead it in the direction you know it must go he did not wait for a reply but touched a finger to the brim of his hat and departed charles marshall stared after him how could the north have been so misguided as to elect that man its president he mimed a couple of steps worth of lincolns loosejointed gait he is peculiarlooking to himself i understand not least but he knows the proper questions to ask lee also watched lincoln until he disappeared behind some willows with their full skirts of new spring leaves the proper question indeed if he said slavery might possibly have to end one day who in the south would listen to him sorry to disturb your supper general lee sir a messenger boy said dumping a tall pile of telegrams onto lees table in the galt house dining room its all right son lee raised an eyebrow in humorous resignation already telegrams leaned in drunken profusion against a platter of stuffed duck against a bowl of peas a gravy boat wineglasses already they covered the bread and hid the relish trays from sight lee went on its plain ill be reading more than eating for yet another night the messenger boy probably did not hear that last sentence he was hurrying back to the telegraph office for a new load of messages general grant said when youre done with those sir if youd be kind enough to pass them my way certainly lee went through the sheaf one by one occasionally pausing to cut another bite from the slice of saddle of mutton in front of him behind him a small colored boy with a large peacock fan stirred the still muggy air that went with june evenings in louisville not too hard there lee warned him as the papers on the table shifted you dont want to blow them into the soup now do you the little slave giggled and shook his head lee finished the pile no great irregularities here he told grant the federal general was also going through a stack nor in mine it seems he reached bottom just after lee did shall we exchange prisoners in return for the reports the federal election inspectors had sent to grant lee gave him the latest set of messages he himself had received from the confederate inspectors as grant said the vote had on the whole proceeded smoothly some precincts from the south and west of missouri had yet to report lee suspected no one in those parts had voted regardless of armistices regardless of federal occupation troops the civil war there went on but the area was thinly populated anyhow even had all its votes gone for the confederacy the state as a whole would have remained in the union kentucky was another matter grant acknowledged as much when he said in the coming week general lee i shall shift my headquarters to st louis so as to maintain them within the territory of the united states you may even find it more congenial than louisville from your previous acquaintance with the city lee said i doubt it grants face never gave away much but his voice turned bleak i was out of the armyon the beach you might saywhile i was there so my memories are not entirely happy ones and as you may understand sir i cannot rejoice at kentuckys having voted itself out of the union to which i owe everything i have in this world i respect the sincerity of your sentiments no furtheri admire it i hope you will understand that the people of kentucky are equally sincere in theirs by close to four to three kentuckys voters had chosen to cast their lot with the south grant said i recognize it but i own to having a great deal of difficulty admiring it to speak frankly i believe the southern cause one of the worst for which people ever took up arms and one for which there was not the least excuse that you fought so long and valiantly for such a patently bad cause has always been a wonder to me we in turn were perpetually amazed at the united states determination to expend so much in treasure and lives to try to restore by force the allegiance the people of the south were no longer willing to give voluntarily thats over now it appears for better or for worse if you visit me in st louis under flag of truce general be sure i shall gladly receive you grant rose now i hope you will excuse me i find i havent the stomach for supper not when i am forced to watch yet another state wrenched away from the union lee also stood shook hands with grant he said kentucky was not wrenched it went of its own free will small consolation grant said and left the table instead of going upstairs to his room he walked over to the bar and began to drink though he had stayed sober until the day of the election he was still on his bar stool when lee went upstairs and still on it drunk asleep when lee came down for breakfast the next morning shall i wake him charles marshall asked eyeing grants slumped form with distaste let him be major lee said marshall gave him a curious look he almost added there but for the grace of god go i but at the last moment kept silent not for the first time he wondered how his life would have gone after a surrender at richmond not well he suspected who would care about the high general of the losing side george mcclellan should have considered that before he ran his bootless race for president lee thought but then mcclellans timing was generally bad his own humor quite re stored by that snide thought lee sat down to wait for a breakfast menu xii the summer sun beat down on nashvilles main square the maples that grew along washington and alston streets gave some shade but could do nothing to cut the heat or the oppressive humidity when a buggy rattled west down washington it kicked up so much dust that it reminded nate caudell of his marching days in the army but despite the beastly weather a goodsized crowd had assembled in front of the nash county courthouse whats going on caudell asked a man who looked about to melt in frock coat vest cravat and stovepipe the nigger auction starts at noon the fellow answered is that today caudell who could no more afford a slave than he could a private railroad coach and a locomotive to haul it skirted the edges of the gathering and started into raeford liless general store the front door was locked caudell scratched his headbut for sunday liles never closed the place then he saw the storekeeper among the men waiting for the auction to start liles was serious about wanting a servant then caudell recognized several other potential buyers among them george lewis his former captain had been elected to the state legislature and lately spent more time down in raleigh than in nash county lewis saw caudell too and waved to him caudell waved back he had to check himself from coming to attention and saluting but the crowd held a good many strangers too caudell heard the soft accents of alabama and mississippi while a couple of men spoke with a texas twang he remembered from the army his ears also caught another accent one that made his head whip around sure enough there stood three rivington men talking among themselves despite the coming of peace they still preferred the splotched muddylooking clothes theyd worn in camp and into battle they looked more comfortable in them than most of the southern gentlemen did in their more formal attire the courthouse clock struck twelve men with watches took them out to check them against the clock a minute or so later the bells of the baptist church announced the coming of noon after another brief delay the bells of the methodist church which was farther down alston street also declared the hour caudell wondered which clock was right and whether anyone of them was it didnt really matter not to him who but a railroad man like henry pleasants needed to know the time exact to the minute despite its announced starting time the slave auction showed no sign of getting under way by the way they chatted and smoked and dipped snuff few of the wouldbe buyers had expected that it would but the rivington men began to fidget one of them pointedly looked at his wristcaudell saw he wore a tiny watch there held on with a leather strap a few minutes later the rivington man looked at his wristwatch again when nothing happened after a third such irritated glance the man shouted what the bleeding hell are we waiting for his impatience set off the crowd like a percussion cap igniting the charge of a springfield cartridge in an instant a dozen men were yelling for things to get moving if hed kept quiet they likely would have stood around another hour without complaining a man in a suit of exaggeratedly dandyish cut hurried out of the courthouse and sprang up onto the platform that had been hastily built in front of it pausing only to spit tobacco juice into the dust he said well commence shortly gentlemen i promise and when you see the fine niggers josiah a beard has to sellhe preened slightly to show one and all he was the josiah a beard in questionyoull be glad you waited i promise you will his broad beaming face radiated candor caudell distrusted him on sight he kept up a bright stream of talk for another few minutes the rivington men quickly started looking impatient again before they started a new round of shouts though a black man came out of the courthouse and up to stand beside josiah beard the auctioneer said here we are gentlemen the first on the list a fine field hand and laborer a negro named columbus aged thirtytwo years lets see him one of the texas men called beard turned to columbus strip off he said curtly the black man pulled his coarse cotton shirt over his head stepped out of his trousers turn around the auctioneer told him columbus obeyed beard raised his voice spoke to the audience now you see him not a mark on his back as youll note for yourselves hes tractable as well as willing hes a genuine cotton nigger by god look at his toes at his fingers look at those legs if you have got the right soil buy him and put your trust in providence my friends hes as good for ten bales as i am for a julep at eleven oclock so what am i bid for this fine buck nigger the bidding started at five hundred dollars and rose rapidly the texas man whod asked to see all of columbus ended up buying him for even with prices still high that was a goodly sum but he seemed unperturbed i could sell him in houston tomorrow and make four hundred back he declared to anyone who cared to listen niggers is still mighty dear anywheres in the transmississippi another black mounted to the stand second on the list beard said an excellent field hand and laborer gentlemen named dock a negro aged twentysix years without waiting for a customers request he added strip off dock yassuh docks negro patois was thick as molasses he shed his shirt and trousers turned before he was told to do so his back like columbuss had never known the lash but an ugly scar seamed the inside of his left thigh about six inches below his genitals josiah beard once more started to extol the slaves docility before he was well begun george lewis called hold on there you boy where did you get that bullet wound docks head lifted he looked straight at lewis got this heah outside o water proof louziana las yeah fum dat bedford forrest he done cotched me but my three frens they gits away the auctioneer did his best to pretend dock had never been a soldier in arms against the confederacy bidding was slow all the same and petered out just past eight hundred dollars one of the rivington men bought the slave he paid gold which did a little to restore josiah beards spirits as dock came down from the platform toward him the rivington man told him you do your work and well get on fine boy just dont put on airs because you used to carry a rifle i can lick you any way you name bare hands axes whips guns any way at all any time you want to try you tell me but you have your grave picked out beforehand do you understand me you dont need to lick me none masseryou gots de law wid you dock said but before he answered he measured his new owner with his eyes saw that the rivington man meant exactly what he said and could back it up without the law he nodded more man to man than slave to master but respectfully nonetheless caudell thought the negro sensible to submitif he was submitting and not shamming if he was shamming hed likely regret it caudell had seen that the rivington men were uncommon fighters more slaves went up on the block some did have scarred backs a couple of them showed the marks of bullets one black when questioned said hed belonged to the th connecticut and had taken his wound at bealeton that made caudell frown for lee had ordered captured negroes treated like any other prisoners someone had seen a profit in disobeying the rivington men bought most of the slaves with bullet wounds and got them cheap the ones they didnt buy the texans did caudell suspected they would try to unload their purchases on fellow westerners who were desperate for labor and who might not recognize a bullet scar when they saw one seventeenth on the list josiah beard said presently a fine tanner and bricklayer named westly a griffe aged twentyfour years westly who stood beside him was slightly lighter of skin than most who had preceded him griffes carried one part white blood to three black the bidding was brisk raeford liles raised his hand again and again caudell understood why a slave with two such desirable skills as tanning and bricklaying would quickly be able to learn what he needed to help out at a general store and would make liles extra money when he rented him out around town but when the griffes price edged toward two thousand dollars liles dropped out with a frustrated snarl of disgust a rivington man and a fellow from alabama or mississippi bid against each other like a couple of men holding flushes in a poker game finally the man from the deep south gave up sold for josiah beard shouted masser you lets me keep some o my pay when you rents me i works extra hard for you westly said as his new owner came up to take him off the block the rivington man laughed at him who said anything about renting you kaffir you are going to work for me and for nobody else the griffes face fell but he had no choice save going with the man who had bought him more field hands were sold and then a prime bricklayer and mason a black man named anderson the auctioneer beamed like the rising sun as the negros price soared up and up again raeford liles bid again he had to drop out the fellow from the deep south who had bid on westly ended up buying anderson for when the rivington man who had been bidding against him abruptly quit he did not look altogether happy as he went up to pay josiah beard caudell did not blame him as someone in the crowd remarked hellfire you can buy yourself a congressman for cheapern after beard disposed of an the male slaves on his list he sold several women some field hands like the men others cooks and seamstresses heres a negro named louisa he caned as yet another wench climbed up beside him shes twentyone years old a numberone cook and a prime breeder tell the gentlemen how many little niggers youve already had louisa is had fo suh she answered shes good for many more too the auctioneer declared and every one pure profit to her owner and shes a goodtempered wench too he turned her around pulled down the top of her dress to display her clear back she fetched josiah beard almost as much as anderson had and looked smug when the texan who had bought her led her away some negroes caudell knew took pride in the high prices they brought it made more than a little sense an owner with a large investment in his animate property was likely to treat it better the slave trader looked out at his audience a smile stole across his face now gentlemen as the piece de resistance i have to display for you a mulatto wench named josephine nineteen years old and a fine hand with a needle caudell caught his breath as josephine climbed up onto the platform beside beard he let it out again in a sudden sharp cough so did most of the men who saw her she was worth every bit of that vocal admiration and more she might have had a trace of indian blood as well as white and negro her cheekbones her slightly slanted eyes and the piquant arch of her nose argued for it her skin perfectly smooth was the precise color of coffee with cream id like a piece o that resistance or no resistance a man close by caudell said hoarsely the schoolteacher found himself nodding the slave girl was simply stunning instead of simply showing josephines back as he had with the other wenches the auctioneer unbuttoned her dress and let it fall to the boards she was bare under it the coughs from the crowd doubled and doubled again her breasts caudell thought would just fill a mans hand their small nipples made him think of sweet chocolate josiah beard turned her around she was as perfect from behind as from the front put your dress back on the auctioneer told her as she stooped to obey he called out now gentlemen what am i bid to caudells surprise the auction started slowly after a moment he understood everyone knew how expensive she would be and everyone was hesitant about risking his money but josephines price climbed steadily past past past past the that had bought the skilled bricklayer and mason past bidders dropped out one by one with groans of regret three thousand one hundred and fifty josiah beard said at length do i hear he looked to the alabama man who had stayed in the auction all the way the man from the deep south stared hungrily at josephine but in the end he shook his head the slave trader puffed out his lips in a small sigh anyone else for no one spoke thirtyone fifty once a pause thirtyone fifty twice beard clapped his hands together sold for come forward sir come forward oh im coming never fear said the rivington man who had just bought josephine the crowd parted like the red sea to show respect for someone who would pay so much for a chattel the rivington man reached into his knapsack pulled out a paperwrapped roll of gold coins then another and another theres a hundred and fifty ounces of gold he said then opened yet another roll and counted out thirteen more he passed the money to beard roll by roll and then coin by coin when at last he was done the slave trader had more than thirteen pounds of gold and a slightly sandbagged expression still matteroffact the rivington man said along with the wench you owe me eleven dollars yes sir josiah beard said not even questioning the calculation he peeled the money from the fat roll of bills he had collected over the course of the afternoon let me have your name sir if you please for the bill of sale im piet hardie piet hardie spell it right let me have it again sir to make sure i do beard wrote then straightened and turned to josephine go on girl go to him he bought youyoure his moving with a grace that matched her beauty josephine descended from the auction block piet hardie slipped an arm around her waist she stood very straight neither pulling away nor pressing herself against him a collective sigh of envy went up from the crowd the fellow from alabama who had been the nexttolast bidder said tell me sir what are you going to do with her now that you got her hardie threw back his head and laughed uproariously what the bleeding hell do you think im going to do with her sir the same thing youd have done if youd bought her the alabama man laughed too ruefully caudell happened to be watching josephines face it congealed like cooling fat she must have hoped the rivington man would differ from others in more ways than his dress finding out so harshly that he did not could only be a cruel disappointment for a very reasonable price gentlemen i can supply shackles to ensure that your animate property doesnt become more animated than youd care for josiah beard chortled at his own wit several men came up to purchase restraints caudell drifted away from the town square for him the slave auction had been nothing more than a way to pass part of a long saturday afternoon he could not even dream of owning a slave especially in summer with his school closed tutoring writing letters for illiterate townsfolk and neatly transcribing county records gave him income sufficient to keep from starving but not much more george lewis fell into step beside him how are you today nate well enough thank you sir though captain no longer lewis was a big enough man in nash county for caudell to keep on giving him the title of respect i see you didnt buy any niggers today didnt plan to i have enough for the tobacco acreage i growmaybe even too many more than anything else i came to see what prices were like in case i decide to sell a couple oh caudell had known for a good many years now that he would never be a wealthy man the knowledge no longer bothered him sometimes as now he derived a certain amusement from listening to the things wealthy men had to worry about do i have too many slaves for my land should i sell a few no that was a problem which would never trouble him some of his thoughts must have shown on his face george lewis clapped him on the back and said if youre having trouble nate you just let me know i dont aim to let anybody who served in my company do without so long as i can help it with stubborn pride caudell answered thats right kind of you but im doing well enough sir lewis raised a politely dubious eyebrow theres plenty worse off than i am caudell insisted most of em have farms though to keep food on their tables lewis said on the edge of anger now caudell shook his head lewis shrugged all right nate if thats how you want it thats how itll be you ever change your mind all you ever need do is let me know about it i will caudell said knowing he wouldnt lewiss concern touched him all the same the captains children did not attend his school lewis could afford better but he looked out for rich and poor in the country caudell had voted for him without hesitation last fall and was ready to do it again if he stood for reelection lewis made his goodbyes and went off caudell was about to head back to his room when raeford liles called after him got a letter for you nate let me open up again caudell trotted back to the general store liles worked the key threw the front door wide he went behind the counter here yare from that gal o yours up rivington way shes not my gal caudell said as he still did whenever he got a letter from mollie bean or sent her one too bad for her if shes not on account of i wish everything and everybody in rivingtond get blown to hell and gone and if she was your gal id leave her out of that there wishin i wish you would do that mr liles caudell said only since its you as asks me nate liles proceeded to curse the town of rivington and its inhabitants with vigor and inventive wit whose like caudell had not heard since an army mule driver tried to flay the hides off his beasts with his tongue one afternoon when they bogged down in a road a week of rain had converted into a true bog an the worst of it is they all got money fallin out their backsides like it was turds three thousand one hundred fifty mortal dollars for that there mulatto wench the devil fry me for bacon in the mornin nate what the hells he gonna get from her he couldnt go down to the whorehouse an have for a few beans it dont feel no better on account of its expensive now does it i dont suppose so caudell said after a small hesitation brought on by thinking of mollie and of the trade she plied in rivington the storekeeper never noticed that his answer came a beat late liles was in full spate like the mississippi in flood season he was also getting to what really bothered him or that griffe westly or that nigger anderson almost two thousand for the one and twentyseven hundred for the other by jesus i been to other auctions too and had the same thing happen to me hows a man supposed to get the help he needs when he cant noways afford to buy it niggers is gettin so dear its damn near cheaper to do without em an them rivington men is a big part o runnin the prices up cause they just dont give a damn how much they spend whats an honest man supposed to do go on as best you can the way you arewhat else can you do caudell said liles was not a wealthy man like george lewis but he was a long way from poor caudell had trouble sympathizing with his complaints not when his own chief worry was figuring out how to stretch his summer money so he could pay the widow bissett for his room and eat anything better than corn bread and beans but liles glared at him over the tops of his halfglasses younger folks these days hasnt got no respect for their elders caudell glared back at thirtyfour he hardly felt himself still wet behind the ears and raeford liles with his store full of good things and getting fuller every day now that the war and the blockade no longer pinched him might have spoken a little more kindly to someone whod fought to keep him in the storekeeping business allison high had been rightwith the war over memories of what it meant were short he wondered how allison was getting along down in wilson county and realized guiltily that he hadnt thought about him in weeks memories were short all right he said never mind mr lileswe all have to go on as best we can the way we are i expect without waiting for an answer he went back out into the baking sunshine of the town square the bell over the front door jingled when he shut it he walked slowly back to the widow bissetts house moving any way but slowly would have invited heatstroke he took off his black felt hat and fanned himself with it the moving air briefly cooled the sweat that ran down his face and trickled through his beard but the sun smote the top of his head with savage heat he hastily replaced the hat hed baked outdoors but found himself poaching instead when he went into his upstairs room he did not stay long enough even to open mollies letter grabbing a length of line and a couple of hooks he headed for stony creek north of town sitting on the bank under a treemaybe taking off his shoes and letting his feet trail in the waterwas the best way he could think of to fight the heat of a summer day he might even catch his own supper too which would save him some money he used his clasp knife to dig worms out of the soft soil baited the hooks and tossed them into the water then he lit a cigar blew a ragged smoke ring and as near content as he could be in such weather pulled the letter from his pocket once more and used the knife again this time to do a neat job of slitting the envelope mollie went on for most of two pages after nearly a year of correspondence with him her handwriting was better than that of some of the twelveyearolds he taught her spelling remained wildly erratic but most of those twelveyearolds had that problem too old blue back notwithstanding much of the letter was chatter about her daytoday life a dress shed made a cake one of her friends had baked a complaint about the high price of shoes smiling he thought she and raeford liles could have commiserated together as usual she said little about the way she spent her nights she knew he knew what she did and doubtless did not care to remind him of it unnecessarily living as she did in rivington though even her daytoday life was out of the ordinary one passage leaped from the page at caudell last weak i come down with dyareaer worsen i ever get it in the army benny lang he comes to see me and wen he sees how sick i am he gos off and wen he comes back he gives me sum pils to take and i takem and next day i am rite as rain i wish we wood of nowed a bout it wen we was to gether on a count of a lot of good men who dyareared them selvs to deth could of been saved caudell nodded just as if mollie were there to see him diarrhea had killed as many men north and south as bullets with soldiers packed tightly together eating food and water that were often badand the water frequently made worse by their own sinks nearby or by men ignoring the sinks and doing their business straight into a streamhow could it be otherwise doctors could sometimes slow the illness but they boasted no magical pills to cure it overnightnot outside of rivington they didnt even the mention of benny lang whose name showed up fairly often in mollies letters failed to annoy caudell as it usually did wonder overcame what he still refused to admit to himself was jealousy and wonder and jealousy both surged in him when toward the end of her letter mollie wrote one thing i may not have tole you a bout is that wen i went to a rivington mans hous i mean one of the ones out in the woods last week i went in side and it was as cool as spring in ther you may be leev me or not just as you like and it was not cool atall out side likely it werent in nashvil too that if you ast me is as big a thing as the lites that burn elextristy or what ever the rivington men cal it the thing the cool air comes out of is a box on the wall with a nob on it like the ones that makes the elextristy lites burn i wish for it al the time on a count of hear in my room it aint cool atall dont you wish you was in rivington to yor true frend al ways m bean nc caudell wished with all his heart and sweaty soul he were in rivington or at least in that house if any of mollies letters had given him the slightest hint the town held enough children to support a school he would have moved without a second thought rivington had to be the boomingest town in the state the place where everything happened first even ahead of wilmington and raleigh the railroad the telegraph and the camera had all come to north carolina since his own boyhood now rivington boasted these wonderful electricityburning lights and cool air in summer both those things sounded as interesting as the camera any day he wondered when they would appear outside of rivington and why he hadnt heard about them in the newspapers the railroad had been ballyhooed for years before it finally arrived just then he got a bite he tossed aside mollies letter and his speculations and pulled a bullhead out of the creek the fish flopped on the bank he had to grab it to keep it from wriggling back into the muddy water it had swallowed the worm he dug up another one impaled it on the hook and tossed in the line again to see what else he could catch he waited with an anglers patience for a fish or fat turtle to go for the bait by the sun he had an hour or so of daylight left maybe he thought he would make a little fire right here cook his supper and sleep out on the grass the mosquitoes would eat him alive but that might be better than tossing and turning in his hot bed he plucked at his beard as he tried to make up his mind if he didnt hook anything more than one little bullhead it wouldnt matter anyhow that wasnt much of a supper something stirred in the clump of jasmine on the far side of the creek he looked up got a glimpse of brown hide through the leaves deer he thought and then with a tinge of alarm or maybe cougar he sat very still the big cats rarely attacked man unless provoked with his sole weapon a clasp knife he had no intention of doing anything provoking the leaves parted his breath went out in a startled grunt as if hed been kicked in the belly peering out at him her lovely face frightened as any hunted wild things was the mulatto wench josephine before either of them could say anything before the girl could turn and bolt into the woods hounds belled back in the direction of town josephines eyes already wide and staring showed white all around the iris her lips skinned back from her teeth hide me she hissed at caudell i do anything you wants massuh anything long as i dont gots to go back to that feller bought me he a devil he is hide me caudell had seen her up on the auction block naked as the day she was born and ever so much more tempting the thought of her doing anything he wanted raised a dark excitement in him but hiding a runaway slave was against every law in the confederacyand where could he hide her anyway more daunting than mere lawbreaking too was imagining the revenge piet hardie would take on him if he tried and failed the hounds cried again louder and closer josephine moaned she plunged away through the bushes leaving caudell just as well pleased he had not had to tell her yes or no he quickly got up pulled in his line picked up the bullhead hed caught and started back to town that way he would not have to tell the rivington man yes or no either he wondered what the fellow had done to josephine to make her run so then shook his head better not to know when the hounds chorused again they were only a few hundred yards away and plainly on the scent caudell heard piet hardie shout too at the men who ran with the dogs keep them on the leash if they mark her by god ill pay you in paper instead of gold barbara bissett fried the bullhead crisp and golden brown on the outside and firm and flaky and white in the center it was as fine a fish as caudell could have wanted and with hot corn bread turned into a pretty fair supper after all even so he hardly tasted it the georgia railroad engine wheezed to a halt the conductor came into the car in which lee was riding augusta he bawled he hurried along left the car went into the next one faintly through two doors lee heard him announce the stop again he got to his feet major you may send me to a lunatic asylum if having once returned to richmond i voluntarily board a train again at any time within the next ten years he said to charles marshall i am heartily sick of traveling from hither to yon inside a boxhe waved to show he meant the passenger coachas if i were a parcel to be delivered by the postman for the good of the country sir i may find myself constrained to act as if i have not heard you his aide answered i beg you however not to take this as implying i fail to sympathize with your point of view lee looked around as he got off the train the city is larger than i had thought it to be about fifteen thousand inhabitants i am given to understand marshall said he looked about too seems a pleasant enough place among the gaggle of people greeting new arrivals and wishing godspeed to departing loved ones was a rather corpulent middleaged man who wore confederate gray and a colonels three stars on his collar he pushed his way through the crowd lee always seemed to draw as if he were a lodestone attracting iron filings with a salute the fellow said george w rains sir at your service lee returned the courtesy then extended his hand delighted to see you colonel allow me to present to you my aide major marshall when the formalities were complete rains said i have my carriage here may i drive you to the hotel ive arranged rooms for you and major marshall at the planters which is by far the finest establishment in the city even english travelers men with wide experience of the world think well of the planterswith the exception i fear of the tea which one of them complained was so weak he did not see how it got out of the spout i should find that no great hardship colonel preferring coffee as i do lee said i am confident you will have done everything necessary for our comfort your exemplary management of the powder mills here throughout the course of the war makes me certain of your ability to tend to such trifles a barechested slave attached to the train station carried the newcomers bags to the carriage lee gave him a dime having come from kentucky he still had on his person a fair sum of us specie the slave grinned displaying uneven yellow teeth colonel rains raised a quizzical eyebrow but said nothing he flicked the reins to set the carriage in motion your shops are busy here charles marshall observed they were even busier during the war rains answered a large portion of the goods that came into charleston and wilmington through the blockade were sold here at auction for dispersal all over the interior of georgia and south carolina is that a bookstore there lee asked pointing perhaps i shall buy a novel to commemorate my stay here its been a good many years since ive had the leisure to enjoy a novel but i just may indulge myself theyre firstrate on a train rains said as i was telling major marshall colonel i feel at the moment a certainsufficiencyin respect to trains lee said on the off chance however that i may be forced to ride them more than i would wish i shall have to investigate that shop merely an off chance of course as i say lee admired rains for keeping his face so straight he wondered how many more thousands of miles he would put in rattling along over the iron rails before his career was done they pulled up in front of the planters hotel slaves strolled out to take charge of lees luggage he and marshall got down from the carriage i will leave you gentlemen here to recover from the rigors of your journey rains said if it pleases you i shall return for breakfast tomorrow then drive you over to the powder mill you are very kind colonel lee said that sounds most satisfactory ill see you then at eight oclock tomorrow morning if that be not too early eight oclock will be fine rains saluted again good day to you sir major the carriage rolled away lee and marshall went into the hotel spurred on by shouts from the white manager and clerks the serving staff did everything but carry them to their rooms yet the shouts were goodnatured and lee got the impression an ordinary guest would have received treatment no different from his own he thought better of the planters for that impression supper did nothing to disappoint him and over chicorylaced coffee the next morning he told rains your establishment here compares quite favorably to the galt house in louisville colonel smaller certainly but very fine ive heard of the galt house though i never stayed in it i think sir if you were to say that to mr jenkins behind the front desk you would have to stand back quickly to keep from getting hit by the buttons that flew off his waistcoat as he swelled up with pride lee smiled id sooner risk buttons than a good many other things that have flown through the air in my direction he drained his cup got to his feet perhaps this evening when we return i shall brave mr jenkinss waistcoat meanwhile though the powder mill lay by the augusta canal a couple of furlongs west of the savannah river the road ran past underground powder magazines each separated from its neighbors by thick brick traverses is that tin sheathing on the roofs of the magazines lee asked zinc rains answered it happened to be more readily available at the time sooner than wait for tin to appear i went ahead with what i had that was what i had to do all through the war if i wanted to accomplish anything pharaoh made the israelites make bricks without straw looking back on all my contrivances here i sometimes think i could have made bricks without clay young georgia soldiers had stood sentry around the magazines more guarded the big wooden shed that housed the powder mill they stared and pointed and lost almost any semblance of military discipline when they saw robert e lee colonel rains coughed drily they all wish theyd been bold in battle like you general the life of a soldier far from the cannons roar has little glamour to it lee thought rains was speaking for himself as well as for his men raising his voice so the georgia lads could hear along with their commander he said without your labor colonel and that of your garrison the cannon never could have roared how much gunpowder did you produce for the confederacy here at augusta just over two million pounds rains answered of that total about three fourths was sent north to richmond for use by the army of northern virginia the balance went to the big guns in the fortifications around charleston wilmington and mobile still more would have gone north to you had the infantry and cavalry not suddenly reequipped themselves with these newfangled aks indeed lee said that reequipment and its consequences are the reason i have come to augusta so you intimated in your telegram from louisville a horse with a uniformed rider came trotting up to the powder mill ah good rains said here is captain bob finney who is superintendent of the arsenal a couple of miles outside of town and thus responsible for the production of smallarms ammunition percussion caps and other such military materiel between the two of us we should display a truly staggering amount of ignorance for you finney arrived in time to hear that last remark he was a cheerfullooking roundfaced man in his middle twenties who wore a closetrimmed reddish beard like that of the federal general sherman yes indeed general lee if its ignorance you want youve come to the proper place he said gaily as he dismounted we turn out more of it than munitions these days as a matter of fact rains smiled plainly used to the captains forward tongue if you gentlemen will step into my officea small hut next to the powder millwe shall see how much ignorance we can produce today one of the chairs in the ramshackle office did not match the other three which made lee suspect rains had borrowed it for the occasion charles marshall said colonel does not the thought of working so close beside a place where so much gunpowder is produced ever weigh on your mind not a bit major rains answered at once in a fifteenhour day we can manufacture close to ten thousand pounds if by unhappy accident such an amount went up i should be translated to my heavenly reward before i had the chance to notice the explosion under those circumstances what point to worrying put that way none i suppose marshall admitted even so he could not help sneaking a glance out the window toward the powder mill to business then rains said general i gather from your telegram and from the correspondence i have had with colonel gorgas in richmond that you are aware the powder which propels the bullet from the cartridge of an ak is not properly speaking gunpowder at all yes i am aware of that lee said remembering the tiny cylindrical grains of powder gorgas had shown him at the confederate armory more than a year before i decided to come here before returning to the capital for two reasons first to learn what progress if any you have made toward duplicating that powder and second if your progress has been small to find out whether these cartridges may be reloaded with powder and bullets of our own manufacture captain finney and i have pursued these investigations on parallel tracks rains said if i may i would prefer that he speak to your second question first as his results have been less problematical than mine however would prove most convenient for you of course lee turned to finney captain ive never been handed a more interesting problem sir the arsenal superintendent said he sounded enthusiastic at facing such a challenge which made lee nod in approval enthusiastic still finney continued i cant tell you how much i admire the rivington men either they must have forgotten more about gunsmithing than any twelve gunsmiths know that might be nothing but literal truth lee thought aloud he said i also admire their ability with firearms captain what he thought of them in other respects was irrelevant to the issue at hand please carry on yes sir i gather you know these ak cartridges have their percussion primers on the inside not in separate caps the way say minié balls do finney waited for lee to nod again you may not know that all the primers have the same shape to ignite the powder in just the same way every timereally marvelously clever i did not know that lee admitted ive not been able to duplicate the effect either finney said by replacing the expended primer with a dab of the mixture of fulminate of mercury and the other substances used in percussion caps then inserting rather less gunpowder into the case than the powder previously found there i have achieved by trial and error a load that will fire from the ak excellent captain lee breathed colonel rains said he makes light of the danger he underwent in what he so casually calls trial and error general he would allow no one but himself to test the loads only the sturdiness of the ak more than once prevented serious injury when a load proved too heavy two of the repeaters did in fact burst in the early days of his experiments both fortunately while being fired from a rest by means of a cord finney dismissed rainss praise with a shrug its not as if i were fighting or anything of the sort in any event my loads are still makeshifts compared to the originals our gunpowder fouls the barrel much worse than that which is proper for the repeaters which is an especially significant difficulty because some of the gas provides the force used to draw each successive round into the chamber one rifle fired repeatedly with my loads became so foul it would no longer do so the charging handle had to be employed to clear the chamber after each shot that would make the weapons at worst the equivalent say of a henry repeater lee said musingly still highly useful in other words you have done well captain i presume you are also producing your own bullets yes sir and theyre not as good as the originals eithercolonel rains tells me colonel gorgas explained to you about the fouling problem from good old plain lead without any fancy copper nightshirt so he did though not in quite those terms lee let amusement show in his voice your loads will shoot though that is the important concern charles marshall said you can load spent cartridges captain and you can reproduce the bullets that go into them can you also manufacture new cartridge cases lee leaned forward in his seat to hear finneys reply if the confederacy could produce its own ammunition that would be a long step forward on the road to independence from the rivington men ive not been able to do it yet finney said and lee knew his face fell but the captain went on ive not given up either before we got to know the ak we southerners didnt have much to do with repeaters or with turning out any kind of brass cartridges now that were at peace with the usa again i expect well be able to license a setup from the people who make ammunition for the henry or one of the other northern repeaters once i have the tools maybe ill be able to jigger em to turn out these cartridge cases instead i aim to try anyway thank you captain for your courage and your energy lee said sincerely if youve not made all the progress for which you might have hoped you have made a good deal only in novels is the hero commonly fortunate enough to discover everything he requires to save the day at the precise instant he requires it thats the truth by god george rains said i hope general that youll grant me the same forbearance youve given captain finney not least because i stand more in need of it tell me what you have learned lee said let me judge though i am already confident you have done your utmost i sometimes wonder rains said i was proud of my knowledge of chemistry until i began investigating the powder the ak uses as propellant now my feelings are closely similar to those expressed by captain finney i have been shown how much i do not know the realization is galling this is a remark i have heard repeatedly in connection with the rivington men and their products lee said adding to himself and i know why too suppose you tell me now what you have found out and leave the enigmas for another time thank you sir rains said gratefully almost twenty years ago a german named schonbein produced an explosive by steeping cotton fibers in strong nitric acid lee raised an eyebrow you dont say there is a use for cotton i had not imagined some in our country have called it king but none dreamed it could be a munition of war were you exploring that possibility here before you began receiving ak cartridges no sir rains answered at once and in emphatic tones the stuff has always been too temperamental for any sane man to want to usetill now one of the constituents of ak powder is a nitrocellulose i have confirmed this both by chemical means and by examination of the powder under a glass the appearance of the cotton remains almost unaltered despite exposure to the acid but somehow perhaps in the purification process its explosive properties have been rendered far more reliably consistent than those of the product with which land the worldwas previously familiar this appears to be considerable progress colonel lee said my congratulations i dont feel i merit them sir rains made a sour face i have some idea of what the powder does and of its ingredients but none at present as to how i might duplicate the effect for myself nor is this treated cotton its sole constituent part more than half of it is another nitrogenous compound one which i believe to have a chemical affinity to glycerine anitroglycerine you might say of itself lees hand went to the waistcoat pocket which held the vial of small white pills from the rivington men rains beamed at him exactly general i had not thought you so chemically astute if you will forgive my saying so of course lee said abstractedly he wondered if his pills were liable to blow a hole in his jacket when he least expected it and wondered also whether the men from america will break hoped they would it seemed a clumsy way to try to get rid of a man besides the little pills really did relieve the pains in his chest he decided that since they had resided in his pocket for more than a year without detonating of their own accord they could probably be relied upon to remain intact gathering his wits he said have you sought to manufacture any of this ah nitroglycerine for yourself yes most cautiously rains said i have nitric acid and glycerine proved available from a soap works in town i mixed minute quantities of them the resulting compound is so explosive that it promptly proceeded to shatter the flask in which it was produced when that flask was accidentally bumped against the edge of a table fortunately the fragments of glass did me no serious damage very fortunately lee echoed not so long before in louisville hed also been lucky with glass fragments rains said there are other ingredients in the ak powder which i am having more difficulty analyzing i have to hope they are the secret to controlling the force of that powder soldiers would i suspect suffer a loss of morale if for instance their cartridges exploded upon being carelessly dropped you are likely to be right lee said being a man inclined to understatement himself he knew a good one when he heard it captain finneys temperament ran the other way if that happened you wouldnt find a regimental ordnance sergeant who would dare poke his head out of his tent for fear of meeting up with a bunch of privates carrying a noose that was probably also true but a commanding generals dignity did not permit acknowledging it lee said by all means continue your investigations colonel rains the confederacy is fortunate to have you if any man now living can uncover the secrets of this powder i am confident you are he thank you sir rains paused thoughtfully any man now living an interesting phrase lee sat in silence not elaborating one bit he realized he had carelessly said too much already at last seeing he would get no more out of him rains shrugged and said i shall go on with my researches and promptly communicate to you in richmond any new results with peace here i am able to devote more time to this project than was heretofore possible thats the truth bob finney agreed before with the powder mill and the cannon foundry and these new cartridges and everything else i dont think you ever sleptyou just went turn and turn about and relieved yourself he grinned mischievously sometimes i expect you were even too busy to do that i should have told you to stay back at the arsenal rains growled in mock anger he gave an exaggerated shudder and turned back to lee is there anything more sir i think not colonel thank you lee answered may i trouble you for a ride back to the hotel however i should like to start arranging my return to richmond having been away so long i begrudge every further unnecessary minute i quite understand that sentiment rains said take my carriage back if you care to i can ride in and pick it up at any time and our conversation has made me eager to go back to investigating this remarkable powder by the way he stirred in his chair he seemed eager to be at it that very moment are you certain lee asked rains nodded vigorouslysure enough he did not care to waste time as a driver lee inclined his head most generous of you sir i am in your debt rains waved that away too when charles marshall took the reins of the carriage the colonel hardly waited for the horses to start moving before he hurried back to get to work again he reminds me of a hound on a scent marshall said an apt comparison lee agreed though he wondered how many northern hounds were following that same trail the carriage rolled along raising a small cloud of dust behind it men in the street waved to lee more than one woman dropped him a curtsy he gravely raised his hat to return each salutation when marshall drove past the bookshop he had seen before he said let me out major if you would i think i shall buy a novel the planters is only a few blocks off ill walk it from here yes sir his aide pulled back on the reins the team slowed stopped as lee got down marshall said while you browse sir ill go over to the train station and arrange our return passage to richmond that would be excellent lee walked into the shop the carriage rattled away the bookseller looked up when he saw who his new customer was his eyes widened he started to speak then thought better of it as lee headed straight for a shelf making it plain he did not care to be interrupted right then after some frowning thought he pulled out ivanhoe and carried it over to the man who ran the shop its heft promised it would keep him amused through a long slow train ride the bookseller looked unhappy an expression that fit his long thin face well im afraid i cant let you have that sir lee stared at him what why ever not mrwhat had the name on the sign outside beenmr arnold its my last copy arnold said as if that explained everything to him it must have for he went on if i sell it to you sir i wont have another and heaven only knows when ill see more again but lee gave up when he saw how determined the bookseller looked trying not to laugh he turned and replaced lvanhoe on its shelf picked up a copy of quentin durward instead you have several of these mr arnold he said deadpan yes sir arnold said now seeming as happy as his doleful physiognomy permitted that will be three dollars paper or seventyfive cents cash money he bobbed his head up and down when lee gravely handed him three us quarters back at the hotel lee told marshall about arnolds book his aide snorted and said its soldiers who are supposed to husband their ammunition not booksellers well put lee said are our arrangements completed for returning to richmond yes sir we depart tomorrow on the nine oclock train and go by way of columbia charlotte greensboro and danville i see lee said is something wrong sir notwrong precisely major i was wondering if we would pass through rivington thats all it might have been interesting to see im sorry general by your remarks to colonel rains i assumed you would wish to travel by the most direct route going over to wilmington and then up through eastern north carolina would be like traversing the two legs of a right triangle rather than its hypotenuse if you like however ill go back to the train station and have our tickets revised lee thought about it no never mind major as you say fastest is best and perhaps i would do better to stay as far away from rivington as i can marshall gave him a curious look but he declined to elaborate summer gave way to fall school started again as usual the children especially the younger ones had forgotten much of what caudell had taught them the spring before he was resigned to that and spent the first couple of weeks of classes getting them back to where theyd been that also let him start his handful of new five and sixyearolds on their abcs and numbers some of them stared at slates and chalk as if theyd never seen such things before likely they hadnt establishing discipline was also dicey as usual the first time he switched a fiveyearold for kicking one of his little classmates the boy just looked at him scornfully and said my pa he licks me a lot hardern that do you want me to try again caudell asked raising the switch he would have sworn the boy thought it over before finally shaking his head whenever he let them go at the close of a day the children would scatter in all directions shouting as joyfully as if theyd just been released from a yankee prison campor for that matter a southern one he remembered the skeletons in rags going back to the united states from andersonville he wished he could work up that much excitement over schools getting out most days he just felt tired one afternoon when the black gum and maple trees were beginning to change color he got back to the widow bissetts house to find henry pleasants sitting on the front porch waiting for him grinning he charged up the steps to shake his friends hand how did you manage to get the time off to come up and see me he asked i have all the time i need pleasants answered when caudell looked puzzled he amplified the railroad let me go they did what caudell said indignantly why would they go and do a damnfool thing like that where are they going to find anyone half as good as you that i dont know they dont either im sure they let me go anyhow pleasants said as for whyshall we go for a walk his eyes slid to the house caudell heard barbara bissett moving around in the parlor he caught pleasantss drift nodded and started down the street pleasants came with him a backwards glance showed caudell the widow disappointedly standing by a front window tell me caudell said after theyd got out of earshot he kept his voice low so did pleasants it was the way i treated the negroes they said what caudell gaped memories of josephines terrified faceand of her sweet ripe bodysurged through him you were too rough on them he could not imagine pleasants whose disposition lived up to his name producing that kind of fear in anyone too rough his friend stared too then started to laugh rather bitterly no no no the railroad let me go because i treated them too much like men is that what happened caudell said hed heard of other northerners dismissed from positions for just the same reason thats what happened by god pleasants searched for a way to explain himself nate youre a teacher you must know the difference between people who are stupid and people who are only ignorant of course i do before he went on caudell looked around theyd walked south from the widow bissetts house a couple of minutes were plenty to get them to the edge of town no one was around to overhear too many of the people in this county are ignorant plenty in my company couldnt write their names or read them if they were written out but i dont reckon there are more stupid people here than anywhere else i taught more than one man his letters while we were in the army and mollie bean too he added to himself they learned fine when i gave them the chance they hadnt had before ive had the same experience with the cornishmen and irish and germans who work the pennsylvania mines they dont know much but theyre not idiots or childrenshow them what they need to do explain why and theyll go on from there you dont need to stand over them with a whip the ones who wont work you turn loose you cant turn niggers loose caudell pointed out thats true but i didnt want to stand over them with a whip either i was afraid id have to you people have kept them pigignorant much worse than the white men who used to work for me up north but i decided id do the same as i did therei broke the gangs in half setting em against each other and i gave half a dollar to each man on the crew that put down the most ties or hauled the most gravel for the roadbed each day i gave them work quotas they had to meet or else neither half got paid i wanted em to have a reason to work besides my sayso if you see what i mean and after i gave em that reason i just stood back and let em go to it how did all that work i know some white men whod swing a hammer for half a dollar a day in summer caudell thought he might have been one of those men himself dont forget they only got the money if they did the most work that went the same as it would in the minesthey got the idea real quick and inside of a week somebody in one halfgang figured out a faster way to get the gravel from the freight car to the roadway the day after that both halfgangs were doing it the new way be damned if i know whether niggers are as smart as white folks nate but they arent as stupid as people down here think and thats a fact if you got the work out of them how could the railroad people complain caudell asked i guess the trouble is if you treat a negro like a man hes going to act like a man my gangs started bragging and strutting in front of other laborers and getting in fights with them and even talking back to whites who showed they didnt know what the hell they were doing uhoh caudell said uhoh is right pleasants agreed you ask me thats a stupid thing for a negro to try in this country no matter how right he ismaybe especially if hes right but somebody who feels like a man doesnt take kindly to orders from a fool the whole thing was partly my fault too my crews were used to telling me when they thought they had good ideas or if they thought i had a bad one id listen why not sometimes they were right down here though if youre black youre wrong you talk like an abolitionist caudell said pleasants shrugged if niggers really are a lot less than whitesif theyre stupid by nature i meani might see some justice in slavery if theyre backwards just because theyre ignorant why not enslave ignorant white men too caudell pondered that in his mind he saw georgie ballentine again and black men in blue uniforms standing up under the fire of aks and josephine lovely flesh to be sold and abused because it came in a dark wrapping was that justice before the war hed taken it for granted hed taken a lot of things for granted before the war he wondered what would have happened had the north won and forced the south to free its slaves how would they live where would they work you couldnt just go and turn them loose all at once he said mmmmaybe not pleasants said though he didnt sound convinced then he laughed i suppose youd lynch anybody who tried after youre just through fighting a war to keep them slaves the war wasnt about slaves caudell said at least it wasnt about slaves till lincoln made it that way he lost the war and hes not us president anymore either and the niggers the yankees freed while they were holding our land are just going to complicate our lives for the next twenty years not if nathan bedford forrest has his way pleasants said when caudell looked a question at him he went on by the papers forrest would just as soon kill the negroes he catches as make slaves out of them again hes a hard man by all accounts caudell admitted some folks like to take that line as vividly as if it had happened the day before he heard the bark of an ak saw a grinning billie beddingfield standing over the corpses of two negro soldiers who had tried to surrender at bealeton pleasants watched the line between his eyes deepen the corners of his mouth turn down you dont have the stomach for massacre yourself do you i guess not caudell felt that in some obscure way he betrayed the confederacy by admitting his doubts to this man from the north who happened to be his friend to keep from having to do it again he changed the subject what will you do now head back to pennsylvania thats the first thing i thought of i tell you frankly then i had a better idea pleasants smiled foxily you know the old saying living well is the best revenge the railroad paid me good money and i never did get around to buying that house down in wilmington so i have a tidy sum in a bank there i was thinking of moving up here to nash county buying myself a farm and working it with free labor white and black both how does that strike you your new neighbors may not like it along with the farm ill buy a rifle pleasants said looking very much like a man who had commanded a union regiment but if anybody can make a go of it i expect youre the fellow caudell finished he meant it if ever hed met an allaround competent man henry pleasants was the one come to think about it folks hereabouts will likely give you more leeway than they would somebody who was born in north carolina theyll reckon youre a damnfool crazy yankee who doesnt know any better i love you too nate pleasants snorted in suppressed mirth maybe i am a damnfool crazy yankee if i had any sense i would go back to the united states you know but letting a bunch of rich peckerheads in embroidered waistcoats run me out of here just sticks in my craw so i figure ill stay around and show em youre stubborn enough to make a southern man thats certain caudell cocked his head to one side you aim to buy a farm up here you say why not down around wilmington the land is better there you could raise rice or indigo make more than you would here at tobacco and corn the delta land is richer but it costs more too and besides pleasants paused to clap caudell on the back i thought id sooner live close by a friend thank you henry they walked along in companionable silence for several steps caudell tried to remember if hed ever had a finer compliment he couldnt think of one a few stars poked through the clouds that drifted by overhead the evening he realized was getting chilly it had a habit of doing that in fall even if one tended to forget about such things during the seemingly endless days of summer which reminded himdo you have a place to stay in town yes ive hired a room over the liberty bell tavern thanksthe same as we did in rocky mount that first day we met ah the neutral noise covered a certain amount of relief caudell would gladly have shared his room with his friend but he was far from sure barbara bissett would have been glad about having an unexpected guest and while pleasants would have to endure her gimlet gaze for only one day he himself might never hear the end of her complaints pleasants said do you remember what else we did in rocky mount that day pieces of it anyhow caudell said smiling reminiscently shall we go and do it again dont know if i want to get that drunk i have to teach tomorrow and id sort of like to be able to know who i am and what im doing but i wouldnt say no to a drink or three caudell and pleasants both turned around in the road the notsobright lights of the notsobig city lay ahead they hurried toward them raeford liles was putting boxes of cloves and peppercorns on a shelf in a back corner of his general store when nate caudell came in behind the counter a grayhaired negro made change for a woman buying a thimble she put money and thimble into her handbag nodded to caudell as she headed for the door morning mrs moye he told her she nodded again the bell jingled to signal her departure caudell said i didnt know youd finally bought yourself a nigger mr liles who israel there liles turned around shook his head didnt buy him nateaint you seen niggers too high for the likes of me hes a free nigger new in town just a couple days and lookin for work so i done hired him hes right sharp israel is israel this heres nate caudell the schoolteacher is pleased to make your quaintance suh israel said whered you come from israel caudell asked las few years suh i been livin ovah in new berne an in the haytithe colored folks townacross the trent from it have you caudell eyed the black man with new curiosity new berne had been in federal hands from early to the end of the war and served as a mecca for escaped slaves from all over north carolina colored regiments recruited there had raided the northeastern part of the state and more blacks in the area labored to support the union war effort some of them had left with the withdrawing yankees but not all caudell wondered if israels freedom papers were genuineand if raeford liles had bothered asking to see them the negro reached under the counter if you nate caudell suh you gots a letter here he gave caudell an envelope which sure enough was addressed to him he recognized mollie beans handwriting for a moment that was all he noticed then he blurted you can read yes suh so i can israel admitted he sounded anxious teaching blacks their letters was against the law in north carolina defensively he went on the yankees they had schools there an they learned lots of us to read now they showed me don reckon i can jus go an forget it again i hired him on account of he reads raeford liles said youre one whos always been talkin about changin times nate an i reckon maybe youre right at least partwayslike israel said he aint gonna forget what he learned the damnyankees messed with niggers for years at new berne an at beaufort an carolina city an washington an plymouth too theres probably thousands and thousands o niggers in the state with their letters now goddamn it shootin emd be purely a waste might as well get the most use we can out of em israel waited to hear how caudell would answer more than a few north carolinians caudell thought would cheerfully have shot thousands of black men but as henry pleasants had said he couldnt stomach a massacre i think youve done well mr liles he said no matter how much we wish they could things arent going back to just like they were before the war wars tear things up thats what theyre all about one way or another though i expect well get along you got pretty good sense nate liles said yes suh israel agreed softly thas all i try to do is git along caudell shrugged if im so allfired smart why arent i rich he took the letter and walked out into the street once out there he used his free hand to jam his hat as far down over his ears as he could the trees that lined washington and alston were barebranched now snow had fallen once or twice this saturday afternoon was clear enough but caudells breath puffed out in a smoky cloud he opened the envelope as he walked back to the widow bissetts house dear nate he read the big thing hear in rivington to day is skandul a nigger went name of josefeen wich belonged to one of the rivington men called peet hardy has gon and hung her self i seen her oncet or twice in town and its a shaym on a count of she was a bout the purttiest gal black or wite i ever seen but i reckon i aynt serprized on a count of i went to peet hardys hous oncet and i aynt never going back a gain not for all the gold in the woreld he is that crool the rivington men is hard on there niggers weve noed that sins we was in the army to gether but even the rest of them has bad things to say a bout feet hardy non of the girls wil go to him no more im not the onely one i no you dont like me to tawk a bout wat i am and wat i do but nate to day i cant help it i feel so bad for that josefeen if you are my true frend i no you will understand yor true trend al ways m bean nc caudell stared down alston street without really seeing it instead with frightening vividness he saw josephines dress fall from her shoulders saw her dark charms exposed for buyers to admire saw the frustrated lust on the alabama mans face when piet hardiea schoolmaster even in his own thoughts he spelled the rivington mans name correctly in his mindoutbid him he also saw her face peering through the jasmine by stony creek heard the terror in her voice heard the nigger hounds baying on her trail he wondered what hardie had done to her to make her first try to flee and then take her own life mollie would know he thought and then shivered in a way that had nothing to do with the cold some knowledge he decided he could live without he read the letter again then slowly and deliberately tore it into tiny pieces he hurled them down to the dirt of the street the chilly wind whirled them away as if it were snowing again after all xiii robert e lee glanced over at a map of kentucky then noted a last couple of corrections to an order changing the size of the garrisons in the new confederate fortifications along the ohio river with a satisfied nod he fixed his signature to the bottom of the paper then he got up stretched and set his hat on his head the sky was beginning to go more purple than blueenough for one day in peacetime he could think that and keep his conscience clear the lobby of mechanics hall was all but deserted when he went downstairs even john beauchamp joness proud brass nameplate presided over a bare desk and an empty chair a sentry came to attention as lee walked past him into the gathering twilight another man in confederate gray was coming down the steps of the building across the street from the war department the building that was the richmond headquarters of america will break lees mouth tightened ever so slightly he wished soldiers would stay away from the rivington men especially since the war was more than a year and a half over he had contemplated a general order to that effect but set the notion aside as being unjust and without foundation in fact the rivington men troubled him but on balance had done his country far more good than harm as he and the other man approached each other he noticed the fellows tunic buttons were grouped in three groups of three his frown deepened what was a general doing consorting with the rivington men he peered through the gathering darkness but did not recognize the officer the other man appeared to have no such doubts about him but then his face was arguably the most widely known in the confederacy the man saluted then held out a hand and said general lee sir im delighted to meet you at last i am nathan bedford forrest the pleasure is mine general forrest forgive me i beg for not knowing you at once as he spoke lee studied the famous cavalry commander forrest was a big man a couple of inches taller than he with wide shoulders but otherwise whipcord lean he bore himself almost as erectly as jefferson davis his hair receded at the temples gray streaked it and his chin beard deep shadows dwelt in the hollows of his cheeks his eyesas soon as lee saw those grayblue eyes he understood how forrest had earned his reputation for good and ill they were the hooded eyes of a bird of prey utterly intent on whatever lay before them of all the officers lee had known he could think of only two whose visages bore the stamp of implacable purpose that marked nathan bedford forrest jackson whom he would mourn forever and john bell hood what this man set out to do he would do or die trying lee said i was just heading home sir will you take supper with me i wouldnt want to put you to any trouble general forrest said doubtfully his voice was soft and pleasant with a strong flavor of backwoods tennessee nonsense lee declared there will be plenty in any case i may keep you too busy to eat as i intend to talk your ears off forrests smile enlivened his brooding features remarkably i am at your service then general lee and i will make sure i keep my hands on my ears at all times my house is only a few blocks away lee said do come along ive wanted to meet you for some time to discuss with you your extraordinary campaigns in the west but circumstances have kept you in the field even while the rest of us enjoyed the fruits of peace blame the yankees for trifling with our niggers forrest said i am sick to death of blame general forrest and of endless recriminations on both sides let me say lee added hastily the united states are here as are we our two nations have a common border which stretches for two thousand miles more or less either we learn not to be distracted by our differences or we fight a war every generation as the nations of europe are in the habit of doing i would not care to see such folly come to our shores spoken like the true christian you are sir forrest said still and all knowing i can lick the yankees whenever i need to will make me sleep better of nights as for the nigger soldiers they left behind well be years getting em all to remember who their masters are and for that i wish god would send all the yankees straight to hell do you think it can be done even given years lee asked kill enough of em general lee sir and the rest of em will get the notion forrest said with brutal pragmatism the cavalry general and negro fighter seemed very sure of himself but lee still wondered if simple savagery could produce even a tacitean peace the promise of force had always had its place in maintaining slavery and keeping revolts from breaking out yet that promise rarely had to be kept in the days before the war he wondered howand whetherthe confederacy could withstand a constantly simmering rebellion hoping to change the subject he asked forrest what brings you to richmond at last i think i wrecked the last nigger robber band that halfway deserved to be called a regiment so i had the leisure to present my report in person forrest answered i gave it to a clerk this afternoon so i daresay youll see it tomorrow i thought id look at the slave markets too plenty of prime niggers here since this is the capital i see lee could not keep a certain chill from his voice he knew forrest had made his fortune trading slaves but he had not expected him to refer to it so openly no virginia gentleman would have done so that was certain forrest might have picked the thought from his mind i hope ive not offended you sir my father was a blacksmith who neither read nor wrote he died when i was sixteen leaving me the oldest of eight brothers and three sisters so ive had to come up as i can my son will be a gentleman but ive not had the leisure to learn that way of life myself he drew himself up straighter than ever in touchy pride youve done well for yourself general forrest and for your family and for the confederate states lee said which had the virtue of being both true and politegentlemanly as a matter of fact nevertheless he could not quite suppress a touch of pique at forrests implied criticism of his own upbringing and social class by then the two men had reached lees house lee knocked on the front door took off his coat as he waited for julia to open it forrest followed his example now that spring was here an uncovered moment at night was no longer uncomfortable crickets chirped here and there in the grass the door swung open julias smile of greeting for lee turned to a questioning look when she saw he had a companion as he handed her his coat he said ive brought a guest home as you see this is lieutenant general forrest of the confederate cavalry julia had been reaching out to take forrests coat and hang it on the tree by lees the motion froze so did julias face for the first time since lee had manumitted her he saw her features go blank in the special way negroes used to hide all feelings from their masters after a long pause she did hang up forrests coat then she turned and hurried away long skirts rustling about her youre too easy on your staff sir forrest remarked with a tone of professional expertise slaves need to have in mind who the masters are shes a freedwoman lee said i no longer own any slaves oh now forrest hid whatever his true feelings were behind a mask as impenetrable as julias lee remembered he had been a gambler as well as a slave dealer julia returned followed closely by lees wife and daughters in an instant forrest became if not a gentleman then at least a polished simulacrum of one bowing over the younger womens hands and bowing even lower over and kissing that of mary custis lee we are delighted to welcome such a famous commander lees wife said thinking on the commander who lives here you are much too kind to my own poor self forrest said bowing yet again then he grinned an impish grin ill take all the flattery i can get though he proved a lively guest at the supper table using silverware a gravy boat and a heel of bread to show how he had won his victory north of corinth mississippi you use your horses then merely to transport your troopers but have them fight dismounted lee said that is my rule forrest agreed a horse has use in getting a man from here to there faster than he can march but what good is it in a fight but to give a choicer target than a man on foot that was true before what with the coming of the repeater its doubly so these days many others did likewise both among the enemy and our own horse soldiers lee said thinking of jeb stuart how do you account for your greater success with the tactic from what ive seen sir most of em did it because circumstances forced it on em me i aimed to fight my men so from the start i drove em hard too and always stayed up at the very front of the pack with all the guns my own escort party carried i used it to plug any holes or to break through when i saw the chance forrest grinned again worked right well too there i cannot disagree lee said thoughtfully should we style your men dragoons then general lee i dont care what you call them and they dont care what you call them but when you do call them they fight like wildcats with rattlesnake fangs and that i do care about will you pass me the sweet potatoes sir lee watched the way julia acted around forrest she was a good enough servant not to ignore him altogether but she plainly wanted to yet even when she was busy at the opposite end of the table her eyes big and fearful kept sliding toward him he must have seemed the bogeyman incarnate to her negroes had been using his name to frighten their children ever since the fort pillow massacre and his campaigns against the black soldiers left behind in the mississippi valley when union forces abandoned confederate soil only made his reputation the more fearsome he knew it too every so often when he spied julia watching him he would raise an eyebrow or bare his teeth for a moment he never did anything overt enough for lee to call him on it but julia finally dropped a silver ladle picked it up and fled as ignominiously as the luckless federal general sturgis whom forrest had smashed though outnumbered better than two to one chuckling forrest said sturgis moaned to one of his colonels for gods sake if mr forrest will let me alone i will let him alone but i wouldnt let him alone i aimed to whip him out of his boots and i did it mildred lee rose from her chair if you men are going to fight your battles across the tablecloth i will leave you to your sport if you stay we wont fight them forrest said quickly hardbitten as he was he could also be charming especially to women but mildred shook her head no i should only spoil your fun for you know youd still wish to and father did not bring you home so he could listen to me he can do that any night after all he can do that any night after all when he is in richmond mary custis lee said an edge to her voice lee sighed silently even after nine months without straying from the capital his wife had not forgiven him his long trip to kentucky and missouri mildred turned and left the room followed by agnes and mary lees eldest daughter wheeled mary custis lee ahead of her well lee rose took a cigar case off a cabinet shelf offered forrest a smoke forrest shook his head i never got the habit but you go on yourself i dont use them either i keep them for guests lee put the case away then asked did you also come to richmond to see the men from america will break what if i did forrest said those repeaters of theirs made my men five times the fighters they would have been without them he gave lee a measuring stare by all accounts wed have lost the war without their aid by all accounts indeed lee studied nathan bedford forrest in return cautiously he said am i to infer that the accounts you mentioned include the one given by the rivington men themselves just so i gather youve also heard this account forrest waited for lee to nod then said softly almost to himself i wondered if i was the only one theyd told well no matter he gathered himself do you believe what they say sir or do i find it fantastic you mean i can imagine nothing more fantastic than men traveling in time as if by railroad forrest started to say something lee held up a hand but i believe nonetheless any madman may claim to come from the future but madmen do not commonly carry proof for their assertions their artifacts convince more strongly than their words my thought exactly general lee forrest drew in along relieved breath but with the artifacts comes the tale and the tale they tell of the history ahead makes me believe more what i already thought that the south is the last and brightest hope of the white race and if we ever turn loose of the niggers here theyll ruin everything everywhere if all the rivington men say is true that may be a justifiable conclusion lee said maybe that belief explained some of forrests savage conduct in his war against the blacks although as hed said himself hed had no use for negroessave as a source of incomeeven before the rivington men came to help the confederacy win its independence lee went on yet all the trend of the nineteenth century makes me wonder the nations of europe almost unanimously find chattel slavery abhorrent and us on account of it most of the south american republics have abandoned it even brutal russia has freed its serfs the trend in history seems to be ever toward more liberty not less are you saying you believe the negroes ought to be freed sir after the war we fit to keep them slaves forrests voice remained low and polite but took on an unmistakable note of warning his rather sallow complexion turned a shade redder we fought the war as you say to ensure we would be the only ones with the right to either preserve our institutions or change them and we have won that right lee answered not only the opinions of the outside world but also the course of the war and of your own gallant efforts after our armistice with the united states have compelled me to alter somewhat my view of the black man not me mine by god forrest growled at fort pillow we killed five hundred niggers for a loss of twenty of our own the mississippi ran red for two hundred yards with their blood that ought to show negro soldiers cannot cope with southernersin other words that they deserve to be just what and where they are they fought well enough at bealeton and elsewhere against the army of northern virginia in our advance on washington city lee said no worse than their equally inexperienced white counterparts at any rate and in your campaigns in the lands formerly under federal occupation have you found them such easy prey as you did at fort pillow he purposely did not mention the stories that said most of the negroes at fort pillow had been slain after they surrendered forrest bristled even so even a rat will fight if you push him into a corner he said contemptuously but if you dont he will not lee replied the negroes could quietly have returned to their bonds at no danger to themselves that they chose what most of them must have known to be a futile fightall the more so as your men were armed with repeatersmust i believe provoke the contemplation of any thoughtful man their grandfathers fit when they were in africa too i expect forrest said with a shrug fit and lost or theyd not have been caught and shipped over here the ones i fit after the armistice they were better than those worthless hapless niggers at fort pillow that i grant you but that they fit well enough i deny it sir or id not have licked them over and over again there our opinions differ lee said forrest inclined his head to show he agreed with that much if with nothing else lee had said lee persisted i do not feel the views of the rest of the world may be ignored with safety for our state nor do i think we can take the negros lack of manliness as much for granted as before sooner than see the confederacy eternally plagued with revolt and insurrection should we not begin a program of just one damned minute sir forrest broke in lee blinked he was not used to being interrupted let alone so rudely forrest sprang up from his chair and thrust his face now quite red up against lees general lee youre highborn youre highminded you might as well be a saint carved out of marble and everybody says you ii be president as soon as jeff davis steps down but if you are talking in any way shape or size about making people free diggers sir i will fight you with every ounce of strength in my body and i wont be alone sir i promise you that i wont be alone lee rose too he wondered if forrest would lay hands on him the cavalry officer was some years his junior but lee promised him a nasty surprise if he struck first he also wondered if forrest would challenge him he did not consider forrest a gentleman but the tennesseean no doubt thought of himself as oneand was no doubt very quick with a pistol but he had offered forrest no personal insult if anything the reverse was true the two men glared at each other at closer than arms length for some little while lee battled down his own rage said tightly general forrest i no longer find you an agreeable guest here nor will you be welcome at my home again forrest snapped his fingerslefthanded he had also eaten that way see how much id care to come back id just as soon eat at thaddeus stevenss house the men of america will break may have saved the south from his tender mercies but i see we can grow our own crop of judases he spun on his heel and stomped away his boots crashing on the wood floor then slammed the door so violently that the flame in every lamp and candle in the dining room jumped lee listened to his furious footsteps receding down the walk he slammed the iron gate that gave onto the street with a loud metallic clang several women exclaimed upstairs lee walked to the bottom of the stairway and called its perfectly all right my dears general forrest chose to leave a bit sooner than he thought he might thats all but it wasnt all right and he knew it till now his only enemies had been men his professional duty called him to oppose mexicans western indians john brown soldiers and officers of the united states now he had a personal foe and a dangerous one he blew a long breath out through his mustache he could feel the difference he did not care for it nate caudell wiped sweat from his forehead paused to rest a moment in the shade of a willow tree his chuckle was half amused half chagrined henry pleasantss new farm was only five miles or so up the road from nashville toward castalia and here hed started breathing hard before it came into sight in the army a fivemile march wouldnt have been worth complaining about im getting lazy and soft he said out loud he pushed on before long he came to a splitrail fence as soon as he turned into the lane that led to the farmhouse a white man who was hoeing a vegetable garden enclosed by another fence turned and let out a loud halloo to announce his arrival the fellows voice had an irish lilt to it when he turned back toward caudell his pale freckled face looked vaguely familiar good day caudell said lifting his hat have i seen you somewhere before faith sir i dont think so john moring i am and ive spent most of me time till now down by raleighsaving a spell in the army that is thats where caudell began and then stopped moring hadnt been in his company and had disappeared from the forty seventh north carolina not long after gettysburg but that was almost three years ago now and no one these days was making any effort to track down deserters caudell shrugged never mind is mr pleasants at home youre nate caudell are ye not aye hes here sir where else would he be caudell lifted his hat again walked on down the lane he passed a stable with a cattle pen beside it jumped over a tiny stream then went by a corncrib and a woodpile he wrinkled his nose at the smell of the pigpen by the corncrib but beyond it stood the farmhouse in the middle of a large irregular yard where chickens and turkeys scratched henry pleasants came out onto the houses covered porch just as caudell got to the end of the yard he waved to his friend and hurried over to greet him barnyard fowl scattered clucking and gobbling indignantly hello nate he said pumping caudells hand he waved out to the fields that stretched back from the house crop should be ail right god willing though weve had less rain than id hoped for good caudell looked at the fields too and back at the cow barn and pigpen then at the farmhouse itself a twostory whitewashed clapboard building with a timbered roof and a tall brick chimneyno planters mansion this but no hovel either it all looks very fine henry im happy for you i still need a man with a good head for figures nate to keep me from having to do my own bookkeeping pleasants said you know id pay you better than your schoolteaching does hed made that offer the last time caudell came to the farm too as he had then caudell shook his head i like teaching school henry its not a line of work you get into for the money and besides id sooner be your friend than your hired man the one wouldnt leave out the other nate you know that all right but no thank you all the same caudell knew nothing of the sort as a teacher he worked for wages but was largely free in what he did and how he did it that suited his independent nature far better than sitting at a ledger with henry pleasants looking over his shoulder ever could a black man carrying a jar of whiskey and two glasses came out of the farmhouse thank you israel pleasants said i knew i hadnt seen you around the general store lately israel caudell said when did you start working for henry here twothree weeks ago suh the negro answered mistuh pleasants he pay as good as mistuh liles an he got mo books to read too now i learned how i surely do love to read suh that i do mistuh liles he fuss some when i go but it werent like he own me only trouble i have with israel is getting his nose out of a book when i need him for something pleasants said if i can teach him ciphering maybe i ii make him my bookkeeper nate since you dont want the job he spoke jocularly but then turned and gave israel a careful onceover maybe i will at that by god i wonder if he could learn israel do you want to try to learn arithmetic if you can do it it would mean more money for you i likes to learn suh an i likes money might well you want to show me reckon i try youre a hard worker israel maybe you will learn if you do you can keep books for a lot of people in town too you know not just for me pleasants said keep at it and youll end up with a fine house of your own one day caudell almost smiled at that but at the last minute kept his face straight it could happen thanks to the war things were looser these days than they ever had been a free negro sensible enough to stay out of trouble might come a long way without a lot of people noticing you want to show me suh reckon i try israel repeated i got no place better to go than here looks like is jus glad i didnt head noth when the bluecoats sail away by what the papers say its rougher bein a nigger up there than down herethey hangs you to a lamp post jus fo walkin down the street you might be right israel though im embarrassed to admit it pleasants said caudell nodded white men up north blame negroes for the war seems like savage antiblack riots had convulsed new york and philadelphia within days of each other as if word of one triggered the next in washington confederate pickets across the potomac watched federal troops battle arsonists intent on burning down the colored part of town and along the ohio river white men with guns turned away slaves fleeing across from kentucky saying this aint your countryand opened fire if the negroes would not go back southern papers reported every atrocity every upheaval in the united states in loving detail as if to warn blacks they could expect no warm reception if they ran away israel heaved a long sigh aint easy bein a nigger no matter where you is that caudell thought was no doubt true israel set down the whiskey jar and went back into the house caudell swigged from his glass he coughed got it down the fire in his throat fumed to warmth in his belly warmth that spread through him pleasants raised his glass heres to a freelabor farm a freelabor farm caudell echoed he drank again the warmth intensified he looked around the impression hed had as he walked up to the farmhouse persisted a freelabor farm thats doing right well for itself if the weather stays close to decent and prices hold up ill get by pleasants answered he was new to farming but seemed to have already picked up the man of the lands ingrained aversion to sounding too optimistic he went on by what the papers say weathers even worse farther south and west i hate to see anyone else hurt but it may help me how many hands do you have working for you seven menthree free blacks two irishmen i saw one of them in your vegetable patch caudel lowered his voice maybe you ought to know he ran off from my regiment who john did he pleasants frowned ill keep a close eye on him then though hes given me no trouble so far anyway i also have a couple of local white men here and tomhes one of the blacksbought his wife hattie free a couple of years ago and she does the cooking for us as if the words were a cue a long unmelodious horn blast sounded from the back of the house pleasants grinned theres dinner now come on nate dinnerfried ham sweet potatoes and corn breadwas served outdoors in back of the house behind the kitchen hattie a very large very brown woman seemed personally offended unless everyone who ate from her table stuffed himself until incapable of moving caudell was more than willing to oblige her happily replete he leaned back on his bench and joined in the byplay between pleasants and the farm hands besides john moring caudell also knew bill wells who had joined his company not long before the last years campaign started wells had been only eighteen then twenty now he still looked years younger you better not send me out to fill canteens mr first sergeant sir he said with a grin ill let henry here give you your fatigues now caudell retorted which made wells duck as if a bullet had cracked past him hatties husband tom israel and the other colored man whose name was joseph sat together they were quieter than the whites and took little part in the banter that flew around the rest of the tablethough at liberty free negroes had to be leery about taking liberties but when israel started boasting about how he was going to learn arithmetic tom raised an eyebrow and said if you de man who do my pay israel i gwine count it twice when i gits it an that a fac you couldnt even count it oncet nigger israel said loftily marse henry i know he pay me right tom said you his pause carried a world of meaning after a while henry pleasants looked at his pocket watch and said time to get back to it the workers got up and headed past the old overseers cabin toward the fields joseph reached out and snagged a sweet potato so he would have something to munch on ifunlikely as the notion seemed to caudellhe got hungry in the middle of the afternoon this is very fine henry caudell said as hattie cleared away the plates youve done well for yourself as usual instead of cheering pleasants the praise made him melancholy he sighed looked down at the planks of the table ran a hand through his dark wavy hair in a low voice he said if only sallie could see this farm sallie caudell peered at his friend in all the time hed known pleasants hed never heard him mention a womans name he tried to figure out why picked the most likely reason he could think of didnt she want to come south with you henry pleasants turned to stare at him the pain in his eyes told caudell at once that hed made a mistake she would have come anywhere with me butoh hell pleasants shook his head even now how hard this is we were married sallie and i just at the start of i would take oath we were the happiest couple in pottsville around christmas she would have borne my child would have caudell knew a sinking sensation gently he asked did you lose her in childbed henry i didnt even have her so long unshed tears glistened in pleasantss eyes she started to moangod such dreadful moans may i never hear againbefore dawn one october morning she blazed with fever the doctor lived only a couple of blocks away i ran through the darkness to his house fetched him back still in his nightshirt he did all he could i know that but salliesallie died the same day may she have gone to a better world as im sure she has the words felt flat and empty to caudell but he had none better to offer doctors could do so littlebut he wondered just for a futile moment if a rivington man could have saved her pleasants said she was a finer christian than i can ever hope to be so i am sure of it as well but it took four big strong miners to keep me from leaping into the grave after her without her the world was cold and empty and not worth living in after fort sumter my aunt emily asked if id ever thought of enlisting in the army i took her up on it she must have thought it would help me forget that was partly my reason i suppose caudell knew he had not finished what was the rest if you must know nate i hoped i would be killed what better way to be set free from my sorrow and pain and uselessness i lived as you see but you seemed a gift from god that day in rocky mount i seized on any excuse not to go back to pottsville as you may imagine whatever your reasons were for staying here in north carolina im glad you did life goes on its the oldest thing in the world to say but its true if nothing else can going through a war the size of ours will teach you that at camp the last night after gettysburg it was caudells turn to have trouble continuing so many friends had fallen in that futile charge but he and his fellow survivors had to carry on as best they could henry pleasants nodded i do know that but i know also that the words are easier to speak than to live moving on toward six years now that sallies gone yet the memory of her pierces me still i would have spoken of her to you before but he tightened his lips blew air out through them it still hurts im sorry i dont blame you as pleasants had before caudell waved to the fields and the fine farmhouse shed be proud of what you have here caudell hesitated wondering if he should say what had sprung into his mind he decided to and if she was like a lot of northern women i reckon shed be proud of the way youre running this farm with free labor too i thank you for that truly i do it cant have come easy not from a north carolina man but youre rightsallie was strong for abolition likely stronger than i was then i dont think i could have hoped to meet her in the world to come if id bought negroes to work this place caudell only grunted he reached for the whiskey jug more and more these days he leaned against slavery himself but he would not say that out loud not yet not even to a close friend who sprang from the north if word he had such notions ever got around he might be lucky to lose only his job he finished his drink then said show me the inside of the house why dont you id be glad to pleasants also emptied his glass then led caudell in through the open kitchen door hattie looked over her shoulder at him from the little tin tub in which she was washing the dishes the furniture in the big sitting room was countrymade and therefore cheap but looked comfortable low chairs and a sofa all with the seats of undressed calfskin handhewn shelves full of books lined one wall a washroom with a tin tub on feet and several storage rooms took up the rest of the ground floor bedrooms are upstairs pleasants said one for me one for israel who works more around the house than in the fields one for my irishmen and one for the two local boys hattie and tom and joshua sleep in the overseers cabin out back i think they find that very funny and very satisfying i know i would in their shoes there used to be a row of slave huts out there too ive knocked down every one of them its your farm henry do you get the work out of your people that an overseer could with a slave gang i certainly believe so given what some of my neighbors tell me they expect from their negroes the two irishmen are capital workers and the free blacks good enough the ones with whom ive had the greatest difficulty are the local white men if i may tell you that without causing offense ive had to let several of them go they will not work steadily for hire and think the very idea smacks of turning them into niggers as one of them said a lot of white folks in the south are like that caudell said if they have to work at tasks slaves normally do they feel as if they are slaves themselves but thats wrong dont you see pleasants said earnestly keeping slaves degrades all labor free and slave alike and theres nothing wrong with labor in itself but when even a good many of your artisans are slaves wheres the prod for a white man to learn a skill your rich planters here are very rich indeed ill not deny that for a moment but your poor are poorer than they are in the united states and have fewer choices open to them to improve their lot where is this country of yourscountry of mine now toogoing i dont think we worry so much about going somewhere as folks do up north caudell said most of us are just content to stay where we are throughout the war all we want is to be left alone had served as a confederate rallying cry but the world keeps changing whether you do or not pleasants pointed out you cant keep walls up foreverlook at admiral perrys trip to japan caudell made a wry face and held up his hand he suspectedhe was virtually certainhis friend was right that didnt mean he wanted to admit it or even to talk about it very much let us finish getting back on our feet after the war and well do pretty well for ourselves he insisted all right pleasants said pacifically seeing he had irked his friend still he did not abandon the argument the wars been over for a couple of years now nate and the worlds not in the habit of waiting josiah gorgass round face beamed like the sun i am truly delighted you could visit the armory on such short notice general lee when you sent word yesterday that you had something worthy of my consideration colonel i naturally made it a point to come investigate at once lee answered your performance both in the war and since gives me every confidence in your judgment your note however i found mysterious what precisely am i here to consider the confederate ordnance chief walked out of his office returned a moment later with a pair of repeating rifles these he said proudly he held one of them out to lee who took it and said i have become moderately familiar with the ak over the past couple of years and this his voice trailed away as he examined the weapon more closely when he spoke again it was without sarcasm this rifle appears different in certain small ways from those to which i have become accustomed what have we here colonel a copy of the ak manufactured here at the armory sir two copies as a matter of fact oh how excellent lee said softly he worked the charging handle of the rifle gorgas had given him the smooth welloiled sniick took him back to the tents northwest of orange court house and to the day he first heard that sound he looked along the barrel the confederate gunsmiths had substituted a simpler sight for the calibrated one which normally graced an ak have you tested these weapons as yet colonel yes sir gorgas said we have successfully duplicated the repeating action of their models when fired with cartridges furnished by the rivington men they also shoot about as accurately and with recoil similar to those models though trials have as yet been limited they appear sturdy enough his eyes flicked away from lee as he said that he remembered the cavalry carbines which had proven as dangerous to their users as to the enemy then have you tried firing them with the loads prepared down in augusta lee asked gorgas nodded again they served the flight path of the bullet is considerably higher with those loads and the recoil considerably increased the ordnance chief winced reminiscently and rubbed his right shoulder as a matter of fact when loaded with ordinary gunpowder the rifle kicks like a mule a minor defect lee said youve done marvelously well colonel gorgas not as well as id like to gorgas answered displaying the resolute perfectionism that suited him so well to his position for one thing try as i might ive not come close to matching the metal that goes into the barrel of the originals so far as i can tell it is as nearly indestructible as makes no difference the ones we turn out both foul mote and are more difficult to clean than their prototypes for another both the rifles you see here are almost entirely handmade not only is production very slow on account of that but parts from one weapon are not interchangeable with those of the other i presume you are working toward remedying this difficulty working toward it is the appropriate phrase sir i am endeavoring to tool up to produce aks as we did springfields but the going is slow we were aided immeasurably in turning out springfields by capturing the arsenal at harpers ferry and the tools it contained here i can gain no such advantage much as i love our country sir we have not been a manufacturing nation much of our industry such as it is was called into being by the exigencies of the late war gorgass face assumed the mournful expression of a bloodhound on a difficult track moreover the ak is a considerably more complex weapon requiring many more steps in its production than the rifles we are used to making by this time next year i expect to be producing it in some quantity how much earlier than that i can hope to turn it out remains to be seen lee considered what the ordnance chief had said it was not all he might have wished to hear the united states emphatically was a manufacturing nation second in the world after only great britain he had visions of huge factories in massachusetts or new yorkor massachusetts and new yorkmaking repeaters in carload lots but as gorgas said the south had been proudly agricultural until war and federal blockade forced it to try to make some of the things it could no longer buy with cotton and tobacco he supposed he should have been pleased with its progress not worried about how backward it remained he willed himself to be pleased since he had no other choice youve done splendidly colonel he said as enthusiastically as he could by all means convey my congratulations to your clever artisans i am glad to know we may one day be able to declare our independence from the men of america will break just as we have from the united states he wished that day would come at once but even seeing it ahead gave him no small relief given the reported deployment of the federal troops who have entered new mexico from colorado mr president i am convinced those troops are intended to lend moral support to the rebels in conflict with the mexican emperor maximilian as president seymour has publicly declared nevertheless i hope i might take the liberty of urging upon you the westward extension of railroads in texas so that we become more readily able to meet dangers which may arise from that quarter now that the tredegar iron works are producing track once more the prospect of such a line appears to me to be deserving of your most serious consideration you may perhaps recall secretary stantons contemptuous reference to our lack of any such means of transportation throughout the vast expanse of west texas i he looked up from the passage to gather his thoughts and discovered andries rhoodie standing across the desk from him the big rivington man had come into his office so quietly that hed failed to notice him do please be seated mr rhoodie he said embarrassed i hope ive not ignored you long no not long rhoodie said as he sat a man of lighter spirit might have eased the moment with a joke but rhoodie serious to the core made no such effort he paused only to rub at his reddish mustache for a moment before bulling ahead we of the awb are not pleased with you general lee this is not the first time such a misfortune has occurred mr rhoodie lee observed he watched rhoodie frown as if unsure whether he was being made sport of like general grant the rivington man had trouble going in any direction but straight on what have i done to raise your hackles this time you favor freeing the blacks here rhoodie said blunt still i was not aware my private opinions were your concern sir nor do i believe them to be so lee replied as against grant he essayed a flanking maneuver in any case how have you become privy to my opinions on the subject i have kept them private and certainly have not communicated them to you you have spoken of these opinions to patriotic officers who disagree with them as strongly as we do to nathan bedford forrest he meant lee worked that out with hardly a pause for thought the rough tennesseean had as much as said he was hand in glove with the rivington men lee wondered if hed said too much to forrest he decided he had not keeping his thoughts secret would have implied he was ashamed of them which he was not he said i repeat sir that my private opinions are not your concern if they stayed private i might agree with you rhoodie answered but everyone says you will be the one to succeed jeff davis and then your private opinions will be all too public they go square against everything we stand for my opinionmy private opinion general leeis that they go square against everything the confederacy stands for there obviously we disagree in a republic like the confederate states the people and their representatives will eventually be responsible for choosing between us rhoodie breathed hard through his nose so you do aim to run for president do you as hed told jefferson davis lee had no knowledge of politics no interest in politics but he also had no intention of permitting andries rhoodie to dictate to him he thought hed taught that to the rivington man in the aftermath of bealeton rhoodie though seemed hard to convince lee said and what if i do if you do general lee you will certainly never see another vial of nitroglycerine tablets as long as you livei promise you that rhoodie said this man would sooner see me dead than president lee thought with a slow surge of wonder he truly would but more even than that he wants to bend me to his will he looked steadily at andries rhoodie i have known for some years now that i am no longer a young man i am also a soldier no doubt i should be lying if i said death held no terror for me but i assure you most earnestly that whatever terrors it does hold are insufficient to make me deviate from my chosen course for the sake of your white pills i beg your pardon sir rhoodie said and startled lee by sounding completely sincere he went on of course i do not question your courage i took altogether the wrong tack to persuade you that your views are mistaken and i apologize for it very well lee still eyed rhoodie with suspicion but no more handsome apology could have been demanded on pain of meeting with pistols let me suggest something else the rivington man said after a short pause for thought now he made his bluntfeatured face as affable as he could and sweetened his voice your charming wife has long suffered from ailments beyond the power of the medicine of these times to cure that does not mean though that those ailments will stay incurable forever he was a good fisherman having dangled the bait in front of lee he fell silent and let him paint his own mental pictures mary free of pain mary hurrying toward him upright and happy and out of the prison of her wheeled chair mary whirling with him as an orchestra played a sprightly waltz had rhoodie spoken of mary before he crassly threatened with the nitroglycerine pills lee knew he would have been tempted as perhaps never before in his life he was more vulnerable through his family than through any danger aimed at himself for their wellbeing was more important to him than his own now he waited until his words were properly deployed before he committed them to battle you had better go mr rhoodie he felt fury like a fire inside him most men quailed from him when he let that anger show andries rhoodie however was an ironclad himself he scowled back at lee you think america will break will let you get by with your insolence forever because we tolerated you more than we should have back when the confederate states still had the north to beat we needed you then but now the confederacy is well established if you try to twist it out of its proper course america will break will break you and what in your doubtlessly omniscient opinion is our proper course pray tell the rivington man ignored the heavy sarcasm he answered as if the question were seriously meant the one for which you left the useless union of course to preserve the south as a place where the white man can enjoy his natural superiority over the nigger to show the world the truth of that superiority and at need to act in the future in concert with other nations to preserve it ah now we come down to it lee said you are saying that unless we serve as your obedient catspaws in some time to come we fail of our purposeour purpose to you that is mr rhoodie our reasons for leaving the united states were more complex than those you name and if we fought to gain our independence from them we shall do likewise as necessary against you and yours and i warn you sir that if you speak to me of this matter again i shall not be responsible for my actions now get out of my sight andries rhoodie stood up dug in his pocket and tossed an old worn half cent on the desk in front of lee this is how much i care for whether youll be responsible for your actions he tramped out of the office slammed the door behind him lee glared in shocked outrage had he been bedford forrest rhoodie never would have got out of mechanics hall alive but forrest and rhoodie were allies lees heart thudded heavily in his chest as had become his habit he reached for his pills he had the vial in his hand before he consciously noticed from whom it had come with an angry growl he put it back in his waistcoat pocket his first thought was better to die without the rivington men than live with their cures he wondered if that also held true for the confederacy as a whole he thought about it seriously then shook his head his nation deserved to be free for that matter how could a good and effective medicine be morally wrong no matter where it came from he took out the pills again let one melt under his tongue while he had them he would use them when they were gone he would do without as he had until the rivington men found their way into his life there that was one decision made he thought with some satisfaction as he replaced the nitroglycerine tablets once more one he said aloud then he realized that as in the heat of battle he had made up his mind without understanding how or even when hed done so he would seek the presidency next year that the men of america will break did not want him to have it was reason enough and more how are you tonight dear mary he asked in the quiet of their bedroom after hed helped her upstairs that evening down below mildred was playing the piano and singing with her sisters most nights he would have stayed down there and sung with them but his mind remained full of andries rhoodie i am as i amnone too well but very much here and how are you robert few people could have followed lees thoughts but after more than a third of a century his wife was one of them she went on something new is troubling you or i miss my guess while i have only my usual collection of aches and pains troubling me indeed as exactly as he could lee recounted the confrontation with rhoodie mary custis lee bristled indignantly when he told how the rivington man had promised to cut off his supply of pills lee could almost see her hair rise under her ruffled nightcap then he had to tell her rhoodie had offered to restore her health candlelight filled the lines of her face with deep shadows as she cocked her head to one side to study him slowly she asked could he havecured me robert i do not know he answered after a moment he reluctantly added i confess i have not known the rivington men to make false claims however big their brags they have a way of backing them up whatwhat did you tell him i told him to get out of my office and never come back lee said can you find it in your heart to forgive me for that his wife did not reply not right away instead she looked down at herself at the shrunken twisted legs that had once been so lively at the painfilled flesh that had imprisoned her spirit for so many years at last she said i am not surprised at it ive known all our lives together that you place your country ahead of everything else i understand that i am used it it i have taken it as an article of faith since the day you set the ring on my finger and i dare say before that then you do forgive me he said in glad relief i do not she answered sharply i understand i can even accept you would not be the man you are had you said yes to rhoodie i would no more have expected you to say yes than that the sun would shine green tomorrow but sometimes i wish you had even an ounce of bend in you do you want me to visit rhoodie in his headquarters he would receive me i think despite the harsh words that lie between us you say now that you would go to him her hands brushed the notion aside with a quick scornful gesture surely your precious duty would find some way of coming between the words and the deed he wanted to be angry at her for that cynical gibe but could not she was too likely right already he regretted his rash offer how could he sell the confederacy for the sake of one persons comfort even if that person was his wife he knew he could not and knew she would pay the price for his not doing so sighing he said i unfortunately belong to a profession that debars all hope of domestic enjoyment you have been wed to that profession and to your country longer and more deeply than ever to me mary custis lee said which was also true he said i am not necessarily wed to that profession forever his wife taking a wifely privilege laughed at him richmond virginia june sir i have the honour to tender the resignation of my commission as general in the army of the confederate states of america very resply your obt servt r e lee general csa lee sanded the letter dry looked down at the words he had written even in black ink on creamy white paper they did not yet seem real to him just as there was a moment of quiet shock before the pain of a wound struck home yet this resignation came easier than the one he had made six years before from the colonelcy of the st us cavalry then he had been cruelly divided in his own spirit wishing he could remain with the united states but knowing virginia in the end meant more to him now the confederacy was at peace its armies could carry on without him his course lay elsewhere he wished he could show the letter to his wife first to see her expression once shed read it after their goround of the night before her expression ought to be worth seeing but that was a diversion he would have to forgo he picked up the paper carried it down the hall secretary of war seddon looked up from the papers that crowded his own desk despite those papers he looked stronger and healthier than he had during the war when his labors all but consumed him even his smile was less cadaverous these days a good morning to you general what can i do for you i have here a letter which requires your attention sir give it to me then james seddon read the twoline note then raised his large head to stare at lee what has occasioned this if i am to meet my full responsibility to the confederate states of america mr secretary i must necessarily do so in and from a civilian capacity proceeding directly from the ranks of the military to any civil office strikes me as more appropriate to ancient rome than to our present republic civil office you say seddon studied lee then slowly nodded you will understand general that rumors pertaining to your possible plans for the future have been in wide circulation for some time now as with paper money so with rumors the wider the circulation the less value they retain lee said the secretary of war smiled his rather unnerving smile no doubt no doubt i certainly did not care to presume on our acquaintance to enquire of you your plans the more so as they may well have been unclear even to you i hope you will permit me to say however that i should be confident of our nations future in your hands you are gracious sir and place more trust in me than i deserve lee said seddon shook his head no doubt taking lees words for a commonplace of polite speech lee wished it were so thedisorderlyquality of civilian life and especially of civilian administration worried him the rivington men worried him more in war and peace he had tested himself against the ablest of his own time and had prevailed but how could he know all the resources the men from a distant time held in reserve he could not knowand he had made the men of america will break his enemies past hope of reconciliation as best he could tell he had earned the right to worry jefferson davis held a fortnightly levee at the confederate white house as lee rode traveller up twelfth street toward the presidential mansion he reflected that one day the place would need a name not derived from one in washington city the confederacy could not go on forever as a mere copy of the united states and its institutions the south would develop institutions of its own his lip quirked the south had one institution all its own and he hoped to begin the job of laying that one to rest lamps and candles blazed bright through the broad windows and open door of the presidential residence casting a warm golden glow on the walkway outside lee dismounted from traveller tied the horse to the iron fence outside the mansion gave him a nose bag full of hay traveller snorted appreciatively and began to eat i wish some people were so easily pleased lee murmured and went up the stairs and into the house varina davis met him near the door how good of you to join us this evening she said with a smile you are quite as handsome as ever in your dark civilian suit he bowed over her hand you are too kind to me mrs davis she was a pretty darkhaired woman some years younger than her husbandand also a good deal more outgoing without her the presidents levees would have been too austere to be worth visiting as it was the gatherings if not the most intellectual in the citythat distinction surely belonged to mrs stanards salonwere the most variegated with congressmen judges soldiers and officials of the administration mingled promiscuously with merchants preachers and simple citizens anxious to conduct business with jefferson davis or simply to see him and with ladies corresponding to all those types lee ran a hand down the sleeve of his black wool formal coat being out of military gray still seemed strange and unnatural as if he were parading through richmond in his underclothes he added i am also most pleased at how lovely you look out of black varina daviss eyes were shadowed for a moment as you will know what with the sad loss of your annie the passing of a child is hard to bear a little more than two years before her little son joe had fallen from some scaffolding and died the same day she and lee shared a few seconds of sad remembrance then she went on but life also calls to us and we must continue as best we can do come in i know my husband will be glad to see you the president stood by a table crowded with punch bowls and plates of fried chicken and ham baked potatoes and tall cakes with yellow icing standing with him a chicken leg in one hand and a glass in the other was stephen r mallory the secretary of the navy a tall heavily built man who resembled nothing so much as an anglosaxon version of judah p benjamin save that his jowly beardfringed face more usually bore frown than smile jefferson davis beckoned lee to him as lee approached the president said loudly i am confident that when my term expires sir i shall leave the nation in your capable hands silence spread outward as everyone present turned to stare at lee after his resignation richmond had buzzed with political rumors now all at once the gossip acquired solid flesha figure of speech almost inevitable when looking toward the rotund frame of secretary mallory lee knew his answer would gain similar weight he said if that be the will of the people i shall humbly accept it though conscious as always of my own shortcomings still in that public voice davis replied i am equally confident that the people observing your manifold virtues will think as highly of them as do i and as they assuredly merit by then lee was close by as he dipped out a glass of lemonade davis reverting to normal tones said to mallory you see how it is done mr secretaryno vulgar party politics such as first forced us to abandon the united states and then left that unhappy nation divided against itself will mar our republics smooth transition from one chief magistrate to the next our states do seem more united in purpose than those which claim that title mallory had a big bass voice lee in a moment of irrelevant irreverence wondered if it was because he was shaped like a big bass fiddle the secretary of the navy went on i can see no issue which would divide our happy confederation he tossed aside the gnawed chicken bone piled ham and potatoes onto a plate and poured gravy over both i see one lee said jefferson daviss features always thin and dyspeptic pinched further as if at some sudden new gastric pang it will not be an issue if you do not choose to make it one he said it will lee answered sooner or later it will return to haunt us how could it do otherwise i would sooner engage the problem at a time of my own choosing than let it grow to crisis strength and overwhelm us you may wear a simple suit sir but you still speak like a soldier mallory said though pompous he was also keen you have grown dissatisfied with our treatment of our negroes have you not i recall it was at your urging that we sent the alabama to join the antislavery patrol off the west african coast many of the souths best men have long been dissatisfied with slavery too many have chosen to keep that dissatisfaction to themselves lee said i do not believe we can afford to do so any longer as for the alabama i am glad we had it to send so no doubt is captain semmes mallory replied the alabama had been in cherbourg harbor with the uss kearsarge a much more formidable vessel waiting just outside french territorial waters for it to emerge when word came of the fall of washington and the armistice they might well disagree with you about slavery even in the united states general lee jefferson davis said their constitutional amendment to abolish it just went down to defeat in the illinois legislature despite the vociferous protests of mr lincoln his voice took on a certain satisfaction at his wartime rivals discomfiture only two us states outside new england have ratified that amendment and only one since seymour became president but slavery is now legal in only two of their states maryland and delaware and is moribund in the latter lee saidfurther the negro constitutes but a tiny fraction of their population which is emphatically not the case with us thus he presents them a smaller problem and allows them to confront it more nearly at their leisure you know we disagree on this question still i shall not lose sleep over it davis said for one thing i may be wrong the negroes in the union army and the guerrillas who remained on our soil after the federal withdrawal proved themselves capable of deeds more manly than i would have expected from their race for davis to admit he might be wrong was very nearly a prodigy his mouth thinned as he weakened that admission by continuing for another believe as you may you will have your hands full in getting congress to accede to your wishes you will have your hands full in getting congress to do anything at all his own battles with the legislative branch though milder now than during the crises of the second american revolution left him with a permanently jaundiced perspective on its utility lee frowned as he contemplated that aspect of government in actionor perhaps of government inaction as a commanding general he could give orders and feel sure they would be obeyedand if they were not he had the power to punish those who failed in their duty but the president of a republic like the confederate states of america could not rule by fiat if congress refused to go along with him he was stymied as if reading his thoughts jefferson davis reached up to put a hand on his shoulder take heart sir take heart while we have as yet no political parties in the confederacy our congress was and is most definitely divided into factions favoring and in opposition to myself but so far as i know no faction opposed to robert e lee exists within the bounds of our nation not after the extraordinary services he has rendered to it if he speaks in any way against the continued servitude of the black man such a faction will spring to life soon enoughhe is right about that stephen mallory said true lee said thinking that an antilee faction in the persons of nathan bedford forrest and the men of america will break was already very much alive well if i fail of election on that account i shall return to the bosom of my family without any great anguish i wasted too large a part of my life away from them i shall not dissemble for the sake of votesi leave such ploys as you said mr president to politicians in the north davis raised his glass in salute long may those ploys remain there lee and mallory drank with him julia came up to lee in the study scuse me marse robert but theres a soldier here to see you a soldier lee said julia nodded lee gave a whimsical shrug having resigned from the army i thought i would henceforth be free of soldiers the black freedwoman looked back in incomprehension lee got up from his chair thank you julia of course i shall see him the soldier proved to be a pinkcheeked second lieutenant who looked so young that lee wondered if he could possibly have seen service in the late war when he saw lee he went into a brace so stiff that lee feared for the integrity of his back bone general lee sir i have a letter here sir which the secretary of war directed me to deliver into your hands sir thank you very much lieutenant lee said accepting the envelope the youngster in gray proffered after extending his hand to give it to lee the lieutenant returned to attention you may go lee told him no sir i am directed to wait and bring your reply if any to the secretary i see very well lee broke the seal on the envelope it held not one but two letters the first folded around the second the outer sheet was in james seddons copperplate script my dear general lee in view of the political developments centering on your name which have of late occasioned so much gossip and so many wildly speculative stories in the richmond papers and in view of the rumored estrangement between yourself and general forrest on the one hand and between yourself and america will break on the other i send you the enclosed so you may act upon it as you see fit and as the times demand i have the honor to remain your most obt c james a seddon lee opened the inner sheet the handwriting and spelling on that one both left something to be desired nathan bedford forrests formal schooling had lasted only a few months but the import of the letter was clear enough forrest was resigning his commission in the confederate army his last sentence explained why if genl lee thinks he will be come the presadent with the job handed him on a silver platter he wrote genl lee can think again lee read forrests letter several times shook his head as far as he could see the south had just acquired political parties jefferson davis would not be pleased he was not pleased himself the young lieutenant asked shall i take any message back to the secretary of war sir eh lieutenant you may convey to mr seddon my gratitude but past that no i have no message xiv raeford liles bustled about inside his general store straightening a bolt of cloth here scratching out a price and writing in a new one there he muttered under his breath as he worked some of the mutters were sulfurous since israel went off to work for henry pleasants he hadnt found anyone who suited him as an employee nate caudell slapped a wooden pocket comb on the counter he glanced at the low stack of threedayold raleigh constitutions there looks as though you were right mr liles he said liless head poked up between a couple of woven straw fans right about what he asked when he saw caudell looking down at the newspapers he scowled this aint a library you know you want to read that you can buy it all right i will caudell lifted the top paper set it by the comb you were right about having general forrest to vote forit says here he is going to run for president good for him liles said hell keep the niggers in line if anybody can way things seem sometimes nowadays the north might as well have won the war i dont know caudell read further anybody who calls robert e lee a traitor to the ideals that form the basis of our republic is crazy and nothing else but without robert e lee the north would have won the war and we wouldnt be here arguing now you know i never had a bad thing to say about robert e lee liles answered and caudell had to nod for that was true the storekeeper continued but from what i hear lee is makin noises about lettin all the niggers go free an if the war wasnt about slavery then just what the hell was it about slavery was a big part of it sure enough caudell admitted but it wasnt the whole reason for the war besides from all ive read lees not talking about freeing all the slaves at once i agree with you anybody who did that would be out of his mind but the yankees turned too many niggers loose for us ever to get em all back youve said as much yourself it makes me think we cant keep em all in bonds forever raeford liles grunted you been listenin to that damnfool yankee friend o yours too much might could be you ought to go north your own self dont you call me a yankee caudell said hotly youd better not call henry a damnfool either not when you look at the crop his farm brought in what with too little water and then too much had been a hard year all through the south but pleasants with his engineering knowledge got his crops enough water in the dry times and not too much in the wet and sent enough tobacco and corn to market to make himself the envy of his neighbors liles grunted again well all right maybe he aint a damnfool but i aint fond o no smart yankees neitherwhat business does he have down here anyways making a living same as you or me caudell could not quite keep from remembering that henry pleasants was making a much better living than he was and a better living than raeford liles too but pleasants was his friend so he went on stoutly he could have gone back to pennsylvania after the war was over but he chose to stay down here and become part of our new country instead if he was as fine as you make him out to be nate hed walk across stony creek outen gettin his feet wet oh horseshit hes no more the second coming than he is a devil with a pointy tail the way you paint him caudell tossed coins some federal some confederate down on the counter stuck the comb in his pocket and walked out of the general store with the newspaper the closing door cut off liless reply in midword he suspected henry pleasants would remain a yankee in the eyes of nash county until the sexton shoveled dirt down onto his coffin if he ever married again whatever offspring he had would likely be labeled the yankees brats their children might escape the taint of northern originor might not nash county was a clannish place one column of the raleigh constitution was labeled events of interest from foreign parts he read a report from montevideo dated october six weeks old now he thought on the south american war between paraguay and all its neighbors closer to home the mexican forces of the emperor maximilian stiffened by a couple of brigades of french troops had inflicted another defeat on the republican army led by juarez caudell nodded in some satisfaction at thatmaximilians government remained friendly to the confederacy the next foreign item came from washington that still sometimes struck him as odd he half expected it to be a protest from president seymour against the aid the french were giving maximilian but it was just the opposite the report said that most of the us troops in the new mexico and arizona territories were being withdrawn seymour had in fact issued a protest but to the government of great britain for increasing its garrisons in the canadas adding those two items together caudell smelled war brewing he wondered when it would boil over from his own experience against the yankees he thought england was about to get a nasty surprise a drop of rain smacked the dirt street in front of him then another one still another hit the brim of his black felt hat he hurried back toward the widow bissetts glad the rain wasnt snow his head turned at a colorful broadside freshly pastedit hadnt been there when he went to the general storeon a fence along alston street save the confederacyvote for forrest the poster exclaimed in big letters below that legend was a picture of the stalwart cavalry leader rain or no he paused to stare at the broadside the election was eleven months away hed never heard of starting a campaign so early he trotted on scratching his head a couple of houses farther down the street he discovered another political poster this one besides forrests picture bore a fourword slogan forresthit em again he passed several more such sheets by the time he got to his room he wondered how many he had not seen how many had been stuck up all over town to make sure everybody saw at least one he wondered how many towns like nashville the confederacy held and how many of those had been similarly broadsided he wondered how much all that had cost nathan bedford forrest was supposed to be rich if he campaigned on this scale till november he would need to be richer than caudell thought he was when he passed a broadside partly protected by an overhanging roof he paused for a closer look under forrests hard but handsome features appeared a line of small type prepared by van pelt printers rivington north carolina caudell studied that for a couple of minutes before he went on if the rivington men were working with forrest he would have all the money he needed from an upstairs window in arlington lee looked across the potomac toward washington dc smoke curled up from hundreds from thousands of chimneys rising to the true clouds and also turning to a dirty gray the smoke that blanketed the city lees mood was a dirty gray too bedford forrest is a very devil he said throwing a copy of the richmond examiner down onto a tabletop he makes political hay merely by noting where this place is he picked up the paper again read no wonder general lee chooses to reside only a stones throw from the heart of yankeedom his ideas show him to be a yankee himself in gray clothing let him say whatever he wants mary custis lee answered now that my dear home has been made habitable once more i would live nowhere else i always felt myself an uprooted plant in richmond i know that my dear nor did i protest when you wanted to remove here lee answered for one thing he knew such protest would have done no good with her mind once made up his wife was harder to drive from a position than any federal general for another he had not imagined nathan bedford forrest could turn his choice of residence against him union commanders had underestimated forrest throughout the war and paid for it again and again lee was beginning to wonder if he and all of official richmond had not made the same mistake who would have thought a roughandready planter with no education to speak of would prove so effective on the stump and who would have imagined he would prove as energetic in political campaigning as in military he fairly flew from town to town made his speeches and was gone on the next train to make another one seventyfive miles down the track lee thought of the shock andrew jackson had created in washington after almost half a century of wellbred presidents from virginia and massachusetts the frontier might seize the confederate capital much sooner mary lee said help me up please robert he got her to her feet on his arm she went over to the window too she however looked not across the potomac toward washington but down at the grounds of arlington she nodded as if pleased with herself the snow hides them and it is not all them lee asked the graves of the yankees who died here grass and flowers in the summertime snow in the winter and i can begin to forget those cursed northerners who lie on our grounds that is not easy not after they did everything in their power to debase and desecrate arlington the ones who lie here were not those who hurt this place lee said the thieves the mutilators are most of them safe in the united states he still did not feel easy about letting her replant the sloping lawns and the gardens around arlington to erase all remembrance of the union graves but in the end had let her have her way she cherished the mansion as if it were part of her family which in a way it was she said i wish they could be made to answer for their crimes the garden my father laid out all ruined and changed the splendid little forest leveled to the ground the gravesthe graves at least i have attended to many crimes committed in time of war go unanswered lee said and as for their perpetrators they now live in another country which was after all the point of the war nor are we guiltless of crimes of our own thinking of forrest made the affair at fort pillow spring to mind he shook his head that had been a bad business with soldiers black and white mostly black shot down as they tried to surrender and after they had surrendered the only thing forrest had to say about it now was his familiar dictum war means fighting and fighting means killing mary lees comment was i think it is shameful for you to speak of our gallant men and the thieving yankees in the same breath through a good part of the war our gallant men kept themselves supplied by thieving from the yankees he said she waved that aside as if it were of no account she of course had never been in the field never known firsthand the desperate want under which the southern fighting man had suffered till the last days of the war she went on i think it is shameful too for general forrest to try to tar you with the yankee brush you did so much more than he to make our nation free and now he calls you abolitionist to be just it is what i seem to have become he felt mary take a deep breath decided to forestall her oh not in the sense he means surely the sense of imposing emancipation by force if necessary and without compensation as those people did in the lands they occupied but we must find a means through which the negro may be gradually brought toward freedom or face trouble unbounded in the future his wife sniffed how do you propose to gradually free the negroes either they are slaves as they have been or they are not i see no middle ground i shall have to define one lee said normally the middle ground was as dangerous politically as in war for it left one vulnerable to fire from both sides here though he would at least be safe from that outandout abolitionists in the northern radical sense of the word were so thin on the ground in the confederacy that he could probably count them on his fingers and toes all the fire his way would come from a single direction from those who thought owning blacks only right and proper but fire from a single direction could be deadly too hed seen that in defeat and victory at malvern hill fredericksburg gettysburg bealeton i wish we could have simply lived out our days here without worry about either war or politics mary said you have given so much robert can there never be an end to it i wish there could he meant it hed never known how much he truly missed his family until for the first time in his life he saw them every day the life of a gentleman farmer at arlington would have suited him very well buti fear i cannot so easily abandon my duty that word mary lee made a sour face help me back to my chair now if you please i would not want you to try your strength too long by the necessity of supporting me and your duty both he did as she asked then returned to the window a moving black dot in the snow became a horseman and a moment later a horseman he recognized heres custis up from richmond he said deliberately trying to sound cheerful and hoping the arrival of their eldest son would help lift mary out of her bitter mood she was at least willing to change the subject take me downstairs she said he pushed the chair to the stairs then helped her down them another chair waited at the bottom on the stairway procuring a second had proved easier and more convenient than manhandling a single one up and down several times a day and mary was almost helpless by herself now the offer andries rhoodie had given lee was seldom far from his thoughts if only it had come from somewhere anywhere other than america will break custiss three sisters were already greeting him by the time lee and mary came to the front hall between hugs custis stamped snow onto the rug sisterly embraces arent warm enough to thaw me out he said whereupon mildred poked him in the ribs and made him jump let me sit by the fire and warm up then ill tell my news and what is that news dear boy lee asked a few minutes later after custis was comfortably ensconced in a caneback chair in front of the crackling fireplace his son waited to reply until he took a cup of coffee from the tray julia brought in thats the real bean he said once hed sipped id grown so used to chicory during the war and afterwards that sometimes i find myself missing it he drank again set the cup down on a small square table ornamented around the edges with polished brass tack heads at last he said general forrest has settled on a runningmate has he lee leaned forward in his own chair who is the individual so honored another western mansenator wigfall of texas i see after a few seconds consideration lee said musingly it is as well then that the election is not to be settled by pistols at ten paces both forrest and wigfall are accomplished duelists while i would not hesitate to face either gentleman my skill in such matters has never been tested and i would not lightly hazard a vicepresidential candidate in such an affair custis chuckled but quickly sobered you ought to get about the business of choosing a vicepresidential candidate father when forrest announced his candidacy against you i took it for little more than a joke but the man is in deadly earnest sir and is campaigning as hard as he drove his own troops which is to say very hard indeed from everything i have ever heard and from everything i have ever seen anyone who underestimates general forrests energy or resolve is but preparing himself to be dreadfully surprised lee said had he the education to accompany them he might well have been the greatest of us all that is by the way however i do now admit to regretting the absence of political parties among us having such structures in place would have facilitated my selection of a colleague i intend to deal with the matter soon dear boy and your telling me that forrest had done so but fortifies my resolve he has a party as well custis answered he and his henchmen are styling themselves patriots and working to enlist other office seekers to run under their banner you will also no doubt have learned by now that he has the monetary support of america will break for his campaign the building across the street from the war department doubles as his richmond headquarters were i a man to shoot a messenger for the news he brought son you would do well to run for your life lee said i have always shunned politics soldiers in a republic can properly pursue no other course when i agreedreluctantlyto run for the presidency i expected the election to be a matter of form but i never undertook a campaign in which i did not expect to prevail nor do i aim to make this one the exception his son nodded approvingly that pleased him but only in an abstracted way his mind was full of what he would have to do to win up until a few minutes before he had been doing his best to think like a politician as that was not his forte no wonder hed had little luck now he resolved to do what he did best think like a soldier and treat forrest as an adversary like mcclellan or grant his hand went up to the collar of his jacket it was a plain civilian coat of black wool but he imagined he felt the familiar wreathed stars of a general once more he got up from his chair back to richmond he said i have work to do early fireflies winked on and off like shooting stars brought down to earth nate caudell tried to recapture his childhood glee at seeing them he did his best but could not quite manage it the little bugs reminded him too much of muzzle flashes in the dark in any case the fireflies were not the only beacons in the night caudell stood on washington street watching the torchlight parade stream into the nashville town square decked out in gray hoods the paraders sang the bedford forrest quickstep as loud as they could he chased the niggers and they did run he chased the niggers and he gave em the gun hit em again hit em again hit em againforrest henry pleasants stood beside caudell he said you know what these trees of forrest remind me of nate whats that you wont like it pleasants warned caudell gestured impatiently pleasants said they remind me of lincolns wideawakes in all dressed up in whats almost a uniform all full of piss and vinegar for their man and all ready to stomp on anyone who doesnt like him and because theyre excited they make other people excited too we didnt have any of those wideawakes down here caudell said come to that lincoln wasnt even on the ballot down here maybe not but somebody in the patriot camp must have been paying attention to the way he ran his campaign remember he won that race too even if he wasnt on the ballot anywhere in the south are you saying that means forrest will win too itd take more than a fancy parade to get me to vote for anybody but robert e lee and that goes for anybody who served in the army of northern virginia but not everybody in the country did serve in the army of northern virginia me id sooner vote for lee than forrest any day but what do i know im just a damnyankeeask my neighbors at the tail end of the parade marched a big man thumping a bigger drum the watching crowd spilled into the street and followed him into the square in front of the courthouse the same platform that had served for the slave auction was up again three or four of forrests trees stood atop it torches held on high more crowded close so the platform was far and away the brightest place in the square one of the hooded trees shouted heres his honor the mayor the rest of the group hollered and clapped as isaac cockrell clambered to the top of the platform he was not an old man he was in fact several years younger than caudell but he was short and fat and rather wheezy among the stalwart trees he cut an unprepossessing figure my friends he said and then again louder my friends the crowd kept right on chattering caudell cupped hands to his mouth yelled hire a substitute cockrell the mayor had bought his way out of the th north carolina a couple of months before gettysburg and stayed prosperously at home while the regiment did its desperate work caudell was not the only man who remembered several other veterans whooped in gleeful derision at his cry isaac cockrell flinched but quickly gathered himself my friends he said yet again and this time was able to go on from there my friends were here tonight to show we all want nathan bedford forrest to be the next president of our confederate states of america forrests trees raised a cheer so did a good many men and women in the crowd the women of course could not vote but they enjoyed a rousing political spectacle no less than their husbands and brothers fathers and sons but caudells was not the only voice that shouted nofar from it to drown out their opponents the trees started singing the bedford forrest quickstep again henry pleasants knew the answer to that lee he boomed making his voice as deep as he could lee lee lee caudell joined the oneword chant so did the other lee menmost of them veterans like him their cry rose to rival the bawled out quickstep raeford liles was singing forrests anthem at the top of his lungs he saw that caudell belonged to the other camp you look like nothin but a stupid damn tree frog nate hunchin up your shoulders every time you chirp out lee id sooner look like a tree frog than have the brains of one caudell retorted liles stuck out his tongue caudell said who looks froggy now having launched into his speech mayor cockrell kept on with it through the hubbub though for some time no one except perhaps the trees up on the platform with him could hear a word he was saying just as well caudell thought but gradually backers of forrest and lee both quieted down enough to get bits of the mayors speech do you want your niggers taken away from you if you do vote for lee sure enough vote for forrest though and your childrenll still keep em and your grandchildren too what niggers a heckler yelled from the back of the crowd i aint got no niggers most of us aint got no niggersaint got the money for it how many niggers you got cockrell that hit home hard enough to make the mayor draw back a pace he owned about half a dozen negroes which while it did not make him a planter certainly established him as welltodo he rallied gamely though even if you dont own any niggers do you want them free to work for low wages lower than a white man would take the hecklercaudell suddenly grinned recognizing dempsey eures voicewould not be stilled cant hardly work for lessn i make farmin the place i farm cockrells argument might have carried more force in a bigger town a place where more people did in fact work for wages but nash county was overwhelmingly rural even by the standards of north carolina tied to the soil as they were its people had scant experience with wages of any sort high or low seeing their speaker falter forrests trees started singing again by then their torches were guttering out letting the square return to night caudell and the other lee backers answered the quickstep with their own call both groups though were running out of steam by ones and twos people began drifting away sometimes in low voices they carried on their arguments sometimes away from the heat of the rally they found themselves able to laugh at how stirred theyd gotten caudell said its still early spring well all be done to a turn if this kind of thing keeps up till november keeps life from getting dull doesnt it pleasants answered as he walked back toward the stable to get his horse i suppose so caudell walked on another few steps with his friend then added wistfully i remember when life was dull or i thought it was anyway you know what looking back it doesnt seem so bad lee had been waiting for the knock on the door of the suite at the powhatan house he got up and opened the door senator brown he said extending his hand thank you for doing me the honor of coming here the honor is mine sir albert gallatin brown of mississippi was a strikingly handsome man in his early fifties with dark wavy hair worn rather long and bushy sidewhiskers that reached down to the line of his jaw his suit was of the most stylish cut a good deal more so than lees his patent leather shoes gleamed in the gaslight do please sit down lee said waving him to a chair brown sank back into the soft cushions crossed his legs lay one arm on the velvet arm of the seat he seemed the picture of ease lee envied him his ability to relax so completely you are perhaps curious as to why i asked if you would see me today call meintrigued browns dark eyes shadowed in their sockets revealed very little he was a veteran politician having served in the mississippi state legislature in the us congress and as a us senator alongside jefferson davis until his state left the union hed also fought as a confederate captain before he was chosen for the new nations senate lee said my purpose is not to keep you in suspense sir i want to ask if you will serve as my vicepresidential candidate for the forthcoming elections browns relaxation dropped from him like a cloak he leaned forward in his seat said softly i thought it might be so even to be considered as your running mate does me more credit than i deserve not at all sir but brown had not finished yet before i say yea or nay there are certain matters concerning which i must satisfy myself he waited to see how lee would take that lee was delighted if my views are in any way unclear to you i would not have you blindly embrace them ask what you will thank you sir brown dipped his head in one way your invitation to me is surprising for i perceived you as being president daviss chosen successor and as you may know the president and i have not always been in complete accord that was an understatement while willing to do whatever proved necessary to win the war brown had consistently maintained war powers resided with the confederate congress not with the president he obviously remembered the angry exchanges hed had with davis had it not been for the presidents urging i should not have sought the presidency that i admit lee said i could hardly deny iti was never struck with political ambition nor do i feel it now to any great degree but if you doubt i am my own man then i thank you for your time here today and apologize for having inconvenienced you i will discuss the position with someone else no need brown said quickly holding up a hand he had political ambition you are quite clear indeed the fact that you have asked me says a great deal for your independence from davis in and of itself but the next question cuts to the bone what precisely is your stand on the negro and his place in our society i do not believe we can successfully keep him in bonds forever and so i feel we must begin the process of lifting those bonds as quickly as is practicable lest he tear them off himself and in so doing work far more harm upon us if you find that position untenable sir the door is but a few steps away brown did not get up and leave but he did not sing hosannas in praise of lees generosity either he said let me quote for you article one section nine clause four of the constitution of the confederate states no bill of attainder ex post facto law or law denying or impairing the right of property in negro slaves shall be passed i am familiar with the clause lee said that it is an impediment to what i propose i cannot deny let me ask you a question in return if i may he waited for brown to nod before continuing suppose the war instead of turning in our favor in had taken a downhill course as it might well have done without our troops being newly armed with repeaters would you then have favored giving weapons to and emancipating certain of our slaves in order to preserve our republic the constitution notwithstanding in such a crisis i would brown said after only a brief pause for thought saving the nation is to me more important than any temporary damage to the constitution which can be made good later if the nation survives fair enough i submit to you then that the negro as slave presents us with a continuing crisis even if one less imminent than the prospect of forfeiting the second american revolution the time to deal with it is before it becomes imminent lest we be forced to act in haste and perhaps desperation brown pondered that then startled lee by throwing back his head and laughing at lees quizzical look he explained rather sheepishly i marvel that i am sitting here listening to you at all let alone carefully considering your ideas when in the us congress i called for opening california to slavery by force of arms if necessary and for the annexation to the united states of cuba and the mexican states of tamaulipas and potosí to serve for the planting and spreading of slavery yet here you sit lee said from browns words and votes in the confederate senate he had gathered that the man was moderate on the question of the negro he had not thought to go back and learn what brown had said as a us congressman and senator that evidently had been an oversight on his part he wondered why the man did not rise up on his hind legs and storm out as nathan bedford forrest and andries rhoodie had before him in like circumstances here i sit brown agreed he laughed again circumstances alter cases when we were part of the united states we had to seek to extend slavery wherever we might to balance the corresponding expansion of the northern states and our consequent loss of power within the us but now we are no longer within the us and may act as we deem best without fear it will weaken us before our political foes that is most sensibly spoken sir lee said with admiration then you are with me i have not said so brown answered sharply i concede there may be circumstances under which some form of emancipation is justified we must however offer the voters a program they can stomach or all this fine talk is so much moonshine how do you propose to go about setting the niggers free in a word gradually lee said i have i hope you will believe given this a good deal of thought i do not and shall not propose confiscatory legislation i understand that would be politically impracticable i hope you do brown said if you dont get elected nothing else matters again lee longed for the clean welldefined world of the soldier where compromise had to be made only with weather and terrain and what the enemy would allow not with ones own principles but the politician who could bring home half a loaf counted himself ahead of the game i do not wish slavery to become the sole issue in this campaign lee said many others are of no small urgency our relations with the united states the still deplorable state of our finances and our posture relative to maximilian and the mexican insurgents to name just a few we have yet even to establish a supreme court on none of these matters has forrest expressed a position he owns but one drum to beat a good point and one we can tax him with but none of those save maybe what we do about the united states will make people sweat theyll get up in arms over the nigger question you still need to answer me about that so i do lee said as i see it as a beginning we need to encourage emancipation in every way possible and to prepare freedmen to learn useful trades during the war several of our states relaxed their laws against slaves learning to read and write i would extend that relaxation throughout the confederacy for the next step i would propose a law allowing a slave or anyone else on behalf of that slave to pay for his release at the price for which he had been sold or was valued by a competent appraiser the owner not having the privilege of refusing said price albert gallatin brown pursed his lips you might get by with that not least because it is so much less radical than what hotheads on the other side say you want i have not finished lee warned brown sat back and composed himself to listen further if a slave or someone who wished to buy his freedom could not pay the whole price at once i would let them pay one sixth the master again being compelled to accept to give the slave one day to work for himself each week another free day being added for each sixth paid until the slaves labor is entirely his own that goes farther but is again reasonable and certainly not confiscatory brown said the plan is modeled after one proposed but unfortunately not accepted some years ago in the empire of brazil lee said since i became convinced of the necessity of this change i have sought intently for ways to facilitate it my former aide charles marshall whose training is in the law recently brought the brazilian proposal to my notice to it i would add a couple of additional features which are brown asked first i would take a small percentage of the property tax paid into the treasury on slaves each year and use it to establish an emancipation fund to free or begin freeing as many negroes as this revenue would permit and second i would propose a law to the effect that all negroes born after a certain date should be reckoned freeborn though owing service to their mothers masters for the first twentyone years of their lives in which time they should also be prepared to live free i have in mind you see not to murder slavery but to let it peacefully die of old age ten years ago in charleston or mobile or vicksburg theyd have hanged you from a lamp post for putting forward a scheme like that brown remarked he ran a finger along the bottom edge of a sidewhisker as he thought finally he said weve all seen a great many surprising things these past ten years havent we all right general lee im with you splendid lee stuck out his hand sir we are confederates browns gaze suddenly turned inward not just confederates he said quietly but confederates lee could hear the capital letter falling into place brown went on i think youve just named our party confederates lee tasted the word on his tongue he said it again firmly and nodded confederates we are the fiddler and banjo player swung from ye cavaliers of dixie to stonewall jacksons way to mister heres your mule hearing the old war songs again took nate caudell back to campfires and sore feet and the smell of powder nothing made a man feel so intensely alive as knowing he might not be alive much longer when the musicians played dixie that remembered intensitycherished all the more now that it was gonefilled him too full to let him keep on singing as he had been doing from somewhere deep inside him a rebel yell clawed its way up his throat and out between his teeth it was not a sound that properly belonged in the sleepy peaceful nashville town square but he did not care he had to let it loose or burst nor was his the only yell that ripped through the afternoon most of the men in the crowdalmost an the men under fortyfive in the crowdwere veterans of the second american revolution and most of them by their faces by their shouts were as caught up in their memories as he was a hat sailed through the air then another the last sweet notes of dixie died away the banjo man and fiddler got down from the flagdraped platform george lewis climbed up onto it caudell found himself coming to attention and had to fight back a sudden sharp order to the people around him to straighten their ranks then he saw a good many other men especially those who had fought in the castalia invincibles under captain lewis were also squaring their shoulders and bringing their feet together but lewis was not wearing a captains three bars these days only the wing collar and cravat that befit a prosperous civilian and legislator the collar fit snugly too he had to have gained twenty or thirty pounds in his time down in raleigh noticing that made caudell smile anyone who hadnt put on weight since his army days wasnt half trying lewis said my friends i dont even know that we needed to get together here today so many of us marched under marse robert fought under marse robertwe an know what hes like is there anybody here from the army of northern virginia whos such a big fool that he doesnt aim to vote for robert e lee come november no caudell shouted so did most of the men around him carried away by the moment several women called no too but most was not all just as caudell had heckled isaac cockrell at the forrest rally so now someone bellowed i aint gonna vote for nobody who wants to take my niggers away cockrell had tried to go on as if no one were harassing him george lewis met his challenger headon peering into the crowd to see who had shouted at him he said jonas perry you are a big fool that raised a laugh lewis went on for one thing everybody here knows those three niggers of yours dont do a lick of work anyway so theyd be no great loss to you the laugh got louder whenever he was in town perry spent most of his time complaining about how lazy his slaves were lewis grew serious anyhow lee doesnt aim to take away anybodys niggers thats a damned lie he dont want us to keep em no more neither jonas perry yelled back how we gonna get our crops in without em you mr big assemblyman george lewis sir you got a lot more niggersn me how you aim to get your crops in without em lewis hesitated the crowd muttered caudell started to worry if a rally went wrong a lot of votes could go wrong too he looked around like him a lot of people stood tensely waiting to hear what george lewis would say along with the whites he also saw several colored men and women in the square they were not part of the rally they had work to do but whatever they were doing they had their heads turned toward the platform or which some of them had been sold all at once caudell realized the election in which they could not take part mattered more to them than to him or george lewis or any white man he would merely be dissatisfied with the results if lee lost while they would have any hope of liberty dashed for at least six years almost too late lewis answered jonas perry jonas if i said i liked the whole of lees plan id be a liar but the way i look at it is this sometimes holding on to a thing just for the sake of holding on to it gets to be more trouble than its worth bedford forrest did everything he could to whip the niggers in arms and make them stop fighting but you still read about bush whackings and murders in louisiana and arkansas and mississippi in the papers all the time and tennesseethe yankees sat on tennessee for two years and turned every nigger in the state loose near enough theres not a prayer of getting them all back with their proper masters there hells bells man you know half the free niggers and then some right here in north carolina were slaves before the yankees came down on the coast im not asking you to like it im asking you if its true is it yes but perry said this time lewis interrupted him but me no buts the niggers who are uppity cant run north anymore either now that were free of the united states they dont want our riffraff we always said we hated niggers running off but it was a kind of safety valve for us now were stuck with all of em and the valves tied down do you want it to blow do you want to see santo domingos all through the south you think im crazy perry said hoarsely caudell understood the catch in his voice to a southerner santo domingo carried the same frisson of horror as violation did to a delicately reared woman slave uprisings slave massacres had always been rare and tiny in the south but all whites knew admit it or no that a great rebellion could always happenand tens of thousands of black men had learned to handle firearms in the course of the second american revolution no i dont think youre crazy jonas i just think you havent thought the thing through and i think marse robert has lewis said lees plan doesnt hurt anybody in the pocketbook and it gives us back our safety valve again it gives us lots of years to figure out what the hell to do with the niggers vote for forrest and things stay just the way they are nowtill they blow sky high perry didnt answer though the crowd had grown so quiet a whisper could have been heard caudell had his doubts that lewis had convinced the burly farmer but hed made him thoughtful into that silence lewis said heres one more thing this is lee were talking about if somebody else had put this notion forward id fret about it a lot more than i do if i trust the judgment of any man on the face of the earth its robert e lee heads bobbed solemnly up and down caudells among them lee was human he could make mistakes any man whod charged up toward cemetery ridge wearing gray knew thatfor too many it was the last thing they ever knew but lee had held off the federals in virginia though constantly outnumbered and beat them and taken washington city when the repeaters gave him a chance had helped arrange the peace with the usa and presided over kentuckys joining the confederacy if all that was not enough to deserve support what was i had a whole big speech all ready to roll out but i dont think im going to bother with it now lewis said the only reason i can see that anyone would want to vote for forrest instead of lee is over slavery and ive covered that as well as i know how talking with jonas here when were talking about anything elsedealing with the united states and other foreign countries making paper money worth what it says it is all that sort of thinglee has it over him and i think everybody knows it a vote for lee and brown moves the confederacy forward a vote for forrest and wigfall holds us back thank you for listening to me my friends im through the crowd cheered lustily and began the chant of lee lee lee that henry pleasants had begun at the forrest rally the banjo picker and fiddler struck up dixie again voices lifted in song caudell raised his with the rest only when he was walking back to his room did he think to wonder how fitting the tune was at a rally for a man who wanted to move however gradually on slavery chattering like magpies caudells students hurried out of the rundown schoolhouse and scattered for their homes it had been a long day for them summer was almost here and the sun rose early and set late the only thing that helped themand their teacherendure was knowing that with summer came an end to lessons when caudell slower and tireder than the children went outside he found a black man waiting for him hello israel he said can i do something for you yes suh you can i wants you to help me with my rithmetic suh i pays you to do it he reached into his pocket took out a tanandbrown confederate fivedollar bill wait wait wait caudell put his hands in the air you dont need me not when you work for henry pleasants hes a real engineerhe knows more about mathematics than ill ever learn yes suh he knows it but he knows it so good he caint teach it to me seem like he done forgot how he ever learn in the fust place if you know what i mean israel said caudell had to nod hed known people like that the negro went on but you suh you a schoolteacher you used to showin folk what dont know nothin how to do things jus a step at a time like them yankee teachers they had at the hayti cross the trent from new berne an these here fractions they drivin me to distraction i gots to know em if is ever goin to keep marse henrys books for him please teach me suh israel displayed the banknote again nothingnot even poor dead josephine with her promises of sensual delightscould have been better calculated to tempt caudell than someone standing in front of him and begging to be taught that israel was black worried him less than it would have before the war for one thing israel was free for another he was already literate and had not gotten into any trouble on account of it that did not mean caudell had no qualms if i do agree to teach you israel when will you be able to come into town will henry let you take time off from your work sadly israel shook his head no suh he sho wont i gots to work fo my keep i finish all my chos early today so as i can get here an ask you but if you wants to help me learn i come in soon as im done an walk back in the dark that dont matter none to me how many days a week would you want to do that caudell asked many as you want israel answered at once caudell studied him if he meant what he said he had more hunger for knowledge than any of the regular students in the school a full days work five miles on foot into nashville a lesson another five miles back to the farm with one of those hikes at least and maybe both made in the night and cutting into his sleep if you really want to try i guess we could manage three evenings a week and see how that goes caudell said his own curiosity was piqued he wondered just how much the negro could do thank you suh thank you israels big happy grin seemed almost to split his face in two then he sobered how much you want me to pay you could he have afforded to caudell would have done it for nothing he could not afford to and he knew it especially with the lean months of summer staring him in the face how does five dollars every other week sound like a lot o money israel said mournfully reckon i gots to pay though if i wants to learn how much would that work out to per week caudell asked wanting to see what his new pupil already knew two dollars an fifty cents israel answered without hesitation you ask me about cash money i can cipher just fine but when its two an a half barrels o this an three an a quarter pounds o that i goes all to pieces it wont be so bad caudell did his best to sound reassuring come on back to the widow bissetts with me as long as youre here you might as well start your lessonssoonest begun soonest done and the resolutely practical part of him added the sooner i start getting paid he did not take israel up to his room they worked on the front porch till it got too dark to see and then for a while after that by candlelight their heads close together but the candles also lured bugs until they were doing more slapping than studying finally israel got up i better get on back fore is eaten up altogether all right israel ill see you wednesday then youve made a fair start i think actually caudell was more than a little impressed by his own account israel had had no schooling at all until he ran off to federally held territory during the war but he learned readily enough and his mere presence here was proof of his willingnesseven his eagernessto work caudell blew out the candles night closed down on the porch hot and close and sticky and completely dark except for the faint glow of a single lamp in the parlor inside israel stumbled going down the stairs and again on the short path that led out to joyner street see you wednesday suh he called then but for the sound of his footsteps he might have vanished from the face of the earth barbara bissett sat waiting for caudell to come in her plump face set in disapproving lines without preamble she snapped i dont want that nigger coming round here again do you understand me what why not caudell said taken by surprise on account of hes a nigger of course his landlady sounded surprised too but for a different reason what will the neighbors say if they see a nigger coming round my house all the time i aint white trash thats sunk so low as to have to make friends with slaves hes free caudell said that had no effect on the widow bissett she took one of the deep breaths she used to inflate before she went on her crying jags anxious to head that off caudell added hes just studying arithmetic with me i dont care what hes doing do you hear me barbara bissett could write her own name read a little and handle money past that her knowledge stopped nor had she ever shown any inclination to learn more but she held the whip hand now he comes round here again mr nate caudell you can just go and find yourself another place to live do you understand me you better understand me i understand you caudell said resignedly though he did not own much in the way of worldly goods he had had to pack up everything and move out on a moments notice so often during his time in the army that hed developed a permanent aversion to the very idea well find somewhere else wednesday he met israel well away from the widow bissetts house took him back to the school and drilled him there that was where the lessons continued adding and subtracting fractions went well enough so long as they had the same denominator but when he showed israel that a half times a half was a quarter the negro shook his head in bewilderment it was always a two under the line befo how come it be a fo now because you multiplied it caudell said patiently how much is two times two if theyre not under the line fo israel admitted but no light went on in his eyes he couldnt make the stretch from whole numbers to those peculiarlooking entities called fractions lets try it another way caudell said you know money suppose you have fifty cents whats another name for that half a dollar israel said all right whats half of half a dollar a quarter israel did know money suddenly he stared at the slate where caudell had chalked the problem half times a half isa quarter he said slowly now his face lit up though he was about fifteen years older than caudell he looked like a little boy discovering that if you put the sounds c and a and t together they turned into a word halftimes a half is a quarter an it don matter whether its money or not thats right caudell said grinning his own grin moments like these were what made his low salary worthwhile so what would half times a quarter be he tensed as he waited for the black mans reply did israel truly grasp the principle or had he just figured out one special case israel frowned in fierce concentration but not for long half times a quarterthatd be an eighth wouldnt it marse nate yup caudell all but shouted it now both men grinned the one in relief the other in excitement you have it israel i got it israel said i sho nough do an aint nobody can take it away from me neither what else you goin to learn me bout this multiplyin fractions he raced through the rest of that topic doing his drills as fast as caudell could give them to him but he ran headlong into another wall when a couple of days later the time came for him to divide fractions instead of multiplying them caudell taught him the same technique he used with his regular students invert the divisor and then multiply we already done multiplyin israel protested this heres supposed to be dividin it is caudell said dividing and multiplying are the inversethe oppositeof each other the same way adding and subtracting are dividing by a fraction or by any number is the same as multiplying by its inverse theyre just separate parts of the whole thing that makes up arithmetic you know to his amazement he found that israel knew no such thing hed learned the rules for each operation without thinking about whether it was related to any other his jaw fell and his eyes went wide as he took in the concept and made it part of himself aint that somethin grand he said at last five times two is ten so of course ten divided by five is two it aint no accident it all fits together yup it sure does caudell said you say sho marse nate but you the first person ever show that to me nobody else ever bother showin me it fit together its like a puzzle aint it where all the pieces go just so an make up a whole big picture you couldnt never guess from lookin at em apart i had the pieces but i never seen the whole picture till now show me this trick o yours again will you i bet i understands it this time aroun he did too at the next session caudell showed him how to find common denominators for fractions he was slow to see the point of that until caudell said its what you do when you get twentyfive and a half bushels of corn from this field and thirtyseven and a third from that one and you need to know how much you have in all israels face took on the intent look with which caudell had become familiar i got you suh he proved himself right in short order as he started back toward henry pleasantss farm he asked whats the next lesson caudell spread his hands there is no next lesson israel far as i can see youve learned everything you needyou should do fine from here on out and as far as he could see israel had learned as well and as fast as a pretty bright white man he was less surprised at that than he thought he ought to be and a lot less surprised than he would have been before the war thank you suh thank you from the bottom of this heart o mine israel knew better than to shake hands uninvited with a white he dipped his head and headed north toward the farm it was my pleasure caudell called after him israel didnt answer caudell started back to the widow bissetts house he knew she couldnt have done as well as the black man had not if her life depended on it but she would not have israel in her house before he got free she could have bought him assuming she scraped up the moneyan unlikely assumption caudell tugged on his beard then kicked at a rock if theres any justice in that damned if i can see it he said out loud nashville was already sleeping no one heard him the buggy clattered down the road raeford liles spat a brown stream of tobacco juice into the dust then he scowled at his horses hindquarters git up he snapped flicking the reins the horse twitched one ear other than that it ignored him nate caudell laughed just another old soldier miserable lazy goodfornothing creature liles flicked the reins again harder this time maybe the horse moved a little faster but caudell wouldnt have bet more than a dime on it he said thanks for giving me the ride into rocky mount thats all right nate i was going to hear bedford forrest give his speech come hell or high water since you wanted to listen to him too im pleased to bring you along hes giving a lot of speeches isnt he caudell said goin all round the country if your precious mr robert e lee wants to sit up in virginia and let his people do his work for him hes liable to lose this here election as if to emphasize his words the storekeeper spat again then wiped his chin with his sleeve i dont know caudell said frowning it doesnt seem dignified somehow for a man to do his own campaigning for president only one i can remember back in the us days was douglas in and look what it got him douglas liles spat again to show what he thought of stephen a douglas all he was good for was split tin his party but forrest now forrest is different he dont say go on up therehe says follow me if something needs doin he does it his own self caudell didnt feel like yet another argument with liles so he let the conversation lag fields and forests flowed slowly past hed come up this road three years before after seeing the wonders of virginia maryland pennsylvania and washington city since then he hadnt been as far from nashville as rocky mount away from the railroads travel stayed as slow as it had always been listening to a speech a dozen miles distant meant a whole day away rocky mount had spread itself to welcome the presidential candidate confederate flags flew everywhere bunting decorated the buildings in the center of townmost of them new since the war a platoon of forrests trees in their confederategray capes ushered spectators toward the platform from which their man would speak beside the platform a band thumped away on the bedford forrest quickstep over and over and over again in front stood a platform loaded with food and drink yall help yourselves a tree said expansively as liles poured himself a drink of whiskey he said all this must cost a pretty penny if forrest does it every stop he makes look around caudell suggested liles did the whiskey glass stopped halfway to his lips rivington men he said in disgust several of them wearing their usual muddy green prowled the edges of the rocky mount town square aks in their hands and serious expressions on their faces caudell couldnt figure out what they were up to until he remembered the federal sentries at the white house after the rebel army broke into washington bodyguards thats what they are he thought if theyre for forrest thats the best reason i can think of to vote for lee liles said they are caudell pointed to the flagpoles that sprouted from the comers of the platform look those are their flags flying under the stainless banner hed seen the awbs threespiked insignia on benny langs jacket and again in richmond across from mechanics hall they got their own flag what the hell business they got havin their own flag liles demanded they aint a country nor a state neither i just figured them things was there for decoration and indeed the red and white banners with their black central emblems fit in well enough in the sea of red white and blue that had washed over rocky mount no caudell said the storekeeper answered him but he didnt hear what liles said hed just recognized one of the rivington menpiet hardie he wanted to go up to him grab him by the front of the shirt and snarl what did you do to the mulatto wench that made her hang herself what did you do to frighten mollie bean who wasnt frightened at gettysburg that seemed unwise not only was hardie half again his size he was also carrying a repeater but if piet hardie backed nathan bedford forrest it was as liles had said another reason to favor robert e lee the town square filled rapidly most of the people there took no special notice of the rivington men some mostly men of an age to be veterans came up and talked with them in a friendly way about the aks caudell knew the south might have lost the war without them he couldnt make himself like the rivington men even so to the bang of a drum the trees called out hit em again hit em again forrest forrest a couple of men went up to the platform and sat down on the front edge rifles across their knees a plump man whose name had escaped caudell went up there too and launched into a speech of his own finally one of the rivington men turned around and glared at him after a few seconds the glare got through the plump man said and now my friends without further ado the man youve been waiting forand waiting for liles put in sourlythe next president of the confederate states of america nathan bedford forrest the trees redoubled their chant but the shouts of the crowd all but drowned them out forrest bounded up onto the platform he stood there for a moment letting the cheers wash over him he was a bigger man than caudell had expected and had more presence like lee he was impossible to ignore or to take lightly he raised both hands lowered them again the noise in the square went down with them into the quiet he had caused forrest said thank you all for coming here to listen to me today his accent was unpolished but his voice was smoother than caudell would have guessed smooth or not though it carried he went on in richmond they think they can pass on the presidency like it was a farm going from father to son in richmond they think its a matter betwixt gentlemen he loaded the word with scorn are they right the gentlemen up in richmond no people shouted back caudell kept silent so did raeford liles but they were in the minority forrest stalked back and forth across the platform he was by no means a classic speaker but he was effective all the same the farther into his speech he went the louder and more booming his voice became soon it was easy to imagine him roaring out orders through the din of battle and easy to imagine men jumping to obey up in richmond forrest cried mr robert e lee says he knows bettern you what to do with your property hear me now people its not for me to say freein slaves is always a bad thing i freed plenty o my own and they went through the war with me as my teamsters his bodyguards from rivington did not care to hear that rivington men caudell knew generally didnt care to hear anything about easing restrictions on blacks the one who had glared down the plump functionary turned his stare on forrest but the former cavalry general was made of sterner stuff and ignored that warning gaze in any case he did not keep the rivington men worrying long if you want to free your niggers that your business but if the government goes an tells you youve got to free your niggershells bells gentlemen am i right or am i wrong but didnt we fight a war with a government that wanted to tell us that this time the roar from the crowd was yes and this time raeford liles roared along with the rest caudell did not roar yes he was not inclined to heckle though either as hed heckled isaac cockrell that had nothing to do with the men with rifles who sat on the platform the thought that rifles might be turned on a heckler simply never entered his mind but forrest unlike cockrell had to be taken seriously as seemed to be his way no matter what he did he returned to the relentless attack my friends i give you that robert e lee helped the confederate states get free of the yankees and i tip my hat to him on account of it but before robert e lee ever fit for the confederacy the yankees wanted to make him their commanderand he almost took on the job when he did decide to stick with his state virginia made him a general straight off thats a rugged way to fight a war by god isnt it the men in the crowd laughed appreciatively warming to his subject forrest went on me i started the fight as a private i wanted to get right incouldnt wait to get right in my friend senator wigfall our next vice presidenthe paused for applausehelped fix up the surrender of fort sumter back when robert e lee that gentleman up in richmond was still a colonel in the army of the us of a if you all want some bobbiecomelately i reckon you can vote for lee but if you want men who were with the confederate states of america from the gitgo youll stick with wigfall and me i thank you kindly for listening to me today he bowed and got down from the platform the drum began to beat again forrests trees chanted hit em again hit em again one of the rivington men raised his ak to his shoulder and fired a short burst into the air caudell saw the muzzle flash but hardly heard the report through the thunderous cheers of the people around him the band struck up the bedford forrest quickstep and then a minstrel tune one caudell didnt know he turned to raeford liles asked whats that its called im coming to my dixie home its a nigger talkin about life up north liles answered he sang a few bars id rather work de cotton patch and die on corn and bacon dan lib up norf on good white bread ob abolition makin i got the sheet music back at the store if you ever want to take a look at it thats all right caudell said quickly trust liles not to miss a chance to try to sell him something just then the noise around them redoubled nathan bedford forrest was plunging into the crowd shaking mens hands and bowing over those that belonged to ladies people surged toward him from allover the square caudell didnt particularly care to meet him but was swept along by the tide forrests big hand almost swallowed up his will you vote for me sir looking up at that strong determined face caudell had to work to make himself shake his head no sir dont reckon so now i fought under general lee and ill stick by him behind forrest a bodyguard who had plunged after himand whom he was ignoringscowled at caudell caudell waited for the famous forrest temper to explode but the exgeneral only nodded and said good to find a man whos loyal and not ashamed to say so you mightas a rustic would he pronounced it moughtchange your mind i hope you do he turned to raeford liles what about you sir i might could vote your way the storekeeper allowed i was leanin that way but id care for you more if the rivington men cared for you less now forrest showed anger any man who wants to keep the right of property in niggers is a patriot by god if thats you youre with me same as they are and if it aint be damned to you he spun away as if liles had ceased to exist he doesnt leave much room for doubt does he caudell said after they had finally got free of the crowd and headed back toward the buggy no liles still looked like a man whod bitten into something sour thatll hurt him too good caudell said he waited for the storekeeper to argue with him but liles just kept walking xv no sooner had robert e lee ventured outside the powhatan house to enjoy the brisk fall air than reporters swooped down on him like stooping hawks he nodded to them unsurprised they had become familiar over the past few months by unspoken agreement they let him alone as long as he was within the hotel but he became fair game the moment his foot hit the sidewalk mr quincy you were here half a step ahead of the rest i believe lee said to the man from the richmond whig thank you general virgil quincy poised pencil over pad if i may ask why have you chosen to remain here in virginia while bedford forrest travels allover the country speaking it seems at every town big enough to boast a railroad station general forrest is of course free to conduct his campaign in any fashion that suits him lee had learned to speak slowly enough to let the reporters take down his words i might add a point which sometimes seems in danger of being forgotten that is to say i also enjoy the same freedom the entire confederacy surely knows where i stand on the issues of the day perhaps general forrest still feels the need to make his ideas more widely accessible to the voters quincy twirled a waxed mustache between thumb and forefinger as he considered his next question how do you feel about forrests questioning your initial loyalty to the confederate cause i prefer to allow my contributions to that cause to speak for themselves if they do not make it plain where my loyalty lay nothing i can say will do so for public consumption lee kept his fury tightly bottled he was used to newspapers sniping at him from time to time but to have his loyalty impugned by a man he had admired until their differing views created a chasm between them and for no better purpose than political advantagethat was hard to bear he had not imagined forrest would stoop so low which if anything but served to illuminate his own political naïveté virgil quincy took a step back lees rule was to allow each reporter two questions edwin helper of the richmond dispatch approached in quincys place to change the subject if i may sir what do you think of the war just begun by the united states against england over the canadas i deprecate war in general lee replied as to this war in particular i would be less than truthful if i said i was sorry to see so many us troops drawn hundreds of miles to the north of our frontier he smiled several reporters chuckled he added even with the accession of kentucky to the confederacy the united states are a larger more populous nation than the csa the implications to be drawn from that should be clear to the observer theyre not quite clear to me helper said what do you think our course ought to be to continue the scrupulous neutrality president davis has proclaimed and is observing lee answered at once any other course involves us in risks which should not be run senator wigfall was shouting for a southern invasion to seize the slave states remaining in the usa while that country was otherwise engaged some fireeaters shouted right along with him others though remembering how englands notsoscrupulous neutrality had almost ruined the confederacy during the war were all for allying with the united states against her should we not at least demand concessions from the usa as the price of our neutrality asked rex van lew of the richmond examiner lee shook his head they are our brothers though we no longer live in the same house with them having grown up to enjoy one of our own putting demands upon brothers strikes me as a bad business and one which cannot fail to bring resentment hes right about that by god virgil quincy said ive yet to hear the end of the time i asked my brother for fifty dollars and it was back before the war the reporters laughed lee walked down broad street with the newpapermen trailing along behind him van lew said what is your opinion of general forrests actively campaigning for a whole year in his quest to defeat you i admire his energy without wishing to employ mine to similar purpose lee said i also doubt the benefit either to the nation or to the electorate of repeating oneself so often now gentlemen if you will excuse me i should like to get in something of a constitutional he increased his pace the reporters were decades younger than hehe would be sixtyone come januarybut several of them began puffing as they hurried to keep up rex van lew had used up his allotted questions but asked another one anyhow how will you feel when the election is over sir relieved lee answered promptly win or lose three reporters asked at the same time win or lose he said relieved at least of suspense if i win relieved of responsibility if i lose while i hope and expect to win the prospect of quiet retirement is by no means altogether unattractive i assure you he walked on three years before the army of northern virginia had paraded in triumph down this very street now most of those soldiers were long since back at their peacetime trades that he thought was as it should be he blinked then smiledhe even had a peacetime trade of his own though hed never expected to turn politician whats funny general edwin helper asked life or if youd like the fortunes of war lee said in capitol square george washington in bronze pointed ahead urging on invisible followers or perhaps the country as a whole lee gravely tipped his hat to his wifes adoptive ancestor then went on with his constitutional nate caudell gauged the creeping shadows in the classroom he put down his chalk thats enough for now well pick it up again after dinner several students let out barely suppressed cheers and grabbed for the bags and old newspapers in which theyd brought their noontime meals for that matter his stomach was growling too he wolfed his ham and corn bread gulped from a canteen full of cold coffee then he hurried over to the town square extra flags flew above the courthouse a long line of men snaked in through the front door unfamiliar buggies and wagons horses and mules were hitched everywherefarmers from half the county were in town to vote today a lot of them were men hed known in the army but seldom saw these days he waved to dempsey eure who was just tying his horse in a narrow space between two buggies they got into line together patriot or confederate caudell asked since eure had heckled mayor cockrell at the forrest rally he thought he knew what answer to expect sure enough the exsergeant said im voting confederate i followed marse robert into washington city so i dont reckon ill run away from him now how about you nate the same caudell said he ought to have an easy time of it here and in virginia where so many served under him out farther west though they know about him but they dont really know him if you know what i mean and they do know forrest out there thats why they voteto see what happens eure said yup caudell looked his friend over smiled as he saw something familiar you still wear a feather in your hat do you how are you getting along i get by dempsey eure said with a shrug married lemon stricklands sister lucy not long after i got home you know we got ourselves a boy two years old an shes in the family way again how times does get onbefore too long suppose ill be sendin wiley to that school of yours you fix him so he knows moren his old man you hear if hes anything like his old man hell do fine caudell said he noticed eure hadnt really said anything about his fortunes except i get by he didnt push for more come to that he couldnt have said more himself the line advanced caudell blinked as he went from sunshine into the gloom inside the courthouse mayor cockrell and cornelius joyner the justice of the peace sat behind a stout wooden table heres the roll nate joyner said when caudell came up to him sign your name on the line he pointed to show where caudell signed quite a lot of men had already voted most had signed their names but for a depressingly large number of voters only an x witnessed by mayor and justice of the peace appeared in the signature column of the register isaac cockrell handed caudell a ballot and a muchsharpened stub of pencil he voted for lee and for albert gallatin brown without hesitation then went on through the rest of his choices sion rogers he saw was running for congress and billing himself a confederate caudell voted for him he might have done so even if rogers ran as a patriot for hed been the th north carolinas first colonel until he resigned his commission early in to become attorney general of north carolina when caudell was done he folded his ballot and returned it to cornelius joyner who slid it through the slot of a wooden box with an impressively stout padlock nathaniel n caudell has voted the justice of the peace intoned his voice loud and deep enough to make caudell proud of having done his civic duty wait a minute mayor cockrell exclaimed when caudell started to walk out with the pencil you bring that back right now you hear were startin to run low on em redfaced caudell returned the little stub meanwhile judge joyner announced to the world that dempsey eure had exercised his franchise eures eyes were twinkling as he left the courthouse with caudell you shouldve told him to buy a substitute for his damn pencil nate he said that was you back this spring wasnt it sure sounded like you if it wasnt it was me all right caudell said good thing his honors ears arent as good as yours the clock above the courthouse chimed one ive got to get back to the schoolhouse dempsey before they burn it down by god its good to see you and you dempsey eure thumped him on the back i wondered if theyd have to get us back into butternut before we met up again it would take a good deal to get me back into uniform and thats a fact caudell said his friend laughed and nodded he went on i really do have to get back he hurried on down alston street while dempsey eure went to reclaim his horse when he walked into the schoolroom again one of the little boys there called who won the election teacher through the snorts and giggles of the older pupils caudellwho had to smile himselfgravely answered we wont know for a few days yet willie they have to count all the votes and send the count to richmond which takes a while now class who can tell me all twelve confederate states and their capitals hands shot into the air as he had in the galt house in louisville so lee now sat in the dining room of the powhatan house in richmond with telegrams piled so high on the table in front of him that he could hardly get to let alone enjoy his plate of smothered chicken he knew now that hed been foolish to order his favorite dish on a night when he couldnt give it his full attention a boy brought in a new set of returns since lee had knife in one hand and fork in the otherhe did manage a distracted bite every now and thenalbert gallatin brown took the telegrams as he read them his face fen forrest and wigfall remain ahead of us in louisiana that is unfortunate lee saidblurrily as his mouth was full he chewed swallowed and resumed sounding like himself again i had hoped to carry louisiana as its white voters have greater and longer familiarity with free negroes especially in and around new orleans than is the case elsewhere in the confederacy the election is more closely contested than i thought it would be brown agreed he sounded gloomy and with reason he and lee were also trailing in mississippi his home state lee looked at the map tacked up on an easel beside the table having it there made him feel more as if this were a military campaign it was in fact borrowed from the war department and would have to go back to mechanics hall once all the results were in he was leading handily here in virginia and in north carolina by rather less in georgia and lightly settled florida and by a fair margin in kentucky which he had helped bring into the confederacy and which was now voting for the first time for the president of the country it had freely chosen south carolina had already come down against him the palmetto state alone in the south still chose its electoral college representatives by vote of the legislature rather than of the people thus its choice had quickly and painfully become known he was losing alabama too along with louisiana and mississippi the cotton states the ones whose livelihoods most depended on plantations and their slave labor were unwilling to vote for anyone who questioned negro servitude in any way that left arkansas texas and tennessee votes from the two western states were slow coming in those from tennessee had arrived in large numbers but every new telegram changed the leader there at the moment forrest was ahead by nearly a thousand votes an hour before lee had led by almost exactly as many albert gallatin brown was studying the map too we badly need tennessee he said the deliberate lack of emphasis in his voice highlighted his words as effectively as a shout you have no confidence in the results from the other two lee asked have you possibly some hope for arkansas lee said only after he had spoken did he realize he had in effect written off texas it too was a cotton state and also one that had boomed since the war with negroes in great demand and fetching high prices were texans likely to vote against prosperity it went against human nature brown had been doing sums on the back of a telegram if forrest takes tennesseeand arkansas he added in deference to lees hope which he did not seem to share that will give him sixtyfour electoral votes and sixty are required for election lee said heavily only once before had he felt as he did now watching his men swarm up the slope toward the union lines on the third day at gettysburg he had been confident they could carry everything before them as he had been confident his own campaign would convince the people he offered the nation the wisest course was he to be proven as disastrously wrong now as he had been then a new messenger boythe other had presumably gone home for the eveningarrived with more telegrams lee took them unfolded the first few he read them set them down on the table well brown asked arkansas or the first considerable returns therefrom again lee declined to continue this time his running mate did not press him he could figure out what silence meant lee made himself get the words out the trend is against us so it all rides on tennessee does it it would appear that way yesor do you think results in any of the other states likely to change albert gallatin brown shook his head he surprised lee by starting to laugh at lees raised eyebrow he explained even if i fail of election i remain in the senate and shall continue to serve my state as best i can again lee found himself envying browns quick adaptability if he was not elected he would go back to arlington put in a crop on the sloping fields and no doubt be more contented living the life of a semiretired gentleman farmer than as president of the confederate states of america yet the idea of losing the election was intolerable to him he would carry the weight of that rejection for the rest of his days the night dragged on a colored waiter took away the dishes fresh stacks of telegrams replaced them before long the whole big table was flooded in louisville lee had been getting returns from only two states now six times that many were voting i have more election results here someone said this was a mans voice not the treble of previous boys from the telegraph office lee looked up to find jefferson davis holding a handful of telegrams the president said i waylaid the messenger at the dining room door he pulled out his watch its already past two how long do you aim to stay up until we know or until we fall asleep in our chairswhichever comes first lee answered the outgoing president smiled lee said from where are your telegrams sir i beg your pardon but i have yet to look at them davis did so then said these first several are from tennessee from chattanooga and its environs mostly let me hear them lee said suddenly alert the president read off the returns as he did brown scrawled figures and lips moving rapidly added them up finally he said that cuts forrests lead there in half more or less he glanced over at a pile of telegrams off to one side we gain when reports come in from the eastern part of the state but fall behind when theyre out of the west the plantations in tennessee are in the south and west the planters there i would infer want their slaves back davis said one eyebrow quirked as he turned toward lee whereas you sir are winning the votes of folk who during the war i feared would go over to the united states en masse as did those of what must now be known as west virginia how can you call yourself a good confederate sir if those who half wanted to be yankees give you the election but for that eyebrow lee would have thought the president in earnest as it was he hoped davis was making one of his wintry jokes he gave back another one if forrest had seen the result there before the rest of the country voted no doubt he would have taxed me with the same charge he did anyhow brown pointed out he succeeded all too well lee said i dont know whether you have kept track of how things stand mr president but he used a forefinger to point out on the map which states were going to whom jefferson davis gnawed on his lower lip as he pondered the shape of the election sectionalism appears to remain alive and well among us he said shaking his head that is dangerous if we cannot cure it it will cause us grief down the road the united states after all tore asunder from a surfeit of sectionalism the constitution of the confederate states does not provide for secession albert gallatin brown said neither did the constitution of the united states davis replied but if the western states have the gall to seek to abandon our confederacy as a result of this election we shall he stopped for once his façade cracked leaving him quite humanly confused if they seek to abandon our confederacy at the moment i have no idea what we shall do in any event the decision will be yours not mine general lee very possibly not lee replied if the returns from tennessee continue to favor forrest the decision will be his and in that event the states which favor him and which favor the indefinite continuation of negro servitude shall have no cause for complaint as a result of this election jefferson davis let out an audible sniff though his background was more like forrests than lees he had enjoyed the education denied to forrest and had come to identify himself completely with the old landed aristocracy of the south he said i cannot imagine thatthat brawler at the head of our nation the voters unfortunately seem to have suffered no similar failure of imagination lee said that is not so brown said stoutly the aggregate total of the popular vote continues to favor us regardless of what the electoral college may say by the constitution however the electoral college is the final arbiter of the election i shall not dispute its results whatever they prove to be lee said if we set aside the constitution for our convenience what point in having it no sooner were the words out of his mouth than he realized others would apply them to his own views on slavery it is not the same thing he told himself not quite comfortably the messenger boy whose function president davis had usurped now returned with a fresh set of results which he placed in front of lee brown asked where are these from lee unfolded the top one read it texas he answered his tone of voice said all that needed saying about the way the votes there were going he did his best to find a silver lining to the cloud we had no great hope for texas in any event he opened another telegram ah now this one from north carolina is more like it we have carried nash county by three to two good brown said what are the numbers lee read them off as brown wrote them down he grinned the grim grin of a fighter who has landed a telling blow jefferson daviss smile held something of the same quality lees own initial burst of enthusiasm quickly faded the news from north carolina was no more cause for jubilation than that from texas was cause for despair the two sets of returns merely confirmed and extended trends that were already there results that went against those trends would have been more interesting anothuh cup of coffee suh the waiter asked no thank you lee said i am sufficiently awash as is my elder brother sydney has always been the naval officer of the family but at the moment i am certain i am shipping more water than he as the waiter left lee put a hand to his mouth to cover a yawn altogether without intending to he fell asleep in his chair a few minutes later more telegrams arrived jefferson davis took them and read the results to brown who asked shall we wake the general no davis said they make no significant changes when more word from tennessee arrives that will be time enough by the feel of things the only definitive word from tennessee will be the last word it will be days before we have the final count then we needs must compose ourselves to wait davis answered and all the less point to waking him now would you not agree nate caudell stared at the empty space on the counter where newspapers should have lain confound it mr liles when are they going to come in theyve been in the storekeeper said went right back out again today tooi done sold every copy i had wept fastern i ever seen em before matter of fact caudell stared at him in blank dismay grinning he went on you ask me pretty enough might could be i tell you who won tennessee why you caudell swore as he hadnt sworn since his army days raeford liles laughed at him when he finally ran down he said youd better tell me before i start tearing this place apart he sounded as menacing as he could it was he knew a poor best liles didnt quiver in his shoes in fact he didnt stop laughing when hed let caudell hang long enough though he said vote from knoxville came in at last that nails it down tightlee carried the state by twentyfive hundred votes thats first rate caudell said letting out a long sigh of relief the results had hung in the balance for more than a week usually even if one or two states returns remained in doubt the shape of a national election grew clear soon enough this time everything rode on the one closest state caudell asked how big an edge in the popular vote did lee end up with just under thirty thousand votes out of almost a million cast sixtynine to fifty in the electoral college liles said but if a couple thousand people in tennessee had gone the other way well wed be talkin about president forrest now no matter what the popular vote had to say i know for as long as caudell could remember people had complained about the electoral college of the united states the only reason they didnt complain more was that it normally did a good job of reflecting what the people decided for whatever their reasons the confederate founding fathers had included an electoral college in the new nations constitution and in its first real testjefferson davis having run unopposedit had almost thrown the confederacy into turmoil by its mere existence he said what are they saying about the election in the west and southwest the states forrest won you mean liles said caudell nodded the storekeeper told him theyre still bawlin like pigs that burned their noses on hot swill from what the papers say senator wigfalls makin noises like they ought to up and pull out of the confederacy set up a new one of their own to suit them what thats crazy caudell said after a moment he wondered why the south had left the united states after an election it could not stomach what does forrest have to say about that hasnt said anything yet liles answered which struck caudell as ominous he also noticed something else you dont seem to be up on your hind legs on account of forrest has lost i aint liles admitted oh i voted for him spite of the rivington men and everything else i aint easy about let tin all the niggers loose but i reckon we wont go far wrong with bobbie lee in richmond god willin a few o them hotheads in south carolina and mississippill see it the same way once they settle down a bit an stop listenin to nothin but their own speeches over and over i do hope youre right caudell said fighting one civil war was plenty for meive seen the elephant now and i dont care to see it ever again thank you very much i cant believe theyd try anything so stupidjust cant believe it liles said damnation nate might could be theyd have to fight us an the united states at the same time wouldnt that be a fine mess caudell said the very idea of threecornered civil strife made him want to pull his hat down over his eyes but after he thought about it he shook his head i reckon the united states have enough on their hands with england up in the canadas did you read what the papers had to say about the war there sure did wethe yankees i mean liles amended with a shamefaced chuckle whipped em again on land up near a place called ottawa i think it was but their navy shelled boston harbor an new york toostarted a big fire there the paper said hell of a thing aint it it is indeed caudell said like the storekeeper he almost instinctively sided with the usa in a quarrel against great britain his enmity with the north was new and fading now that the confederacy had gained its freedom britain thoughbritain had been the bogeyman since his schoolboy days thats a war im just as glad were no part of amen liles said next time ill save you a paper no matter what nate i promise youd better caudell said mockfiercely as he left the general store he found himself halfdelighted lee had won the election halfworried because even that victory looked to be bringing trouble in its wake he clicked his tongue between his teeth the older he got the more he wondered if there was such a thing as an unmixed blessing robert e lees heels made a reassuringly solid sound as he walked down the stairs from the great columned porch of arlington and onto the lawn even the boards of those stairs were new since the war the old timber uncared for while the federals occupied the mansion had grown dangerously rotten the lawn at the moment was patchy and yellow but spring would restore its lushness for him someone rode up the path toward arlington at first lee thought it might be one of his sons but he soon saw it was not after another few seconds when he did recognize the rider his brows contracted in a frown it was nathan bedford forrest he stood stiffly waiting for the former cavalry general to approach after their hot words in richmond after the bitter campaign he wondered that forrest had the nerve to visit him here he would have liked nothing better than sending his adversary away unheard had he been merely robert e lee rather than presidentelect of the confederate states of america he would have done just that the good of the country though demanded that he give forrest a hearing he even made himself take a few steps toward forrest who reined in and dismounted his horse began cropping the sere grass forrest began to raise his right hand then stopped as if unsure whether lee would take it and unwilling to give him cause to refuse he dipped his head instead a sharp abrupt gesture general lee sir he said then added after a tiny pause mr presidentelect general forrest lee said with the same wary politeness forrest had used he was not ready to shake hands with his recent rival not yet seeking neutral ground on which to begin the conversation he nodded toward forrests horse that is a handsome animal sir king philip thank you sir forrests eyes lit up partly perhaps in relief partly with a horsemans enthusiasm i rode him in a good many fights hes old now as youll note but he still carries me well so i saw lee nodded again then because he found no other polite but meaningless questions to ask he said how may i serve you today sir i came forrest had to start twice before he could get it out i came to congratulate you for winning the election general lee now he did hold out his hand and lee took it thank you general forrestthank you lee said with no small relief of his own ill do anything i can to make things easy for you as you take over forrest said will you lee said all at once suspicious as well as relieved after theunpleasantness which marked the campaign that is good to hear but he let his voice trail away forrest was notoriously touchy if he was in earnest no point to stirring him but he would not be stirred not today he waved his hand all that was just business just trying to put a scarehe pronounced it skeeron you and on the people out there who did the voting same as i would have on a yankee general to get him runnin he waved again this time encompassing the whole of the confederacy i came close that you did sir lee said and having come so close you are most generous to come here now with your support when it comes to niggers general lee i dont agree with you still and i dont reckon i ever shall forrest said but i lost the whys of it dont matter that i got beat is a selfevident fact sir if i carried on now it would be nothin but folly and rashness i wanted to meet you like a man and say that to you straight out lee saw he meant it this time he held out his hand to forrest who squeezed hard lee said the nation owes you a debt of gratitude for taking that view i hope you will forgive me for saying that i wish more of those who followed you would do likewise the talk of new secession out of the southwest is deeply troubling to me and senator wigfall has produced more than his share of it he does go on dont he forrest grinned then sobered i tell you what general lee if those damn fools try and leave the confederacy ill put my uniform back on and whip em into line inside of six weeks i mean it sir tell it to the papers or if youd rather ill tell it to em my own self if you would do that general forrest i think it would have a very happy effect on all concerned then i will forrest said would you care to come inside and take some coffee with me lee asked in richmond he had ordered forrest out of his house now he tacitly apologized but forrest shook his head he remembered the quarrel too no sir i do this for the countrys sake not yours i will abide by the vote of the people but theyand youhave not the power to make me like it i aim to keep on working against you in every way i lawfully can that is your right as it is the right of every citizen congress will have to ratify my proposals in order for them to take effect of course i anticipate considerable disputation before that comes to pass lee and albert gallatin brown had been going over the list of congressmen and senators returned to office trying to work out the odds of their favoring the commencement of even gradual compensated emancipation he thought his program had a chance of passage he knew it was far from assured forrest bowed to lee we have been rivals i reckon well stay rivals but weve both fought for this country we can work together to keep it whole thats what i came to say general lee and now ive said it a good morning to you sir he bowed again swung up onto king philip and rode away lee plucked at his beard as he watched forrest go he felt as if a weight had come off his shoulders nathan bedford forrest was still a political foe but seemed not to want to remain a personal enemy after all that suited lee political foes he was learning could be dealt with the casual thought brought him up shortwas he in fact turning into a politician in his old age he stopped to consider the idea carefully at last he shook his head his inevitable slide into decay hadnt yet progressed so far dressed in his sunday bestwhich save for being the newest of his four shirts and three pairs of trousers was no different from what he wore the other six days of the weeknate caudell hurried into the nashville baptist church once inside he took off his hat and slid into a place on one of the hard wooden pews several peopleincluding the preacher ben drakesent disapproving looks his way the service was about to begin he avoided drakes eye as he sat yancey glover strode importantly to the front of the hall nodded to the preacher and waited a few seconds to let everyone notice him standing there then the precentor launched into a mighty fortress is our god the congregation joined in they had no hymnals glovers big bass voice pulled them through the song that voice was one of the reasons the church elder had the precentors job rock of ages came next with several more hymns right behind the congregation warmed up both physicallya chilly nasty rain was falling outsideand spiritually yancey glover marched back to his seat ben drake pounded a fist down on the pulpit once twice three times the preacher was an impressivelooking man of about fortyfive with a full head of wavy gray hair hed served a few months as a lieutenant in the castalia invincibles till chronic dysentery forced him to resign his commission i know thy works says the book of revelation drake began that thou art neither cold nor hot i would thou wert cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth thats what god says my friendsyou cannot you dare not be lukewarm again in the book of deuteronomy thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might not with some of thy might friends not with a little of thy might when thou hast the time with all thy might as hard as you can all the time while youre eating or working or bathing or reading you cant be lukewarm or the lord will spew you out of his mouth and you dont want that no indeed you dont for if the lord spews you out of his mouth whos going to suck you right on in you know who my friendssatan thats who paul says in his epistle to the philippians whose end is destruction whose god is their belly and whose glory is in their shame who mind earthly things so what do you want to do do you want to fret yourselves about the things of this world or about god who endures forever god the congregation shouted with a single voice nate was as loud as anyone hed been sorry when drake had to leave the regiment people listened to him he might have become captain instead of george lewis when john harrison resigned in october if hed led on the battlefield half as well as he did from the pulpit the castalia invincibles would have been in good hands he went on glorifying god and casting scorn on satan and the things of this world for the next couple of hours by the time he was done he had his congregation up on their feet urging him on he made caudell ashamed of the way he drank and swore and even of the way he smoked as he had more than once before he vowed to abandon his wicked habits hed never managed to keep any of those vows that shamed him too another round of hymns closed the service some people went up to the pulpit to talk with the preacher about his sermon others hung around in small groups inside the church some of them talked about the sermon too for others tobacco or horses were of more pressing interest even on sunday young men took the chance to eye young ladies and even if they were bold enough to say hello church was a town social center a place where everyone gathered caudell more social caterpillar than butterfly was about to head out into the rain when a woman called dont go nate he turned around the woman smiled at him she was fairly tall with gray eyes black curls that fell past her shoulders and a mouth that was too wide for perfect beautyher smile emphasized that hed noticed her earlier partly for her own sake but mostly because he hadnt seen her in church before she smiled again and repeated dont go she still didnt look familiar but that voicemollie he exclaimed what are you doing here no wonder he hadnt recognized herhed never seen her dressed as a woman till this instant raeford liles who was standing nearby cackled like a laying hen so this heres your sweetheart eh nate let me meet her why dont you caudell introduced them he didnt bother contradicting the storekeeper not anymore liles fussed over mollie bean as if he were a planter and she a fine lady not least to embarrass nate he was embarrassed but not on account of that several other castalia invincibles men who knew mollie was no lady were among those who stood around chatting in the church most of them though were with their wives whatever they thought they had to be discreet he said what brings you to nashville mollie her smile blew out i got a problem nate caudell gulped raeford liles started to cackle again mollie fixed him with a gaze that would not have looked out of place over the sights of an ak i aint in a family way mister so you can just drag your mind out of the ditch she said quietly liles blushed all the way up to the top of his head started coughing and couldnt stop and retired in disorder whats the matter caudell asked he was relieved for a couple of reasons first that she wasnt pregnanteven if hed had nothing to do with itand second that she hadnt noticed him worrying that she was it aint somethin i can explain in just words she said you got to see it an even then it dont make senseor i aint beep able to make it make sense anyways you know a whole lot moren me its on account of you im able to read and write at all so i reckoned if anybody i knew could cipher this out it was you an i brang it to you i had to get out of rivington anyhow those few sentences raised enough questions in caudells mind for any six school quizzes but he contented himself with one that might lead to answers for the rest where are you staying in one of the rooms up above the liberty bell mollies lip curled this town dont have a proper hotel let alone anything like the notahilton come on over with me i got the book you need to see there lets go caudell said wren tisdale who ran the saloon had fought in the chicora guards not the castalia invincibles even if mollie had given him her whole proper name it probably meant nothing to him caudell put his hat back on mollie opened the small longhandled umbrella she was carrying they splashed over to the liberty bell mollie used her free hand to hold her skirts out of the mud wren tisdale nodded to them as they came in he was a dark dour man whose looks belied his name this being sunday the bar was quiet and deserted the saloonkeepers eyebrows rose slightly when they climbed the stairs together but he kept his mouth shut caudells ears heated just the same mollies room was small and none too clean it held only a bed a stool a pitcher and a chamber pot on the bed lay a couple of carpet bags mollie dug in one caudell averted his eyes as lacy feminine undergarments flew this way and that being easy with her came harder now that she was so unequivocally a woman finally she said here nate this heres what you got to see as shed said it was a book the paper cover somewhat crinkled from rough treatment showed a us flag crossed with a confederate battle flag the american heritage picture history of the civil war caudell read aloud open it up anywheres mollie said here come on sit down beside me he sat though at a greater distance than hed used to back in the days when she wore uniform tunic and trousers then as shed suggested he opened the big heavy book at random he found himself looking at a discussion of the vicksburg campaign at a woodcut from leslies illustrated newspaper and at photographs of generals grant and van dorn ive never seen photographs just put into a book like that before instead of being made into engravings first he breathed and look at that painting above the picture of grant there once upon a time you wrote me for a joke asking if the rivington men had books with colored pictures all through em mollie said now you can see em for yourself caudell only half heard her he had just read the caption under that colored picture it says this here is a photograph too but theres no such thing as colored photographs everybody knows that without his willing it his voice rose in protest he flipped through several pages found color on about every other one on maps on reproductions of paintings and on what by their clarity seemed to be more photographs scratching his head in befuddlement he turned to mollie where did you get this rivingtoni stole it from benny lang she answered matteroffactly sometimes after we was donewell hell you know done with whathed go off an do other things his own business i mean until he was ready for his second round one of them times i pulled this here book out of a case he kept byby the bed with that fine light he had in there readin was easy but this here book it purely perplexed me what year is it nate what year he stared at her its of coursejanuary if you want to get picky she gestured impatiently i know that i really do but look in the front of the book he did the date of printing did not appear on the title page as it did in most books he knew he turned the page sure enough there was the information he needed next to the table of contents copyright he said slowly and this edition was printed in his voice trailed away then firmed again thats impossible is it look here she pointed to a section he hadnt yet noticed something called library of congress cataloging in publication data the author someone named bruce catton was listed as having been born in richard m ketchum who was called editor at the top of the page seemed to have been born in and the book itself fell under united stateshistorycivil war but the war ended in caudell said as much to the book as to mollie if hed been bewildered before now he was completely at sea mollie went to the next page that aint what it says here is it caudells eyes grew wide as he read the first two sentences of the introduction which talked about the south surrendering of themselves his eyes kept reading by the time he got through that twopage introduction he was ready to question his own sanity every calm rational word spoke of a longago war the united states had won if this richard ketchum was either a maniac or a prankster he didnt let on once caudell started reading in earnest before long he realized going through the whole book in detail would take too long he skimmed over the astonishing pictures and maps read their captions after a while he asked does benny lang know this book is gone dont reckon so mollie answered i moved a skinny book from the shelf on top so as to fill up part of the space this one took and fiddled with both shelves so the holes didnt show then i hid this one with the ah dainties i used to fetch over to bennys place sometimes and got it back to my room without him bein the wiser read it there some more times i was by myself an the more i read the more i got confused till i figured i had to come to you till today caudell had seen mollie only in ragged gray and butternut picturing her in dainties distracted him from the book for a little while but soon the story of the war engrossed him again the farther he got the less he understood and the more he came to wonder whether this bruce catton really was writing in some distant future time he kept referring to what he called the civil war as having happened well in the past and he kept assuming the united states had won and the confederate states lost that was clear very early on when he talked about the overwhelming material advantages the north enjoyed and about the trouble the south had in creating a navy out of nothing and about the confederacys twopronged offensive into kentucky and maryland in as a chance to win the war which failed catton also talked about slavery as something dead and long departed the feeling underlying his words seemed to be revulsion that it had ever existed lincolns emancipation proclamation which the results of the war had rendered meaningless and which all the south heartily loathed in any case was to catton a harbinger of great things ahead not even the staunchest yankee should have been able to consider it as having any great effect gettysburgcaudell studied the paintings of the third days fight then turned to a calm photograph of the battlefield after the fight was done the weathered granite and bronze monument there looked as if it had stood for decades if not centuries yet the fight was only four and a half years in the past he looked up lit mollie does your scar still pain you the one from gettysburg you mean it twinges right smart sometimes she looked at the colored photograph too she understood what he was driving at dont reckon itd trouble me atall if i waited till that was took he raised an eyebrow somewhere down deep she believed the impossible dates of and he shivered and not just because the room was chilly he was starting to believe them himself when he looked down to the picture history of the civil war once more he discovered it was almost too dark to see evening had snuck up on him like a dismounted yankee cavalryman in the wilderness he went downstairs asked wren tisdale for some candles leering the saloonkeeper supplied them you can go straight to hell you and your filthy mind caudell growled were up there reading a book and if you dont believe me you come on up and watch us he lit one of the candles at the fireplace hurried back to mollies room a few minutes later he heard someone coming partway upstairs and then hastily going back down he laughed said to mollie tisdale checking up on us she giggled too his awareness of the world around him diminished once more as he bent close to read by candlelight after a while he raised his head in complete mystification everything from the wilderness on is wrong he said grant didnt go southwe went north and johnston stopped sherman a picture of one of the fierce jaunty bummers who the book claimed had looted their way across georgia stared mutely up at him it dont talk none about our repeaters neither mollie said by god youre right it doesnt caudell flipped to the back of the book he already discovered it had an excellent index nothing was listed about repeaters nothing about aks but they won the war for us without them wed maybe have lost mollie put in she pointed to the picture history of the civil war like in there caudell kept going through the book he found a picture of the tredegar iron works said to have been taken after richmond fell he found the story of lincolns reelection over george mcclellan who he knew had actually run fourth in the election of and no mention whatever of us president seymours participation in the race he found photographs of richmond in ruins and a painting of lincoln going through the city in a carriage his eyes filled with foolish tears foolish for why should he be moved at what had never happened as he found word of the surrender of the army of northern virginia to overwhelming federal forces and a final photograph of a grimfaced robert e lee said to have been made just after that surrender at the very end of the book he found a painting from a year that to him still felt far in the futureof union veterans parading in boston seeing the white beards of the officers marching in the first rank made gooseflesh prickle up on his arms he found himself altogether confused either bruce cat ton had never heard of the world in which he lived or the man was the most inspired hoaxer of all timeeven after some hard thought caudell found he could not believe the picture history of the civil war a hoax for one thing it was too perfect too detailed for another even if an obsessed man somehow spent a lifetime assembling everything that went into this booka lifetime when caudell wondered no printer in could have produced anything like itwhy would anyone else have cared to view the product of his obsession what do you think nate mollie asked when he finally closed the covers i think caudell stopped as if saying what he thought somehow made it more real but no help for it i think this may truly be a book fromfrom the twentieth century she threw her arms around him and kissed him on the cheek oh sweet jesus thank you i was thinkin the same thing and thinkin i had to be out of my head believe me i feel the same way but when he looked down at the volume that should have been impossible his resolve firmed all the other choices seem even crazier though seems like that to me too but if its real nate its important what are we going to do about it that brought him up short youve had more time to think about this than i have not wanting to sound as if he was accusing her he quickly added but youre dead right if this comes out of rivington it ought to shed some kind of light on all the other peculiar things the rivington men have not just aks went through his mind but also desiccated meals benny langs helmet and bulletstopping flapjack he still wondered if hed heard that straight and the marvelous lights and artificial coolness about which mollie had written hed never before thought of all those things together now that he had he saw what a mountain of strangeness they made a mountain beside which the picture history of the civil war was by itself but a foothill he knew he was not a man cut out to handle mountains he thought of bringing the book to george lewis shook his head the moment the idea occurred to him taken as a whole the mystery of rivington was far too big for lewis too with that realization came an answer to mollies question robert e lee needs to see this book mollie stared at him robert e lee marse robert her voice rose to a squeak the president hes not the king caudell said hes not even president yet and wont be for more than a month remember how it was in richmond jeff davis had his house open every other week just so he could meet people captain lewis went there once to shake his hand i aint no captain mollie vehemently shook her head im just ahell and damnation nate you know what i am she set a hand on the book in his lap you go nate you can tell marse robert what its all about bettern i ever could me caudell was temptedanyone who brought something this important to richmond would become important himself if only by association but then regretfully he said no it wouldnt be right for one thing you got the book so you should be the one who takes it for another youve lived at rivington so you can tell marse robert all about it hell want to know that the rivington men were strong for forrest in the election oh were they ever mollie said you never heard such cussin and fussin and carryin oil as when tennessee went for lee there you see and besides mollie youre already traveling me i have to teach school tomorrow and the next day and the day after that or else throwaway a job i like and that im good at he took a deep breath ill do it if i have to i guess but youre a better choice but im nothin but a nocount whore mollie wailed marse robert he wont want nothin to do with the likes of me i dont know he has an eye for pretty ladies they say caudell said but that made matters worse not better he tugged at his beard then suddenly grinned and asked do you still have your old uniform yeah i do she replied sounding puzzled at the change of subject what about it if you wont go as mollie go as melvin he said you know marse robert would do whatever needed doing for one of his old soldiersand you soldiered as hard as anybody she had to nod slowly she said might could be thatd work her laugh came shaky but it was a laugh always kept it in case i had to get out of somewhere quiet and sneakylike never reckoned id want to get into someplace that way a hand flew up to her hair hate to chop this short again after its been growin since the war but if it needs doin it needs doin i got me a little scissors right here she rummaged in one of the carpetbags found what she was looking for handed caudell the scissors you cut it nate you can see what youre doin caudell hadnt cut hair since the war ended a negro barber would have laughed scornfully at the job he did but when he was through mollie looked more like a man or at least a beardless youth than a woman but the dress she still wore and the feel of her thick curly hair running through his fingers as he worked the occasional moments when his hands brushed against the smooth warm skin of her cheek her ear her neck reminded him she was no man even if she could put on the outer seeming of one her hands checked what he had accomplished she smiled with her hair short all at once it was the saucy smile of the mollie beside whom hed marched and foughtand lain thats good nate thank you you want to shut the door there so as i can change he did as she asked after a moments hesitation he stood outside in the hallway through the thin wood panel he heard her chuckle and felt himself blush she opened the door a couple of minutes later how do i look shabby was the first word that came to mind no one could look anything but shabby in trousers tunic and forage cap that had gone through the war even if those clothes were cleaned and mended as mollies were but seeing her in uniform somehow excited him in a way her hoop skirt and petticoats had notthis was the way shed looked when he went to her cabin she was used to reading mens eyes you want to come back inside nate she asked softly handy thing about this outfit is it goes off a sight easier than the one i had on before not trusting himself to speak he nodded stepped in and closed the door again they lay side by side afterwards on the narrow clothesstrewn bed the next to last candle nate had got from wren tisdale still burned had the saloonkeeper known he could have leered with impunity mollie stroked caudells cheek just above the line where his beard started she said i always remembered you were sweet about it you treat me like im somebody not justa place to stick it in funny he said sitting up i always thought the same about youthat you werent just going through the motions i mean not with you other timesoh the hell with other times i wish grimacing she broke off without saying what she wished caudell thought he could make a fair guess he rather wished she had no other times to come between them too mollie got off the bed and started to dress so did caudell the room was cold as he pulled up his trousers he said i have some money saved up that i can give you for train fare if you need it he did not have much but for this he was ready to use it dont fret yourself mollie finished buttoning her privates tunic then slid over her head a small velvet bag on a thong she tucked it under the tunic it clinked slightly as it settled between her breasts i hear tell golds still right scarce most places but not in rivington you seen that for yourself i got plenty all right caudell said not altogether unhappily he thought of something else when you go to richmond dont go back through rivington in case benny lang has noticed his book is missing after all the rivington men might be watching the wilmington and weldon railroad go south to goldsboro from rocky mount then over to raleigh or greensboro so you can head north on the raleigh and gaston or the north carolina railroad up to the richmond and danville thats right smart nate ill do it mollie promised ill hire me a wagon first thing tomorrow to take me to the rocky mount train station she grinned a grin that took him back to their days round campfires together wont mr wren tisdale be confused when i go downstairs in the mornin not unless you go barefoot he said noticing a gap in her disguise he kicked one of his shoes over to her heretake these i have another pair in my room my feet wont freeze on the way back reckon my shoesll fit you like socks on a chicken but if you have to you can get yourself some proper ones on your way north oh nate not your shoes but she saw the need for what hed said as clearly as he did she stooped started to put them on then stopped and stuffed the toes with waddedup clothes from a carpet bag just like idve done in the war taking big ones off a dead yankee she got up and hugged him thanks for not thinkin im crazy on account of all this thanks for she hugged him again hard for bein a friend and more than a friend he hugged her too felt the womanly shape of her through the uniform that masked it from the eye more than a friend indeed he thought come back here when you can if you care to he said it was not any sort of promise but it was as close to one as he could make himself come had she pressed for more he might well have fought shy of the little hed said but she only nodded maybe shed not expected even so much freezing mud squelched between his toes as he walked out of the liberty bell his head though his head was in the clouds and not just because hed broken a long spell of abstinence not only had he held a willing woman in his arms hed somehow held a bit of the future in his hands lee walked out of st pauls episcopal church the shadow cast by george washingtons equestrian statue across ninth street in capitol square shielded his eyes from the low wan winter sun beside him jefferson davis said a fine sermon do you not agree yes as usual lee said mr president let me tell you again how grateful i am that you have agreed to serve as my secretary of war i hesitated to ask it of you lest you should feel it beneath your dignity to assume a cabinet position after having held the presidency davis snorted nonsense sir i am ineligible under the constitution to continue as president if i am to remain in public life it must necessarily be at some lower level the post you offered suits me well and i am glad to have it lee was about to reply when a light hesitant voice said beggin your pardon general lee sir frowning he turned to deal with whoever had presumed to interrupt his conversation with president davis he saw a smoothfaced private in a worn uniform clutching a parcel wrapped in coarse brown paper and twine to his chest yes private he asked voice polite but frosty the soldier who at second glance looked not quite young enough to be so free of beard came to attention but held on to the parcel mmelvin bean sir th north carolina i got here a book you ought to see sir never mind that now young man jefferson davis said impatiently he walked on looking back to see if lee was following lee was about to when the private said something that made him stop in his tracks its a book from rivington sir is it lee said davis had gone too far to hear the halfdozen soft nervous words but seeing that the ordinary soldier had somehow gained lees attention he shrugged and headed off toward the presidential mansion yes sir it surely is melvin bean said the private gulped licked his lips and then went on in a ragged whisper other thing you ought to know sir is that inside this here book it says it was printed in nineteen hundred and sixty sir by god lee said softly private bean looked ready to bolt and run lee did not blame him in the least he himself knew the secret of the rivington men but if this common soldier had somehow stumbled across it not only would he have trouble believing it he would have even more trouble believing anyone else would believe it quickly lee set out to ease his mind private you had better come back to the powhatan house with me this is most assuredly something i must see have you a horse no sircame up by train melvin bean gaped at him blurted youyou mean you believe me sir just like that just like that lee agreed gravely wait here a moment if you please he ducked back inside the church spoke with a vestryman then returned to private bean therenow traveller will be seen to walk up capitol square and then to the hotel with me if you would be so kind and tell me how this book its called the picture history of the civil war sir bean said the picture history of the civil war from you said a shiver of wonder ran up lees spine how would the second american revolution look from a distance of a hundred years he and melvin bean turned right from ninth onto broad street tell me at once how it came into your possession the story was less than clear and left him imperfectly edified he gathered a woman friend of beans had actually gotten the book away from the stronghold of america will break but a couple of times the private said i when he meant she lee did not press him for the sake of a volume from rivingtonand from he was willing to overlook a discrepancy or three private bean by his accent was a country boy lee expected him to gape at the red velvet and goldleaf splendor of the powhatan houses lobby but he took it in stride merely muttering something lee did not quite catch to him it sounded like its not a not a hilton lee led him to his own suite and closed the door after them he turned on the gaslight sat by it and pulled up another chair for melvin bean now if i may the picture history of the civil war in anticipation he slipped on his spectacles bean handed him the parcel he cut the twine with a pen knife undid the paper wrapper and stared at the book for a long moment before he opened it the unusual quality of the printing struck him at once his lips shaped a silent whistle when he saw the copyright and publication dates he turned the page came to the introduction for a moment he was confused and jolted when he read of the wars ending with the souths surrender then he understood and said quietly so this is how it would have been had the rivington men not come back to us sir melvin bean said he was at the very edge of his seat and still looked ready to flee at any moment he also looked hungry lee had seen that expression too many times in the war ever to mistake it he stood up melvin bean bounced to his feet too lee took some bills out of a trouser pocket handed twenty dollars to the private soldier why dont you buy yourself some dinner young man the cooks here are quite fine ask for my usual table in the dining room and tell them to send a boy back here to me if they doubt your right to sit there later perhaps i shall have questions for you but first i want to read awhile bean stared at the money without reaching for it i couldnt take that from you general lee sir lee pressed it into the privates hand you can and you shall i got money o my own melvin bean said drawing himself up with prickly pride as may be use this anyhow please if for no other reason than as a token of my thanks for having brought this volume to my notice he took bean by the elbow steered the private to the door and pointed in the direction of the dining room go ahead please as a favor to me still shaking his head melvin bean walked slowly down the hall lee went back to his chair picked up the picture history of the civil war and plunged in he was not normally an enthusiastic reader when hed come back to richmond from augusta georgia hed had half a dozen chapters to go in quentin durward and those six chapters remained unread to this day but he held in his hands a volume he had never imagined he would be able to examine he eagerly seized the chance this bruce cattons style was less latinate less ornate more downtoearth than lee would have expected from a serious work of history he soon ceased to notice he was after information and the smooth flowing text and astonishing pictures made it easy to acquire he had to remind himself that cat ton was writing long after the war ended and that to the historian it had not gone as he himself remembered but the odd tone ran deeper than that cat ton plainly saw chattel slavery as an outmoded institution which deserved to perish to him the emancipation proclamation gave the united states the moral high ground for the rest of the war lee had trouble squaring that with what andries rhoodie had said about the hatred between black and white which was to come the sun sank the only light left in lees room was the yellow pool beneath the gas lamp he never noticedhe had reached and all at once the world he knew turned sideways he studied grants campaign against him and shermans against joseph johnston and nodded most soberly that relentless hammering used northern resources simply to club the confederacy into submission it was the sort of attack he had feared most and one which only the rivington mens aks could have disrupted he winced when he read of john bell hood taking johnstons command in front of atlanta hood had the fierce visage of a lion and boldness to match at the head of a division he was a nonpareil but for boldness though he lacked all qualification for army command he would attack whether attack was called for or notover the next few pages lee read what had comewhat would have come he made himself rememberof that he also took far more careful note of the political maneuvering in this other version of the war than he would have before his own notaltogethervoluntary entry into politics he was unsurprised to discover lincoln reelected andries rhoodie had told him of that but rhoodie had also spoken of lincoln treating the confederate states as conquered provinces after their defeat and that proved nothing but a lie even with the war all but won lincoln had tried to get the federal congress to compensate southern slaveholders for the animate property they were losing past reunion and emancipation lincoln had intended to impose no harsh terms upon the states which had lost their war for independence absurdly rage filled lee at rhoodies untruth a man who knew the future might at least have the courtesy to report it correctly he thought that rhoodie had lied argued he and america will break had their own political agenda one which they aimed to impose on the confederacy given their support for nathan bedford forrest and all their efforts against the negro the nature of that agenda was easy enough to deduce the permanent dominance of the white man but by the tone of the picture history of the civil war white supremacy was an outmoded idea in their own day just as the course of history would have led lee to believe did that make them maverick heroes or simply mavericks the question being unanswerable for the time being lee put it aside and kept reading he pursed his lips and tightly clenched his jaw when he came upon a picture of a wrecked locomotive in the burnedout ruins of the richmond and petersburg railroad depot a few pages farther on he encountered himself old grim and defeated standing on the back porch of the rented house in which he and his wife had lived in richmond it was uncanny seeing himself in a photograph for which hed never posed as eerie was the photograph on the facing page of his farewell order to the army of northern virginia unmistakably in the handwriting of charles marshall and as unmistakably nothing marshall had been compelled by fate to write he read of lincolns second inaugural address and of the broad peace lincoln hoped to gain and a page later he read of the bullet that had slain lincoln on good friday evening in he clicked his tongue between his teeth at the thought of a president dying at an assassins hands then all at once he shivered as if suddenly seized by an ague he had seen lincoln in louisville that good friday had listened to him plead without avail for kentucky to stay in the union had even spoken with him he shivered again in defeat in the world he knew lincoln had wanted to martyr himself for the united states in the other world where there was no need for it he had been made a martyr in the hour of his greatest triumph at last lee closed the picture history of the civil war his joints creaked and protested when he got up from his chair how long had he been sitting rapt he took out his watch he blinkedit was after midnight dear god ive entirely forgotten melvin bean he exclaimed he hoped the young soldier had bought supper as well as dinner with his money hoped even more that he was still hereperhaps stretched out asleep on a couch in the hotel lobbyto be questioned lee opened the door hurried down the hall to find out to his dismay he found no grayclad soldier taking his ease in the lobby or at the bar no waiter recalled serving supper to any such person scowling lee headed for the front desk bean had said he had money maybe just maybe hed taken a room here the desk clerk regretfully spread his hands no sir nobody by that name has checked in today he spun the registration book on its revolving stand so lee could see for himself then he turned to the bank of pigeonholes behind him this came in for you this afternoon though sir sure enough the envelope he held out bore lees name in a sprawling scrawl lee accepted it with a word of thanks slit it open when he saw what was inside his breath went out in a surprised hiss something wrong sir the clerk asked anxiously after a moment lee said no nothing wrong he took the twenty dollars out of the envelope returned the bills to his pocket and slowly walked back to his room what can i do for you today general lee andries rhoodie asked more than ordinary curiosity in his deep rough voice i tell you straight out id not expected you to ask me for a meeting nor had i expected the need for my doing so to arise lee answered i find however that you and your colleagues have been less than completely candid with me and with others in the confederacy concerning the course events would have taken had america will break not intervened on our behalfor perhaps on your own behalf would phrase it more accurately haw rhoodie fleered laughter you find that do you i tell you now what i have said before is the truth and even if it werent how the devil would you know lee sat beside a small marbletopped table covered at the moment with an antimacassar borrowed from the couch he pulled the cloth aside to reveal the picture history of the civil war by this means sir rhoodies air of disdainful arrogance crashed in ruins for the first time since hed known the rivington man lee saw him altogether at a loss rhoodie lost color gave back a pace sank heavily into a chair his mouth opened but no sound came forth after a few seconds of gathering himself he tried again how did you come by that book that is none of your affair lee said though he had no intention of revealing it to rhoodie the question still bothered him as far as he could tell melvin bean had disappeared from richmond nor had discreet questions at the railway depots revealed anyone who had seen a person of his description boarding a southbound train whether in uniform or other mens clothing lee had also had the military records examined sure enough a melvin bean had been mustered out along with the rest of the th north carolina in but there the trail ended it was a puzzle but one that was not relevant here and now he went on in any event no matter how i obtained the volume it speaks for itself so it does rhoodie said rallying he was neither weakling nor fool and not a man to be cast down long it tells you how the united states would have crushed your country and your dreams to dust without us youve not been any too bloody grateful for our help either i freely acknowledge it lee said as for gratitude i should feel more were i surer your aid was disinterested intended to further our ends rather than your own some of us died in the taking of washington rhoodie growled i know but for what cause lee reached out to lay a hand on the picture history of the civil war as you can imagine i have read this work repeatedly and with the closest attention yes our struggle for freedom would have failed without you in so much you told the truth but in other regardsyou spoke of lincolns tyranny over us of ceaseless strife between black and white of other evils whereof your book here makes no mention what it does mention is a continuing search for justice and equality between the races one incomplete even in that distant future day but nonetheless of vital import to both north and south this seems to me to be in accord with a continuation of the trends that have grown here in my own century and dead against your account of what lies ahead nonsense a wave of rhoodies hand brushed aside lees words or would you care for one of your daughters to marry a kaffir and submit to his loving embrace lee did not particularly care for the idea of his daughters marrying at all he answered no to be frank i should not care for that but it is neither here nor there the discrepancy between your words and the tone of this history makes me wonder whether you and american will break are in accord with the spirit of the future as you claim or whether you are in fact as misplaced and out of step with your own time as john brown was with his andries rhoodie had gone white before now he turned red one big fist clenched his guttural accent came thicker than lee had ever heard it as he ground out since you aim on taking the confederacy to the devil general lee we will show you what we are that i vow do not think to threaten me sir i do not threaten rhoodie said i promise xvi you jus leave it all to me marse robert john dabney said i promise i take care of everythin for you make your inauguration day special robert e lee liked that kind of talk whether from a junior officer during the war or as now from a caterer smiling he said i place myself entirely in your hands john the rotund negro beamed make me a raft o mint juleps for drinks the prince of wales he like my mint juleps you know that sir so ive heard yes now lee kept a damper on his smile dabney told that story at any excuse or none but it was true when the prince visited richmond in hed praised the colored mans juleps to the skies the renown that won dabney helped him gain so many cooking and bartending jobs that he d been able to buy himself and his wife their freedom before the end of the war hed started his own restaurant and catering service since then no one who was anyone in richmond would think of holding a large entertainment without his supervision dabneys eyes got a faraway look as he added some detail to the feast that would follow lees installation as president the negro could neither read nor write he had to carry in his head all the preparations for each of the banquets he had in progress nobody had ever known him to slip up on that account lee went into the bedroom of his powhatan house suite there julia and his daughters were helping mary custis lee into her gown you look lovely my dear he said that shade of creamy yellow is particularly becoming to you i wish id had the seamstress make a jacket to go with the dress his wife answered its a raw day out there early march is apt to be lee admitted still the sun is shining if id chosen to be sworn in on washingtons birthday as president davis did rather than waiting until march we should have displayed ourselves in capitol square in the midst of a snowstorm hardly an edifying spectacle for the people why did you decide to wait his daughter mary asked with the familys connection to washington id expected you to follow daviss lead i had two reasons one was fear of the weather which proved justified the other was that the constitution prescribes march as the first day of a new presidents term and i desire to observe scrupulously its every provision lee reflected on his own hypocrisy while following all the meaningless minutiae for his inauguration he aimed to sidle around the much more prominent constitutional prohibitions against interfering with slavery he intensely disliked feeling like a hypocrite which was both alien and repugnant to his nature but a show of observance on small matters would help mask his deviation in great ones and he was resolved to deviate the success of a man like john dabney pointed up the injustice of slavery as no abolitionist tract could aside from the caterers undoubted ability that was one reason lee had engaged him if legislators saw a successful black man in action they might be more inclined to allow other negroes to seek the same road mildred lee fastened a last stay were ready father she said excellent then let us proceed i want a lap robe lest i catch my death mary custis lee declared fetch your mother a lap robe and quickly lee said with a pointed glance at his watch the ceremony is to commence at half past eleven oclock mildred draped the robe over her mothers knees is that fast enough to suit you she asked or if id taken longer would you have left without us the way you used to march off to church by yourself sometimes when we were slow lee whose natural sense of punctuality had been reinforced by more than thirtyfive years of military discipline said as well you didnt expose me to the temptation mildred stuck out her tongue at him he made an effort at looking severe but found he was smiling in spite of himself julia started to push mary custis lees chair but lee waved her away this was a duty he would undertake himself rather than going out to the lobby of the powhatan house he headed for the hotels rear doorway which opened right across from capitol square his daughters walked proudly behind him their wide skirts rustling as they glided down the hall chill air smote lees breath puffed from him as if he had suddenly taken up pipe smoking his wife pulled the lap robe higher there you see i should have frozen she said lee reached down to pat her shoulder i am glad you have it capitol street and the paths through capitol square already swarmed with people making their way toward the covered wooden platform which had been erected under the statue of washington marshals with drawn swordsand with aks slung on their backsbriefly halted the tide to let lee and his family cross before he and albert gallatin brown were sworn in on that platform other ceremonies awaited at the confederate capitol marshals helped lee wrestle his wifes chair up the stairs to the flagdraped entrance to the capitol the chief marshal a plump superannuated colonel of ordnance named charles dimmock saluted mr presidentelect he boomed lee inclined his head mr chief marshal congressman sion rogers of north carolina bustled up to lee mr presidentelect on behalf of the joint committee on arrangements it is my privilege to welcome you to the congress of the confederate states of america if you and your charming family will please to come with me he escorted the lees into the chamber of the virginia house of delegatesthe virginia legislature continued to meet in the capitol along with the confederate congress congressmen senators members of the virginia senate and house virginias governor smith several other state heads judges generals and clergymen packed the hall along with a goodly number of reporters they converged on lee until colonel dimmock interposed his formidable person between the throng and the presidentelect the minister from the united states caught lees eye congratulations general or rather mr presidentelect thank you mr pendleton lee answered gravely george pendleton a former congressman from ohio was a close friend to us vice president vallandigham and had favored peaceful accommodation with the south throughout the second american revolution lee added let me applaud you on general sheridans recent capture of winnipeg your armies continue to perform very well as does your ironclad fleet on the great lakes you are generous to a recent foe what pendleton meant by that was thanks for forbearing to comment on the complete dominance of the british fleet on the high seas not only had boston harbor been bombarded again but a force of english marines had seized and burned san francisco then reembarked on their ships and departed before us forces could do anything about it if you will come with me mr presidentelect congressman rogers said lee obediently followed him to the front of the chamber jefferson and varina davis albert gallatin brown and his wife roberta and outgoing vice president alexander stephens a lifelong bachelor were already standing there chatting so were lees three sons and joseph brown albert gallatin browns other son bob captured at gettysburg had emerged from a northern prison camp so weak that he had died a year after the war ended there you see mildred we are the last to arrive lee said his youngest daughter only sniffed he laughed a little mildred was incorrigible as he came up he noticed that while varina davis and roberta brown were talking animatedly their husbands longtime political foes in mississippi still had little to say to each other that is a lovely ring mrs davis roberta brown remarked may i see it more closely varina davis extended a slim shapely hand mr davis gave it to me upon our engagement a dozen small diamonds surround an emeraldcut sapphire lovely mrs brown said again the mounting is also very fine work the talk broke off when jefferson davis saw lee approaching and hurried up to shake his hand albert and joseph brown followed as did stephens and lees own sons lee also bowed over the hands of varina davis and roberta brown jefferson davis said i leave you a nation at peace and secure within its borders sir god grant that you may offer your successor a similar boon congressman rogers who wore a harassed expression consulted a scrap of paper he carried in his left hand if you ladies and gentlemen will be so kind as to form a receiving line first you mr vice president then the vice presidentelects family then mr brown himself then the presidents family and mr davis then the lees and finally general lee himself in the place of honor at the end he repeated himself several times and chivvied people about until he had them all where he wanted them dignitaries began filing past shaking hands and offering best wishes lee returned murmured words of thanks which he wondered if they heard finally senator louis wigfall of texas broke the routine nathan bedford forrests defeated running mate was a burly broadshouldered man with a fierce countenance and a long thick beard he growled if you think youre gonna turn the niggers loose general lee youll do it only over my dead body i do hope it wont come to that lee said quietlylet wigfall make of the answer what he would the texan stopped stared scowled and at last forced by the crowd behind him moved on lees arm was tired and his hand sore when congressman rogers declared the hour now nears half past twelve oclock we shall proceed out through the east door of the capitol to the platform in the following order first chief marshal dimmock and his marshals next the band which hasi hopegathered by the east door next the members of the joint committee on arrangements next the presidentelect attended by the outgoing president next the vice presidentelect attended by the outgoing vice president next the families of these officials next the members of the old and new cabinetsexcluding mr davis for obvious reasonsand their families next he went on for some time marshaling his hosts like any good general senators and congressmen even lined up in columns of four the press made up the rear of the procession behind masons and members of other benevolent societies but ahead of the generality of citizens the band began blaring dixie as lee made his way toward the east doorcongressman rogers let out an audible sigh of relief to hear them lee remembered the last time he had left the hall of delegates a band had played then too for he had just been invested with the command of the armed forces of a virginia not yet even formally affiliated to the confederate states of america his step faltered for a moment as he thought of the changes he had been part of through the past seven years outside colonel dimmock was shouting at the generality of citizens who already crowded capitol square make way for president lee without the president you dont have a show make way make way marshals move them aside the marshals did their best slowly the procession began to advance the journey to the base of washingtons statue took three times as long as it should have lee fidgeted nervously as he went along at slow march jefferson davis set a calming hand on his arm the crush does not matter not today as the good colonel said without you we have no show caught out like a small boy at some naughty act lee spread his hands in a show of guilt the band still playing lustily took its place to one side of the wooden platform after the marshals cleared away the numerous citizens who had thought the area ideal for viewing the inaugural ceremony that only packed the rest of the square more tightly crowds spilled out onto ninth street and capitol street snarling traffic on both thoroughfares and creating a hubbub which in both volume and intensity seemed inappropriate to the celebration about to take place having displaced the improperly situated spectators the marshals spread out along the front of the platform there were at most a dozen of them it was no great show of force lee thought of lincolns inaugural in a country coming apart where sharpshooters peered from the windows of the us capitol and a battery of artillery remained just out of sight in case insurrection broke out without warning no such fears disrupted the confederate states not today lee and jefferson davis ascended to the platform so did alexander stephens and albert gallatin brown the members of the joint committee on arrangements already stood up there congressman rogers had another list in his hand yes bishop johns your place is up here as is yours of course judge halyburton colonel dimmock you too if you please and the president of the senate and the speaker of the house of representatives and you governor smith for our other distinguished guests we have seats waiting down here at the front he pointed to the rows of wooden chairs there marked off by a gilded rope there was only one problem with those wooden chairsnot enough of them had been set out senators and members of the virginia house of delegates reporters and congressmen and cabinet members rowed like kilkenny cats as they tried to stake out places to sit lee watched the unseemly spectacle for a couple of minutes then turned to charles dimmock mr chief marshal may i beg a favor and ask that my wife be brought up here given her infirmity i fear she may not be altogether safe in that seething crowd ill see to it sir dimmock leaned over called a couple of junior marshals to his side the husky young men pushed their way through the squabbling dignitariesseeing a minister pull a congressmans beard lee wondered how many duels would arise from the days eventsmake their way to mary custis lee whom her children had protectively surrounded and with the help of her sons got her and her chair onto the platform thank you robert she said this is much better for me a gust of wind tugged at her bonnet she snatched up a hand to keep it from being blown away when all the chairs were taken and those unable to gain them had been banished beyond the pale of the gilded rope the band at a signal from sion rogers fell silent the congressman shouted the right reverend bishop johns will now ask the lords blessing on this auspicious day the noise from the crowd did not cease but it did diminish as the bishop splendid in the glistening silks of his vestments stepped forward to the edge of the platform let us pray he said lee bent his head but not before he saw the wind blow off the bishops miter johns made a catch a baseball player would have been proud of set the runaway headgear more firmly in place several people cheered ignoring them the bishop repeated let us pray almighty god guide and protect us in our efforts to perpetuate the principles which by your blessing our fathers were able to vindicate establish and transmit to us their posterity our hope remains reverently fixed on you whose favor is ever vouchsafed to the cause which is just with humble gratitude and adoration acknowledging the providence which has so visibly protected the confederacy during its brief but eventful career we trustingly commit ourselves to you so that with the continuance of your favor gratefully acknowledged we may look forward to success to peace and to prosperity for our nation amen amen echoed from the crowd as bishop johns stepped back judge j d halyburton of the confederate court at richmond strode ponderously forward to take his place the judge had a bible under his arm his voice was a bass rumble that suited the massive frame his black robe could not altogether conceal the president of the senate of the confederate states of america having informed me that senator albert gallatin brown of the state of mississippi has obtained a majority of the electoral votes cast for the office of vice president of the confederate states of america i now have the honor to invite senator brown here to me to set his hand upon the holy scriptures and take his oath of office judge halyburton held out the bible to brown raise your right hand sir as his runningmate was formally invested with the vice presidency lee looked out at the sea of faces all turned toward the platform most were still and attentive watching and doing their best to hear brown take his oath a small commotion a hundred yards away or perhaps a bit more drew lees eyeseveral men were trying to elbow their way closer to the platform through the tightly packed crowd lee wondered why most of them were tall enough to see over the heads in front of them judge halyburton was booming i now have the honor to invite general lee here to me to set his hand upon the holy scriptures and take his oath of office lee took off his hat as he walked over to the judge the wind kicked up again blowing his coat open he tried to keep it in place with his arms and hoped the chilly breeze would not cause him to catch cold set your hat down for a moment if you would halyburton said quietly lee obeyed putting his foot down on the edge of the brim so the hat would not flyaway from him his left hand went onto the bible at full volume once more the judge said raise your right hand again lee obeyed then phrase by phrase he repeated the presidential oath i robert edward leedo solemnly swearthat i will faithfully executethe office of president of the confederate statesand will to the best of my abilitypreserve protect and defendthe constitution thereof on his own he added so help me god judge halyburtons plump cheeks got plumper as he grinned and stuck out a hand let me be the first to offer you my best wishes president lee thank you sir lee retrieved his hat as if that were a cue the band played dixie again the crowed cheered and clapped over the music lee used those couple of minutes to review his inaugural address he hoped it would not slide out of his mind the moment he began to speak hed spent the last several days working to memorize it but knew he lacked the lifelong politicians gift for storing away long stretches of prose the music stopped the crowd grewquieter when lee decided they were as quiet as they were going to get he took a deep breath and began wishing he owned judge halyburtons stentorian tones the trust you the people of the confederate states of america have reposed in me makes me all too conscious of my own inadequacies further the great achievements of my predecessor the illustrious jefferson davis founding president of our happy confederacy set a standard i despair of emulating in the face of formidable odds he secured for us our independence from the government of the united states which was determined to deny us our right to such independence he just then the fickle wind flicked his hat out of his hand leaving him with the unpalatable choice of losing his dignity by letting it blow away or losing his dignity by bending to pick it up it lay at his feet as if mocking him he glared down at it before the wind could sweep it off the platform he stooped down and grabbed it something craacked through the space his head had just occupied a bullet the unsleeping soldiers part of his mind reported he started to straighten another bullet tugged at his coat sleeve parting the material neat as a scissors judge halyburton had never seen combat all through the war hed served on the bench in richmond but nothing was wrong with his reactions he swept out a thick arm and knocked lee off the platform he stumbled and went to all fours when he hit the ground below an instant later the judge crashed down beside him with a cry of pain blood soaking his robes from a shoulder wound lee leaped to his feet started to scramble back onto the platform so he could see what was going ona dignified even boring occasion had turned to horror in the wink of an eye judge halyburton grabbed his ankle and held him back stay down here you damned fool he shouted its you theyre shooting at that had not occurred to lee despite reading of lincolns assassination in the picture history of the civil war he still found the idea of political murder in america as alien as that sideways world wherein the south had lost its war for freedom thinking of that other world and of having seen those big men elbowing through the crowd made him suddenly dreadfully certain who the they doing the shooting were the rivington men he exclaimed and tried to break free of judge halyburtons grip let me got but the judge clung to him limpetlike with all the strength in his unwounded left arm bullets kept flying with the extravagant frequency that marked the use of repeating weapons through his own startlement through the rising tide of shouts and screams from the crowd lee noted that these repeaters whatever they were and to whomever they belonged sounded different from the aks to which hed become accustomed he also noted that while the assassins had failed to slay him with their first shots they were not giving up all but one of the marshals who had served as ceremonial guards in front of the platform were down dead or wounded the sole unhurt man had his repeater on his shoulder but hesitated to fire because of the crush of people between him and the gunmen and because of the innocent people behind them the assassins had no such compunctions lee finally twisted free from judge halyburton he leaped up onto the platform only to be knocked flat by jefferson davis stay low the justbecomeformer president bawled in his ear as if to underline his words another stream of bullets buzzed by the platform was a charnel house blood and bodies everywhere wounded men shrieked marys chair lay on its side two wheels in the air ice ran through lee my wife he gasped he had wanted her to be able to see his moment of triumph nowmary he said again davis did not or perhaps would not answer him the crowd surged like the sea gone mad most people were trying to flee the assassins but some men moved purposefully toward them amidst the continued chatter of the strange repeaters single pistol shots began to bark a fair number of citizens habitually went armed and almost all of them had fought in the second american revolution after the initial shock their instinct was to hit back the marshal with the ak fired three quick rounds then he reeled backwards the rifle flew from his hands as he clutched at his neck a dignitary in frock coat and top hat snatched up the weapon and began to shoot with a confidence that showed he had been a wartime infantry soldier within moments three other men grabbed fallen marshals rifles and followed his example but the assassins kept shooting too lee wondered how that was possible given the fire now coming against them from every side and their lack of any cover save the panicked folk around them yet the repeaters that were not aks snarled on and on men and women toppled and screamed more bullets cracked by some just above lees head after what seemed forever but was lees pocket watch insisted only a couple of minutes the assassins weapons at last fell silent jefferson davis cautiously raised his head when nothing happened he let lee up dear god lee groaned getting his first long look at the slaughter all around hed known the aftermath of battle ever since his days in mexico more than twenty years before during the second american revolution hed seen more slaughter than one man had any business knowing but never in his worst nightmares had he imagined a firefight in the midst of a crowd of civilianscombat was for soldiers not innocent bystanders if the murderers out there had ever heard of that rule they laughed at it men in silk cravats and men in farmers overalls women in faded calico and women in glistening taffetas bled and moaned and cried for nothing more than being in the wrong place at the wrong time and up on the platform where the assassins had concentrated their fire lee had trouble telling who was slain who wounded and who merely splashed with other peoples blood then he saw that albert gallatin brown for one would never get up again the new vice president of the confederate states had a neat hole above his right eye while the back of his head was a white and crimson horror of blownout brains and bone jefferson davis yanked off his coat began tearing at it to make bandages to help the injured lee knew he ought to do likewise but he couldnt not yethed just noticed his wifes skirts behind her overturned chair mary he said she did not answer but she might well not have heard him through the groans and wails all around he hurried to her death had been kind as far as death ever is she looked surprised not hurt but her staring eyes would never see anything again blood soaked her breast and pooled all around her a single round had gone in one side of her throat and quite neatly out the other as if from very far away people shouted general lee sir president lee the titles reminded him that public duty came before private pain he made himself turn his head away from the woman with whom hed shared almost thirtyseven years tears would come later when he had time for them now now someone was yelling one of the bastards is still alive president lee even through shock and anguish that could still surprise him like a splash of cold water it helped clear his head he said then he must be kept so we shall have answers for this bring him up here at once while he waited he leaned over the edge of the platform down to where judge halyburton sat holding his shoulder with his good hand and using some most unjudicial language your honor lee said and then again more urgently your honor what do you need halyburton growled for this day never to have happened as fast as the thought appeared lee forced it down no time for it and no use to it he said i believe and hope momentarily to confirm that the men who committed this cowardly atrocity belong to the society that calls itself america will break that society has for some years housed itself in the building across from mechanics hall he pointed toward the western corner of capitol square sure enough through the trees he saw the rivington mens flag still flying will you grant us a warrant to search those premises goddam right i will halyburton said and if thats where the snakes lair is sir ill tell you to get yourself somewhere else besides here a good shot could hit you from there hes right mr president jefferson davis said get to cover at once behind washingtons monument he did not wait for lee to argue but forced him down off the bloodsoaked platform and then behind the sheltering marble and bronze at the same time he shouted a guard for president lee the guard detachment was surely the highestranking in the history of the confederate states as a good half of its members were generals who had come to watch one of their own inaugurated they held bared swords weapons hardly more likely to be useful than the drums and fifes and horns of the bandsmen who also crowded round to protect lee despite the guards despite daviss warnings lee looked around the base of the statue of washington more folk than judge halyburton alone must have heard what he said about the headquarters of america will break for men marched purposefully toward it through the stillmilling crowd this is a hard day for the country lee said we shall sorely miss vice president brown as well as the other casualties we have suffered and his voice broke if he let himself think about and he would not be able to do what manifestly had to be done and would wait would have to wait davis set an understanding hand on his shoulder he nodded gratefully said i hopei praymrs davis is safe yes she is well praise be to godi saw her your own loss davis looked uncommonly grim we shall have a reckoning for this day and hang these wretches higher than hamana better end than they merit too lees sons big men like himself forced their way through the guards to him blood splashed custis and rob by the way they ignored it it was not their own lees mouth twisted when he saw roonie cradling a wounded hand against his other arm for a moment he could not help being father rather than leader your sisters your wives he demanded harshly none of them hurt custis said and lees shoulders slumped in thanks then custis went on but sir is mother tears cut clean tracks through the crimson stains on his cheeks yes my dear boys she lee again checked himself before he dissolved in sorrow with his sons just then a congressman and a fellow in the ragged clothes of a day laborer dragged konrad de buys up to him he knew a crazy kind of relief duty always pulled him out of his private concerns how often mary had taken him to task for that maryhe scowled and focused his attention on de buys the rivington mans face usually bold and boyish was pale and twisted with pain hed been shot in the right wrist and left shoulder blood soaked hastilyand no doubt grudginglyapplied bandages his eyes widened just for an instant when he saw lee then as best he could through the torment of his wounds he set his features to reveal nothing he even managed an ironic nod of greeting lee had always admired de buyss gallantry to find it still displayed under such circumstances wrung from him a cry almost of despair why sir why what did we ever do to merit such treatment at your hands you know the answer to that de buys said and lee remembered andries rhoodies voice tolling like an iron bell i do not threaten i promise now the rivington man permitted himself an expression selfreproach who would have thought we could bugger up this operation against the likes of you you mind your mouth you son of a bitch the day laborer snarled shaking de buys like a rat the rivington man set his teeth against the agony that must have shot through himthen lashed out with a foot and caught his captor right between the legs the day laborer collapsed with a groan clutching at his privates de buys did not even try to run he managed a haggard smile for lee and another nod as if inviting him to ask the next question before lee could speak gunfire crackled in front of the building that had sheltered america will break since more screams and shouts arose from the civilians still milling about in capitol square konrad de buyss smile got wider you will not find us easy meat for your slaughter nor did you find us so lee said which sobered the rivington man jefferson davis said the snakes in their nest will presently discover as this one has that their plot against you miscarried mr president again i urge you to repair to a location out of rifle range from that nest lee was about to refuse then he glanced at konrad de buys saw the rivington man watching him in turn the intensity of de buyss gaze made him stop and think hard the offices of america will break looked across franklin street to mechanics hall not back toward capitol square as davis said whatever rivington men remained at their headquarters might well have thought their attack successful until armed men approached the building if he stayed where he was he gratuitously offered them a second chance to make it so very well sir he said quietly let us return to the capitol then a building easily secured against anything short of artillery daviss nod was grateful konrad de buyss face once more revealed nothing save pain and indifference most of the rivington men were good at secreting away their thoughts but lee judged from the very blankness of the mask that de buys concealed disappointment not delight the plan had been for sion rogers to escort him from capitol square to the presidential residence after the inaugural address and for some other member of the joint committee on arrangements to conduct albert gallatin brown back to his rented house the plan thanks to the rivington men lay messily dead so did albert gallatin brown rogers lee thought was only wounded back at the capitol lee sent urgent orders down to the armory and the powder works there if anywhere in richmond he would be able to lay hands on a decent number of properly trained soldiers the confederate capital was a city at peace who would have imagined it needed garrisoning against its own lee stood surrounded by his countrys highest commanders but they had no men to lead james longstreet was saying something to the same effect an old indianfighters joke about too many chiefs lee only half heard him he was considering the extent of konrad de buyss injuries shaking his head he said you will need to see a surgeon only when the words were out of his mouth did he realize he had been contemplating the best way to preserve the life of the man who regardless of whether he had actually fired the fatal shot had just killed his wife a surgeon de buys scoffed dyou think i care to live without my arms thats what hed do to me you know there is no other way to prevent the inevitable suppuration of your wounds lee faltered his surgeonshis timeknew no such way the rivington men might well but de buys said hang me and have done youll get round to it soon enough at all odds the hungry growls from everyone who heard him attested to the truth of that someone tapped lee on the back he spun round it was colonel dimmock but for the bandsmen one of the lowestranking soldiers present a bullet had clipped off the bottom of his right ear though that side of his tunic was covered with blood he seemed unaware hed been wounded he held out a weapon to lee this was what those murdering swine were shooting with sir lee took therifle even as his mind formed the word he rejected it the firearm was too short and stubby to merit the name it reminded him of nothing so much as an ak that had somehow been washed and left on the line to shrink even the metal stock he discovered folded around against the body of the piece to save space the gun weighed next to nothing he supposed de buys and his henchmen had carried such weapons exactly because they were easy to conceal until needed though de buys was seriously injured he held the gun well away from the rivington man as he asked what do you call this thing why should i tell you anything de buys said then he spat out a short sharp fragment of laughter but what the hell difference does a name make its an lee heard the name as oozie seeing him frown in perplexity de buys amplified uzi named after uziel gal the israeli who designed it israeli lee frowned again does that mean israelite no never mind you neednt answer he turned to the men who had hold of de buys take him to jail make certain he is securely guarded if he will not see the surgeon do not compel him to do so he will after all soon stand trial the soldiers nodded like lee they knew de buys would go up on the gallows shortly after the trial was over they turned the rivington man around and started to march him out of the hall of delegates only then did lee see the four or five bullet holes in the back of de buyss jacket the man had no business being on his feet not if hed taken those hits along withalong with the two that had actually wounded him lee thought uneasily wait he said when he asked de buys about his seeming invulnerability the rivington man smiled a nasty smile and said i told you wed not be easy meat general lee lee reached out and prodded his belly it was hard not with muscle but with metal or wood or something of that sort lee knew of no armor proof against rifle bullets the rivington men evidently did no wonder the team of assassins had been so hard to bring down he began to worry if the rivington men all wore it they would be anything but easy meat as if to underscore that concern fresh firing broke out around the building america will break used in a way lee supposed that was good news it meant more troops were coming up to deal with the rivington men but it also meant they had not yet been dealt with the guards took konrad de buys away the firing went on and on a messenger dashed into the capitol seeing lee he saluted raggedly and panted marse robert them sons of bitchesbegging your pardon sirthey wont give up for hell we got a lot of men down out there and i dont know but one of theirs we kiltson of a whore fell out the window he was shootin from can we bring up artillery to blast em out whatever is wanted to accomplish the task at hand lee replied at once he ground his teeth but for skirmishes inside washington his soldiers had scant experience fighting within the confines of cities that did not appear to be true of the men of america will break he thanked god that they were confined to a single building a few hundred such fighters especially armored like de buys might be able to seize and holdeven a town like richmond the thought was unpalatable but inescapable he wondered how many rivington men rivington actually held other messengers came in bringing more word not only of the small battle across from mechanics hall but also of the carnage de buys and his accomplices had worked lees heart sank with every piece of bad news alexander stephens wounded judah benjamin wounded john atkins his choice to replace john reagan as postmaster general dead general jubal early dead with pistol in hand as he tried to attack the assassins jeb stuart wounded that last report hurt almost as if it had been one of his own sons past the bare fact of the injury the messenger knew nothing lee bent his head and prayed the wound was not severe a napoleon roared and a moment later another lee heard the rending crash of twelvepound iron roundshot battering masonry he briefly wondered why the gun crews did not come to closer quarters and blast the rivington men from their holes with case shot then he scorned himself for a fool even springfields could murder an artillery crew that got close enough to fire case shot against riflemen with repeaters the ploy was suicidal the brass cannon boomed again and again but then they fell silent smallarms fire continued lee paced the hall of delegates chamber like a caged lion waiting for another messenger to come and let him know what was going on he wished he could lead from the front as he had in his us army days but that role did not suit a commanding general much less the president of the confederate states at last a messenger did arrive lee all but sprang at him only to recoil in dismay when he gave his news bastards picked off the gunners fastern they could serve their pieces even at long range they aint all dead nothin like that but most all of ems shot lee groaned sharpshooters with telescopes mounted above their rifles might have been able to hit artillerymen at a thousand yards or more but he hadnt thought aks capable of such work when he turned away his eye fell on thethe uzi de buys had called it he shook his head annoyed at himself again how could he assume aks were the only guns in the rivington mens arsenal the answer was simple but painful he couldnt rifle fire rose to a new crescendo forgetting the dignity and importance of his office lee started for the doorway to find out what had happened and to take charge colonel dimmocks bulky body blocked his path no sir the chief marshal said here you stay till its over stand aside lee ordered dimmock did not move he outweighed lee by at least thirty pounds and even the thought of forcibly shoving him aside reminded lee that trapped by his duty he had to obey the chief marshal he dipped his head to dimmock i beg your pardon sir you are in the right but waiting came hard hard the rattle of smallarms fire slowed flared slowed flared once more stopped when the lull stretched to two minutes lee tried pushing past colonel dimmock again again the colonel refused to yield his place lee tossed his head like a man trying to bite his own ear dimmock ignored the show of temper bare moments later the gunfire began again sighing lee apologized again a new messenger entered the hall of delegates sir its a hell of a mess out there if those rivington sons of bitches had a clear field of fire all around their damn building wed never get close enough to shoot at em all the lead theyre throwing around we had us a little truce to move the wounded a while backthats what the quiet was hope you dont mind that no by no means lee said we must do what we can for our men press on with the attack and since the cover of the surrounding structures is proving our principal advantage be sure to use it well the soldier saluted and hurried away the gunfire from around the awb headquarters went on and on it was nearly sunset when the racket peaked in a few seconds of sustained shooting at full automatic that stopped as abruptly as the fall of a headsmans axe when yet another messenger came in lee pounced on him the man looked weary but triumphant an expression lee had seen on soldiers since before the mexican war the last of them murderin creatures is dead the fellow said a cheer went up from everyone who heard him he went on we finally got some troops into the building took some dointhem rivington bastards had the door barricaded so we couldnt noways knock it down finally some of our boys made em keep their heads down while some more went in through the windows that distracted em made em fight two bunches at once they died hard but theys dead god bless you corporal lee said the messengers sleeves were bare of stripes he looked confused for a second then grinned enormously lee turned to colonel dimmock with your gracious permission sir the chief marshal stepped out of the doorway officers and bandsmen formed up around lee as he went outside he did not want them but they refused to go away after brief annoyance he decided he could not properly be angry with them they had their duty too for that mattersomething he thought of too late had it been truethe last messenger might have been a rivington man in disguise aiming to lure him out of the safety of the capitol he hurried west toward the statue of washington capitol square had emptied of healthy civilians save for the doctors who moved from one of the wounded to the next doing what they could that lee knew was pitifully little no doubt the rivington men with their century and a half of added knowledge could have given more effective treatmentbut had it not been for the rivington men none of these poor wretches would have lain here at all a small tincture of guilt colored lees rage had the people not come out to see and hear him they would not lie here either a fourwheeled military ambulance clattered eastward every bump made the wounded within cry out lee bit his lip at least one of those wounded was a woman war had spared him at least that horror now he met it in alleged peacetime on what should have been one of the high days of his life he called to the ambulance driver are you taking them to general hospital number twelve no sir i got to go on to chimborazo the driver said number twelves full up he clucked to his horses flicked the reins the ambulance sped up so did the cries from inside it lees heart went out to those poor hurt souls chimborazo military hospital out on the eastern edge of town was twice as far from capitol square as military hospital number twelve which meant they would have twice the jolting journey to endure it also meant the butchers bill in the square was small only by comparison to a standup fight during the second american revolution general hospital number twelve could take in more than a hundred people if it was already filledhe wondered just how many wounded had had to go to chimborazo he promised himself the rivington men would pay for every one he started to go up to the covered platform on which hed taken his oath of office but stopped when he saw the dead and injured had been taken away only the bloody rills that ran down the timbers of the front and sides told of the chaos that had reigned here a few hours before he wondered where they had taken mary he wanted to see her to say how sorry he was for inviting her up onto the stand to say goodbye no time now he hoped she would know without his telling her she was often sharptempered with her endless bodily afflictions who could blame her but after thirtyseven years she knew himhad known him he corrected himself still not truly believing it in his heartabout as well as one person can know another the bodies of the five men who had accompanied konrad de buys still lay where they had fallen they were not a pretty sight all but one had been shot in the head the sole exception who looked absurdly peaceful by comparison to his comrades had bled to death from a thigh wound rips in coats and shirts told of other rounds that had struck without doing damage lees lips thinnedtheyd all been armored like de buys no wonder theyd been so hard to bring down with that armor maybe theyd thought they could escape once theyd done their murderous work if so theyd proved mistaken there as elsewhere none of the assassins still gripped his uzi lee hoped that meant the guns had been taken to someone responsiblewith luck to josiah gorgas who would no doubt be delighted to have such fascinating new toys to play with and if not well if not a thief would be able to use the uzis only until they ran out of ammunition where now sir one of the bandsmen asked when lee shifted his direction again to the offices of america will break he said in a voice like stone the corner of franklin and ninth was another scene whose like lee had not known since the war as in capitol square physicians and ambulances swarmed liked bees bullet holes scarred and pitted the face of mechanics hall a confederate soldier shot through the head hung half in half out of one window across the street was an identically dead identically placed rivington man the headquarters of america will break had taken far worse damage than mechanics hall the twelvepounder shot had blown several gaping holes in its brick and marble front only blind luck the building didnt go up inflames lee thought fire spread so easily and was so hard to fight he remembered the charred richmond of the picture history of the civil war and had to shiver that disaster could have happened here he pointed to the roof above which the red white and black awb flag still flew someone cut that down at once a couple of soldiers hurried off to do his bidding one of them said we ought to save it with our captured yankee battle flags that had not occurred to lee hed simply wanted the hateful banner cast on the rubbish heap but the soldier had a point the confederacy had won a battle here but the cost the cost lee followed the men into the building looked around curiously part of the curiosity sprang from his never having been here before the rivington men had come to him rather than he to them but some of his curiosity was also professional here he had the chance to learn what hard combat inside a building did to it he shook his head not liking what he saw the trail of blood and crumpled bodies led him to the suite of offices america will break had used corpses in confederate gray far outnumbered those in mottled green the rivington men had fought like devilsor perhaps they had simply preferred dying in action to the gallows brass cartridge cases clinked an incongruously cheerful sound as lee kicked them out of his path a door had painted upon it america will break and the organizations threepronged insignia lee stepped over two bodies in gray and one in green walked inside the fellow whose head and torso he had seen from the street had fought from a window here bullets had chewed up the wall opposite that window the picture that hung there was no longer recognizable one of the bandsmen who guarded lee looked around and said take away the dead men and it aint so very peculiar is it he was right shorn of carnage the offices of america will break might have housed any fairsized business or trading establishment lee did not know quite what hed expected perhaps knowing what he knew about the rivington men hed looked for the future to have impinged more visibly on their operation but the desks the chairs the cabinets full of papers here seemed at first glance no different from those in the war department across the street those papers would have to be examined of course but their home appeared utterly ordinary youd reckon anybody nasty enough to do what these bastards done ought to have a place that looks worsen this the guard went on thats so lee said thoughtfully the bandsman whose every word declared his lack of education had nonetheless touched an important truth evil to lees way of looking at things ought to declare itself openly to appear as foul as it was in fact but the headquarters of america will break a group that stopped at nothing not even indiscriminate murder to achieve its ends had for the eye at least no taint somehow the semblance of normality made even worse the evil it contained lee strode from room to room within the suite all the furnishings were like those of the chamber through which hed entered which is to say unmemorable but unmemorable men could not have plotted such hideously memorable deeds at last lee came to a door before which several soldiers stood its locked sir one said we put a shoulder to it but it dont want to move excitement flowered within leewas this the rivington mens sanctum sanctorum send for a locksmith then if you have not already done so he said the soldier hurried away lee examined the doorknob here at last was something unfamiliar its shape was like none he had ever seen he wondered what luck the locksmith would have with it the door was painted with a smooth coat of gray enamel he rapped it it was metallically cold metallically hard and gave not at all jingling with tools the locksmith arrived around half past six and set to work at once five days later despite his efforts those of the best burglar in richmond released from jail to test his expertise and a team of men armed with a stout ram the door remained closed once more lee found himself awash in telegrams he would willingly have forgone the flood of sympathy and indeed were it possible would have forgone the telegrams that had announced his election and set in train that bloody march from the flood though came a few messages he cherished one from springfield illinois in the usa said simply may god be with you and your country in your hour of sorrow you are in my prayers the printed signature read a lincoln another came from clarksdale mississippi request your kind permission to rescind my resignation from confederate states cavalry so i can lead against the murderers who would set at naught our republic and its institutionsn b forrest how shall i respond to this one from forrest sir asked charles marshall who had resumed his wartime post as lees aide by his tone he wanted nothing to do with the patriot leader but lee said answer your country is ever grateful for your service lieutenant general forrest he and i may fail to see eyetoeye on a great many issues but hypocrisy has never been numbered among his vices and against the men of america will break i fear we may need the most able military talent available to us do you deny forrests native gifts along those lines marshall shook his head but his mouth was set in a narrow line of disapproval as he wrote down lees reply and took it to the telegraph office that afternoon lee endured his wifes funeral service bishop johns one arm in a sling from the wound he himself had taken up on the platform spoke of how allwise providence had summoned mary from the world of men of how her spirit yet lived and would continue to inspire everyone who had known her thanks to the courage with which she had faced adversity of her unshaken confidence in god as her hope and strength which all would do well to emulate lee believed with his whole being every word the right reverend johns spoke yet the oration brought less comfort than it should have serving instead to tear off the scab which had begun to grow over his grief he wept unashamed as a hearse drawn by six black horses took his wifes coffin to the richmond fredericksburg and potomac railroad depot to start its final journey to arlington he knew she would never have forgiven him for interring her anywhere else a lieutenant came up to him as he was leaving st pauls church i beg your pardon sir for disturbing you at such a time but your orders were to be informed the moment we succeeded in entering that sealed chamber we have just done so thank you young man yes i shall go there at once have you a carriage yes sir if you will follow me the lieutenant drove lee east on broad to ninth and then down the western side of capitol square to the building that had sheltered america will break when he swung right onto franklin lee pointed and exclaimed the lieutenant chuckled we took a leaf from your book sir since that damned doori beg your pardon againdefeated our every frontal assault we decided to outflank it a ladder leaned against the side of the building several masons in grimy overalls stood at the base of the wall one still held a mallet and chisel crowbars and pry bars along with chunks of stone and broken brick lay on the sidewalk theyd broken a hole in the wall big enough for a man to crawl though has anyone gone in yet lee asked when the lieutenant shook his head lee descended from the carriage and hurried toward the ladder the lieutenant sprang down too and got in front of him with the selfconscious voice junior officers use when dressing down their superiors he said with your permission sir i shall precede you in case the rivington menmen was not the word he usedhave placed a torpedo or some other infernal device in there lee considered that reluctantly nodded his courage was not at issue here and his duty to his country was very well lieutenant carry on the young soldier swarmed up the ladder disappeared into the inky hole lee waited with barely contained worry and impatience until he stuck his head out again seems safe enough sir though i tripped over a chair and damn near broke my fool neck can you bring a lantern up with you its still almighty dark inside a soldier darted into the war department across the street came out with a lantern which he handed to lee he and a couple of the masons steadied the ladder while lee ascended lee was simultaneously grateful and offended they hadnt offered the spry young lieutenant any such assistance how decrepit did they think he was at the top of the climb the lieutenant took the lantern from him then helped him through the hole he held the flickering light on high while lee got to his feet its faint yellow beams and the gray light that came through the hole in the outer wall told lee at once that america will break truly did not belong to or any year close to it metal he muttered everything metal the desks the cabinets the bookcases against the walls the swivel chairs all were painted metal like the impenetrable door that had so long defeated everything the confederacy threw at it on this side he noticed that door was set well into the wall its inner surface was not painted at all only polished and cast back at lee the light the lantern shed upon it above one of the cabinets a low one hung a poster blazoned with the emblem of america will break above the insignia stood the awe initials lee had first seen on andries rhoodies coffee mug in camp above orange court house he wondered where rhoodie was the big man had not died on march nor had he been at his house when soldiers came that evening armed with a warrant and with aks set on full automatic that worried leethis side of bedford forrest rhoodie was as dangerous a man as he could think of below the three bent spikes in their circle stood a pair of unfamiliar words afrikaner weerstandsbeweging and below them in smaller letters afrikaner resistance movement lee cocked his head he wondered what an afrikaner wasnot an african certainly not by the way the rivington men treated negroesand whether the name betokened resistance against afrikaners whatever they were or by them he deliberately turned away from the poster refusing to let inessentials sidetrack him he walked over to the polished metal door set his hand on the knob the lieutenant dashed up and tried to turn it for him this time he refused to yield his place the men on the other side of that door had done everything but fire a napoleon at itand theyd contemplated that desisting only for fear of damaging the room the door guarded were it hooked to a torpedo they surely would have set off the explosive charge he worked the knob it did not turn smoothlythe confederates had managed that much at any rate in their efforts to force itbut it turned the door was heavy lee had to exert his full strength to pull it back and the massive hinges squealed in protest as he did so but it opened a couple of officers standing on the other side stared at him then grinned and began to clap their applause was joined by another noise a low throaty rumble that began as soon as the door swung wide they stopped clapping the rumble went on looking about for its source lee decided after a few seconds that it was somehow coming from within the thickened wall it sounded mechanical though not really like a steam engine he wondered why anyone would want to conceal something mechanical inside a wall behind him in the hidden chamber the lieutenant cried out he whirled wondering what trap the youngster had sprung he saw no trap only the lieutenants startled face he saw that very clearly for several long thin tubes mounted on the ceilinghed not noticed them before who notices ceilingshad suddenly started shedding a fine white light that illuminated the room as well as hazy sunshine might have what on earth the lieutenant said lee did not know what on earth either though after a moments reflection he supposed he should not have been surprised the rivington men enjoyed better lamps even than gaslight but understanding all their tricks was another inessential now the shining tubes let him read the titles of the volumes that packed these secret bookshelves as soon as he saw the picture history of the civil war was one of them the shelves drew him like a lodestone he ran a finger lightly down the spine of the picture history as if to reassure himself it was real somehow finding a second copy of it was far more than twice as strange as finding only one one was an isolated curiosity a liber ex machina but where there were two there had to be hundreds thousands all at once the distant time from which the men of the awb had come felt nearly close enough for him to touch and that picture history proved to be but one of hundreds of books about the second american revolution though they called it the civil war or the war between the states or occasionally the great rebellion he found memoirs by joe johnston by u s grant by jefferson davishe shook his head when he saw daviss were called the rise and fall of the confederate nationbyjubal early he shook his head again hed gone to earlys funeral yesterday and knew his former division commander had written no memoirs nor for that matter had johnston or grant or davis he also found studies on the battle of the wilderness on confederate railroads on blackwhite relations north and south before during and after the second american revolution and on confederate richmondone he saw with wry amusement was called general lees city the amusement slipped when he pulled the book off the shelf and saw on its cover richmond in flames he opened the book discovered it had been publishedwould be published would have been publishedin he also noted that its author was one richard m lee and wondered if the man was a descendant if he was he had an impartiality robert e lee approved of for he also seemed to have written a book named mr lincolns city lee put the book back in its place it stood near half a shelf of volumes that looked to be devoted exclusively to him he left them alone he already knew who he was the rivington men for all their reference works plainly did not along with the books on the confederacy lee found several shelves of volumes on south africanot a country so far as he knew that appeared on the globe in some had their titles written in english but more in the germanlooking language that had also produced the phrase afrikaner weerstandsbeweging it was not german that had been lees first guess when papers written in it turned up in the files of the awb outer offices but a professor of german summoned from the virginia military institute had taken one look and gone back to v mi with his tail between his legs lee did not let failure frustrate himand where the professor gave up a richmond merchant a jew from aachen was able to make fair sense of the awbs private tongue lee stuck his head out the door asked the two soldiers in the adjoining room is mr goldfarb anywhere about yes sir i saw him next door said one of them a captain he turned to his companion you want to go and fetch him in here fred fred who was a lieutenant went and fetched him avram goldfarb was a mediumsized heavyset man in his fifties with curly gray hair and a curly gray beard long enough to obviate any need for a cravat his nose was more distinctly hebraic than that of judah p benjamin and his eyeswhen lee looked into those dark deepset eyes he gained a more profound understanding of the book of jeremiah than he had enjoyed before avram goldfarb had seen sorrow for himself and for his folk he dipped his head to lee youve found more papers in this verkakte tongue for me to read sir at lees nod he rolled those sorrowful eyes i will do my best even if it makes me crazy this speech it is not deutschgerman you would sayit is not dutch as i should know since aachen lies by the border and before i did as much trade with amsterdam as with colognebut enough this speech it is not quite anything it is you would say in english a mishmash lee was not sure he would say that but he got the idea he stood aside to let goldfarb into the secret chamber the jew blinked when he noticed the extraordinary ceiling lights but lee gave him no time to ponder them he pulled out a book that had akrikaner weerstandsbeweging in its title hoping it would tell him more about the awb the african resistance movement what it is by eugen blankaatd goldfarb read african lee pointed to the poster on the wall afrikaner then goldfarb said shrugging whatever an afrikaner may be he opened the book to the frontispiece an arresting photograph of a stalwart young man his right arm upraised his left hand on a bible standing blindfolded in front of what looked like a firing squad armed with aks there were a few lines of text under the photograph goldfarb translated them if i advance follow me if i retreat shoot me if i die avenge me so help me god it was not the oath of a group that did anything by halves lee let air hiss out through his nose to his sorrow he already knew that whatever goldfarb thought of it his face revealed nothing he turned the page then startled lee by starting to laugh he pointed to the copyright page the printer must have been drunk sir and the proofreader too or someone would have noticed this says the book was made in he laughed again louder this time mr goldfarb lee said seriously i suggest you never speak of this ah error to anyone save me please believe me when i tell you i make this suggestion for your own safety the jew studied him saw he meant what he said slowly he nodded i will do as you say sir now to theis foreword an english word the preface perhaps lee said after a moments thought the preface thank you i begin more than half a jahrhundertexcuse me a centuryago during the second worldwar he said it like that as if it were one word so lee needed a second to understand and another to start to imagine what it meant but goldfarb was already going on a great man koot vorster said hitlers my struggle shows the way to greatness the way to south africa hitler gave the germans a calling he gave them a fanaticism which causes them to stand back for no one we must follow this example because only by such fanaticism can the afrikaner nation achieve its calling goldfarb looked to lee this to me is nonsense do you wish me to go on with it lee did not understand the historical references either but he knew that was because the history in question had yet to happen he also got a stronger feeling for the way the awb thought fanaticism to his way of thinking was no virtue yet the rivington men plainly considered it one he said please do continue mr goldfarb if you like goldfarb cleared his throat and went on but no onehmmheeded vorster i am sorry sir but this is dutch spelled as if the devil had written it and i must sometimes guess what it means south africa threw in with england and hitler and germany were beatenand so was south africa now we whites are prisoners in our own country ruined by stupid evil laws that make all men alike regardless of their color those who cursed our land with these laws call themselves liberal but they lie they call us outlaws we take pride in the name and call them fools they have been seduced by outlanders and outlanders ways and we will no more stand for it white power shall yet rise again and put the kaffiri do not know what a kaffir is i am sorryback down into his proper place the rest of the world be damned say i so say we all they are a tiny group of radicals then lee breathed goldfarb gave him a curious look he took no notice of it shall i go on goldfarb asked wait lee was thinking hard if mankinds opinionthe rest of the world blankaard had writtenhad decisively turned against these selfadmitted afrikaner outlaws a hundred fifty years ahead then what better more logical reason for their return to the confederacy than an effort to build another nation that favored white power to become south africas friend and collaborator in a changed future rhoodie had said as much and everything the rivington men had done here fit in with that goal the confederate states of america had not been formed for outlawry just the reverse that alone would have made lee oppose the awb with everything he had but the men from the future had given him other reasons he heard again bishop johnss prayers over marys casket they shall not have their way sir goldfarb asked never mind lee said no you need go no farther in that book now i have heard enough yes sir goldfarb slapped the volume closed stared all around what a strange place he said to which lee could only nod goldfarb pointed to an objectlee knew no better word for iton one of the desks what is that thing for instance i cannot tell you mr goldfarb for i do not know lee had curiously tapped the artifact in question a couple of times himself as he walked back and forth past it its main piece was shaped like a box taller than it was deep but it had a thin metal tube projecting upward from one comer of the top a spiral cord joined the boxlike part to another one which was small enough to be held in the hand the front of the boxlike part was covered with switches and knobs one said onoff lee flicked it from the latter to the former a light went on in the glassedin upper part of the box a low hiss rather like distant surf but more steady came from a metalcovered grill lee moved the switch back to off the light went out the noise faded and was gone ive never seen anything like that before goldfarb said but what is it good for again i do not know lee answered though the awb men doubtless did or what about this other thing next to it still another mystery i am afraid lee ran his hand over the gadget close by the one that hissed it was hard but did not feel to the finger like metal wood or glassthough glass did seem to cover the large dark greenish square that dominated the center of the oystergray upright cabinet connected to that small cabinet by another spiral cord was a low flat box with letters numbers and symbols printed onto upraised studs for no reason lee could fathom the letters were scrambled and there were two sets of numbered studs one above the top row of letters the other off to the right by itself he poked a couple of studs they clicked and went down under the pressure of his touch but otherwise did nothing maybe it is a qwerty goldfarb said pointing to the nonsense word formed by part of one row of letters maybe it is lee said quite seriously then he pointed too at the words beside the sole decoration on the otherwise severely functional device a stylized apple with rainbow stripes and a bite taken out of one side or maybe its a macintosh ivql i wonder what it is for goldfarb said so do i lee turned away from the qwertyhe liked the merchants suggestion better than his ownand found another book with afrikaner weerstandsbeweging on the spine tell me what this one contains mr goldfarb if you would be so kind xvii judge cornelius joyner nailed a sheet of paper to the notice board in front of the nash county courthouse to nate caudell who watched from the middle of a crowd of silent grimfaced people each stroke of the hammer sounded like a bullet slamming home he squeezed mollie beans hand she squeezed back hard enough to hurt the justice of the peace tossed aside the hammer the thump it made against the damp ground reminded caudell of a dead body falling he sternly reined in his runaway imagination judge joyner turned and faced the men and women who packed the square i know not all of you have your letters so im going to read this out loud for you youd best listen and pay heed too he turned back to the notice hed just posted his deep voice was big enough that caudell had no trouble hearing him the following proclamation is published for the information of all concerned by virtue of the power vested in men by law to declare the suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus in regions threatened by rebellion i robert e lee president of the confederate states of america do proclaim that martial law is hereby extended over the counties of nash edgecombe halifax franklin and warren in north carolina and i do proclaim the suspension of all civil jurisdiction with the exception of that enabling the courts to take cognizance of the probate of wills the administration of the estates of deceased persons the qualification of guardians to enter decrees and orders for the partition and sale of property to make orders concerning roads and bridges to assess county levies and to order the payment of county dues and the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus in the counties aforesaid in faith whereof i have hereby signed my name and set my seal this fifteenth day of march in the year robert e lee caudell added his sigh to the dozens that went up around him read all at once as joyner had read it the proclamation felt like a boulder rolling over him he hung his head in shame at having his home county branded throughout the south as a region threatened by rebellionbut then rivington lay within nash county till word came down of what people were calling the richmond massacre hed been mildly proud to have rivington close by no matter what he thought of some of the men whod settled there now he wished the place were on the far side of the moon judge joyner said dont go away yet folks theres more he raised his voice again lieutenant general forrest commanding confederate states forces in eastern north carolina is charged with due execution of the foregoing proclamation he will forthwith establish an efficient military police and will enforcethe following orders all distillation of spirituous liquors is positively prohibited and the distilleries will forthwith be closed the sale of spirituous liquors of any kind is also prohibited and establishments for the sale thereof will be closed now the noises that rose from the crowd sounded more like mutters than sighs most of the grumbles came from farmers who were used to turning part of their corn into whiskey the liberty bell saloon had a shiny new padlock on the front door though caudell suspected that would not keep wren tisdale from selling a spirituous liquor or two out the back im not done cornelius joyner warned you all had better listen to this all persons infringing the above prohibition will suffer such punishment as shall be ordered by the sentence of a courtmartial provided that no sentence to hard labor be for more than one month by the sentence of a regimental courtmartial as directed by the sixtyseventh article of war by command of the secretary of war s cooper adjutant and inspector general a month working on the roads for selling a man a drink raeford liles said i dont believe it youd better caudell warned him thats just what you could draw from a regimental court if they haul you before forrest now he let the words hang liles turned a faint green having met the new confederate commander for eastern north carolina he figured he might hang if he violated an order forrest was charged with enforcing judge joyner picked up his hammer and stood aside george lewis stepped out of the front row of the crowd to take his place lewis wore a gray civilian jacket and a shirt to which a threebarred stand collar had been hastily sewn must be none of his old uniforms fits anymore caudell thought smiling a little lewis said i am ordered by general forrest and authorized by governor vance to recall to duty company d th north carolina infantry for a period not to exceed days said company to serve as military police for nash county and perform such other duties as may be duly assigned by proper military authority mollie squeezed nates hand again he wondered if that meant she intended to rejoin the castalia invincibles herself he was afraid it did shed returned from richmond wearing a wig that nearly matched the dark curls hed shorn so she could go there in disguise she wore it in public all the time if she took it off she could easily play the man once more caudell wished she wouldnt the two of them had stayed together since shed got back from richmond he feared she would take up her old ways if she found herself among so many men but he feared even more that she would be hurt or killed if she took up a rifle again his memories of combat were too recent and too horribly vivid for him to make light of its risks as he had before he signed up with the invincibles in but if she wanted to put the uniform back on how the devil was he supposed to stop her lost in his own worries hed missed some of what lewis was saying he started listening again report here for duty tomorrow at noon wear your uniforms if you have them still well give out armbands to everyone who doesnt and well furnish weapons repeaters someone asked eagerly thats right if youre going to soldier youll carry soldiers weapons i said that loud and clear down in raleigh lewis puffed out his already massive chest as if to say it was only through his political pull that the castalia invincibles had obtained aks more power to him if that was so caudell thought lewis went on get word to anybody you know who lives in the county but isnt here in town today we may give a few days grace but we wont stand for deserters caudell stuck up a hand lewis pointed at him he said what do we do if we run into rivington men god only knows whats going on north of here that proclamations dated the fifteenth but here it is the twentysixth and its only just now got here i know it george lewiss face was rounder now than when hed last led the castalia invincibles but no less determined we arent called up to go after the rivington men were supposed to be military police but if you see one of the bastards shoot him theyve wrecked the railroad track up near weldon and theyve torn down all the telegraph lines they can get to far as i can see nate weve got ourselves a little war here all through the town square heads bobbed up and down nate nodded with the rest as far as he could see it looked like a little war too probably the only thing keeping it from turning into a big war was that there werent enough rivington men to make it one but even a few would be ungodly hard to get rid of uneasily he remembered the armor benny lang had worn under his mottled clothes it had turned a minié ball would it stop a round from an ak he had no way of knowing but he thought it likely lewis waved to show he was done cornelius joyner went back inside the courthouse singly and by small groups people began drifting out of the square talking as they went caudell started to say something to mollie she beat him to it i already know what youre gonna tell me nate i dont wanna have to hear it he spread his hands in front of him but mollie it isnt right it why aint it im as good a soldier as any o them others aint i her voice was low but very determined you know damn well i am mister nate caudell sides i reckon all this is part my faultleastways marse robert made an almighty much about that book i brung him that was your idea too remember wouldnt hardly be right makin a mess and then not helpin put it back together but caudell kicked helplessly at the dirt mollie had ruined half the argument hed had in mind but only half trouble was he knew no safe way to say the other half mollie did it for him youre worried ill go back to whorin again i reckon she said he could only nod he felt his face grow red mollie shrugged cant say for certain i wont but if i do nate then you wont have to have nothin more to do with me an thatll be that she set her hand on his arm i dont want it to end that way i swear i dont i dont either its justoh hell caudell kicked the dirt again foolish to take chances he thoughtwould you use a onetime drunk to guard a whiskey barrel well maybe if you were sure hed changed his ways was he sure about mollie he knew he wasnt and knew he couldnt say so not unless he wanted to kill the stillfragile bond between them he also knew he had only to say a couple of words to captain lewis to keep her out of the musterbut that would cost him mollie too he scowled fiercely first at the street and then at mollie she wrinkled her nose in reply hell of a thing he said whats that here i am not even back in the army yet and ive already lost a fight the tunic with the first sergeants stripes still fit it was ragged but it had been ragged four years ago too caudell wore one of his regular pairs of pants and his black felt hat he laughed at himself as he headed for the square he didnt look much different from the way he had when hed got home from the war no come to think of it hed been missing a hat then some of the men who joined him in front of the courthouse still had their old tunics some didnt only one or two wore proper forage caps they were a motley band but hardly more so caudell reflected than when theyd paraded through richmond in triumph the men stood around in little groups talking about fights theyd seen george lewis walked through the square exchanging banter with them and checking their names off on a list not far from caudell he paused in perplexity i dont recall your serving with the th sir henry pleasants grinned at him no reason you should captain i was with the thth pennsylvania that is he tapped the silver oak leaf on the union shoulder strap hed sewn to his checked flannel shirt lewiss eyes widened he could read northern badges of rank though they differed from those the confederacy used quietly he said i mean you no disrespect lieutenant colonelyoure pleasants arent you ive heard of youbut only those who served with the castalia invincibles have been summoned to duty i dont claim the rank captain lewis nor seek to raise trouble pleasants said i would happily join you as a private so long as i may join this is my country now and lee my presidentand if anyone tries to foully murder him how may i call myself a man unless i help hunt the villains out hmm lewis rubbed his chin you speak smoothly enough thats certain did you command that regiment till bealeton yes but as i say i know i have no rank in the confederate army pleasants waved his hand put it to your other men if they say no ill go home and tend my farm if they say yes youll have one more soldier like most regiments raised to fight in the second american revolution the th north carolina had always done without much military formality by god ill do just that lewis said he raised his voice invincibles shalt we admit to our number henryit is henry isnt itpleasants who had the misfortune to spend the war wearing a blue coat rather than our good confederate gray nate caudell spoke up at once hell yes let him in if hes crazy enough to want to live here hell fit right into this company thanks natei think pleasants said laughing sure let him in dempsey eure said the more we have the less for each of us to do four years of peace had not diluted his soldiers pragmatism but kennel tant shook his head dont want to let no damn yankees into this here company several other invincibles echoed that some of them profanely the men argued back and forth for a few minutes then george lewis said all right well have a show of hands all those for letting henry pleasants join us those against looking around caudell saw that pleasants had won the vote lewis saw the same thing he turned to pleasants all right private ill put your name on the list more softly he added i may pick your brains every so often too henry pleasants came to attention saluted as the captain wishes youre under my orders too now henry caudell said touching the stripes on his sleeve now theres an appalling notion pleasants said with an exaggerated shiver captain lewis may i please reconsider ive already written your name do you want me to have to scratch it out and make my list untidy oh i suppose not pleasants allowed just keep me away from this wild man here i love you too henry caudell said he might have gone on teasing with his friend but suddenly he had no heart for it mollie bean had just walked into the square she was wearing gray caudell hoped someone anyone would speak up and greet her by her right name it would take only one voice then captain lewis would have to send her away and she would stay safe several of the men who lived in town stared first at mollie then at caudell they knew the two of them had taken up with each other but no one said a word mollie went up to lewis gave him a crisp salute melvin bean reportin sir bean he went down his list checked off the name then he took a longer look at her snorted laughter good god bean havent you managed to raise a beard yet several invincibles let out strangled coughs mollie turned red hope soared in nate then he saw that george lewiss plump cheeks were on the pink side too why you son of a bitch he thoughtyouve known all along the only thing lewis might not have known since hed spent most of the time since the war down in raleigh was that mollie and caudell were together now though something about mollie besides her smooth cheeks caught the captains notice it says here youre from rivington yes sir thats so she said nodding youre about the only one from the company who is ill make you acting corporal put you next in charge of skirmishers after nate here most of the fighting right now is north of rivington but along with breaking up stills and such i want us to see how closely we can approach the town from this direction maybe forrest will want to hit the rivington men two ways at once and thats something hell need to know does that suit you yes sir she walked over to stand by caudell grinned up at him that suits me right fine if lewis hadnt known they were together he did now nate wanted to kick her he wanted to pick her up and shake her to see if he could get some sense into her that way he wanted to laugh and cry at the same time captain lewis had ordered the two of them to work together which was wonderful but hed also given them the most dangerous job the company would have to do a job that wasnt even properly its responsibility caudell wondered if he ought to squawk about that he ended up just standing there feeling foolish he saw more than one soldier eyeing the way mollie stayed at his side he hoped they got the message she wasnt availableand he hoped she wasnt maybe he thought hopefully jealousy would make someone give her away and force captain lewis to notice officially that she was a woman but no one said a word lewis said come on inside the courthouse and get your rifles dempsey eure whooped id sooner get my hands on a repeater again thandamn near anything he was looking at mollie too but with a twinkle in his eye that made it impossible for caudell to get angry at him the aks leaned against the courthouse wall in a row neater than the castalia invincibles were likely to form cornelius joyner an invincible himself stood guard over them with a pistol one by one lewis handed each of his men a rifle and three banana clips heavy with cartridges caudell hadnt touched a firearm since he left the army his hands he discovered still knew what to do the smell of oil and metal and powder that came from the rifle the sensuously mechanical glide of the charging handle as he pushed it back to expose the open chamber made him see the armys old virginia campground almost as vividly as he did the courthouse where he stood by the murmurs that rose from his comrades they also had memories flooding back the only memories henry pleasants had of aks were unpleasant ones im glad ill be on the right end of one of these things for a change he said somebodyll have to show me what to do with it though easy enough to learn dempsey eure had mischief in his voice especially getting the bolt back in i have a feeling sergeant that youre trying to lead me down the primrose path pleasants said me eure was the picture of affronted innocence sir if you like ill take henry with me and teach him what he needs to know caudell said to captain lewis all right lewis said teach him quickly though you bean and the rest of a squad will head up toward rivington tomorrow morning check the farms you come across certainly but i want to know where the rivington men have their pickets out as i said before thats important military information send a man back with the word before sunset tomorrow or at once if you come under fire yes sir caudell knew lewis was giving him the option of using henry pleasants as his messenger if the pennsylvanian had trouble getting the hang of the ak maybe he would do that on the other hand if bullets started flying maybe he would send mollie bean back to nashville to tell lewis what theyd run into she wouldnt like that but she would have to go she was only acting corporal while he was a first sergeant the conclusion would have made him happier if hed managed to forget how free and easy confederate soldiers were apt to be about obeying orders they didnt care for theres nothin you could call a straight road between here and rivington mollie said early the next morning the smell of brewing coffee took caudell back to the war though this cup came from the liberty bell instead of being hastily cooked above a little campfire henry pleasants methodically stripped his ak reassembled it then stripped it again this is an astonishing weapon he said the third time hed said that this morning and at least the dozenth since hed got the rifle whoever invented it was a genius to get so many new things right and put them all together hed said that about a dozen times too caudell sipped his coffee which was far better than the chicory and burnt barley hed drunk while he was in the army of northern virginia pleasants already handled the repeater with confidence and competence he was an engineer caudell reminded himself and used to learning to use unfamiliar devices in a hurry that suited nate fine not only did he admire his friends knack but if pleasants was no liability with a rifle he could use mollie as a messenger withoutwell with only a fewqualms of conscience she was saying easiest way to get from hereto there matter of fact is to go over to rocky mount and take the train on up she chuckled thatd be the easiest way anyhow if the line wasnt busted an if the rivington men wouldnt shoot you dead for tryin to use it lets try another road then alsie hopkins said he sounded so serious that the whole squad hooted at him caudell raised his cup tilted his head back to drain it he slung the ak over his shoulder lets go he said ambling east along washington street to first hardly seemed like soldiering though ruffin biggs complained i forgot how heavy a rifle this was caudell frowned compared to the rifle musket he had carried the ak was small and light but compared to no rifle at allhis burden the past four yearsit did feel rather like a slab of stone he decided biggs had a point first street remained a respectable road until it leaped over stony creek the soldiers feet drummed loudly on the wooden bridge bob southard said whats that fairy tale the three billy goats guff gruff caudell corrected him he waved down at the little stream might could be a few snappers in there but i dont think stony creeks big enough to hold a troll a few hundred yards past the bridge the road split into three narrow tracks none of which seemed to lead anywhere in particular see what i mean mollie said the right fork is the one that goes north and east henry pleasants remarked thats the way were looking for mollie looked at him youre right but howd you know youre new hereabouts a couple of my miners welshmen came down and settled on that road he answered i thought theyd work on the railroad with me but theyre content to farm a few acres and hunt a little havent seen em in town much caudell said they must stick to themselves pleasants nodded they do lloyd and andrew are both like that we ought to have a look at those farms of theirs then caudell said could be anything on ema still maybe or who knows what else lloyd morgans place came first a couple of miles up the path from nashville the cabin on it was small dark and tumbledown rather like morgan himself he looked anything but happy at having guests but did not presume to argue with a squad of soldiers with repeaters at the ready he also smelled powerfully of whiskey try as they would though caudells squad found no still nate asked him where hed got the liquor he just shook his head and muttered in welsh finally caudell gave up lees proclamation doesnt make it against the law to get drunk lets go as pine woods screened morgans farm from view ruffin biggs grumbled i bet hes standing back there laughing at us could be so caudell agreed cant win all the time mollie bean said when she was doing what any other soldier might as now caudell found he had no trouble thinking of her as melvin again he could not decide whether that was good or bad andrew gwynns farm an hours tramp from lloyd morgans made the latter seem a plantation by comparison looking at the tiny weedinfested plot gwynn cultivatedor rather did not seem to cultivatecaudell marveled that he managed to make a living from it and if he didnthow did he make a living suspicion rose within caudell he said well look this place over real careful boys they looked andrew gwynn came out of the shack by the path to watch them look under a shock of dark hair his face was pale narrow closed unlike morgan he was in complete control of himself when the searchers again failed to find anything he gave them a cold nod and went back inside caudell was dissatisfied frustrated i know hes hiding one somewhere he said several times i can feel it after the squad had moved another couple of miles closer to rivington henry pleasants told him its back in a little clearing well off the road theres no pathfar as i know andrew never goes there the same way twice why didnt you say that when we were back there henry caudell demanded glaring at his friend if youd found it by yourselves that would have been all right pleasants answered but andrew came down here at my urging i didnt feel right giving him away before his eyes but our orders were caudell stopped remembering what hed thought about orders the day before he set hands on hips you know what henry pleasants shook his head caudell went on youd better watch yourself because near as i can see youre turning into a rebel alsie hopkins slapped his knee and doubled over laughing pleasants didnt look so sure is that a compliment he asked damned if i know caudell said the road twisted like a snake with the bellyache past andrew gwynns farm pleasants was as lost as caudell who marveled at how strange places just a few miles from home could be without mollie to tell him which turns to make he knew he might have wandered in circles a blue jay jeered at him from up in a pine tree before long they found another break in the woods caudell glanced first at mollie then at henry pleasants so did the rest of the squad nobody knows who lives here caudell said well well have to go and find out then they stopped at the edge of the woods peering through brush at the clearing ahead by the look of things nobody lived there though someone once had the cabin was a roofless ruin the fields a riot of weeds and shrubs and here and there manhigh saplings bob southard tramped off across the field alsie hopkins started after him caudell put out an arm to stop him called to southard you want to be careful bob were getting close to where those rivington bastards might be southard shook his head and kept walking they got more things to worry about than me they he never said anything else a burst of fire from the far side of the clearing cut him down where he stood he spun when he was hit so caudell could see the almost comic amazement on his face as he fell caudells own battle reflexes had not faded at the first sound of fire he threw himself flat the wisdom of that was proved a moment later when bullets probed the place from which southard had emerged searching for anyone who might have been with him oh sweet jesus i pissed myself alsie hopkins wailed caudell didnt feel like laughing had he not stepped behind a tree not long before he knew he might have done the same thing bullets slapped trees smacked branches with a rough hand again and again and again whoever was shooting up ahead he seemed to have all the ammunition in the world and he wasnt shy about using it caudell turned his head far enough to get his mouth out of the dirt said to henry pleasants beside him thats no ak up there what is it then being a transplanted northerner pleasants was not yet intimately familiar with the rifle he carried caudell shook his head without raising it damned if i know but the report is heavier and hes not firing clips either listendamn bullets just keep on coming he remembered how far away the trees on the other side of the clearing were and how fast poor overconfident bob southard had gone down whatever hes shooting its got ungodly range the firing stopped stay down three people hissed at the same time mollie bean added hes tryin to find out just where were at weve got to spread out caudell said his initial terror at unexpectedly coming under fire was gone now replaced by the more familiar fear that went with any combat if he could not master that fear he could live with it four years of peace dropped away from him as if they had never been when he spoke again he might have been teaching a lesson his students already knew well henry you and i will slide right ruffin you and alsie head left mmelvin you stay here give us some covering fire and if anything goes wrong you make sure you get back and give captain lewis the word mollie said ought to be me with you instead of henry nate he aint that handy with a repeater but you know the country hereabouts best that gives you the best chance of making it back to nashville caudell said he made sense enough that she quit arguing he took a deep breath lets go he slid backwards into deeper cover henry pleasants had no trouble staying with him or staying low he might have been a lieutenant colonel but hed learned to move like a red indian mollies ak barked three or four quick rounds sent in the direction from which the bullets ahead had come the reply was almost instantaneous a storm of fire so furious that caudell realized he hadnt left mollie in a safe place after all against that monster gun there didnt seem to be any safe places off to the left hopkins and biggs started to fire the gun hesitated for a moment then began stuttering out death in a new direction it chewed away at the brush that screened attackers from it caudell noticed he was thinking about it as if it were a sentient entity in its own right and a malevolent one when he said something like that to henry pleasants his friend laughed mirthlessly now you know how i felt at bealeton now crouching now crawling they scurried through the trees guided by the deep monotonous patter of the gunand the gunner caudell reminded himselfthey were stalking mollie kept squeezing off shots every minute or two so did alsie hopkins and ruffin biggs for a while the hidden gunner continued his pattern of swinging back and forth between them then apparently deciding mollie wasnt advancing and wasnt dangerous where she was he concentrated his fire on the two moving men shall we take some of the heat off them pleasants asked hefting the ak hed still never fired caudell shook his head not yet best way we can do that is get close enough to make sure our shots count pleasants sketched a salute spoken like an officer most of an hour of slow movement went by before caudell spotted muzzle flashes ahead and to his left he went flat on his belly and wriggled forward like a cottonmouth henry pleasants was right beside him for some time those flashes were all they saw when at last they drew near enough to make out more caudells lips shaped a silent whistle hes got his own little earthwork there in back of concealing branches heapedup dirt warded the gunner against bullets from front left right either hopkins or biggs fired at him a burst answered them keeping them pinned well away caudell saw a flick of motion behind the long barrel of the gun that projected over the revetment a plan shaped itself in his mind he whispered to pleasants move away from me over to that stump there next time he starts shooting well both try and take him out all right ever so cautiously pleasants crawled into place caudell himself crouched behind a tree trunk he waited waitedmollie fired the hidden enemy did not reply then shots came from the left from biggs and hopkins a stream of bullets lashed out at them caudell fired so did henry pleasants they were close enough to hear the enemy gunners cry of fear and rage the long barrel swung toward caudell with terrifying speed seen straight on the muzzle flashes were bright as the sun bullets slammed into the trunk just above his head all at once the bullets were chewing up the treetops not closing in on him after a few seconds the firing stopped wary of a trick caudell waited several minutes before peering round his sheltering tree trunk the big black gun barrel pointed up at the sky in his minds eye caudell saw the rivington man who had been back of it hit saw his dying weight slump down onto the gun and raise the muzzle saw him fall away so the bullets stopped corning shaking with reaction he called over to pleasants you all right henry his voice shook too yes i think so pleasants didnt sound any too steady himself which reassured nate what the hell kind of gun is that anyhow damned if i know shall we go find out caudell started to leave his cover but henry pleasants said i dont think thats a good idea nate what why not two reasons for one thing weve done what captain lewis told us to do weve found where these bastards have their southern pickets posted and for two look how well situated that gun is do you think its there all by its lonesome or do you think there are more guns farther back just waiting for us to show ourselves so they can cut us down as if in response to pleasantss words a new gun opened up north and east of the one theyd taken out bullets cut twigs spaanged off stones caudell once more flat on his belly could see no flashes hearing the deep endless roar was quite bad enough all right henry im convinced lets get out of here getting out was almost as sticky as getting in had been the sun was low in the west by the time they rejoined mollie bean ruffin biggs and alsie hopkins were already there biggs wore a filthy bandage stuffed into the front of his right shoe i got a couple of toes gone i reckon he said matteroffactly here on out you can call me gimpy what the hell kind of gun was that you went up against nate mollie asked unconsciously echoing henry pleasants caudell could hear the concern she did her best to conceal it wanted him he wanted to squeeze the breath out of her to prove to himself flesh on flesh that he was still alive he couldnt not now he said henry here talked me out of going up to see when he explained why his companions nodded alise hopkins said that there gun looks to shoot bout as far as a napoleon he shook his head didnt much fancy gettin shot at when i couldnt hardly shoot back ruffin biggs nodded again this time to pleasants reckon you was right yankeecapn lewisll need to know about a gun like that and so will hitemagain forrest you mean henry pleasants let out a dry chuckle ruffin i suspect he already knows guards round the capitol guards posted on the grounds of the presidential residence a guard with an ak in his carriage lee felt a prisoner of guards and guards most of all at the corner of ninth and franklin infantry and artillery both protecting the most important secrets of the confederacy the battered building that had housed america will break had changed since lee visited it just after his men finally succeeded in breaking into the awb sanctum the hole in the outer wall of that hidden chamber was bigger now it needed to be to let light into the room the glowing tubes on the ceiling had failed when the thing that chugged in the wall fell silent a new canvas awning shielded the opening from the elements the officer in charge of the guard detachment saluted as lees carriage rolled up the congressional delegation arrived a few minutes ago sir per your instructions they are waiting in the outer office of that suite thank you major lee got down from the carriage so did his bodyguard he tossed his head the only time he had to himself these days was in the privy or the bathtuband had the tub been bigger a guard likely would have joined him there assassins murdered freedom merely by existing the senators and congressmen turned as lee came in through the entry to the awb suite so did judah p benjamin leaning heavily on two sticks luckily the bullet that had gone through his calf missed the bone the wound was healing but the former secretary of state still moved like an old man instead of with the imposing presence he had once enjoyed gentlemen you have my sincerest gratitude for joining me today lee said if you will be so kind as to come with me i will show you why you were invited here it had better be good growled senator wigfall of texas when i tried going into that room yonder the one with the heavy door the damned guards said theyd shoot me to stop me im not accustomed to our own good confederate soldiers turning into hessians and i dont care for it not one bit i dont they were but obeying my explicit orders sir you will see the reason behind them i assure you the guards will admit you now as you are in my company and indeed with lee heading the group the soldiers presented arms to wigfall and the other senators and congressmen the officials turned this way and that staring at the unfamiliar office furnishings within the secret room wigfall pointed to the qwerty on one desk what the devil is that thing if you can tell me senator i shall be in your debt lee said congressman lucius gartrell of georgia a confederate rather than a patriot in politics looked toward a hole in the wall not far from the door what happened there mr president the device which made those tubes overheadlee pointedgive light was housed there after it ceased operation we removed it in an effort to discover the principles by which it worked our best guess is that it ran out of fuel cant you just give it more wood or coal then gartrell said it does not appear to burn either but rather a combustible fluid of some sort lee answered that was what his military engineers had told him based on the few drops of strongsmelling liquid left in the tank marked fuel whatever the liquid was it wasnt whale oil of so much the engineers seemed certain past that point no certainty existed most of the savants working with the ronda generatorfor so it proclaimed itself to bebelieved that what it generated was electricity but what the stuff was good for once generated they hadnt a clue the rivington men had known though duncan kenner of louisiana another congressman of the confederate persuasion said this is all very interesting im sure mr president but why are we here lee nodded to judah benjamin whose usual small smile never wavered benjamin had primed kenner to ask just that question lee said the answer congressman reaches back more than four years and has until recently been a tightly held secret even now before i continue i must require your word of honor and that of your colleagues not to divulge what you learn here today without my prior permission most of the legislators agreed at once mulish wigfall said be damned if ill buy a pig in a poke very well senator you may go i am sorry to have wasted your time lee said politely wigfall glared but seeing lee prepared to be inflexible added his promise to the rest lee nodded his thanks then went on in early as you must all be aware our confederacys prospects in the war for independence were poor we were outnumbered and outfactoried from the start portions of our land had been overrun and the north was beginning to find in grant and sherman and sheridan officers who could bring its full strength to bear upon us even wigfall had to nod the staunchest southern fireeater remembered how bleak things had looked then lucius quintus cincinnatus lamar of mississippi newly returned to congress as a patriot and as staunch a fireeater as any ever born said the coming at that moment of the rivington men and their repeaters always seemed to me to be visible even miraculous proof of the favor which divine providence showed the confederate states of america several other senators and congressmen solemnly nodded i confess that i inclined toward a similar view for some time lee said i have since been disabused of this notion we were indeed shown favor but of a sort neither divine nor miraculous hear me out my friends the story i am about to tell you may seem implausible but i assure you it is the truth he told the legislators what he knew of the rivington men and their travel through time to come to the souths aid part of what he said was gleaned from andries rhoodie part from the volumes in the chamber where he now stood as he spoke he watched louis wigfall go paler and paler that did not surprise him the men of the awb must have given wigfall their own version of this tale lee finished and so you see gentlemen they helped us gain our freedom not out of consideration for our virtues but so we might serve as pawns in their game silence stretched when he was through finally congressman lamar said this is anextraordinary web you spin mr president so extraordinary that i hope you will not be offended if i say it would be all the better for proof i can offer that or at least corroboration judah benjamin said i heard much of this same tale from andries rhoodies lips as did jefferson davis and if i be not mistaken joe johnston and alexander stephens as well benjamin looked around the room and unless i am much mistaken my friends some few of you will have heard it as well we are not so good at keeping secrets even important secrets as we might be since lee kept secrets without difficulty he had not thought of that but by the expressions on several legislators faces benjamin had a point lee glanced toward wigfall almost defiantly the texan said ive heard it yes but not through gossip and chitchat the rivington men told it to me and general forrest though their interpretation of the events differed substantially from that ascribed to them by mr lee by their fruits ye shall know them or so the bible says lee answered he waved to the book that lay open on every desk in the secret room to few folks is it given to learn how history would judge them thanks to the men of the awb we possess that opportunity i have taken the liberty of marking certain passages in these books passages i believe to be representative of the whole by no means do i require you to take these as allinclusive however feel free to browse as you would to learn how the future thought of some of the issues our confederacy was in part founded to uphold you mean niggers dont you wigfall said in the end it always comes down to niggers there senator i find i cannot disagree with you lee said thinking this was one of the few occasions on which he could truthfully say that he took a step back indicating that the congressmen and senators might begin their examination instantly he was reminded of a game of musical chairs for legislators outnumbered chairs to hold them his momentary amusement vanished as fast as it formed just such a contretemps at his inauguration had led him to bring mary up onto the platform with him and shortly thereafter to his becoming a widower unlike the scene in capitol square no unseemly brawl followed here some men claimed seats others stood and peered over their shoulders all the books had markers inserted at the pages that gave their publication dates a few derisive snorts arose from skeptical lawmakers but those soon faded many of the volumes were illustrated and illustrated with photographs and lavish color impossible to match in the mundane world of and every work had the dizzying effect of being written with the hindsight of a hundred years and more within moments the only sounds in the room were soft grunts of wonder louis t wigfall heaved his bulk out of a chair advanced on lee i owe you an apology mr president and i am man enough to give it i thought youd put together some humbug here to befool us but i see it is not so you could not have manufactured so much and in such detail shaking his head like a bedeviled bear he shambled back to the desk from which he had come and without complaint took a place behind congressman gartrell who had occupied his chair lee leaned against the hard cold side of a closed file cabinet let the lawmakers look as long as they would this was the second such delegation he had led into the awb sanctum eventually he planned to allow the entire confederate congress to see the books and papers assembled here as had happened with the first group of legislators wonder began to give way to indignation as senators and congressmen moved from one volume to the next compared one account of the lost civil war and its aftermath with another every one of these things sounds as if a damnyankee wrote it congressman lamar exclaimed someone elselee did not notice whoadded not just a damnyankee but a damned abolitionist yankee where lee had quoted matthew judah p benjamin chose bobbie burns oh wad some power the giftie gie us to see oursels as others see us it wad frae monie a blunder free us an foolish notion he did his best to turn his soft accent to broad harsh scots a thoughtful silence descended when he was through into it lee said unique among men my friends we have been granted that ah giftie we always remained faithful to our peculiar institution despite the censure of those outside our bounds confident posterity would thank us for that fidelity but here before us we have the verdict of posterity which condemns us for maintaining the ownership of one man by another and is convinced that that system if ever it were justifiable had in our time long since outlived such justification this time he picked words from the book of daniel thou art weighed in the balances and art found wanting only god knows his judgments but we may see for ourselves the verdict which history has brought in against us did you know of this when during your presidential campaign you spoke of ending slavery congressman kenner asked no sir i did not lee said indeed the rivington men painted for me quite a different picture of the future a picture in which white and black remained forever at each others throats the pages in this room serve to give the lie to that picture as i think you will agree yet it was the one they offered as mr benjamin and i think senator wigfall will attest judah benjamins massive head moved up and down wigfall also nodded though his expression was anything but sanguine lee wondered whether the fierce frown was aimed at himself for having forced the texan to make that admission or at the awb men for having misled him l q c lamar said what of the rivington men then if this love feast between negroes and whites be the way of the future and so it would seem startling and i must say repugnant though i find it how do the rivington men fit into it poorly i suspect lee held up a hand no i do not intend to be flippant by their own words as rendered into english by mr benjamins coreligionist mr goldfarb they show themselves to be zealots at strife with virtually the entire world of their time let me offer you an analogy which quite offended andries rhoodie the rivington men are as mad in their support of whites in their times as john brown was in support of blacks in ours the confederate legislators looked at each other one by one they began to nod the same thing had happened with the first delegation to see the evidence from the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries few men were brazen enough to withstand their greatgrandsons scorn louis t wigfall came close damn me to hell sir if i can stomach that stinking black republican of an abe lincoln being made into some plaster saint and damn me to hell if i want to live in a country where the man who blacks my boots and curries my horse is my equal a measure of equality before the law by no means creates of itself equality in society lee said the united states make that abundantly clear and let me ask you a different question senator if i may having seen the means the awb employs to reach its ends do you yet find those ends deserving of your support wigfalls glower grew black as his boots but he had been in the middle of the capitol square massacre at last he shook his heavy head nor do i lee raised his voice spoke to the entire congressional delegation am i to construe from this then that you shall vote in the affirmative when a bill arranging for the gradual compensated emancipation of negro slaves the terms to be along the lines of those i outlined before becoming president is introduced into the senate and house of representatives again the lawmakers looked at one another some of them as if they hoped one of their number would have the nerve to say no lee watched them all especially wigfall and lamar whom he judged likeliest to oppose him the one from stubbornness the other out of principle lamar cleared his throat several congressmen beamed the representative from mississippi said retreating from a longheld position is apt to be as dangerous in politics as in war in so doing i fear i look down into the open grave of any future aspirations yet given the evidence you have presented to us today i have no choice but to support such legislation as you suggest and justify my vote to my constituents as well as i may thereafter lees nod was the next thing to a bow if not the immediate gratitude of the voters in your district you will gain your countrys lasting thanks after the mississippian declared himself in favor of lees program the rest of the lawmakers fell in line even wigfall nodded gruffly though lee knowing his volatility did not take that as a firm promise judah benjamin said you know mr lamar what with the atrocities of march and the insurrection currently being mounted in north carolina your vote in favor of emancipation may yet redound to your advantage provided you make your district aware that in so voting you reject everything the rivington men support lamars features usually on the brooding side lit up it could be so sir with your wellknown acuity of judgment in matters political it likely is so you flatter me sir benjamin said and he contrived to appear flattered but flattery lee thought was best defined as overfulsome praise and having seen benjamin in action he was more than willing to concede the former secretary of states reputation was deserved congressman gartrell said how fare we against the rebels sir not so well as i would wish lee answered the rivington men are few in numbers but possessed of the advantage of a century and a half of progress in the mechanic arts progress we of course lack the repeaters they furnished us for use against the united states are one example of such progress unhappily we have discovered that they are only one example the rivington men have on the whole succeeded in maintaining the positions they seized when fighting broke out after march were it not for the aks in our arsenal i fear they might have managed to do much more than merely hold those positions he stopped scowling almost as ferociously as had senator wigfall the longbarreled largecaliber endless repeaters the rivington men used to defend strong points made aks seem like springfields by comparison nor were the torpedoes they buried in the fields between those strong points any bargain either after watching the legs blown off two or three men their comrades grew noticeably less eager to advance we shall in the end defeat them though gartrell pressed anxiously if we defeated the united states sir we shall surely overcome a small band of insurrectionists lee wished he were as certain as he sounded bullets snapped past a few feet over caudells head the stream sweeping first left to right then back from right to left the wash in which he lay was only about a hundred yards from the gunner getting this close had taken him all day now that he was here he didnt know what to do next firing a few shots at random was likelier to alert the gunner than to kill him and the rivington men still had the rifle grenades theyd used in the trenches outside washington city caudell didnt want them raining down on him he turned to henry pleasants who sprawled beside him in the gully we cant go forward not anymore he said waving pleasants nodded if they showed themselves they were dead men caudell waved in the other direction we cant go back either not hardly eight or nine soldiers lay in the gully with them the survivors of twice that many or more pleasants nodded again caudell said well what does that leave us im looking for ideas damn it i wish i had one pleasants said maybe when night comes he broke off with a grimace by the way they shot at night the rivington men could see in the dark like cats and even if that werent so with the brute of a repeater up ahead if one bullet didnt get you the next one would or the next flopped down a couple of feet away mollie bean said cant go forward cant go back she wiped her forehead with her sleeve since the one was as dirty as the other that helped her not at all she still looked good to caudell the only way she could have looked better was far away from the fighting if something happened to herbut she hadnt let caudell send her away he said we cant go over em not enough trees and theyd shoot us out of em like boys with squirrel guns and we cant go under em because we arent a pack of moles hed been talking as much to hear the sound of his own voice as for any other reason he almost jumped when henry pleasants rolled over and whacked him in the shoulder jumping here was dangerous pleasantss eyes blazed in his filthy face the hell we cant go under em he said his voice shook with excitement huh what are you talking about caudell said going under em pleasants repeated impatiently as if to a stupid child when caudell still looked blank he realized he had to explain further nate i used to be a mining engineer remember if we could run a tunnel from here to under that big repeater set a charge of powder and light it offwe can do it i swear we can and blow em high as the sky the ground around here is soft the side of the wash will keep the rivington men from spying what were up toim not crazy nate i swear by almighty god im not you mean it caudell said slowly wonderingly the stream of bullets was right overhead now advancing farther against the gun that spat them was only a fancy way to commit suicide unlesscaudell had a sudden vision of gun and gunner both flying through the air he liked it better than anything else hed imagined since being so rudely returned to combat pleasants sensed hed hooked his fish i sure do mean it nate if we can bring lloyd and andrew up here and some other men whove dugyou must have some in this stateand their tools and the timber wed need to shore up the tunnel as we dig he started ticking off on his fingers exactly what hed need as if he were sitting comfortably in a mining office instead of hunkered down in a dry wash finally to dam the flow of ideas caudell held up a hand all right i surrenderyouve convinced me but im just a sergeant remember he pointed at the stripes on his sleeve i cant get you everything youre talking about well head back to captain lewis if you sell him your scheme too youll likely get a chance to try it lets go pleasants turned and started to crawl down the gully caudell grabbed him by the ankle henry you just swore to me you werent crazy and here you go making yourself out a liar if you want to live to see captain lewis you wont just march off and do it not from here you wont think about where you are when night comes well try getting out till then we sit tight pleasants looked mutinous caudell went on how much digging did you plan on doing today anyhow his friend managed a shamefaced laugh sorry youre thinking straighter than i am thats plain but when i see something like this in my mind i go all on fire to get started on it no matter whats in my way i know you do caudell remembered that that driving eagerness to get the job done and the matching blindness to anything not directly related to getting it done had cost his friend his railroad job after a couple of years as a first sergeant practicality was his own middle name he plucked at his beard as he thought after a couple of minutes he asked if youre not here can one of your welshmen oversee this job andrew could pleasants answered at once lloyd works well enough but he likes his whiskey too well to make a proper chief fair enough heres what well do then after it gets dark you and i and melvin here will all head back to nashville well go separately and wait a minute mollie bean interrupted whatre yall sendin me back for youve spent the last however long listening to henry and me caudell answered you know as much about this notion of his as i do anyway captain lewis needs to hear it even at night its no sure bet one of us or even one out of two will make it back safe out of the range of that damned gun up there but if i send three somebody ought to get back she nodded warily all right nate reckon that makes sense in front of other people a good deal had to stay unsaid between them if shed thought he was sending her back just to get her out of dangerwhich he very much wanted to doshed surely have refused to go but her pride could accept an order with military reason behind it shadows shifted lengthened began to blend into the one great purple shadow of twilight when full dark came caudell turned to mollie and pleasants ill go first he said first one through is likeliest to draw fire henry youre nextgive me fifteen minutes or so before you start mmelvin you go last fifteen minutes behind henry well all meeti hope he thoughtat captain lewiss luck nate pleasants said luck mollie echoed so softly he hardly heard her he wanted to hug her to kiss her to be with her anywhere but this miserable spot all he could do was nod a nod she might well not have seen in the darkness then scuttle off down the dry wash his mouth was dry too he remembered too well the terrifying confusion of the night fight outside washington city then the rivington men and their fancy weapons had been allies now they were trying to kill him the wash got shallower and shallower as it curved away from the endless repeater he rolled out of it and behind a hollow stump doing his best to keep the stump between himself and the gunner he crawled scrambled crawled again hed gone several hundred yards before bullets came snarling after him he threw himself flatbetter than flat actually for he landed in a hole in the ground he waited a few minutes then crawled on when he decided the pine woods screened him away from the rivington man at the gun he got up and walked steering by the stars till he came to a road he knew hed started only six or eight miles outside nashville but the town clocks were chiming midnight when he came into town lewis made his headquarters at the courthouse a sentry gave caudell now even filthier than he had been before a dubious look you sure this wont wait soldier im sure caudell put bite in his voice he discovered he still had his wartime prejudice against anyone in a clean uniform his growl sufficed to get the sentry to step aside he went into the courthouse found lewis snoring on a pallet captain lewis sir captain lewis grunted then rolled over and sat up who he rubbed his eyes the torches outside the doorway let him see who what the devil is it nate as caudell started to explain what it was several horsemen rode into the town square their harness jingling a man with cavalry spurs on his boots strode into the courthouse caudell kept on talking to lewis let the damned courier wait his turn he thought most of that breed were arrogant eager to get their eversoprecious words in first but this one stood quietly until caudell was through captain lewis yawned till his jaw gave an audible pop then he said if this pleasants knows what hes doingand he sounds like he doestell him to go ahead sounds like a good chance to get rid of that damned repeater and we havent had much luck with it any other way as caudell saluted the man behind him spoke for the first time captain sergeant the hell with one repeater when youre holdin four kings you better not just raise a dime caudell whirled he knew that voice though hed not expected to hear it in the nashville courthouse george lewis sprang out of bed and to his feet he was wearing his makeshift captains tunic but only drawers beneath it he came to attention and saluted anyhow general forrest sir at ease captainand put on your pants nathan bedford forrest added with a chuckle i rode in to see how things were on this part of the line around that goddam rivington place on account of theyd been pretty quiet till now reckon theyre gonna liven up some he rounded on caudell where is this mining engineer of yours first sergeant he ought to be along any time now sir caudell said uncomfortably he told again how he pleasants and mollie beanthough he remembered to call her melvinhad set out at fifteenminute intervals forrest nodded best you could have done i expect but if that engineer stops a bulletwait he said one of those other miners could do the job too didnt he yes but caudell hopelessly spread his hands henry pleasants was his friend mollie was a great deal more than that forrest might understand his feelings but the man washad to be by the wreathed stars on his collara soldier first now that he had an idea he would carry it forward with or without the person who first proposed it to caudell the people mattered more than the idea he waited and worried waited more worried more about three in the morning when worry was turning to despair mollie and pleasants came into the courthouse together caudell let out a rebel yell that likely bounced half of nashville out of bed he hugged henry pleasants first which gave him all the excuse he needed to hug mollie too longer and more closely what the devil happened to you two he demanded we got lost mollie said in a small sheepish voice my fault i i dont care a damn about all that nathan bedford forrest broke in he paused a moment to let himself or at least his rank be recognized then said which one of you is pleasants i am sir pleasants drew himself stiff and straight private henry pleasants th north carolina formerly lieutenant colonel henry pleasants th pennsylvania is that a fact forrest took a longer closer look at the mining engineer decided you liked it better down here did you some ways pleasants said and let it go at that forrest did not press him he had things other than politics on his mind caudell here tells me you think you can run a mine under that big repeater up in front of you i can blow that goddamned gun just as high as you want it sir pleasants said positively the hell with one repeater forrest said as he had to caudell and lewis before i want that mine i want it bad enough to taste it colonel pleasants beamed to hear his old rank used captain lewis glared a little forrest plowed ahead about how long would you need to dig it pleasantss eyes went far away his lips moved silently as he calculated he stayed in that brown study for several minutes when his face cleared he answered give me the men tools and shoring timbers ill needand a pump in case the shaft is wetand ill have it done in three weeks to a month forrest clapped him on the back youll get em by god he promised and youll have your old u srank back as part of my staff if that suits you now george lewis glared more than a little pleasants grinned from ear to ear thank you sir maybe i should have voted for you after all caudell gulped wondering how the notoriously hotheaded forrest would take that but the generals answer when it came was lowvoiced and serious sir if id known then what i know now i wouldnt have voted for myself i was fooled into thinking america will break had the souths best interests at heart not its own he shook his head plainly angry at being deceived then he grinned too an expression half mischievous half savage now i aim to fool those rivington bastards right back how are you going to do that sir caudell mollie and george lewis asked at the same time weve just been tapping at america will break down here south of rivington forrest answered still with that predatory grin i aim to swing a good deal around to here start pounding em right about where that repeater is the more men and guns we throw at em the more theyll have to bring in to keep us from crackin em ill throw in more and theyll bring more and by the time three weeks or a month have gone by gentlemen theyll need a sight more than one repeater to hold us back ill make them make that spot the linchpin of their whole position it was as if someone had struck a match right in front of caudells eyes dazzled he exclaimed they can bring up all the fancy guns they want because while theyre doing that well be digging and when were done well blow every one of those fancy guns straight to hell nathan bedford forrest finished for him thats right first sergeant then well smash through the gap and go straight for rivington forrests grin suddenly slid off his face leaving him looking very grim indeed and if the rivington men get word of what were up to because somebody blabs ill kill the bigmouthed son of a bitch with my own hands does everyone understand me the courthouse got quiet for a moment even without knowing forrests reputation no one who heard him could have doubted he meant exactly what he said perhaps seeking to ease the tension that blunt threat had left in the air henry pleasants said you know melvin youre the spit and image of nates lady friend mollie bean just how close a relative of hers are you caudell choked and wished he could sink through the floor mollie though must have anticipated getting asked that sooner or later for she answered lightly were right close henryexcuse me i mean colonel henry sir lots o people say we look alike you certainly do pleasants said general forrest told nate and mollie you two go get some sleep youve earned it my thanks for coming back with word of this here plan he turned to pleasants you stay here with me sir sounds like we got ourselves a whole mess o talking to get through yes sir henry pleasants said i think we do xviii lee wondered how jefferson davis had ever managed to inveigle him into accepting the confederate presidency even without counting the armed guards who surrounded the presidential residence on shockoe hill he found himself a prisoner of his position to do everything that needed doing he should have been born triplets the one of him available was not nearly enough whenever he did anything he felt guilty because he was neglecting something else he drank coffee as he waded through the mornings stack of reports general forrest was shifting the main effort of his attack to southwest of rivington a telegram said lee glanced at a map of north carolina on a stand by his desk then shrugged that direction of assault looked no more promising to him than any other but forrest usually had a reason for the things he did even if the reason was not obvious often it wasnt being without any formal military training forrest made up his own rules as he went along and if lee couldnt see what he was up to likely the rivington men couldnt either lee hoped they couldnt the telegram also reported that forrest had appointed a new officer to his staff a colonel pleasants the name was vaguely familiar to lee but he couldnt place it he reached for a book taken from the awb sanctum lee colonels by a certain robert krick a man still a lifetime away from being born it was a better more comprehensive list of the higher officers of the army of northern virginia than any from lees own time it did not however mention colonel pleasants lee looked at the far wall of his office without seeing it as he tried to remember in what connection hed noticed the colonels name he pulled out the picture history of the civil war a volume that over the past few months had come to seem like an old friend sure enough pleasantss name appeared in the index lee flipped to page reading about the grinding campaign that had not happened in still made him want to shiver as if he were going through one of poes frightening tales instead hard to imagine his incomparable army of northern virginia trapped within siege lines round petersburg with the federals using every expedient they could think of to break those lines he read of the mine henry pleasants had proposed of the tons of powder going off beneath the confederate trenches of the battle of the crater that the union forces seemed to have bungled beyond belief for otherwise how could they have lost having read all that he idly wondered how pleasants had ended up in the south rather than pennsylvania the idleness fell from him he slammed the book shut with a noise like a rifle shot mr marshall he called come in here please i need you sir behind his spectacles charles marshalls eyes were worried lee rarely sounded so urgent what do you require send a telegram to general forrest at once saying that i order himbe sure to use the word orderi order him not to include the name of the latest colonel to join his staff in any further dispatches either telegraphic of postal do you have that ithink so sir the aide repeated the message accurately enough though his voice was puzzled i confess i dont altogether understand it never mind just take it to the telegrapher immediately marshall shrugged but hurried away lee returned the picture history of the civil war to its place on the shelf if henry pleasants was planning to do now to the rivington men what had been done to the south in until those same rivington men helped change history lee did not want them reminded of his existence if they were tapping the wires between north carolina and richmond and if pleasantss name seemed vaguely familiar to one of them as it had to lee he shook his head more than a little unnerved at stumbling over a new complication to fighting the men from the future not only did they have armaments and armor his forces could not match they knew a great deal about the events of his own recent past and the people who shaped them a mere name might have been plenty to warn them of what forrest likely had in mind lee set forrests telegram aside and read the latest papers from washington philadelphia and new york he did not think the british would get the canadas back any time soon vancouver had just fallen to a u s force pushing up from oregon the washington evening star was even reporting that the russian empire alarmed at the progress of federal arms had offered to sell alaska to the united states as preferable to seeing it conquered like the rest of north america lee smiled at thatwhat good were more square miles of snow and ice to anyone his smile faded as he read of continued english success at sea the blockade of the eastern coast of the united states was probably tighter than the us blockade of the confederacy had been during the second american revolution and the us merchant fleet reduced to desperate straits confederate corn production was booming to make up for the us wheat no longer available to the british isles that led him into the latest report from julian hartridge of georgia his secretary of the treasury reparations from the united states had allowed the confederacy to payoff most of its wartime debts that was important the french had installed maximilian in mexico not least because the previous government owed them money and he did not want to give any european power a similar excuse for meddling in confederate affairs but new debts came every day the manufactured goods the south bought were worth more and could be produced for less labor than the cotton and corn it gave in exchange for them gold kept flowing out of the country southern industry had made great strides during the war and lee wanted to encourage it further but the constitution forbade a protective tariff he made a rueful noise half grunt half sigh when the historians of a century hence came to write about his presidency he suspected they might call him the great circumventor because the confederate constitution stood foursquare against most of what needed doing all the south had wanted upon secession was to be left alone but the world and the south itself had changed too much since for a return to the halcyon antebellum days to be possible much less practical or so lee believed at any rate the proof of that belief lay in a draft bill on his desk a bill with the deliberately innocuous title of legislation regulating the labor of certain inhabitants of the confederate states that word inhabitants brought back his smile though without much mirth to it he could not have called the people affected by the legislation citizens for under existing law slaves were not confederate citizens his bill would see to thatif it passed despite all the startling documents from the captured awb offices despite the richmond massacre itself he still worried about that he thought he had convinced the legislators themselves of the wisdom of his course but the people back home despite having elected him remained unenthusiastic about setting the negro on the road to freedom lawmakers wanted to be reelected not just to be right and to do right in their wisdom the framers of the confederate constitution made sure their president would not have to concern himself with that lee was pleased to recall a constitution provision he wholeheartedly endorsed his daughter mary came into the room she served as hostess during the fortnightly levees he held following the custom jefferson davis had begun what with his wifes infirmity much of that duty might have fallen to her in any case after march he deliberately made himself shove that black redstained day out of the forefront of his mind or as far out as he could what can i do for you my deaf he asked i have a parcel here for you from colonel rains in augusta georgia she handed him a small box closed with twine he opened it with the enthusiasm of a child getting a birthday treat from colonel rains is it probably some new munitions but the box held inside a protective layer of cotton wool a corked bottle of pills and a note i am given to understand that the rivington men before their descent into vicious and brutal madness prescribed nitrogenated glycerine as a medicine for you in the hope that the enclosed may be of benefit i remain your most obt servant g w rains i hope they help your chest pains father mary said they certainly should lee paused looked up at her over the tops of his spectacles how do you know what they are for for that matter how did colonel rains learn i was taking nitroglycerine i scent a conspiracy i plead guilty i found one of your old empty bottles and sent it to him as the label gave the proper dosage to include in each pill but the idea came originally from mr marshall who recalled both the nature of your old pills and that colonel rains was producing the identical substance im only sorry neither of us thought of it sooner dont trouble yourself on that account my dear i seem to have survived to this point even without the medication lee said touched by their concern his expression hardened i am not sorry to have a supply from a source other than the rivington men mary nodded her own face grim like her younger sisters she still wore black to mourn her mother but for blind luck she would have been mourning him too the new nitroglycerine tablets rattled in the bottle as he picked it up the rivington men had been willing even eager to help him when they needed him and help him they had more than any contemporary could but when his hopes for the south crossed theirs theyd tried to discard him as casually as if he were a smeared sheet of foolscap he clicked tongue between teeth it is my country not theirs father mary said but hed been talking to himself not to her thomas bocock of virginia the speaker of the house said i now have the distinct honor and high privilege of presenting to you the president of the confederate states of america robert e lee applause from congressmen and senators filled the house chamber as lee stepped up to the rostrum bocock sat down in back of him albert gallatin brown should have been beside the speaker in his capacity as president of the senate but albert gallatin brown was dead which also meant that if anything happened to lee bocock would become the confederacys third president lee dismissed that thought from his mind as he took a few seconds to gather himself before launching into what might prove the most important speech of his administration he said distinguished senators members of the house of representatives i am of course aware of how unusual it is for a president to request of you the privilege of speaking to your assembled number in support of a particular piece of legislation but i desire that you have my reasons for requesting of you a favorable vote on the bill now before you regarding the regulation of labor of certain inhabitants of the confederate states during the war the confederate congress had usually met in camera its deliberations secret the policy carried over into time of peace as well lee did not altogether approve of it but this once found it useful not all of what he had to say belonged in the richmond papers he made that clear from the outset all of you by now have seen the works the awb brought back to our time you have seen how with virtual unanimity the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries condemn the institution of slavery with the same sort of loathing we might apply to savage tribes who devour their fellow men several legislators winced at the harsh comparison lee did not care he aimed to state his case in the strongest possible terms he went on the awb sought to keep us just as we were sought to freeze us in place forever so we might join them in defiance of what lies ahead and sought to overthrow our duly elected government when we gave the slightest sign of contravening their desires their armed revolt continues to this day a vote against this proposed legislation is a vote for the awb and its methods you will have seen that for yourselves in the awbs secret chambers i wish to explicitly remind you of it here today so that you may retain no doubt as to the issues involved he paused for a moment looked out over his audience this business of gaining his wishes through persuasion did not come naturally to him not after a lifetime of simply receiving or giving orders save for one or two scribbling notes to themselves senators and congressmen stared intently back at him if not persuaded they were at least fully attentive that would do onward yet i believe gentlemen we should sooner or later have been compelled to confront this issue even had we gained our independence by our own exertions even had the awb never existed had the awb never existed the south would not have gained its independence by its own exertions lee had known that since he first opened the picture history of the civil war the members of congress knew it too intellectually the books from the awb sanctum made it abundantly clear but in their hearts most of them still surely felt their beloved country would have found some road to freedom without the intervention of the men from the future lee went on the war itself and its aftermath taught us new lessons about the negro lessons i admit a fair number of us would sooner not have learned yet they remain before us and we ignore them at our peril we learned from the united states that colored men might make fair soldiers a possibility we had previously denied let me now state what some of you will have gathered from your readings in the secret chamber at the time when the rivington men came to us certain of our officers had already begun to suggest freeing and arming negro slaves so they might battle the northern foe at our sides a murmur ran through the house chamber not everyone had noticed that part of the record nor did everyone care to remember how little hope the war had held only a bit more than four years before the arrival of the rivington men and their repeaters obviated the necessity for such desperate expedients but the negro has continued to instruct us as to his capacities though the insurrections that so long plagued the mississippi valley have been reduced to small scattered outbreaks the tenacity with which colored men maintained them in the face of overwhelming odds must give us pause if we continue to see those colored men only as the docile servants they appeared to be in days past we have tacitly recognized this change in that many blacks who escaped from bondage during the upheavals of the second american revolution remain at liberty not least perhaps because once having tasted freedom they can no longer safely be returned to servitude further during the war several states relaxed restrictions on what the negro might be taught the better to benefit from his intelligent exertions once having taught him one may no longer demand that he subsequently forget yet if the negro may learn if he will take up arms in his own defense if in our hour of peril we contemplated his taking up arms in our defense where is the justice in leaving him in chains to do so but exacerbates the risk of servile rebellion and gives our enemies a dagger pointed straight at our hearts i submit to you my friends that emancipation however distasteful it may appear exists de facto in large stretches of our territory gradually acknowledging it de jure will allow us to control its impact upon our nation and will shield us against the excesses we all fear gentlemen of the congress rest assured i do not lightly urge upon you the provisions of the legislation whose introduction i have proposed i truly believe these provisions shall prove to be in the best interest of the confederate states of america in the long run and request of you their passage the world will little note nor long remember what i say here but it can never forget what you do here let our descendants say that this nation under god shall have a new birth of freedom and let them say that it began here today i thank you he stepped away from the podium the applause that followed was more than polite less than warm he wondered how much of it he would have kept had the confederate congress known he was borrowing words from one of abraham lincolns memorial addresses by all accounts lincolns little speech at gettysburg had become famous in the world wherein the souths independence had been crushed here in the real world lincoln and all he stood for were discredited his words no doubt doomed to obscurity forever lee had read through that gettysburg speech at least a dozen times he thought it deserved to live louis t wigfall got to his feet mr speaker he boomed senator wigfall thomas bocock responded as he resumed his customary place of honor mr speaker i desire to say a few words in respectful opposition to bococks gavel came down on the rostrum with three sharp cracks cutting through the building spate the honorable gentleman is not recognized he will please recall that we are met in special joint session for the specific purpose of hearing president lees address he will i am certain have adequate opportunity to express his opinion of the measures proposed in that address when in deliberation within the confines of the senate chamber wigfall tried to go on with his speech anyhow the speaker of the house gaveled him down at last redfaced and sullen he sat lee stared stonily at him he might not have made his speech but he had made his point lees shoulders shifted slightly as he stifled a sigh if not even the acknowledged voice of the future convinced some people of the folly of their chosen course what could nothing was the answer that immediately sprang to mind he hoped with all his heart such stubborn souls made up only a minority of the congress a deeptoned whistle in the air not a birdmortar nate caudell yelled along with twenty others he dove into a deep bombproof a timberreinforced hole dug into the front wall of the trench he landed on top of someone two more men jumped in on top of him the mortar shell burst less than a hundred yards behind him hl the second line of trenches dirt fountained skyward a clod found the bombproof opening and hit him in the back of the neck half a minute later another round whistled past overhead this one by the sound destined for some far more distant target the four men whod taken shelter in the bombproof crawled outno one could stand insidemade foredoomed efforts to brush themselves clean caudell also rubbed bruised ribs be glared about a quarter seriously at dempsey eure thats the second time you landed on me the past two days im starting to think youre more dangerous than any damned mortar bomb long as the rivington men think the same way eure answered with a chuckle how many of them have you landed on caudell asked darkly his friend said reckon ill have my chance soon enoughif henry ever gets that tunnel of his finished he diggin under them guns up there or is he headin all the way to china the three weeks to a month pleasants had promised to nathan bedford forrest had already stretched into a month and a half proper tools and experienced diggers were in shorter supply in north carolina than hed imagined caudell had crawled down the tunnel himself a couple of times carrying boards through blackness toward a flickering candle flame that gave a man with a pick a tiny dollop of light by which to work he wanted to kiss the dry wash when he emerged and marveled that some men endured a lifetime down in the mines another mortar bomb went sailing off into the confederates reargood thing they dont seem to have a whole lot of shells for that beast he said it reaches almost all the way back to nashville dempsey eure nodded i was listenin to some artillerymen talkin and they say its got more rangen one of our hundredpounder coast defense guns be switched if i know how the rivington men do it same way they do the aks i reckon whatever that is caudell shrugged same way they get books full of photographsand colored ones at that he thought same way they get books printed inwas it hed never spoken to anyone but mollie about the picture history of the civil war shed stolen who would believe him he wasnt always sure he believed himself but getting back in the trenches against the endless repeater and the longrange mortar had undermined his doubts as surely as henry pleasants was undermining the bastion up ahead hed come to take the ak for granted but those other weapons reminded him afresh that they did not belong to they were also one more reason the tunnel was running late captain lewis walked down the wash he dipped his head to caudell and eure much to my surprise its done at last he said he sounded annoyed whenever he mentioned the tunnel seeing pleasants promoted from private to colonel in one fell swoop still rankled weve been ready awhile now sir caudell said he waved to the sets of packedearth steps that led up from the bottom of the wash to the parapet excavating a hundredyard shaft produced a lot of dirt it had to go somewhere inconspicuous to keep the rivington men from spotting it and figuring out its source the steps served that purpose and when the moment came would also let the confederate soldiers quickly go over to the attack pleasants will touch off the charge at sunrise tomorrow or is supposed to at any rate lewis said assuming it goes off you know your orders yes sir caudell and dempsey eure said together eure amplified soon as it blows we go over we head straight for rivington and we dont stop for nothin the orders had come straight from forrest and were imbued with his driving energy thats it lewis agreed if it turns out to be that simple we can get down on our knees and thank god the next time we go to church but the generals rightthe first strike has to be right for the heart the troops behind us can fan out and take whatever strongpoints are left from the flank and rear what if it doesnt blow eure said then general forrest thinks up something new and unless i miss my guess colonel henry pleasants turns back into a pumpkini mean a private but being a just man at heart lewis added hes not stinted himself i give him that i hope it works as he claims we shant have a better chance than this i hope it works too caudell said fervently if it didnt and the attack went on anyhow the result would be gruesome and he would be a part of that result he wondered whether charging a nest of endless repeaters could possibly be worse than tramping across open fields toward the massed muskets and artillery atop cemetery ridge maybe not but it wouldnt be much better either after darkness fell men began moving forward in the zigzag network of trenches the confederates had dug up to the dry wash to help disguise that movement longrange artillery fire started up the fire had to be at long range no matter how well protected cannon were fire from the endless repeaters murdered their crews when they tried to get too near the rivington mens lines confederate artillery fuses were imperfectly reliable more than one shell burst above the soldiers heads rather than among their foes but enough came down near their target for the rivington men to answer with mortar fire damned if i dont halfway hope they hit somebody caudell growled to mollie bean im sick of my own side shooting at me just then another shell fell short and made them both throw themselves flat mollie said they aint tryin to kill us nate does that make it better or worse if they do he asked she thought for a few seconds then shrugged he didnt know the answer either but army life was easier to take when you had something to bellyache aboutfor one thing it kept you from remembering you might get killed in the next few hours he broke a piece of corn bread in half passed one chunk to mollie after she ate it she rolled herself in her blanket lay down im gonna sleep while i canif i can the racket from the artillery duel made that anything but obvious caudell wished she were safe in nashville but telling her so seemed pointless since she wouldnt listen to him and even if she had she could hardly get back there against the tide of soldiers moving the other way for that matter he wished he were safe in nashville which was just as impossible to arrange he took a cigar out of a tunic pocket lit it at a tiny cook fire smoked in quick savage puffs the smoke failed to soothe him as hed hoped he tossed the chewed butt into the dirt by then mollie had succeeded in falling asleep he lay down next to her not really expecting to doze off himself but the next thing he knew someone was shaking him awake and saying come on get ready now he sat up surprised to see the sky pale in the east he put on his hat grabbed his rifle and his haversack he moved a couple of full banana clips from the latter to his trouser pockets where he could get at them easily with that he was as ready as he could be beside him mollie made the same sort of sketchy preparations as darkness faded he could see farther and farther up and down the wash there stood captain lewis carefully cleaning his ak one last time and therecaudell nodded to himself he might have known nathan bedford forrest would place himself in the first rank when the fighting started henry pleasants stood by the mouth of the tunnel hed proposed and labored so mightily to build a length of slow match in his hand he looked toward general forrest forrest was looking from the sky to pleasants and back again at last he nodded a single abrupt motion pleasants stopped touched the slow match to a fuse that lay on the floor of the tunnel the fuse caught pleasants sighed and straightened caudell noticed he was holding his own breath how long for the flame to run from this end of the tunnel to that before he could ask forrest beat him to it when will it go off shouldnt be long pleasants answered a confederate shell screamed overhead making him raise his voice in fact it should be right about before he could say now the ground shook beneath caudells feet hed heard of earthquakes but hed never been in the middle of one before a roar like fifty thunderstorms left him momentarily stunned he saw forrests lips shape the words god damn but could not hear him through that echoing blast he did not know whether he was the next man out of the gully after forrest but he was sure no more than a couple of others could have been in front of him two or three steps past the parapet he stopped dead in wonder hed never had a good look at that strongpoint while the tunnel was being dug peering through a firing slit only invited a bullet in the face and the bastion wasnt there for him to examine anymore god almighty he said softly the gunpowder brought in bag by bag barrel by barrel had blown the biggest hole in the ground hed ever imaginedit had to be fifty yards across fifty feet wide and god only knew how deep all around it lay broken chunks of earthwork timbers snapped like dry twigs guns tossed every which way and twisted bodies in mottled green like him most of the others emerging from the confederate works paused to gape in wonder and disbelief up ahead of them nathan bedford forrest turned gestured furiously come on you bastards and fetch the ladders right now do you hear me we aint got time to waste that was true not only were the guns in the bastion itself destroyed but the endless repeaters to either flank had fallen silent the men at them momentarily stunned by the disaster that had befallen their comrades and doubtless wondering if the ground was about to heave up under them as well caudell dashed forward shouting for all he was worth he reached the edge of the crater slid down into it on his backside more wreckage lay strewn over the bottom and more bodies some of them moved as he scrambled past he stopped and stared again wondering how anyone could have lived through that explosion but nathan bedford forrest disdaining to wait for ladders was already climbing the far wall of the hole and yelling come on come on come on caudell hurried after hima general who went out ahead of his men could always pull them after him forrest grimy now as any private soldier reached out a hand and helped pull caudell up onto the flat ground beyond the crater behind them teams of soldiers were carrying ladders across the bottom of the hole leaning up against the wall so others could ascend off to either side the repeaters started their deadly stutter again but hundreds of confederates were almost to the crater inside it or coming up the ladders there was captain lewis shouting orders and waving to get the men into a line of battle keep moving forrest shouted come on keep moving bullets chewed the grass close to his feet spat dirt into caudells face that was ak fire from the bushes ahead the rivington men had detached fighters to try to plug the gap the confederates had blown in their line caudell dove behind the closest cover he saw a corpse wearing mottled green and brown its head and neck twisted at an impossible angle he fired several rounds before he realized the blank staring face a few inches from his own belonged to piet hardie his lips skinned back from his teeth in a savage smile he gave the corpse a familiar thump on the shoulder how many more wenches did you aim to torment to death piet too bad you wont get the chance isnt it quicker than you deserved to go too maybe not caudell decided once hed said that a noose would have been quick and if ever a man deserved a noose piet hardie did once out of their earthworks the rivington men were vulnerable the confederates knew how to attack mere riflemen and their numbers counted for more than their foes armor and helmets some men in gray rushed forward in small groups while others fired to cover their advance then the groups reversed roles leapfrogging past one another as they fanned out to get around the handful of defenders so long piet caudell leaped to his feet and hunched low dashed toward a broken tree fifty yards away bullets whipped past him as he ran he sprawled behind the scanty protection the tree trunk gave him fired to support a double handful of men moving up on his right then he was running again in the direction of a tall clump of grass behind him and to his left one of the rivington mens endless repeaters fell silent a minute later so did the one on the other side rebel yells rang through the continuing racket of rifle fire caudell whooped as loud as anyone with those murderous repeaters out of action the rivington men could not hope to keep the whole confederate army from going not only through henry pleasantss crater but around it to either side nathan bedford forrest saw that too forward boys with me they aint got a prayer of holdin us back now he was normally softspoken caudell had noticed that back in nashville and in the trenches but at need on the stump or in the middle of a fight his voice swelled to carry as far as he wanted he pointed north and east were an hour from rivington lets go the soldiers cheered like madmen cheers or no though rivington proved more than an hour away if the confederates knew how to advance against rifle fire the rivington men were artists on defense they gave ground only grudgingly in a reverse of the leapfrog pattern their opponents used to move forward they made stand after stand stalling the confederates again and again surely inflicting far more casualties than they suffered but the confederates had soldiers to spend and the rivington men did not the gray line grew ever wider flanking the rivington men out of one position after another forrest did not would not let the advance flag whenever a handful of rivington men held out against everything the confederates could throw at them he cried come on boys well go around pull the weed up by the roots and the leaves are bound to wither nate he whirled where he lay his ak swinging almost of its own accord to bear on the person whod startled him he jerked the barrel down in a hurry jesus god mollie i damn near shot you are you all right cept for you just now havin your gun on me sure you yup how much farther to rivington she frowned as she thought such a serious involuted almost harsh expression should have made her face seem more than usually masculine especially in this warlike setting but instead she reminded nate of a girl trying to remember where shed put her pincushion he wanted to carry her back to nashville a notion as tender as it was impracticable three four miles i reckon she answered at last then she brought her rifle up to her shoulder fired a couple of quick shots thought i saw somethin movin in them bushes up there reckon not though come on caudell looked ahead for the next likely piece of cover he pointed toward a thick stand of pine saplings he went first with mollie ready to open fire on anyone who shot at him when nobody did he got down on one knee and covered her advance they were still near the foaming crest of the confederate wave for they could hear nathan bedford forrest loudly and profanely urging his men on he was also yelling something new we get into rivington dont you go burning any houses you hear me not even if theres some of these muddy green boys shootin from em anybody burns a house and i catch him hell wish a rivington man put a bullet through his head instead god damn me to hell if i lie what do you suppose thats all about caudell asked while wanton arson was not a legitimate tool of war hed never heard it so specifically and vehemently forbidden nate you got to remember i been in them houses mollie hesitated nate grimaced recalling how and why shed been in them when she saw he would do no more than grimace she hurried on aint nothin like em nowheres else the books the lights the cool air that blows the books he exclaimed the picture history of the civil war had come out of one of those rivington houses if they held more volumes of that ilk the confederate authorities had good reason to want them preserved makes sense to me mollie said when he quickly explained his reasoning marse robert he was plumb took with the one you had me bring him for the next few minutes neither of them had much chance to talk the rivington men did their best to rally they seemed to be in somewhat greater numbers now reinforced by their fellows rushing down from the town rifle grenades bursting among the confederates created brief consternation but after weeks of intermittent mortar fire the small bombs were not so terrifying and now that they were forced from their fortified positions the rivington men even reinforced lacked the troops to halt determined attackers determined the confederates were the advance resumed someone moaned from behind a clump of beggarweeds caudell and mollie hurried over ready to help a wounded comrade but the man back there was not a comrade his mottled tunic and trousers proclaimed his allegiance to america will break blood from a wound above the knee soaked one leg of those trousers turning dark green and brown to black got you caudell yelled distracted from his pain the rivington man whipped his head around it was benny lang he was utterly defenseless his rifle lay several feet away caudells finger tightened on the trigger of his ak dont mollie exclaimed guessing what was in his mind he aint one of the real bad ones nate no caudell remembered george ballentine but that memory wasnt nearly all of why he wanted to put a bullet through benny lang it wasnt exactly as if mollie had been unfaithful with the rivington mannot exactly but pretty close but after a few seconds nate lowered the rifle a little if hed killed lang here in the bushes man against man and gun against gun that was war and fair enough try as he would though he couldnt make himself think of blowing out the back or a wounded mans head as anything but murder thanks lang said when he no longer looked straight down the muzzle of the ak help me cut my trouser leg off so i can get a bandage he was half stunned from his injury and no doubt he didnt remember seeing mollie bean in uniform just as caudell had never seen her in properly feminine clothes until that morning in church but her voice must have registered at last for he blurted jesus christ moll is that you moll the pet name made nate ready to shoot him again mollie ground her teeth before she answered almost inaudibly its me all right benny i soldiered beforeim sorry i lied to you when you ast me how i got shot and this hereshe raised her chin looked defiantly at caudell as if daring him to deny itthis heres my intended nate caudell the wounded man got out part of a laugh before it turned into a hiss caudell christ i remember youi taught you the ak didnt i small bloody world what caudell numb with suddenly having to be sociable on the battlefield managed a nod lang had both hands on his wound where his trousers looked black those hands were red he said im going to reach for my knife ill do that very slowly and i give you my word of honor i wont throw the knife once i have itthere are two of you after all and only the one blade caudell nodded again now with assurancethis was business as lang got out the knife he scooped up the rivington mans rifle he did not relax his vigilance not one bit after the richmond massacre could a member of america will break be trusted to honor a parole but benny lang did only what hed promised slicing his pants leg so he could see the wound in the outside of his thigh had it been to the inside he would have bled to death in short order as it was caudell who had enough experience with gunshot wounds to make a fair judge thought he would recover if fever didnt carry him off lang might have been reading his mind i carry medicine to keep wounds from going bad im going to get that now and a pressure bandage again he moved with slow care the medicine came in a little packet he tore it open sprinkled some powder onto his leg and slapped on the bandage then he held the packet out to caudell theres some left you may need it in a while oror your mollie caudell took the medicine packet grunted gruffly as he stuck it in his pocket he didnt want to feel beholden to benny lang not any which way gruff still he said stay here someone will take you back to the surgeons pretty soon spare me that lang said its a throughandthrough wound so your doctors wont have to dig the bullet outnot bloody likely youll take me to one of ours is it i know your men mean well but he shuddered at the very idea then shook his head it all went so well for us till lee was elected since then everythings been buggered up he put a hand on the bandage as if still unwilling to believe ruination could have chosen to visit him personally hes as settled as hes going to be caudell said to mollie lets get moving but before they could leave something in benny langs pocket let out a flatulent burst of noise and then words report your position and status lang over nates rifle came up again what the devil is that its called a radio the rivington man answered think of it as a talking telegraph without wires may i answer curiosity and caution fought within caudell curiosity won barely go ahead but if you betray us itll be the last thing you ever do he jerked the ak to emphasize his words right lang eyed the rifles muzzle with respect he took out something a little smaller than a lowcut shoe extended a telescoping metal rod from one end spoke into the other lang here i am wounded and captured out you can talk with your people on thatradio did you sayany time you want cant you caudell asked when the rivington man nodded nate held out a hand give it here lang scowled instead of obeying he smashed the radio against a goodsized rock as hard as he could pieces flew in every direction he said do what you want with me i wont let you spy on us caudells blood had cooled after a moments anger he reluctantly lowered his rifle if hed been in the rivington mans place he hoped hed have had the courage to do as lang had mollie thought of something else youve had these radio things all along havent you ever since you came here benny lang nodded again caudell saw what mollie was driving at and you never let on did you having these things would have helped us almost as much as our repeaters i reckon but you never let on why not if wed needed to badly enough i think we would have the rivington man answered but we always thought it was a good idea to keep a few secrets of our own you play poker yes nate said then think of them as an ace in the hole fat lot of good they did you caudell took a couple of steps toward the crackle of gunfire ahead mollie started to follow benny lang grimaced when he saw that you be careful moll bullets have no chivalry found that out at gettysburg she told him i hope you make it i do but after that she quickly turned back to caudell im ready nate she left lang without looking behind her as they pushed on caudell said so im your intended am i he thought he kept his voice light it must not have been light enough mollie turned and looked at him through frightened eyes well aint you he wondered how many battlefields had known arguments like this one precious few he thought then he realized he had to answer mollie yup reckon i am he said long as we both come out of this alive her face glowed with that special shine that could make her beautiful even if she was not particularly pretty seeing her expression caudell felt himself grinning too now that the words were said he found he rather liked the idea of being an intended it gave him a feeling of purpose conspicuously missing from combat but hed said other words as well and coming out of the fight alive was by no means guaranteed for him or for mollie the woods ended so abruptly that he had to bring himself up short to keep from blundering into open country swearing at himself he peered from behind a tree at the estate ahead the colonnaded big house with wings spreading out to either side would not have shamed any successful planter in the state the rows of clapboard slave cabins also argued for extravagant prosperity but caudell scratched his head the slaves had their garden plots and there was a barn for livestock but where were the broad acres of corn or cotton or tobacco needed to support such a grand estate when he asked that aloud mollie said the rivington men aint all planters nate but they all live like they was why not they got the gold for it remember maybe from sellin all our rifles to the govment maybe caudell said though vivid memory reminded him the confederate government had been a lot longer on promises than hard cash in but however they came by it gold the rivington men certainly had he could almost feel the sweet heaviness of the oneounce coins hed got from the rivington bank just after wars end he shrugged one more answer hed never know how the rivington men got their money didnt matter not in the middle of a fight what did matter was that for the moment anyway no one was shooting from the big house caudell rubbed his chin the nearest slave hut was hardly more than fifty yards away he pointed toward it mollie nodded nate dashed forward bent at the waist to make as small a target as possible he dove behind the hut fetched up against it with a thump as soon as he was safe mollie sprinted up beside him they lay there panting for a few seconds then got to their feetthey still stooped for the roof was too low to offer much coverand sidled around toward the front of the cabin they almost ran into a tall skinny negro man hurrying the other wayand almost killed him too for caudells heart leaped into his mouth and his finger tightened on the trigger of his rifle by mollies gasp the unexpected meeting frightened her just as badly if they were frightened the slave was terrified he jumped backwards screaming like a woman and threw his hands high over his head don shoot me he squealed don shoot poor ol raggedy shadrach who aint done you no harm then he seemed to see the uniforms caudell and mollie were wearing instead of merely the aks they carried his eyes widened till they looked like splashes of whitewash on his black face lawd god he said you aint them devils what owns us you gummint sojers thats right caudell said thinking that raggedy was a word that fit shadrach like a second skin plenty of his first skin was plain to see for his gray cotton jacket and trousers were little more than rags by the ladder of ribs thus exposed caudell guessed he was fed no better than he was clothed now his eyes got wider still caudell hadnt thought they could gummint sojers the negro repeated wonderingly he capered like a stick puppet then leaped forward to fold caudell and mollie into a bony rank embrace is powerful glad to see you gentlemens deed i is you kill every one o them devils in green you hear me kill em daid every rivington nigger there is ll bless you fo it caudell blinked he was not used to this kind of ecstatic greeting from a slave during the second american revolution negroes had run away from confederate armies not toward them he wondered again what sort of horrors the rivington men worked on their blacks though shadrachs condition gave him a clue but that for the moment was by the way he pointed toward the big house any rivington men holed up in there no suh shadrach said positively the massa he off fightin gainst you folks couple other devils run by here a while backhe gestured vaguelybut they don stop you hunt em down suh hunt em down ifn you has to use dogs every nigger here he never complain about nothin no mo not ifn you gets em all you give us guns we shoots em our own selves i believe you caudell said he did too where before the war he would have laughed at the idea that negroes might make soldiers before the war of course no negro would have been so suicidally foolhardy as to ask one white man for arms to use against another marse robert he gwine set the niggers free like we hear tell shadrach asked a little at a time yes caudell said which was plenty to set the slave dancing again if that house is empty we got to get going mollie said caudell nodded he glanced back as he trotted away shadrach was still capering beside the mean little slave cabins a couple of women gaudy in brightly striped skirts and wearing red handkerchiefs on their heads stepped out of their huts shadrach pointed at caudell and mollie said something the women screeched for joy and started dancing too one of them was big with child hurrying past the big house caudell wondered who had put that child in her a few hundreds yards past the clearing fighting picked up the coughing snarl of an endless repeater brought caudell to a respectful halt off to the right he heard nathan bedford forrest yelling i see the dirty son of a bitch well git himhe aint dug his self in yet sure enough after a minute or so the rivington repeater fell silent and rebel yells rang out in triumph caudell and mollie moved forward again past the dead gunner he had sited his weapon wellsay what you would of them the rivington men were no mean soldiersbut in this chaotic fighting had lacked time to use the spade now he also lacked most of his face mollie and caudell came up to another palatial mansion this one also flanked by slave huts all the shabbier in comparison to the big house mollie frowned after some little hesitation she said that theres benny langs place is it caudells voice was as neutral as he could make it he paused for thought finally found something safe to add he never seemed to notice his book was missing youre right mollie said reckon with the war over and all he didnt need to read about it no more caudell chewed on that a few seconds before he nodded as lang himself had said everythingthe war includedwent the rivington mens way until lee became president of the confederacy and when things went badly afterwardsi think you put all this in train when you took that book wasnt all me nate caudell she said sounding almost angry you reckon idve ever thought of anything as crazy as goin up to marse robert by my lonesome not likely maybe not he admitted i wont lose sleep over my part though the way i look at it is like this if the rivington men are the sort of people who could do something like the richmond massacre they arent the sort of people who ought to be near the top of the heap they would have done something else just as bad sooner or later with us or without us they need putting down and were just the ones who happen to be doing the job might could be youre right mollie said thoughtfully and after a moment reckon maybe you are you got a good way of lookin at things nate most important thing i want to look at now is the both of us getting through this aliveintended the way mollies face kindled made caudell glad hed tacked on the last word they went by or near several more big new houses the rivington men had built far back into the woods from what once was the sleepy little town of rivington about a mile and a half from the western edge of what had been the town the rivington men made a serious stand you want to watch yourself a corporal warned as caudell came up they got wire with teeth strung out up ahead you try crawlin through it it slows you down an they shoot you bodies hung up at grotesque angles underscored the fellows caution from behind the wire the rivington men traded fire with the confederates nathan bedford forrest stalked down the stalled confederate line his dark gray eyes flashed with frustration we got to keep drivin they get a chance to dig in here we have to start allover again goddamn it suddenly he pounded fist into open palm laughed out loud turning to an aide who walked beside him he said major strange i reckon its about time to send in a flag of truce major j p strange forrests adjutant was a darkhaired man of about the generals age with a high broad forehead sweeping mustaches and a graying beavertail of a beard he said the usual message sir theyd best surrender or we shant answer for the consequences the very same forrest chuckled reminiscently dont know how many times we slickered the yankees with that one during the war course after fort pillow they was more inclined to believe it than they had been before let me scout out some white cloth and a stick sir strange said a few minutes later he stepped out between the two lines waving the parley flag firing slowed stopped a rivington man called come ahead and say your say graycoat we wont shoot forsay an hour strange looked back at forrest who nodded agreed the major said holding the white flag high he walked forward a rivington man almost invisible in his mottled clothes and what looked like green and brown face paint took charge of him caudell lit a cigar and prepared to enjoy the brief ceasefire long before the hour was up though he saw the white flag returning a tall rivington man accompanied major strange may i cross to speak with you general forrest he shouted come ahead mr rhoodie forrest shouted backthe truce has a while to run he waited for the rivington men to approach then said how do you answer andries caudell listening realized with a small start that the two men wereor had beenfriends i answer no andries rhoodie replied at once i know your tricksive read of them often enough remember youll not bluff me into giving up forrests swarthy face darkened further with rage few men care to be called predictable especially men as wily as the confederate general if you think im bluffing this time andries you are mistaken if you do not yield you will likely die here and if i do yield what will happen to me rhoodie retorted after richmond if im taken ill dance on air which you know as well as i and we may hold you yet hold us sir forrests laugh sounded more like a bay you havent the chance of a snake in the garden of eden of holding us how many battles did you win by bluff rhoodie said you wont bluff me i won by bluff when i was weak i aint weak now andries you say so want to see my army so you know what ive got it was rhoodies turn to laugh how many of them would i see three times to make you look stronger than you are you can trick damnfool yankees that way but dont expect me to fall for it git back to your lines rhoodie or youll find the truce runnin out a mite early forrest growled taking a step toward the rivington man he was ten years older than rhoodie and while large could not match his massive frame still caudell would have bet on him in a fighthe had a fire a vitality the rivington man lacked but andries rhoodie if stolid next to forrest was also stolid enough not to be overawed by him he held his ground glowering like a big slow bear facing a panther how many lives do you want to spend taking us down few as i have to forrest said but when it comes to that andries i got more lives to spend than you that worked for grant against lee till you came along didnt it reckon it can work just as well for us this time most of the confederates who heard forresteven major strangefrowned and scratched their heads wondering what he was talking about caudell started to frown with them until he remembered the picture history of the civil war if forrest hadnt seen it he knew of something like it and knew it was true rhoodie knew that too for the first time forrest succeeded in rocking him he ground his teeth once twice three times then without another word he turned and stamped back to his own line nineteen ninetysix caudell thought as he watched that broad retreating back but there was no dream to it somehow the rivington men had slid back through time to change the way the second american revolution turned out and having changed that theyd also tried to change the subsequent confederate governmenttried to change it by gunfire caudells hands tightened on his own ak they werent going to get away with it nathan bedford forrest muttered a curse which his mustache muffled he too stared after andries rhoodie when he turned back to his own troops his eye fell on caudell and mollie bean his gaze sharpened i saw you two back at nashville with pleasants he said not making it a question youre from around these parts then yes sir they said together mollie added matter of fact sir im from rivington are you forrest said suddenly smiling suppose you could guide a company around east to outflank these works the rivington bastards are running up here reckon so mollie answered i expect we can march fastern they can dig i expect so too forrest turned to his adjutant major strange gather a force from the men moving up take command of it and go with bean and caudell herenate envied the general his memoryaround to the right i want you moving before the hours up on account of theyre surely digging now yes sir strange said adding to his guides you two come along with me and help me assemble my force if you do get around them drive straight for rivington forrest said get into their rear one more time and theyre done for question sir strange said at forrests nod he went on do you want us to strike for the town once in their rear or back at the fighting men themselves your usual aim is to beat the army with that accomplished the place it defended will fall of its own accord nothing is usual about the rivington men nathan bedford forrest answered in rivington they have the engine they use to bring in their weaponsi gather they travel here through it too come to that if its taken or wrecked the fighters are done for too so this time i want the town youll have it major strange promised caudell beando i have your names straightcome along now this time i really mean it caudell stumbled over his own feet a couple of times as he followed forrests aidehe wasnt paying much attention to where he was going his mind kept chewing on the idea of an engine that ran through time it made perfect sense the rivington men had to come from somewhen that wasnt but hed never wondered about how they did it until forrest set him thinking the soldiers he and mollie helped strange collect belonged to several different regiments advance was as likely as retreat to break up an armys neat ranks when theyd rounded up about a companys worth the major said all right bean get us around them do my best sir mollie led the impromptu force east saying well go most of the way to the railroad tracks before i try and bring us north theres a little path runs alongside em about half a mile this way good enough strange said the line of the railroad itself is sure to be strongly held but a path his features were not nearly so mobile as those of his commander but anticipation sparked in his eyes the detachment had not been moving long when firing erupted up ahead after a few minutes mortar bombs began falling crump crump crump back around where major strange had chosen his men caudell said im not usually what youd call fond of marching but right this second it looks pretty fine to me major strange who tramped along in front of him bobbed his head up and down in emphatic agreement the din of gunfire faded behind the confederates caudell took that as a good sign hoping it meant the rivington men hadnt the men to extend their wired line all the way from the position theyd been defending to the wilmington and weldon tracks if they hadhe took a deep breath which had nothing to do with how tired he was if they had enough men for that this detachment was going to get chewed up mollie recognized the path when she came to it nate would have marched right by it was so narrow and overgrown that he wondered if it went back to indian days that made it harder to follow north but also raised his spirits newcomers like the rivington men might never have discovered it no wire with teeth reached out to trap him for enemy guns the soldiers who marched with him had seen too much war to make a lot of unnecessary noise but they grinned and checked their rifles they knew what they were gaining here how close to the town do the woods grow strange asked mollie inside half a mile sir she answered the major beamed like a cherub as it turned out they didnt do quite as well as mollie expected they came to a new clearing with a halfbuilt big house in the middle of it on the far side were four or five rivington men hurrying toward the fighting they stopped in comic dismay as the confederates began coming out of the woods then one of them raised his repeater to his shoulder and started shooting the fierce little fire fight lasted only a few minutes even with body armor four or five were no match for a company major strange was rubbing his chin as he trotted north he waved the detachment to a halt told off about a quarter of his little force and pointed them westward i know the general told me to drive for the town but the rivington men have to know were here now after the racket we just made he said i dont aim to be hit from the side when i m supposed to be doing the hitting myself the men hed split off from his main command went regretfully but they went stranges order made too much military sense to be disobeyed even by soldiers who wanted to be in at the kill theyd all been outflanked at one time or another and didnt fancy ending up on the receiving end of that punishment ever again strange waved once more lets go skirmish order the confederates formed two lines the men well separated from one another and rolled forward a few shots came from in front of them but only a few nate let loose with a rebel yell as the whitewashed bulk of the notahilton began playing peekaboo through the trees gunfire crackled not far off to the left mollie pointed toward j p strange nodded approvingly so did caudell sure enough the rivington men had tried to swing back on the detachment always nice to have an officer who can see past the end of his beard caudell thought something went pop under strange the noise was loud enough to make caudell who trotted along perhaps fifty yards to the right of the major look his way he saw a black cylinder bounce out of the ground about to the level of stranges waist a split second later came another much louder blast the major collapsed with gruesome bonelessness almost torn in two a couple of men closest to him on either side also went down small deadly pieces of metal buzzed past caudell like angry bees torpedo the cry rose from half a dozen throats caudell wished he could glide through the air or like jesus walk on water but there was no help for it but to run on once we take rivington we dont have to worry about torpedoes again as long as we live he shouted as much for his own spirits sake as for the men around him he blinked when they raised a cheer and there all at once lay the town whose name had become a curse all through the confederacy only a handful of men in mottled green were on the street caudell fired at one of them several other confederates opened up at the same time so even though the man fell he was not sure his bullet had brought him down the other rivington men scrambled for cover remembering nathan bedford forrests orders to poor major strange caudell yelled watch where they retreat to thatll be what the general wants us to take out following his own advice wasnt easy the rivington men were far from the only people dashing this way and that a great many shrieking slaves some white men in ordinary clothesthe true rivington men caudell thoughtand a handful of women scattered in panic at the sound of gunfire the railroad station mollie said and that did indeed seem to be where the rivington men were retreating one corner of caudells mouth twisted down hed had a small taste of housetohouse fighting when the army of northern virginia took washington city and he didnt care for it of course nobody ever bothered to ask a soldier whether he cared for the job he was doing he crawled down to the end of the horse trough behind which he and mollie lay looking for the next piece of cover hed run to as he did so he saw two men in splotched green dart over the tracks it aint the station he said forgetting all his carefully cultivated grammar theyre making for that shed across the way he remembered the shed and the armed guard whod prowled around it from his train trip through rivington on the way home after the war but for four years weathering it looked the same now as it had then they crazy mollie said they cant fight from the shed she was rightthe only thing that made the shed different from a big wooden box was its door a determined squad in the train station could have held out for a long time maybe even until the confederates brought up artillery but another rivington man abandoned the station for the shed a bullet knocked him sprawling before he got there he crawled on leaving a trail of blood behind him until he made it through the doorway crazy to go from the station to the shed unless they must keep their time engine in there caudell said the men of america will break were losing their fight for rivington but if theyd come out of a distant time they might be able to go back again the idea angered caudellit seemed like an unfair escape hatch time engine mollie said not now he answered absently the tactics the rivington men were using made him sure hed guessed their game the fighters in the train station were a rear guard holding back the confederates while their fellows one by one dashed for the shed a couple of them stopped bullets and fell but most ran the gauntlet of fire they knew their business even when but one man was left in the station he kept firing now from this window now from that so his foes took a little while to realize he was alone and he let go a long sprayed burst before he sprinted across the tracks forcing enough of the confederates to duck that he made it to the shed safe the door swung closed behind him only when silence lengthened did some of the confederates warily emerge from cover a lieutenantin the confusion caudell never had caught his nametrotted up to the shed if any rivington men remained inside he was a dead man but no one fired from in there he waved his hat signaling it was safe to approach caudell came up slowly wondering if things could be as peaceful as they seemed the young lieutenant started to pull the door open then thought better of it he sent several rounds through the rough pine boards when all stayed silent he grinned and yanked on the iron handle a blast of yellow flame a roarthe mine literally blew him out of his shoes but for those shoes all that was left of him was a great red smear on the ground and the train tracks the three men behind him also went down as if scythed so did the facing wall of the station another torpedo half deafened by the explosion caudell could hardly hear himself scream mollie saw something he had not pointing she said all the blast came out in one direction i wonder how they did that when nate head still ringing helplessly spread his hands she stepped close and bawled in his ear till he understood however the rivington men managed their hellish tricks he was just glad he hadnt been right in front of the shed along with the four men instantly killed several others were down badly wounded their cries pierced the thick wool that still seemed to swaddle caudells ears but the door to the shed was openopen for good now caudell glanced at mollie she nodded though her face mirrored the dread he felt they ran for the doorway together shouting for all they were worth and firing as they went the air inside smelled hot and burnt caudell dove and rolled he bumped up against a stack of crates neatly stenciled meals ready to eat mollie crouched beside him he blinked again and again to make his eyes adapt to the sudden gloom the shed wasnt as dark as it should have been over in one corner hidden behind more crates a bright white light shone off the cobwebby ceiling mollie pointed to it with the muzzle of her ak thats the same kind of light benny lang had in his house cept he had em all over not just the one to hell with benny lang but caudell was already scuttling forward on hands and knees reckon weve got to find out what that is mollie went right behind him and several other soldiers too he waved them to a halt when he came to a turn in the maze of crates if i touch off another torpedo no need for us all to go up he rounded corners one by one each time by himself he didnt think about bravery till long afterwards at the time the only thing in his mind was the luckless lieutenants empty shoes if he did touch off a torpedo hed never know what hit him oddly that helped steady him hed seen too many worse ways of dying then he came to the last turn ahead of him the light spilled out bright as day maybe brighter one of the men in back of mollie said where the helld all them rivington bastards get to caudell turned the corner since he had no idea what a time engine was supposed to look like he couldnt have honestly said the machine took him by surprise it had a small platform perhaps three feet square that glowed almost like the sun his first quick thought when he saw it was relief that it was no largerwho could say what deviltry the rivington men might have brought from the future through a big time engine he blinked so he could squint through the glare and to make sure he could trust his eyes on that platform stood a rivington man but caudell could see right through him as if he were one of the ghosts old negroes talked about incessantly while one part of him chewed on that another brought up his repeater before he truly thought about what he was doing he squeezed off half a dozen rounds the bullets passed right through the rivington man he did not crumplehe disappeared the glowing platform went dark plunging the shed into blackness the confederates behind caudell shouted in alarm for that matter so did he the time engine spat sparks like a railroad car going forty miles an hour with its brakes locked the wall behind it and the crates to either side caught fire almost at once lets get out of here three people yelled together the soldiers scrambled and stumbled and cursed their way back through the maze toward the light from the sheds blasted doorway caudell who brought up the rear was coughing and choking on smoke by the time he made it to the blessed fresh air but even as he rubbed his streaming eyes he wondered what had happened to the rivington man on the platform when he shot up the time engine had the man made it backor rather forwardto his own year when the engine smashed to bits was he rudely dumped into or or or had he vanished into a limbo of no time at all caudell knew he would never find outor stop wondering a brisk crackle of gunfire from the south made him quit speculating in a hurry here were the outflanked rivington men come too late to save their link to whatever year had spawned them but they still carried rifles in their hands and theyd proved themselves fighters as tough as any caudell had ever run into if they wanted revenge they could take a fairsized chunk of it caudell ran south away from the burning shed he flopped down by the horse trough from which hed fired at the train station only now on the opposite side where was mollie there shooting from behind the steps of the general store a big knot of fear eased inside him when he saw her the shed and the supplies inside blazed fiercely now he could feel the heat on the back of his neck from a hundred yards away he looked over his shoulder the thick column of black black smoke mounting to the sky came from the funeral pyre of the rivington mens hopes he peeked round the edge of the horse trough for a muzzle flash at which to shoot he fired twice then the ak clicked uselesslyanother clip empty he clicked in his last one chambered a round as he did so he remembered how nearly impossible it was to load a rifle musket while lying down he crawled along peeked round the other edge of the troughmaybe someone in mottled green was waiting for him to show up in the same place twice in a row he hadnt lived through the second american revolution by being stupid no muzzle flashesbut what was that flapping from behind a pokeberry bush a white flag he said doubting his own words while he spoke them aloud but a white flag it was a rivington man stepped out from cover to wave it back and forth slowly firing on both sides died away the men of america will break emerged one by one hands raised in surrender even after a couple of dozen fighters in mottled green all of them rifleless came out into the open caudell stayed low behind the horse trough he had trouble believing the rivington men after battling so long and hard against everything the confederacy could throw at them would give up now nor was he alone hardly any confederate soldiers left hiding places to take charge of their enemies so the rivington men kept walking hands up heads down that more than anything else at last convinced caudell they really were giving up they looked like beaten troops he got to his feet ready to dive back to safety in an instant at the least hint of danger when mollie made as if to join him he waved her back saying keep me covered some of the other confederates moved with him others stayed in place to support them how many he was not sure for when he turned around to look he could see only a couple of them he also saw the blacks and native whites of rivington coming out of their hiding places now that the shooting had stopped a few of them also started toward the men of america will break the men who had ruled their town ruled their lives for the past four years and more the man with the white flag was the same big fellow who had parleyed with nathan bedford forrest caudell searched for his name found it andries rhoodie rhoodie turned his head from one of the approaching confederates to the next finally he made straight for nate hailing him with you seem to be the ranking soldier here sir me caudells voice was a startled squeak he looked quickly to either side sure enough rhoodie was right no confederate officers had broken coverhe wondered if any of the detachments officers were still aliveand no other first sergeants he gathered himself yes sir i guess i am at that im first sergeant nate caudell th north carolina then you are the man to whom we must surrender rhoodie sounded as if he would sooner have faced red indians scalping knives he wore no sword but took off a belt that held a holstered pistol thrust it at caudell here uh thanks though no connoisseur of surrender ceremonies caudell suspected they could be handled with more grace awkwardly not wanting to let go of his ak he belted the pistol round his own waist then he blurted what made you just up and quit like that what the bleeding hell dyou think rhoodie stabbed a finger toward the burning shed with our time machine gone how are we supposed to fight a whole country he did not even try to hide his bitterness caudell forbore to mention that he was the one whod ruined the time machine rhoodie had called it but nettled by the rivington mans tone he said even when you had it we were whipping youotherwise how did we get here rhoodie glared then seemed to crumple his shoulders sagged the iron went out of his backbone he stared down at his heavy boots behind caudell sudden shouts rang out hey whats that crazy nigger doin wheres he goin look out somebody stop him as caudell turned a short scrawny black man wearing only a pair of tattered trousers shot past him the negro clenched a broken whiskey bottle with a wordless shriek of hate he drove the jagged end into andries rhoodies throat blood spurted spectacularly crimson in the afternoon sun rhoodie let out a gobbling choking scream brought up his hands to clutch at the gaping wound but blood poured between his fingers from his mouth from his nose he took a couple of wobbling steps tottered fell another rivington man grabbed for a bandage pack like the one benny lang had used knelt by rhoodie andries he shouted and then something in a guttural language caudell did not know rhoodie lay still after a minute or two the other rivington man stood up shaking his head under dirt and streaks of green and black paint his face was white the negro threw down the broken bloody bottle he turned to the confederates saying massers yall do what you want wif me i dured moren man was meant to dure from dat white devil you look heah he ran his hands up and down his ribcage which showed in even sharper relief than that of the slave with whom caudell had talked outside of town an heah he turned to show his back and the scars old and new crisscrossing it i aint no ornery uppity nigger massers sweah to god i aintdat rhoodie he jus evil to his boys i seen him heah an i couldnt take no mo caudell and the rest of the soldiers in gray looked at one another in confusion wondering what to do next a black who slew a white had to die so said generations of law but if the white was an enemy of the confederate states a man whod led the rivington fighters who was wanted in connection with the richmond massacre and who moreover had abused the black outrageously generations of law said the black still had to die generations of custom dictated against bothering with much law no one raised a gun against the negro after a long pause caudell jerked a thumb back toward rivington youd better get out of here the negro stared then fled as fast as hed come butthat kafthat niggerhe just murdered a blanka white a rivington man spluttered furiously shut up you four soldiers growled in the same breath one added reckon the son of a bitch had it coming by god caudell thought the same thing but hadnt quite had the nerve to say it out loud that someone did showed the south was indeed different from what it had been in xix the door to the presidential mansion stood open for the fortnightly levee moths got in with the people but to close the door would have made the place stifling along with june summer had come to richmond more moths fluttered hopefully against the window screen looking for their chance to immolate themselves in the gaslights within robert e lee and his daughter mary stood just inside the front hall greeting visitors as they arrived good evening sir and madamhow are you today senator magoffin well mr secretary what brings you here jefferson davis allowed himself a thin selfdeprecating smile i just thought i would drop by to see how this house was getting along without me it seems to be doing quite well you also expressed a certain small interest in hearing the latest gossip as i recall varina davis said with a twinkle in her eye i davis looked at lee mr president i submit myself to your judgment can you conceive of my making such a preposterous statement no but then i cannot conceive of your lovely wife lying about it either lee replied i never knew you were such a diplomat jefferson davis exclaimed while varinas creamy shoulders shook with merriment the former president went on had you shown this talent previously i might have sent you to europe in place of mason and slidell in that case sir i am glad i hid my light under a bushel lee said which won him a small laugh from davis and a bigger one from his wife mary lee said you both seem happier now that you are out of this house happier jefferson davis soberly considered that and after a moment shook his headno i think not easier might be a better word in that the full weight of responsibility now lies on your fathers broad and capable shoulders the full weight of thirst now lies on my narrow parched throat varina davis said with your kind consent gentleman mary i aim to raid the punch bowl her maroon skins stiff with crinoline rustled about her as she sailed grandly toward the refreshment table set against the far wall of the room with a final bow jefferson davis followed his wife once he was out of earshot lee said let him claim what he will my dear maryi am certain you are right ive not seen such spring in his stride since our days back at west point when the stream of guests slowed lee claimed a goblet of punch for himself and drifted through the crowd listening that to him was what was most valuable about the levees they let him get a feel for what richmond thoughtor at least talked aboutwhich he could have had in no other way two things seemed to be on peoples minds tonight the recent surrender of the last america will break rebels down in north carolina and the continuing congressional debate on the bill that weakened slavery a plump prosperouslooking man approached lee and said see here sir if we are to set about turning our niggers loose why then did we shed so much blood separating ourselves from yankeedom we might as well rejoin the united states as emancipate our slaves i fear i cannot agree with you sir lee answered we spent our blood to regain the privilege of settling our own affairs as we choose rather than having such settlements enforced upon us by other sections of the us which chose a way different from ours and which enjoyed a numerical preponderance over us bah the man said succinctly and started to stomp off sir let me tell you something if i may lee said the fellow stopped however much he disagreed with his president he recognized an obligation to listen to him lee went on when i went into washington city after it fell to our arms lord lyons the british minister to the united states asked me a question i have never forgotten as we had made the confederate states into a nation what son of nation would it be the man had an answer ready the same sort as it was before the war of course but we are not the same now as then nor can we again become so lee said as the minister pointed out commerce demands we playa role in the wider world and the war was hard on us and harder on our institutions including that of negro servitude i would sooner make some small accommodations now give the negro some stake in the southwhich is after all his country toothan face perhaps servile insurrection in ten years time or twenty i wouldnt the man snapped this time he did leave lee sighed hed had similar conversations before at these levees every one of them saddened him how could so many people be unable to see past their own noses he did not know the answer to that but it was demonstrably true he cheered up when mississippi congressman ethelbert barksdale came over to him and said i heard the last part of your talk with that fat fool mr president of course he doesnt fear fighting in a slave uprising by the look of him he probably didnt fight in the second american revolution eitheror dont you think hes the kind who would have hired a substitute i shouldnt care to impugn the courage or patriotism of a man i do not know sirbut you may very well be right lee said sometimes a small taste of malice was sweet the pleasure swiftly faded though but there are so many with views like his that i fear for my bill it will pass sir barksdale said earnestly he was a confederate party man through and through having backed jefferson davis in war and peace and lee after him hed barely kept his own congressional seat in the past election just riding out forrests mississippi landslide now he lowered his voice if youd told him what the awb was really working toward he would have turned up his toes with men of his stripe i wonder even about that lee said gloomily but barksdale had a point without the richmond massacre and the books in the awbs secret room no bill limiting slavery in any way would have had a prayer of getting through the confederate congress in the aftermath of the murders and of the revelations from the awb sanctum his legislation did have a chance maybe even a good one as often happens with those who would do evil the rivington men proved their own worst enemies that they did barksdale looked left right back over his shoulder let his voice fall even further so that lee had to lean close to hear him and speaking of the rivington men mr president what shall be done with the ones captured in the fighting round their home town home base lee corrected you pose an interesting question congressman they were of course taken in arms against the confederacy a prima facie case for treason if ever there was one were we to hang them not a voice could be raised against us barksdale stared at him you mean they might not hang you startle me nothing is yet decided they fall under military rather than civil jurisdiction both on account of their rebellion and because nash county north carolina where they were captured had had the right to the writ of habeas corpus revoked and fell under the administration of general forrest ah i see barksdales face cleared the question is whether to hang em or shoot em i dont much care one way or the other theyll end up equally dead with either which is the point of the exercise after all eh as i say nothing is yet decided but ldo want to thank you again for your sterling work in support of the bill regulating negroes labor have you any idea yet when it might come up for a vote as was his habit ethelbert barksdale licked his lips while he thought the vote in the house might be as early as next week if it passes therehmm senators having fewer limits on their debate than representatives the bill may well encounter considerable delay in the upper house before it goes up or down i mislike delay lee said fretfully the longer legislators had to bury in their memories the richmond massacre and the truth about the awb the likelier they were to revert to comfortable traditional southern thought patternsinto which slavery fit only too well i trust sir that you will do your best to move the bill forward in the house with the utmost expedition barksdale puffed out the chest of his starched white shirt till he looked like a pouter pigeon mr president you may rely upon me if he was pompous he was also sincere lee gave him credit for that replying i do sir believe me i do the mississippi congressman preened then his eyes narrowed in calculation one way to influence the tally might be the welltimed execution of a rivington man or two i shall bear your advice in mind i assure you lee said barksdale swaggered off pleased and proud to have influenced events but lee though he would remember the advice had no intention of taking it he did not object to executing felons hed ordered rapists and looters in the army of northern virginia hanged to kill a man for the sake of political advantage thoughhe rebelled at that however richly some of the rivington men deserved it he talked for a while with a veteran who had a hook where his left hand should have been gettysburg the third day the fellow said when lee asked him where hed been hurt hed heard that too many times i should never have sent you brave lads forward then ah well it came right in the end sir the veteran said smiling lee nodded touched by his devotion but he would have been equally mutilated had the south lost without even the pride of victory to show for it that would have been his bitter portion had the rivington men not come just as it was now for thousands of maimed men in the north chatting with a couple of pretty girls helped restore lees spirits hed always had an eye for women had corresponded with several for years but never did anything more all through his long marriage now the girls were also eyeing him with a frank feminine speculation hed never noticed before he suddenly realized he was an eligible man once more his face heated the idea frightened him more than any two battles in which hed fought he retreated to the less intimidating company of jefferson davis youre rather flushed the former president observed perhaps you should have the front door opened again in spite of the insects the heat is not what troubles me lee said with such dignity as he could muster davis though far from a savvy politician knew better than to ask what did as lees carriage rolled east along cary street toward libby prison it passed a mule team hauling a barge down the city canal in the james river the twin stacks of the lightdraft gunboat c s s bealeton sent pencils of smoke into the sky the prison was a threestory brick building creamcolored up to the bottom of the secondfloor windows and red above a warehouse before the war it had housed as many as a thousand federal prisoners during the winter of many of them managed to escape not long after lee first met the rivington men but the chimney through which theyd gained access to the basement was long since sealed up moreover more guards kept an eye on the fiftyone rivington men on the third floor than had watched all those yankees lees own bodyguard nevertheless looked nervous as he preceded his charge up the stairs to the secondfloor chickamauga room i shall be quite safe lieutenant i assure you lee said only the one prisoner will be brought in and not only you but several from the force here will be present to make certain nothing goes wrong yes sir the lieutenant said eloquently unconvinced after a moment he added with the awb men sir how do you propose to make certain of anything that is the question lee admitted yes sir his guard repeated fiercely now i mean after what happened at your inauguration he broke off not wanting to hurt lee by reminding him of the illomened day his expression said he would have executed all the captured rivington men without a second thought the chickamauga room as headquarters for the prisoners interrogation had been fitted with a desk by one of its ninepaned windows and a few chairs guards snapped to attention when lee came in while he settled himself at the desk a couple of them hurried off to fetch a captive for him to question the man who returned between the guards was slim and dark and walked with a limp in plain gray shirt and pantsslaves clothes actually the prison warder saved a dollar where he couldhe did not look like one of the fearsome rivington men good morning mr lang lee said he pointed to a chair a few feet in front of the desk you may sit if your wound still troubles you its healing well enough benny lang said he sat all the same lees bodyguard ak ready to fire from the hip interposed himself between chair and desk the men from the libby prison detachment stood off to one side their rifles equally ready as he looked from one of them to another langs mouth shaped an ironic smile i suppose i should be flattered at how dangerous you think i am lees answer was serious the confederacy has learned to its cost how dangerous you rivington men are he watched langs smile fade went on i also wish to inform you so you may pass it on to your fellows upstairs that the house of representatives yesterday passed by a vote of fiftytwo to fortyone the bill regulating the labor of this nations colored individuals the way in which you sought to turn us from that course succeeded only in putting us more firmly upon it lang set his jaw get rid of us then and have done the bodyguards back seemed to radiate agreement with the suggestion lee said you must understand beyond any possible doubt that the direction in which you intended to go is not the one we have chosen for ourselves those of you who grasp that and are able to fully accept it may yet gain the opportunity to redeem your lives despite your treason hows that the rivington man asked scornfully say were sorry and go scotfree im not a big enough fool to believe it i wish to heaven i could you neednt lee said benny lang gave a mordant chuckle ignoring it lee went on if you were ever to regain your freedom you would earn it i assure you lang studied him youre not a man in the habit of lying he said slowly tell me more lee still wondered if he should as his bodyguard had said being certain about anything that had to do with the rivington men was impossible even though theyd been stripped of all their gear from the future right down to their very clothes he couldnt be sure that knowing something of which was ignorant they might not yet find a means to escape and give the confederacy more grief he felt in fact rather like a fisherman who had rubbed a lamp seen a genie come forth and was now wondering howor ifhe could control it if he could though how much good that would bring his country and so cautiously he said you know mr lang that in capturing the awb offices here in richmond and your headquarters down in rivington we have come into possession of a large quantity of volumes from the twentieth and twentyfirst centuries our scholars as you may imagine have fallen on these with glad cries and will spend years gleaning what they can from them if you have the bloody books what do you want with us lang said primarily to serve as bridges a complaint i have heard repeatedly is that your volumes take for granted matters about which we know nothing i confess that having seen your works in action i find this unsurprising we are speaking after all of a gap of a hundred fifty years you men may well prove of great value by helping us understandand perhaps helping us useyour ah artifacts performing that task faithfully and well could in time possibly even expiate the crimes of which you are surely guilty youd use us eh lang cocked his head from your point of view i suppose that makes good sense but how would you know you could trust us there lies the rub lee admitted i am glad you can see it we would be taking a risk with your greater knowledge you might delude the men with whom you work in the same way you sought to delude the entire confederacy as to the path the future would have taken without your interventionand as you tried to do with your speaking wireless telegraph learning of that device still irked lee he said we could have done great things with it in the late warhad you seen fit to reveal its existence lang said we would have i swear it if youd been in trouble as it was as we thought the aks turned out to be plenty to win your freedom and so you concealed a potentially vital tool from us for your own advantage i promise we shall do our best to prevent any future episodes of that sort your rivington men would be split up not permitted to know where your fellows are nor save under most unusual circumstances to communicate with them further you would be required to explain fully to the scholars or mechanics with whom you will be working every step of every process you demonstrate even so we recognize the risk remains though we shall do our utmost to minimize it benny lang made a sour face wed be just like the poor damned german technicians hauled off to russia at the end of world war ii lee did not understand the reference seeing that lang went on never mind whatever you propose is better than hanging i think most of us will be willing to go along i know i will the reason i chose to put the question to you first mr lang is that you are one of the rivington men likeliest to be chosen to help us comprehend the products of your time by most accounts you have comported yourself well here in the confederate states you fought bravely on our behalfand then later it must be said against usand while living the planters life in rivington you treated your negro servants relatively well this lets me hope at least you will be able to accommodate yourself to your changed circumstances ill manage given the alternative you can bet ill manage lang said yes that would offer considerable incentiveso much so in fact that we shall carefully examine every mans sincerity and credentials before even considering his release your sentences may possibly be suspended they shall not be forgotten youd be stupid if you did forget them lang said nodding the other thing that worries me is not an of us know the kinds of things you will want to learn up in our own time we werent professors you know a lot of us were soldiers or police me i repaired computers there you see what i meant about the gap between your time and mine lee said i havent the faintest idea what a ah computer is let alone how to repair one a computer is an electronic machine that calculates and puts information together very quickly benny lang said lee almost asked him what sort of machine he had said but decided not to bother as he doubted the answer would have left him enlightenedthe gap again he chose a simpler question what does a computer look like when lang explained lee grinned like a small boyone mystery solved so thats the proper name for the qwerty for the what langs confusion lasted only a couple of seconds oh you named it for the keyboard didnt you thats not bad give me a steady supply of electricity and ill show you things with that machine the likes of which youve never imagined lee believed him the rivington men had already shown himshown all the southa great many things whose likes had never been imagined some of them he thought should have remained unimagined he wondered if the computer would prove to be one such time alone would tell he said if the device be as useful as you say will you teach us to manufacture more like it we have commenced production of our own aks you know no i didnt know that but it doesnt matter anyhow genera lee three guards growled at the same time lang looked briefly nonplused then realized his mistake sorry president lee if you want me to build you a bloody computer you may as well hang me now i cant do it or rather you cant do it you not only lack the technology you need you lack the technology to make the technology you need and likely a couple of more regressions before that too give me electricity and ill show you how to use however many computers youve captured you can do that until they break down when they do theyre gone for good but you repair computers lee objected you just said as much so i do when i have the proper tools and parts where am i to come by those in and if repairing one becomes a condition for your continued freedomfor your survival benny lang stared bleakly at him then im dead lee liked the answer it bespoke a certain basic honesty if any rivington men ever saw the outside of libby prison he resolved that benny lang would be one of them for now though he said only tell your comrades what i have said to you mr lang before long you will be furnished paper and pens i want a complete listing of the types of knowledge each of you possesses warn the rest not to lie you have lied to the confederacy far too much and any claim one of you proves unable to substantiate will result in his being considered a fullfledged traitor once more do you understand that and agree to it i understand it as for agreeing what choice have i none lee said implacably be warned also that your crimes and your likely trustworthiness will be weighed against what you know when we consider whether to release any of you also mr lang do pass on to your friends the vote of the house of representatives if you are set at liberty you shall not be permitted to meddle in politics is that quite clear the resentment that flared in langs eyes showed it was you give us few choices would you in my position lee said and lang would not meet his gaze he turned to the prison guards take him back upstairs as they marched off with benny lang lee walked back down to the street his bodyguard said sir if it was up to me the only time those bastards ever saw the sun again except through iron bars would be the day we took em out to hang em believe me lieutenant i sympathize with you there lee said but they may yet prove of great value to our country and it is our country lieutenant we shall shape it to our ends not theirs i promise you that but if they do meddle sir then we hang them lee said satisfied at last the bodyguard raised his repeater in salute aint gonna be easy nate mollie bean said the closer the wedding day came the more nervous she got she stooped down tossed a pebble into stony creek well do fine caudell said stoutly watching the ripples spread your hair is growing out nice as you please pretty soon youll be able to pack away your wig and just say youve changed your style my hairs not what im fret tin about an you know it perfectly well aint gonna be easy livin in this town with some of the people knowin i used to be a whore i wish you wouldnt be so blunt caudell muttered how come dont you like bein reminded neither you know its not that he answered quickly theyd had this discussion before he continued once were married do you want to move back to rivington then god almighty no mollie threw up her hands a startled blue heron leaped into the air with a loud whuff whuff whuff of wings in rivington everybody knows i wasdoin what i was dointill first part o this year hereabouts its only some of the men who remember back to the warleastways i hope thats how it is nobodys ever given me a hard time about it caudell made a fist anyone who tried id give him this now you tell me straight out mollie have you ever had any trouble from the women in town any at all noo she said he judged she was telling the truth but didnt quite trust it as if to confirm that she went on sometimes though i just dont feel like i can look them fine ladies in the eye theyre no finer than you are he insisted and meant every word of it come to that do you want me to tell you which ones had great big babies six or seven months after they said their i dos i can name three or four right off the top of my head that won a giggle from her can you it dont surprise me there you see he said triumphantly aint gonna be easy she said again brief confidence deserting her he took a deep breath hows this then well stay here as long as everything is good as long as everybody treats us the way theyre supposed to the first time anybody doesnt well pack up whatever we happen to have and move someplace where nobodys ever heard of either one of us and well make ourselves a fresh start you dont want to do that nate mollie sounded worried hard pullin up stakes when youve been somewheres a long time an you like nashville you know you do i like you more he said and intended to add and i want you to be happy too before he had the chance mollie pulled his face down to hers and kissed him her eyes were shining as she said nobody never told me nothin like that before some of her fear seemed to leave her once more for she looked around and then waved and this time she surprised no birds its right pretty herethe willow there the jasmine just across the creek thatll be all full o sweet flowers tonightnate whatever is the matter nate nothing really i reckon but caudell still felt as though hed seen a ghost the sensation was almost as strong as when hed fired through the rivington man on the time machine platform after a moment to steady himself he explained i was fishing under that willow when poor josephineremember josephinestuck her head out through the jasmine piet hardie had the hounds out after her him mollies face changed her voice needed only the one word to turn flat and hard ive prayed more than once that he didnt get away when we took rivington it aint christian but i done it fraid ill never know though oh yes you will caudell told how hed huddled behind hardies body after henry pleasants touched off the mine outside rivington mollie clapped her hands together when he was done he got what was comin to him by god caudell felt as if he were a bold knight whod slain the rivington man in single combat not just stumbled upon almost stumbled over his corpse by the way mollie flushed and pressed herself against him she had something of that same feeling herself she looked up and down the creek her voice went low and throaty dont seem to be anybody around nate so there doesnt grinning he laid her down on the thick soft grass then quickly stooped beside her with practiced fingers he undid the buttons and eyelets that held her dress closed the process would have gone even faster than it did had he not paused every few seconds to kiss the flesh he exposed but soon she lay bare and he as well their sweatslick skins slid against each other oh mollie he said she did not answer not in words he got back into his clothes reluctantly no matter what a preacher might say early summer was easier to take without them he felt at peace with the whole world as he and mollie kept walking slowly along the creekbank but after a few paces she said reckon we can try what you said nate i hope it works i purely do but if it dont ill be glad for the chance to pull stakes and thats a fact all right he answered pleased and a trifle annoyed at the same time he might have wished her to stay happy and distracted rather longer before he could say anything later he thought that just as well the two of them rounded a bend in the creek on the far bank by a thicket of water oaks a grayhaired black man sat fishing he waved with his left hand called how do marse nate miss mollie hello israel nate looked over his shoulder no the negro couldnt have seen him and mollie cavorting in the grass relieved he turned back catching anything got me a couple catfish israel held them up stony creek was so narrow he hardly needed to raise his voice to talk across it hows it feel workin for the famous colonel pleasants mollie asked now the fightins done marse henry he took off the uniform fast as can be israel said the railroad he was workin for they send a man out to the farm the other day askin him to take back his old job at twice the money he say they make it back by usin his name an i expect he be right what did henry tell him caudell said bumping into a new set of mixed emotions he wanted his friend to do well but he didnt want him moving back down to wilmington as far as seeing him went that would be almost as bad as if he went home to pennsylvania israel answered he tol that man to git off his land and never come back that he had better things to do with his name than sell it to a railroad that hadnt wanted the man who was wearin it his very words marse nate i was there to hear em good caudell said mollie nodded so did israel just then the line the black man was holding gave a jerk he pulled in a fat little sunfish let it flop away its life on the bank nate added as long as thats settled i think ill call on henry some time in the next few days always glad to see you marse henry and me too israel said as he spoke he got another bite you come tomorrow maybe some of this nice fish be left i wouldnt mind if there was caudell said agreeably i wont be going up there just to eat it though i want to ask henry if hell be my best man taken by surprise mollie gasped and clung to him israel smiled across the creek at the two of them thats fine he said marse henry he always goin on about how happy you two be so i know he be happy to do that for you dont tell him ahead of time caudell warned i want to do it myself i won say a word israel promised miss mollie marse henry he go on too about how much your brother or cousini aint quite sure whichmelvin looks like you he be at your weddin idont think so mollie answered after a moments hesitation now that the fightings done i dont think well see melvin much around these parts travelin sort o man is he israel said some folks is like that too bad he wont be there to see you wed though well do fine without him mollie leaned against nate again they started walking along the creek once more israels farewell wave was interrupted by yet another catch caudell knew mild envy hed never pulled so many fish out of stony creek so fast mollie said something his mind on fish caudell missed it im sorry i said maybe itll work out all right after all you start talkin about get tin a best man and things like that it makes the wedding start to seem real it had better seem real he slipped his arm around her waist pulled her close kissed her israel was no doubt watching from the far bank caudell couldnt have cared less the upstanding wings of nates collar brushed against his beard and tickled he felt slightly strangled he wasnt used to the tightness of his cravat even without the black silk tie he suspected he would have had some trouble breathing few men go calm to their wedding the still sultry air inside the baptist church gave him an excuse for sweating as men will he tried to tell himself he was being foolishhed marched into battle with fewer palpitations than he had right now but the inside of his mouth stayed dry ben drake was well into the wedding service the preachers big voice boomed if there be any who know of any reason this marriage should not take place let him speak now or forever hold his peace caudell tensed preachers intoned those words at every wedding but heresome of the men listening here knew whoand whatmollie had been he didnt think anyone held that sort of grudge against him or her butthe prescribed pause passed no one spoke the service went on caudell eased a little much too quickly or so it seemed drake turned to him and said do you nathaniel take this woman mollie to be your lawful wedded wife to have and to hold to love and to cherish until death do you part i do caudell was used to outshouting a room full of school children now he wondered if even henry pleasants beside him resplendent in full colonels uniformconfederate though he had threatened to scandalize everyone by wearing bluecould hear pleasants beamedhe must have spoken out loud he tried on a smile it fit do you mollie take this man nathaniel to be your lawful wedded husband to have and to hold to love and to cherish and to obey until death do you part from behind her veil mollies words rang clear i do then under the laws of god and those of the sovereign state of north carolina i pronounce you man and wife ben drake smiled kiss your bride nate awkwardly caudell moved aside the filmy veil the kiss was decorously chaste in the third row of pews barbara bissett started to sob his landlady cried at any excuse or none this time she was not alone by the time nate and mollie walked up the aisle to the church door half the women whod watched the ceremony were dabbing at their eyes caudell wondered why they did that weddings were supposed to be happy times but the little lace handkerchiefs always came out he and mollie stood in the doorway while their friends filed past as far as he could remember hed never shaken so many mens hands hugged so many women in so short a time a beautiful wedding just beautiful barbara bissett said squeezing him against her ample bosom then she started crying again dempsey eure came up his wife lucy beside him he slapped caudells back planted a loud smack of a kiss on moilies cheek now all you two have to do is wait till the sun goes down he said adding mischievously fool thing to do too if you ask me gettin married near the longest dayand the shortest nightof the year the men who heard him guffawed the women tittered and pretended they had no idea what he was talking about mollie said youre terrible dempsey oh im not quite as bad as all that he answered grinning just for a moment some of nates joy leaked away dempsey had shared a winter cabin with him during the war hed also gone over to mollies cabin then a few times or more than a few was he reminding her of it now she might have had a point when she said this wouldnt be easy but there by dempsey stood lucy eure blonde and slim and pretty in a birdlike way she had one hand on the top of their sons head a sleeping baby filled her other arm by the proud way dempsey smiled at them he was happy enough right where he was caudell decided he worried too much if he read things into every chance remark he and mollie would have trouble raeford liles said all them letters you got from this lady here nate and all them times you told me you werent sweethearts i reckoned the two of you would join up sooner or later he cackled you were right sure enough caudell admitted determined now not to be teased he put an arm around mollie im glad you were two big elms shaded the street in front of the church the guests stood in small groups there dont anybody leave quite yet henry pleasants said loudly you may just possibly have noticed some trestle tables there hattie who cooks for me and my farmhands has set up a little spread for you all you still talk like a yankee henry caudell said youre supposed to say that as one word they werent goin away anyhow mollie put in seems more like they was tryin to keep from chargin them tables hattie will hold them at bay pleasants said sure enough the big black woman lashed out with a serving spoon at a man who got too close to a platter of roasted chicken he hastily drew back hattie used the spoon to beckon to caudell and mollie de new husband and wife dey eats first she proclaimed as if daring someone to argue with her nobody did caudell hurried over grabbed a plate and fork and foraged among chicken and ham and turkey corn bread and sweet potato biscuits and beans cooked with salt pork carolina fruitcake peanut brittle and peaches candied in honey also looked tempting but the plate had only so much room another trip he told himself attacking the ham his eyebrows leaped up as he tried to figure out what all hattie had done with it he tasted brown sugar mustard and cloves molasses honey and something that had him puzzled until he finally identified it as the liquor from brandied crabapples he was sure there were more flavors than he was noticing too he took another bite and another pretty soon the ham was gone but some of the mystery remained here you go henry pleasants pressed a glass of whiskey into his hand thank you henry caudell paused then repeated himself in a different tone of voice thank you henryfor everything me whats there to thank me for pleasants waved the idea away hadnt been for you idve just gone back to the life i went into the army to escape i dreaded having to do that when the war was over and thanks to you i had no need he would have said morehed had a glass of whiskey or two himself while caudell was eatingbut wren tisdale came over to him and asked how much do you want for that nigger wench pleasants ill give you top dollar by godthe business her cooking will bring into the liberty bell ought to make her worth my while pretty quick shes not for sale sir pleasants said she will you hire her out to me then how much would you want for two weeks of her time out of the month if youd let me finish id have told you shes not for sale because shes free pleasants said if you want her to cook at the liberty bell youll have to worry about making it worth her while the saloonkeepers pinched sallow features darkened with anger i aint no yankeei dont hold with free niggers he stalked off thats peculiar caudell said watching him go hatties cooking isnt going to change just because shes free true enough but if he took her on as a free woman hed have to treat her that way pleasants lowered his voice a lot of you southerners have trouble with that caudell pointed to the three stars on the collar of his friends gray jacket youre a southerner yourself now henry like it or not even if you cant say yall and come to that the blacks in the usa arent having an easy time of it either if you can believe the papers thats so pleasants sighed if lees bill ever gets out of the senate it will put this country on the right track at any rate i cant see why theyre taking so long over it caudell answered even bedford forrest said he wouldnt have voted for himself if hed known the truth about the rivington men after politicians listen to their own speeches for a while they start forgetting what they know if you ask me pleasants tapped nates glass with a forefinger can i fill you up again caudell pointed to a punch bowl why dont you get me some syllabub instead it should go nicely with the fruitcake and sure enough the sweetened mixture of madeira sherry lemon juice and cream all spicy with mace and cinnamon perfectly complemented the candied orange peel cherries raisins figs and pecans in the cake when he was through at last caudell said you can just roll me back home henry im too full to walk or for anything else pleasants asked with a proper best mans leer caudell glanced over at mollie her smile brought one to his own lips you neednt worry about that he said firmly when the trestle tables were as bare of food as if an invading army had swept over them and shadows lengthened toward evening raeford liles drove the newlyweds to the widow bissetts in his buggy everyone pelted them with rice as they climbed up onto the seat you have some in your beard mollie said i dont care caudell answered but he brushed at himself anyhow half a dozen grains cascaded down onto the front of his jacket the buggy started to roll more rice flew the house was quiet and empty when liles pulled up in front of it all the bissetts were going out to sleep at payton bissetts farm to give caudell and mollie one private night reining in the storekeeper said you got to pay me my fare now before caudell had a chance to get angry he explained im going to kiss the bride he leaned over and pecked mollies cheek caudell slid down from the buggy held out his arms to help mollie like i told you back at the church mr liles im glad you were right and i was wrong heh heh the storekeepers grin showed his few remaining teeth reckon i dont need to wish you a good evenin now do i he flicked the reins clucked to his horse the buggy turned in the middle of the street headed back toward liless rooms over the general store why dont you come with me mrs caudell nate said he hadnt called her that before her eyes slowly widened thats sure enough who i am now aint it she said perhaps half to herself mr caudell itd be purely a pleasure they walked to the doorway arm in arm he carried her over the threshold twice at the front door and again at the doorway to his upstairs room the second time he didnt put her down right away but walked over to the bed and gently laid her upon it then he went back and closed the door behind them as he began to untie his cravat he said one day before long well have to find another place to live this room isnt going to be big enough for the both of us she was sitting up reaching around to the back of her neck to undo the fastenings of her wedding gown she interrupted herself to nod then she smiled that glowing smile of hers reckon youre right nate but its big enough for tonight dont you think he hurried to her im sure of it he had no idea whether they would live happily ever after hed start worrying about that tomorrow tonight he did not care robert e lee angrily jerked his head to one side as if he were snapping at his own ear twentyfour men he growled twentyfour men holding our countrys future in their pocketand they will not let it out our senate like that of the united states upon which it was modeled is leisurely in debate charles marshall said leisurely lee rolled his eyes up toward the ceiling of his office and toward the heavens that ceiling hid mr marshall i have been raised from childhood with the firm conviction that the republican form of government is the finest ever devised but the dilatory tactics i have seen in connection with this bill tempt me to doubt my faith therein had the army of northern virginia campaigned in the manner in which the senate debates aks would not have sufficed to gain our independence had the army of northern virginia campaigned in the manner in which the senate debates it would have been mcclellans army of the potomac instead marshall said caught by surprise lee let out a short bark of laughter i will not say you are wrong sir but that is no way for a proper armyor a proper governmentto conduct its business the vote must surely come in the next few days mr president marshall said must it so people have been claiming for weeks now yet still the debate goes on and on and on lees open hand came down with a thump on a pile of the days richmond newspapers and still thisthis twaddle continues to be printed charles marshall raised a sympathetic eyebrow it is pretty dreadful isnt it dreadful i wish i were a fine profane swearer like general forrest so i might more appropriately express my feelings lee whacked the pile of papers again every sort of argument the south had devised over the years to justify slavery was coming out anew in the course of the senate debateand in the newspapers arguments taken from the politics of aristotle lay cheek by jowl with those borrowed from the book of genesis and its condemnation of the children of ham tucked in alongside both were modern allegedly scientific claims that aligned blacks with the great apes and purported to prove them inferior to whites in the papers the counterarguments adduced by supporters of lees legislation seemed feeble by comparison those senators had to be circumspect to keep from sounding like homegrown abolition fanatics much of their public argument was based on the evidence of the past few years evidence that showed the negro in a light different from that in which he had been viewed before could helpless sambo they said have made first a soldier and then a rebel so dangerous that de facto emancipation already existed over broad areas of the confederacy the answer they maintained was obviously no but their foes turned that answer against them if the negro could make a soldier and a dangerous rebel why then all the better reason to grant him no concessions indeed to tighten control on him harder than ever the real trouble was half the arguments in favor of lees bill could not be stated publicly its backers could rail at the rivington men could point out how they had murdered to try to force the southern government away from any step toward emancipation and had revolted when the murders failed to achieve their purpose that was fine as far as it went it did not go far enough though lee did not want the lesson of future history paraded through the newspapers for northerners and englishmen to read those secrets were an ace in the hole against the ambitions of nations larger and more powerful than the confederate states if they did not stay secretlate reports from the war in the canadas said that some us forces were beginning to carry repeating rifles patterned after the ak that worried lee one day before too long the united states might try a war of revenge against the confederacy if they did he wanted things like buried torpedoes and endless repeaters to stay dark and quiet the better to surprise the invaders trumpeting the knowledge from out of time would only make that harder in public then his supporters had to watch what they said he sighed when the second american revolution began our bold southern men said they could beat the north with one hand tied behind their backs we found out it was not so soon enough now i wonder if we can pass this bill while using only one hand he explained what he meant to charles marshall his aide thoughtfully pursed his lips if the only way to rally popular support for the legislation would be to allow everything to come out are you willing to do that now theres a pretty problem lee exclaimed i confess i had not thought of it in quite those terms which weighs for more a nations safety or justice for its inhabitants he considered the question for three or four minutes before continuing i believe sir the answer must be no once a secret is gone it is gone forever and cannot be restored but even if my bill fails of passage in this session of congress it may be introduced again in future sessions and one day will surely be approved how say you mr president your views generally strike me as sensible and this instance is no exception you remind me that you are fighting a war here not merely a single battle well put lee said when caught up in the excitement of a single battle it is important to bear in mind the campaign of which it forms a part true enough sir marshall said although i had not envisioned your presidential term as analogous to a military campaign he ventured a chuckle i suppose that if i spoke with jefferson davis he would say he had spent a good part of his time in office campaigning against our congress i do hope to avoid some of the difficulties he had he was and is a most able man but also one who sees disagreement as an affront if not a betrayal i do not think he himself would disagree with my assessment i still have hope at least that a more conciliatory approach will yield better results and if not marshall asked if not i shall bellow and froth at the reprobates until steam starts from my ears as if from a locomotive engines safety valve lee caught his aide staring i see you do not believe me too badif i cannot fool you how am i to deceive the congress still shaking his head charles marshall walked out of the office lee settled in to his daily paperwork he had never cared for it and the presidency brought far more of it his way than hed had to deal with even as general but regardless of whether he cared for it it was part of his duty and so he conscientiously undertook it a report from the virginia military institute caught his eye hendrik nieuwoudt one of the rivington men ordered there had been found hanged in his room apparently a suicide hed left a note on his bed i cant stand being watched anymore lees mouth tightened constant surveillance was the price those awb men who had been released paid and would continue to pay for being suffered to live that phrase with its biblical overtones echoed in his mind hed thought of the rivington men as captive genies before witches though made as good a description for them they had curious powers and they were dangerous benny lang and most of the others appeared to understand and accept that but nieuwoudt was the second of their number to kill himself lee had a horror of suicide to him it seemed the ultimate abandonment of responsibility yet the rivington men were already abandoned like no others in all the world cast adrift even from their proper time what had they to live for he wished he could make their lot easier but would not put his nation in hes way for their sake if that made him partly to blame for their deaths he would accept the burden an officer had to learn to do that else he would never be able to give an order that brought his men within range of the enemys shot and shell and now he was not merely general but commander in chief reminding himself of that brought his thoughts back to the senate how easy it would be if he could simply order the men of the upper house to approve his legislation but he could not the constitution did not permit it they would make up their own minds in their own good timeand quite probably drive him mad in the process commotion on the grounds of the presidential mansion lee looked up from a letter he was writing to the british minister running feet a sentrys cry of halt yall halt right now do you hear me after the richmond massacre sentries took their duties more seriously than they had in times past several voices shouted back at the sentry that garbled any single reply but one word was repeated often enough to come through clearly vote the vote lee jumped to his feet and hurried out the letter forgotten hed hoped the vote might finally come today but past delays had forced caution on him guards stood before the front steps with extended bayonets holding a squad of reporters out of the residence the reporters yells redoubled when lee appeared in the doorway fourteen to ten one of them bawled above the general din fourteen to ten president lee what do you have to say about that fourteen to ten which way mr helper lee asked doing his best to hold anxiety from his voice you must be aware your response to that question will have some small bearing on the comments i make the man from the richmond dispatch laughed which meant rex van lew of the examiner got to tell lee what he needed to know fourteen to tenor mr president lees breath whooshed out in one long happy sigh hed had remarks ready for this occasion and another set ready in case he lost but they all flew straight out of his head he spoke the first thought he had gentlemen we are on our way on our way where mr president asked virgil quincy of the whig that we shall all discover in due course lee answered but i am heartily glad we have begun the journey youve given up owning slaves yourself president lee quincy said how will the passage of this bill affect you personally aside from making me the most relieved man in richmond do you mean lee said which raised more laughter among the reporters through it he went on as you may know the constitution sets my salary at per annum i aim to contribute the tenth part of that sum each year into the emancipation fund this legislation establishes to show i favor it with more than words alone that quieted the reporters who bent over their pads to write down his reply after a moment edwin helper said how do you feel about the prospect of no more niggers being born into slavery after december the date i proposed originally to congress as the terminus ad quem was december lee said i accept with a certain amount of reluctance its decision to delay that day two years further but i am forced to concede that the additional period will let us prepare more adequately i am pleased that negroes will begin to be freeborn during my term in office and even more pleased that they shall begin to enjoy their full liberty before the commencement of the twentieth century rex van lew stiffened at that like a bird dog corning to point theres been a good deal of talk about the twentieth century all through the debate of this bill sir why worry so much about it nowwhy talk so much about it nowwhen its still more than thirty years away any conscientious legislator naturally has in mind the future of his country mr van lew and speaking of the twentieth century is a convenient way to indicate our course toward that future it was lee knew less than half an answer the twentieth centuryand the twentyfirstloomed large in the debate because senators and congressmen were actually able to judge their views not merely guess at them but that was a story which ought not to appear in the newspapers van lew both clever and persistent recognized that lee had been imperfectly frank he waved his hand again but lee pretended not to see him he pointed instead to virgil quincy who asked what will you do with masters who refuse to accept part payment so their slaves can start working to buy themselves free congress has passed this bill i will sign it and it shall be enforced lee said i might add that a majority of our citizens knowing my views on the matter chose to invest me with presidential authority i construe this to mean they will comply with the law dont you think they voted for you because of who you are rather than your views about slavery quincy asked who i am includes my views on slavery lee answered with that gentlemen i fear you will have to rest content he went back into the presidential mansion what about the constitution president lee someone shouted after him by then lee had already closed the door he could pretend not to hear the question and he did he felt brief shame at using a politicians trick but stifled it the plain truth was that his bill violated the spirit of the confederate constitution and very likely its letter as well opponents of the law had been sayingbellowingas much for months he did not care to admit publicly that they were right before he took office hed hoped to see congress get around to establishing a supreme court during his term now all at once he wondered if that was a good idea justices would probably overturn the law or important sections of it if it came before them for reviewand it would theyd have a harder time doing that if the legislation was well established and working smoothly before they ever got a chance to examine it another politicians trick he thought his mouth twisted in distaste but however much he hated the idea he was a politician now maneuvering against his foes in congress as he had against the union army deception and misdirection had served his strategy then no reason not to employ them now his servant julia came into the reception room a feather duster in her hand she must have heard the reporters when she saw lee she dropped him a curtsy as elegant as any hed ever received from a highborn white lady without a word she turned and began dusting the bricabrac on a table thus she did not see the deep bow lee gave in return most of the nearly four million blacks in the confederacy remained slaves that would be so for many years to come but lee tried to look into the misty future to see how his country would change as more and more negroes gained their freedom he was at bottom a deeply conservative man the principal reason hed supported the slow beginning of emancipation was in the hope that gradual change would lead to less longrange disruption than the periodic explosions of hatred that had to follow any effort to pretend the time from to had never happened he hoped that blacks once free would come to be and be recognized as good southerners like any other but just what even so simple a phrase as good southerners like any others meant would have to be redefined in the years ahead would free negroes be able to join the army how would that look black faces in confederate gray in it had been a counsel of desperation and averted by victory now it would have to be seriously considered would free blacks be able to testify against whites in court for that matter would they be able to gain the right to vote looking ahead he suspected those things unthinkable now might well come with the passage of time he wondered how many of the congressmen and senators who had voted with him believed they or their successors would ever have to worry about black voters few he was sure most thought they were giving the negro just a little freedom but there is no such thing as possessing just a little freedom lee mused once one enjoys any whatsoever he will seek it all you got that right marse robert julia said he started slightly he hadnt noticed he was speaking aloud he wondered how much change he would get to see himself when andries rhoodie asked if he wanted to learn on what day he would die hed answered no without thinking twice but the picture history of the civil war and other volumes from the awb hoard let him know he ought to have only a little more than two years left not even enough time to see the first black babies freeborn yet he still had hopes of proving the volumes from the future wrong the world to which they referred was no longer the one in which he lived here and now he had nitroglycerine pills to lend his heart strength his hand went to the jar in his waistcoat pocket that hadnt been so in the other world the vanished world the world where the confederacy went down to defeat watching his beloved south beaten had probably also helped break his heart in the more usual sense of the phrase he remembered that unbearably somber photograph of him in the picture history what point could his life have had lived out among the ruins of everything hed held dear even losing mary could not be a greater grief in truth though he had purpose as well as medication if he took care of himself why shouldnt he live longer than the vanquished lee of that vanished world if god was kind to him he might yet see negroes start growing up toward freedom might even see the end of his term in and if notnot it lay in gods hands not his own god would do as he willed and against gods judgments there was no appeal lee would go on doing his best for as many days as the lord chose to grant him a man could do no more when he was gone however far ahead that might be others would carry on after him he looked over his shoulder toward the doorway in which hed stood when the reporters brought word his bill had passed i shall have given those others a fair foundation upon which to build he said quietly then he started back to his office despite the happy nature of the interruption that letter to the british minister remained to be written acknowledgments the guns of the south would never have been written had judith tarr not complained in a letter to me that the cover art for an upcoming book of hers was as anachronistic as robert e lee holding an uzi that set me wondering how and why he might get his hands on such a weapon the guns of the south is the result thanks judy special thanks go to chris bunch formerly of the us special forces for advice on the care and feeding of the ak any inaccuracies that may have crept in are purely my own this would have been a different and i think a poorer book were it not for the exceedingly kind assistance of w t jordan of the north carolina department of archives and history responding to a letter from a writer of whom hed never heard mr jordan graciously sent me a photocopy of the rare longoutofprint regimental history of the th north carolina which was written by captain john thorp of company a with an additional sketch by lieutenant j rowan rogers of company i moreover mr jordan is the current editor of the series of volumes entitled north carolina troops a roster volume xi of which contains the detailed roster of the th north carolina the information contained therein has proved beyond price and given me a great many of my characters thanks to nashville town manager tony robertson for sending me a beautifully detailed map of nashville again i appreciate the kindness strangers so often show to writers two highly intelligent and wellinformed readers dan cragg and anne chapman carefully went over this manuscript after it was submitted it is considerably improved because of their thoughtful suggestions thanks also to mr cragg for the two minié balls from fairfax county virginia and finally thanks to my wife laura for her usual thoughtful first reading fortelling me where id gone wrong for suggesting ways to make things better for splendid help with the research and just for being who she is historical notes if my portrayal of robert e lee seems to bear only a small resemblance to the revisionist one offered by thomas connelly in the marble man it is not because i am ignorant of the latter but simply because in most instances i disagree with connellys interpretation lees own writings i think show clearly enough what sort of man he was the fragment of a letter which opens this book is from letter number in the collection the wartime papers of robert e lee edited by clifford downey and louis h manarin all persons stated to have served with the th north carolina in early actually did so at that time in the companies noted and with their proper ranks there are only two partial exceptions to this rule i do not know whether the slave george ballentine still remained with the regiment then and i do not know the actual company with which mollie bean served mollie bean did serve with the th north carolina she was the richmond whig of february tells us as cited in north carolina troops a roster picked up in uniform not far from richmond on the night of february and sent into the city for questioning at the provost marshals office she said she had been with the regiment for two years and had been wounded twice the whig story ends it will not we presume be pretended that she had served so long in the army without her sex being discovered but such cases the whig notwithstanding were far from unknown among both the gray and the blue i have taken a novelists liberty in imagining why she joined in the first place i have taken similar liberties in inventing occupations for a few minor characters from the th when those are not known but the jobs of most of those who served in that regiment along with their ages home counties and wounds suffered up to the time at which the guns of the south begins are authentic the character i have ascribed to each man is a product of those factors and of my imagination billie beddingfields nature is inferred from his habit of repeatedly gaining noncommissioned rank and then being demoted again the town of rivington north carolina is entirely fictitious as is everything connected with it including mollie beans residing there the men of the th north carolina could not actually have looked across washington to see the burning long bridge from the position in which i have them doing so geography occasionally has to bend just a little to serve the novelists needs the terms of peace between the united states and confederate states are based upon those set forth in a letter of february from confederate secretary of state r m t hunter to his european commissioners james mason and john slidell as modified by subsequent events both real and imaginary lees plans for measures limiting slavery are derived from brazilian constitutional proposals unfortunately not adopted of and from brazils freebirth law of i concede the anachronism brazils parliament finally adopted full emancipation in for those who are interested in such things i append detailed returns of the fictitious us presidential election of and confederate presidential election of the returns of the us election in particular seem to require some further explanation the twoparty system was not so well established in the s as now as witness the fourcornered electoral struggle of starting a new party and hoping for success was perfectly possible the republicans indeed had run their first national ticket as recently as in a country stunned by defeat as the us was here new movements would naturally arise i might also note that before i worked out the final tally i did not know myself who was going to win this election statebystate returns were determined as follows mcclellan the most conservative candidate was given a percentage equal to half the total bell and breckinridge received in each state in the real election of in states where they had not appeared on the ballot he was assigned a small arbitrary percentage the exception here is his home state of new jersey which seems reasonable as he carried it in the real election one of the two states kentucky being the other which he did carry and later served as its governor lincoln and fremont are considered to have split a vote percentage equal to the average of lincolns and actual percentages this method was designed to reduce the republican total from what it actually was in with the war almost won and in most states worked well in pennsylvania however where lincolns actual percentage increased from to i reduced the percentage to be divided between lincoln and fremont fremonts share of the total republican vote varies by how radical i judged the republicans of each state to be he scores better in kansas and new england than in the midwest horatio seymour got whatever percentage was left in each state the percentages for all candidates were turned into popular vote figures by using actual vote totals while the guns of the south is of course a work of fiction in every respect i think these imaginary returns do reflect the confused political situation that would surely have existed in a united states that lost the civil war maps
