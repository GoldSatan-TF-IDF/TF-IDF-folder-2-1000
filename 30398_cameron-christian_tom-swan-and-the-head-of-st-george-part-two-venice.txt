tom swan and the head of st george part two venice christian cameron foreword theres something very historical about writing an historical serial for epublication if its been done recently i havent heard about it and yet it has impeccable historical credentials before we had the epub we had the magazine and in that format dumas did it and conan doyle and a host of other authors with magnificent credentials harriet beecher stowe for example and charles dickens its a fine format instead of a single pulse of seven hundred manuscript pages the author can write in blocks with independent storylines that may still have an arc and a complex interweb of characters and motivations i was resistant but not for long so here is tom swan my first serial character tom is firmly based in history italy was full of itinerant englishmen especially soldiers throughout the period and so was greece i confess that the man who forms the basis for the character was not english but italian cyriac of ancona sometimes known as the grandfather of archaeology who roved the levant in search of antiquities and manuscripts that he could beg borrow or steal for the pope and other rich clients in their burning zeal to rediscover the ancient world ancient manuscripts were then and remain incredibly valuable recent rediscovery of a complete text of archimedes in a palimpsest shows that such manuscripts are still out there and give us an idea of the kind of treasures for which tom swan and cyriac of ancona searched if this serial has some success ill write more the format as i say is fun and allows me to explore some nooks and crannies of history and even some characters that id love to take to greater depth philokles in the tyrant series archilogos arimnestoss ionian adversary in the long war series geoffrey de charny in the late middle ages the list goes on and on and ill add pieces rapidly perhaps even one a month readers of my other books are aware that im a passionate reenactor and also a military veteran and that these experiences inform my writing those who are new to me deserve the following reassurance ive worn the clothes and armour and shot the bows and rowed and even ridden some of the horses in the process of working as an intelligence professional i met people who exercise real power every day and i got an idea of how they work and how history works but i dont do this in a vacuum and i receive an amazing level of support from friends fellow reenactors veterans academics crafts people and artists in those last categories id like to thank dario wielec who drew the illustrations he has a passion for historical detail that delights me every time i see his drawings from any period and you can see more of his stuff at httpdariocaballerosblogspotca finally the covers for the tom swan series are provided by albion swords who are to me the premier manufacturers of accurate replica swords in north america i use their products every day how many people can say that about swords chris cameron toronto june tom swan part two venice italy was a different world the air was different farms were different food was delicious women were beautiful they flirted harder and they hit harder when offended men were quick to make friends and quick to draw knives swan liked it they paused for a week in florence where bessarion had relatives swan was enough part of the cardinals household that he had come to understand that the cardinal had an extensive network of informants and special friends who provided him with the essential information that allowed him to remain important and powerful while impoverished florence was incredible swan went from one building to the next from one magnificent vista to the next from one tuscan vintage to the next one evening he threw his arms around giovanni accudi and demanded to be made an italian an italianate englishman is the devil come to earth cesare said and laughed two weeks later they were in rome bessarion had a place a magnificent set of apartments in an old palazzo the whole decorated in statues pulled from the forum with paintings from many of the artists swan had never seen so much wealth in his life hed been in the english palaces they had carvings old oak blue and gilt ceilings they were like merchants homes in cheapside compared to this every ceiling was painted with a scene the resurrection of christ the birth of venus the crucifixion the rending of adonis by artemiss hunting dogs swan walked from room to room his neck strained watching the scenes go by and bumping into furniture alessandro laughed at him so did the lawyers who home at last wanted to show off their adoptive city come out with us giovanni said meet the most beautiful women play cards with them cesare said bed them giovanni said if you can pay said cesare and he frowned do you have any silver swan made a face take me to a pawn shop he said and i might have a little silver most of the cardinals entourage had their own homes but the lawyers had rooms in the old palazzo and giannis the only one of the regular guards to be unmarried also lived in the villa cesare pounded on his door wear a clean doublet were going to visit aphrodite he called giannis opened the door he had plainly been asleep on the road the guards among whom he might have been numbered at least by a casual observer had been awake a great deal even in safe towns in northern italy in the palazzo they slept contrarily the lawyers whod scarcely ever been employed on the road were now expected to write all day cesare looked swan over in the courtyard of the palazzo you look like a very young assassin or perhaps a peasant in the borrowed clothes of a relative he said indeed swan hadnt bought a rag since paris and his one suit of doublet and hose had been slept in fought in and oft mended even clean the doublet was threadbare cesare by contrast looked like a different man instead of the long gown of his profession or the travelling gown hed worn on the road he had a short doublet and very very tight wool hose as he was a big man edging on to a life of having a roll of fat at his waist he shook his head id lend you clothes he said sadly but theres nothing about you thats the same size as me the same was true of accudi who stood over six feet tall in his stockings and was as thin as a spear im not sure i can be seen in public with him giovanni said when he came down his fine brocaded wool doublet contrasted perfectly with his hose and his matching shoes even his dagger belt matched and had gold fittings that looked to swan like real gold im not going to take him to donna lucrescias house well be mocked im more afraid well be killed cesare amended swan began to be annoyed go then he said ill stay home are you too poor to buy clothes cesare asked good clothes can be had cheaply if second hand a good cutter can resew them in an hour i wasnt born yesterday swan complained we have clothes in london too giannis came down in a pierced leather doublet and particoloured hose he looked at swan he cant go out dressed like that none of the girls will even look at him he looks like somebodys country cousin cesare guffawed and swan boiled over very funny you bastards giannis put a hand on the englishmans arm never ever say that in italian it is a mortal insult swords in the moonlight yes you understand he grinned fine lets go to a pawnbrokers ill get a little cash and then well get some clothes if you popinjays are then satisfied we can go to dinner he glared around at the two italians and the greek they all smiled tolerantly back so young cesare said and reached out to pinch his cheek swans hand whipped out and caught the brescians and so touchy the pawnbrokers was nothing like a similar booth in cheapside first the shop was in the front of a very old building of brick and stone near the ancient forum the street was broader than any street in london or paris the shop if it was a shop displayed few wares a painting some helmets of milanese make and a single beautiful golden rose swan looked hard at the rose is that a papal rose he asked giovannni barely gave it a glance yes no doubt frederico has a dozen of them as soon as men get them they pawn them swan shook his head shocked the highest award in christendom cesare laughed and pounded his fist on the counter house he called customers hush said giovanni theyll take us for peasants a middleaged man emerged from the back in the cap and gown of a rich merchant or a senior scholar or perhaps a priest ah messires a pleasure i hope that you gentlemen had a pleasant trip north pleasant cesare said frederico you know better than that the shopowner if he was such shrugged expressively i hear things the treaty died in a battle constantinople fell to the turks he shrugged again these are hard times how may i help you gentlemen my young friend has come into the possession of items cesare smiled to be honest i dont know what he has but i assured him that this house was the right house in which to sell them or leave them and borrow a little money you may tell your friend to step in then is he shy waiting in the street admiring antiquities in the forum the man in the cap walked out from behind his counter this young man right here giovanni said pointing graciously to swan with a sweep of his hand a servant my dear friends i do not lend money to servants the mans face closed are you making game of me swan wavered between anger and amusement but amusement won out he bowed deeply messire is mistaken if he thinks me a servant he said or perhaps not i am in fact a poorly dressed englishman i serve god and my own interest in that way im a servant frederico returned the bow he smiled ah your pardon messire a man can be judged only on clothes until he opens his mouth and sometimes after swan said my clothes are against me and it is to remedy this important shortcoming that i have come he smiled and coughed ahem just so frederico said might we do this in private swan said the other three smiled and withdrew to the front step swan opened his purse i have these he said withdrawing three ivory crucifixes each had the image of christ in carefully carved and dyed ivory on a cross of ivory about the size of a womans hand all three were set in silver the banker he was clearly no pawnbroker put spectacles on his nose and bent over the ivories not bad he said paris work may i ask how you came to own them swan set his mouth considered blank refusal and then smiled spoils of war he said ah said the banker the owner is dead swan was surprised by the direction of the conversation yes he lied ah the banker said good do you wish a loan or a sale how much are we talking swan asked i never bargain said the banker he shrugged i never intended to be in this business and i despise haggling swan tried not to smile in this case he had heard it all before twenty venetian ducats for the good one and ten each for the others the banker said as a loan you mean swan said no that was my final price said the banker swan pursed his lips you know my friends are in a hurry he said but i am not in quite such a hurry as that he picked them up and dropped them back in his wallet the banker plucked the spectacles off his nose what did you expect a hundred ducats more like four hundred swan said he shrugged good day youre mad said the banker you mistook me for a servant and then you mistook me for a mark swan smiled would you like to start again no said the banker now it was swans turn to shrug he walked out into the sunlight take me where the man behind the counter knows what things are worth he said loudly dont come into my shop again said the banker and the heavy door slammed shut hes the best dealer in rome cesare said swan shook his head ive seen better dealers in a london thieves market he said the third shop they visited was in the jewish ghetto you are too picky are you sure these things are worth anything giovanni asked but the jew was both friendlier and far more accommodating swan bowed deeply was polite and bargained only briefly the jew isaac counted two hundred and fifty venetian ducats into a bag when he was done swan leaned over the counter messire i should very much like to learn hebrew and arabic i wonder if you know someone who might teach me isaac called for kahve they were served the sweet stuff in tiny cups by a veiled woman and swan felt as if he was living in a fantasy poem after some sips isaac said you intend the priesthood swan shook his head no my friend i would like to travel and to read scripture isaac nodded i will consider he said i know a rabbi here who teaches foreigners i could perhaps teach you arabic if not i have a slave who might be of help i would esteem it a favour swan said he held out his hand isaac took his hand very few christians clasp hands with jews he said swan shrugged im told that jesuss mother mary was a jew he said he smiled to indicate that this wasnt meant as an insult isaac didnt smile but neither did he withdraw his hand very few men think as you do he said he walked out into the late afternoon sun to find three very disgruntled men waiting you had coffee with a jew giannis spat swan shrugged he found that in italy everyone shrugged as much as he did how much did you get cesare asked enough lets get some clothes swan said the clothing trade was one of the most prosperous and raucous in rome there was a market where very pretty girls screamed prices at the tops of their lungs to lure male customers into their booths it was early evening the coolest part of the day and the market was crowded most of the clients were religious priests and monks who desired to have a second or third set of clothes in which to as cesare muttered have adventures i dont see any womens clothes swan said cesare snorted women dont buy used clothes he said or dress up or pretend to be what they are not swan laughed do you know any women he asked as a young man he was immediately drawn to the darkhaired beauty in a gown recut to show her ankles and breasts it was dark blue velvet she smiled at him and he instantly wanted to buy from her giovanni all but boxed his ears follow me he said swan smiled at the girl but when she saw he was headed elsewhere her eyes moved right through him and she was busy smiling at a young french priest behind him he followed giovanni to a stall well up the middle street out of the market square there was a dark awning neatly folded shirts and braes and hose on a low cart in front and a massive jumble of coats jupons doublets and short cloaks littering six tables stretching away into ever darker interior regions foglio giovanni said waving an arm like a man welcoming a guest into his home all the best clothing at the most reasonable prices cesare rolled his eyes if an orsini dies his clothes will be here in three hours he said he stepped out into the street and looked up speaking of which it is past six what if i skip along and order dinner at angelas and well meet for mass then eat and get laid giovanni put a hand over his eyes really cesare to speak of eating and mass in the same breath giannis smiled you are all going to hell but you are poor heretics so you know no better anyway he nodded to cesare ill accompany you when the other two were gone giovanni turned what did you sell he asked an heirloom swan said an old man came out of the shop he bowed to giovanni and then turned to look at the englishman this i take it is the customer he said his tone was acerbic as if it was really too much bother for him to wait on anyone swan smiled as ingratiatingly as he could manage giovanni grinned he can pay he said ah said the old man he managed a smile i sell so much on credit last week a young man who had bought on credit was killed in a street fight giovanni said when they took his corpse to be anointed there was a man from messire siciliano here to take the clothes messer siciliano shrugged what can i do he said as if he were the oppressed party and you cannot tell me the young scapegrace needed the clothes the englishman bowed i would like a suit of clothes in fact i would like two or even three suits of clothes i would like them if this is possible in the florentine style i would also like that fine leather arming doublet with all the lacing points for armour florentine snorted giovanni dont be foolish this is roma we dont show our parts like florentines and we wear sober colours im sure you do swan said siciliano nodded he went through the shirts holding them up to his customer he was quick no no too much blackwork and the fabric is too light good for a sodomite not for you no ah look at this mice teeth on the cuffs superb work he tossed swan a linen shirt then he continued down the pile no no oh no too small made for a giant made for a humpback ah try this it took an hour and giovanni was a great help although it became increasingly clear that his tastes were very different from the englishmans besides the arming doublet which swan desired with all his soul he got two doublets of wool one scarlet one black he got two pairs of black hose that didnt fit very well and one pair of scarlet hose that fitted perfectly as if made for him he bought one pair of braes and two shirts youll want more linen giovanni said the englishman nodded and ill buy it new im not fussy but im tired of wearing other mens linens giovanni nodded i know a girl he said she sews neatly and shes fast you can take the scarlet siciliano said the black and the spares need a little tailoring i can have them for you tomorrow the day after for sure how much in florins tell me in ducats ah venetian in gold asked the tailor is there another kind swan muttered he knew this process too the shopkeeper was making time while calculating twenty ducats ricardo giovanni said for a friend siciliano pointed at the pile the arming doublet is worth half that by itself the scarlet stuff was ten ducats a yard new the doublet has one small hole and no stains and is if i may say so beautifully made and fits like a glove eighteen the arming doublet has a triangular hole under one arm where it failed its last wearer and a corresponding stain where his fluids rushed out swan pointed out the scarlet is excellent and im at least the third owner theres a long strain mark in the wool from the last owner and a fitting mark where it was recut from another garment he sniffed and it smells of spikenard he paused fifteen you bargain well for a foreigner said siciliano dont you need to be cutting throats or tupping sullied virgins isnt fleecing a poor shopowner beneath you seventeen swan met his eye and smiled no he said i love to haggle fifteen and a half fuck your mother you waste my time you are insulting my shop and i did extra work for you you sodomite give me back my clothes the roman reached out and tried to seize the bundle swan held it out of his line of motion you forgot to add sixteen and a half siciliano stopped slapped his thigh and laughed the laugh transformed his face suddenly he didnt look so old bah sixteen swan counted down the coins then stepped into the darkness behind the sixth table to change giovanni called its all clean he washes everything i do not siciliano shouted my wife does swan came out lacing his scarlet hose to his scarlet doublet the shirt felt wonderful clean braes felt like heaven theres a cloak that went with that suit siciliano said now it was swans turn to laugh of course there was i imagine it fits me as well as the rest with a flourish the roman tailor produced it he hung it on the englishmans shoulders swan looked down and saw that a whole corner was missing he looked at the owner who frowned yes he said it took some swordcuts in fact it had three long cuts carefully resewn with good scarlet thread but still in bright sunlight a little visible two ducats siciliano said swan rolled his eyes and handed over one more i knew you two would get along giovanni said as they walked on evening mass was a major production at any church in rome but giovanni led him to the former temple of jupiter optimus maximus where the dome rose away in a magnificent sweep that engaged the young englishman through the whole service in the portico they found cesare just bowing deeply to a beautiful woman in a crimson gown with two blond slaves carrying her train giovanni swept a bow and swan matched his bow cesare reached his whole hand into the holy water font by the centre door and then extended his hand dripping towards the woman who reached out and touched it with the slightest the very slightest of nods she crossed herself and swept by dropping a veil of bruges lace over her face you are a bold lecher giovanni hissed to his friend cesare laughed you only live the one time he said cardinal orsinis whore giovanni said over his shoulder giovanni had made a serious mistake he thought that the englishman was still at his left shoulder but swan had been separated in the push of the crowd as the woman passed them and his comment was delivered not to swan but to a liveried retainer a man in orsini livery the orsini mans fist lashed out and giovanni folded like a stool over the punch a great whoof coming out of him he fell and another man in the orsini red and yellow kicked him savagely there was a scream from a woman in the crowd and some excitement cesare caught a blow on his shoulder and slammed both fists together into one of giovannis assailants who went down as if hit with an axe swan saw the glint of a blade he wasnt wearing his sword few men did in rome at least before dark and never to mass but he had his knife the red and yellow livery was suddenly everywhere cesare caught one of them up and threw him bodily into two more the first tough who had hit giovanni had a dagger in his fist so did the man kicking him the first man saw swan put a hand on his dagger he changed direction came at the englishman and his left hand shot out and took swan by the throat swan wrapped the offending arm with his own and broke the mans arm in a lock the snap of the bone was audible across the church he twisted the broken arm and the man screamed swan let him go he drew his knife and the second man backed away from giovanni they eyed each other for a long heartbeat and then the orsini man put his dagger away and bent to pick up the man with the broken arm i am adolfo he said you will be hearing from us you work for that schismatic greek yes swan smiled you serve that whore orsini yes adolfo stiffened best run away swan said he was enjoying this cesare caught his arm leave it alone this is all a misunderstanding he turned to adolfo hes a foreigner adolfos eyes sparkled he had his dagger out again and the church was empty even the priests and acolytes were gone even if he kissed my feet i would not forgive him perhaps it was the scarlet clothes its true i misunderstood swan said my italian is not so good i did not mean that cardinal orsini was a whore i mean you are a whore you catamite bastard the roman leaped swan didnt move his arm shot out and there followed a series of blows so fast that the bystanders couldnt follow them swan took a blow in the gut that wrenched him back against the temple wall but the wall at his back steadied him and he got a knee up in time to stop the blow to his groin then he and the orsini thug had each other by the dagger wrists the roman was smaller than swan and swan tried twice to headbutt the manboth blows were partly avoided but the second gave him a fleeting advantage in balance he threw his adversary over his extended hipbut the other man held onto his shoulders like a leech and down they both went onto the hard marble floor swan lost track of the orsinis knife hand and flinched just as the mans fist crashed into his temple they rolled apartthe roman had lost his knife and swan stunned got to one knee the roman went for his knife swan hooked his leg he traded balance for aggressiondesperateand fell heavily atop the man the orsini wasnt moving there was blood running out of his mouth swan looked at his dagger sticking out of the dying mans guts giannis had his knife out are you insane he asked in a conversational tone he attacked giovanni swan answered he wiped his mouth he couldnt breathe in truth he wasnt sure what had made him so high handed he drew first cesare said the orsini retainers were gathering cesare got an arm under giovannis arm can you move fast he asked swan by st george swan answered he spat some blood and the four of them ran giovanni was in bad shape and by the time they reached the palazzo he was slumped between swan and cesare he stopped in the courtyard to go to the jakes and scared himself by pissing blood that bastard kicked him in the back over and over swan said he was bouncing with the spirit of the combat giovanni said something very stupid cesare said wearily giannis shrugged does this mean no dinner the orsinis will be out in every street cesare said giannis smiled and held his hands wide ill wear a sword then he said he turned to swan are you insane he clapped the younger man on the back it was beautiful he never expected it hah i mean you are a whore you catamite bastard he laughed a long loud laugh let me buy you dinner you wont live long but youll be famous dinner was uneventful and delicious after dinner they walked to a certain house in the very richest portion of town groups of young men with torches went by laughing and singing and once they were crowded off the street by a big group but none of the torches or the fops or the roving swordsmen were orsinis the sun had set and the night was dark madonna lucrescias house was an old palazzo very much in the gothic style of two hundred years before but inside it was a perfumed garden the walls were decorated in paintings on stucco the subjects were amorous and very very straightforward cesare smiled ive heard she allows the better artists a straightforward trade he said giannis grinned if only i had such a talent the women who adorned the rooms appeared perfectly modest if perhaps a little open there was dancing and men played at cards while women watched a woman worked a loom in one room in another two women played the lute while a third danced and a crowd of men watched an african appeared at swans elbow with a tray on the tray were three glasses fine venetian glass what does this cost swan asked no one knows no one knows from whence madonna gets her fortune cesare shrugged nothing in rome is as it seems my young friend this woman like our master deals first and foremost in information if the orsini are so dangerous swan said he paused why the gallantry with the mistress cesare smiled because i am a large man nearly twice your age you imagine i cannot be in love or be gallant he said swan had never imagined the italian as a lover or as a man of daring he bowed i will endeavour to think differently of you my friend you are such a serious child cesare said in my youth i was a poet and i was going to be a second dante in middle age im a notary for an outoffavour cardinal in the curia in rome the lawyer took a long drink of wine let me tell you something about age my young friend when you are thirtyfive you still have the eighteenyearold inside you you are the same man you just weigh more he laughed but since donna esperanza is not immediately available to me i will go and light my candle with one of these delicious young things you know what we call this house swan smiled no he said a stunning redhead was looking at him from under her lashes his head knew her interest to be simulated but his body reacted instantly to her lowered gaze we call it the well of sanctity the brescian said because the whole curia and every priest in rome drinks here some call them the papal bankers giannis said because the curia come here to make their deposits cesare laughed so hard he snorted wine i can remember when you could scarcely speak italian you rogue giannis smiled modestly a tall woman older than the girls dancing but with the figure of a classical beauty wearing a dark red gown of venetian velvet and a fortune in pearls paused by them she didnt bend over their table but she performed what might have been called a courtesy swan rose from his seat and bowed low giannis stood like a ramrod with his flat cap in both hands cesare didnt get up but he reached for her hand and caught it and didnt so much kiss it as breathe lightly on it donna you honour us too much he said so much that you cant get your arse off your chair you fat peasant the woman said her accent was charming the educated tuscan italian that swan was already learning was the sign of breeding but her words were foul cesare grinned not so fat as it could cover yours donna she threw back her head and laughed and her laugh was as beautiful as her body just for a moment she reminded swan of tilda they were of an age thirtyfive he guessed quite ancient and yet both of them laughed loud in a way that young women seemed scared to do she turned to giannis can you even afford to drink my wine heretic giannis nodded clearly nervous was your mother a tyrant you poor man she said running a finger under his chin do women terrify you she laughed come i have a new german girl from the other side of the alps the two of you can be scared together come she turned to cesare hes a hardened killer is he not cesare nodded obviously filling his eyes with her yes donna a hard man a soldier and yet his hand is trembling even now she turned her brilliant gaze and her perfect teeth on the greek she had his hand held high as if they were dancers in a pavane when she had led him away swan was a trifle disappointed shed looked at him a dozen times assessed him from the shoes on his feet to the hair curling atop his head but not a word cesare read his mind not for you young man shed eat you and take all your money he laughed who for then rumour is shes the darling of one of the spanish cardinals and that hes very jealous cesare shook his head trust a spaniard to love a whore and be jealous a nation no a race looking for a fight swan watched her walk back towards them she favoured him with a brilliant smile he rose again from his seat feeling very young cesare caught one of her hands i have something for you he said who is this boy surely hes not old enough to have hair on his parts she leaned so close to swan he thought she was going to kiss him then she moved away smoothly and laughed she looked at cesare who handed her a scroll she blushed for me she asked oh my heart someone give me a knife the redhead reached up showing a wonderful length of leg and drew a tiny knife from under her kirtle she handed it to donna with a bow and donna used it to open the seal on the parchment she read her colour high her chin rose a hand twitched cesare she said she snapped her fingers come i have something i need to show you cesare bowed over her hand always at your service he said and followed her swan watched him go trying to be amused at her contempt for him deeply resentful really im called maria said the redhead she made a nice courtesy she raised an eyebrow he wont be back swan felt like the boy hed just been called he i she he shrugged do you know any dances she asked i love to dance he shook his head i dont really know a great many dances he said and then after a pause he settled on complete honesty i know the may dance as we dance it in london thats all in london while girls dance men learn to fight she smiled would you like to learn he rose to his feet i would like it above all things he said she smiled your italian is very good for a barbarian later after they had made love he rolled over to her i have never done that in a bed he said its so comfortable she laughed and hit him with a pillow he tried to fight her off and found her astonishingly strong and fast and agile when he finally pinned her arms after some tickling he leaned over her you would make a superb swordsman woman he kissed her she used the kiss to get a hand free and thrust a knee between his legs and rolled them both over teach me she breathed at him her hair was all around him and her breasts trailed across the top of his chest now he asked mockingly and she giggled there was a knock at the door she bounced off the bed are you married she asked he reached for the knife in his clothes no he said yes he asked open the door messire we need to have a chat said a voice violetta said the young woman you said maria swan said she shrugged were all maria to new customers she admitted i was busy dancing he said im thomas the man at the door is my capitano just so long as he isnt your lover she grinned i mean it about the sword i would love to learn she wriggled into her shift and opened a closet door do i he was trying to get his shirt on pay you she laughed silly boy the bed costs fifty ducats my kisses are free she gave him one and vanished into the cupboard alessandro opened the door swan had his braes on and was trying to get his hose over them the italian laughed listen you are in a bordello no one expects you to be dressed but the capitano was fully dressed and had his sword on his belt and another in his hand scabbarded he tossed it on the bed you left this at the palazzo thanks for bringing it swan said i didnt need it you may yet make an italian alessandro said but there are twenty men in orsini colours in the street they mean to kill you and cesare and giannis he shrugged the cardinal sent me to see to it you came home without a fight he looked around the room can you pay for this thomas nodded sold the ivories the capitano said thomas nodded and then caught himself i knew you had them listen boy you killed a man today a bad man i have no doubt but the way i hear it all you had to do was walk away and instead you called him out and killed him swan was prepared to bridle but he admired alessandro and something in the mans tone held not so much censure as weariness so thats the wrong path alessandro said i know this eh you kill a man and it hurts yes kill another its not so bad kill a third and you think hey im invincible and i can do this for ever ill be glorious rich and famous alessandro met his eye eh he was mocking us was he and did it hurt you alessandro shook his head if you do this the next man or the next will kill you he shook his head i will endeavour to teach you the rudiments of defence you are fast ive seen you and you know a little swan drew himself up it is hard to be proud and haughty without clothes but he tried im the best blade in london he said he felt like a fool as soon as he said the words which werent true anyway im not the best blade in rome alessandro said and suddenly his sword was in his hand pointed at swans throat its behind you on the bed think you can get to it and draw it before i run you through swan was frozen no he said im not the best blade in rome and i can run you through on every pass even if you could draw your sword you stamp your foot whenever you attack you hold up your left hand as if you have a buckler in it you dont know how to roll your wrist with an opponents cut you are good enough to bully peasants but not good enough to fight a trained man do you believe me swan hung his head yes excellent then you will dress and follow me well fetch our friends and leave through the cellars be sure and pay your bills the ladies here know everyone do not i pray you offend them the exit through the cellars was not as dramatic as swan had expected and in an hour they were at home in the palazzo the cardinal will see you in the morning alessandro said expect to be leaving peter woke him with a cup of beer and a piece of dry bread you sold the ivories said the fleming swan shook his head why does everyone know what i do he asked you are young we find you interesting peter shrugged id like to be paid i would like new clothes and a nice ride on a young filly eh swan went to his purse opened it and counted out fifty ducats peter grinned theres a days pay swan shook his head a years pay peter nodded a year for an archer one night for a girl at madonna lucrescias i doubt the girl sees much of it swan said peter pocketed the money ill consider this a payment against my wages swan drank off his small beer id like to be paid he said peter nodded you should kill more people then i hear you put a knife in someones hired bravo yesterday did you get his purse no swan said sullenly really master if you are going to kill people kindly take their money the cardinal was waiting in his library the cardinals library was the largest single room in the palazzo it was at the front of the house and was decorated and arranged like an ancient greek andron with couches side tables and a wall of holes for scrolls there were more scrolls on the massive tables that filled the ends of the room and one end had shelves for the newerstyle folio books two tall windows illuminated every corner of the room with mediterranean sun cardinal bessarion looked up from a scroll you look prosperous he said swan bowed can you buy a horse the cardinal asked in greek yes or rent one swan answered in the same language the cardinal sat back and made a steeple of his fingers you have a problem and i have a problem he said i know you are brave and i know you are ferociously intelligent but are you loyal and can i trust you at all he waved to a chair a new copy of an ancient greek chair sit yes you can trust me eminence really even though you lied to me about your birth your value as a prisoner your status and then stole from an abbey and stole from our companions on the road even though you come to me still smelling faintly of sin where may i add alessandro found you but did not breathe a word i have other sources swan took a breath started to gather a hot reply in his mouth and then overcame it he hung his head you can trust me eminence yesterday you killed a man tell me why the cardinal sat back hands together like one of the examiners at the grammar school where a young thomas swan had endured many horrid hours he took another breath and released it he hurt giovanni he might have hurt him worse he was contemptuous of us he needed a lesson you sound shockingly like an italian young man listen the orsini have been roman senators since well since rome had an army and a senate and no pope they have the sort of wealth and power that other men dont even dream exists if bartolomeo the old man orders you killed he can hire a man to do it who will kill you here in my house or out on the street or in the lovely violettas bed i can buy peace but it will be expensive he leaned forward you must pick your fights swan who had never been very good at picking his fights sat with his eyes down the cardinal nodded i need money he said suddenly i imagine you would not be averse to some this abrupt change of direction left swan feeling naked yes no he looked around what the cardinal laughed and rang a bell alessandro came in with giannis i would like to send the three of you to greece to constantinople to be precise i would like you to go to my former house and retrieve things i wont endanger you more than this go to my house and retrieve what you find there and get the hmm objects on a ship and bring them here giannis pursed his lips the holy city has fallen my prince alessandro sucked a tooth and winced ottoman constantinople he looked at the cardinal not easy bessarion nodded slowly theres a letter from the pope to the sultan an official letter one of the bishops will carry it he shrugged i refused the duty but i offered to provide the escort how soon swan asked a week at least perhaps more he looked at alessandro the italian shook his head messire swan should leave rome will we go by ship of course from ancona or genoa the cardinal fidgeted with his cross not venice possibly venice why do you ask the cardinal looked at him we could send them ahead to arrange lodgings and so on our business for you is secret yes alessandro leaned forward yes i see bessarion leaned back venice alessandro nodded i will miss you eminence but the orsini will not look for this young fool in venice and i will enjoy seeing my family he grinned even if they may not enjoy seeing me the cardinal reached into his table drawer and pulled out a box i have heard that it takes money to make money he said i have a hundred ducats for each of you and alessandro will have another three hundred on account any bank will make it good he looked at swan the very best thing to bring out of greece right now is books swan nodded his heart was afire with the excitement of the trip the adventure books he said books said cardinal bessarion ancient greek books he smiled if you cant find books find relics preferably famous ones and preferably real ones he looked at alessandro there is a rumour that the head of saint george is no longer in hagia sophia he said giannis crossed himself someone saved it someone stole it bessarion said see if you can recover it alessandro fingered his beard the head of saint george he whispered he sounded awestruck venice was perhaps the most wonderful place that thomas swan had ever been even more wonderful then rome first it was like a floating city men said venice was wedded to the sea those men werent englishmen because they said it with disdain or wonder swan had grown up with the sea in the form of the thames at his bedside and his front door and something about venice made him feel very comfortable and then there were the ships a young thomas swan had leaned in the doorway of the swan inn and watched the ships sail by row by be towed by hed waved at sailors and dreamed of adventure hed served sailors in his mothers inn every street in venice had ships at the end of it the great thoroughfares ran to wharves and warehouses and the smaller streets were canals the very smallest alleys were paved there were bridges and you had to take a boat to get anywhere just like london like london but richer the great of venice were rich to a degree that made london look a little tawdry but other elements were similar alessandros family the bembii were ancient aristocrats and merchants with relatives who ranged from members of the inner council to penniless scavengers in the streets they sent their sons to sea to serve in the navy or to learn the ropes on a merchantman and the great round ships filled the harbours and every wharf and strand and down towards the arsenal there were galleys and professional rowers rough lowerclass men who didnt get out of the street for any man and wore swords like nobles and were sometimes the police and sometimes the rioters and there were the arsenali the men who worked in the great military buildings again often foreigners or new citizens but afraid of no one wearing swords in public they were like englishmen and swan felt at home he prowled the city alone or with either cesare or giannis or alessandro or all three from st marks to the arsenal he learned the way to the jewish ghetto and made friends there his last day in rome against the cardinals express instructions hed crept out of the palazzo and visited isaac hed deposited his new hundred ducats and left isaacs house with a letter to a jew of venice with an enclosed letter of credit and a short missive in hebrew so early in his visit to venice he left cesare and giannis drinking in a foreigners tavern and caught a boat across the lagoon to the iudica as the locals called it it had its own gate and a watch the young man at the gate didnt look like a jew he didnt have a beard and he didnt have a cap and he wasnt wearing a long gown he leaned against the gate with the negligent hostility of any young man and he wore a sword which swan knew was against the law stop he said when swan approached the gate state your business swan bowed i have a letter for aaron benomye from isaac gold of rome the young man brightened really he asked may i see he was considerably more polite swan warmed to him here he said the young man glanced at the cover and tapped the envelope of parchment against his thumb the rabbi may still be with his family he said he rang a small iron bell and another surly young man appeared im going to take this foreigner to rabbi aaron he said and off they went through a jumble of alleys dry alleys the jews didnt have to use boats to get around they went past a synagogue and up a set of steps to a private house that didnt seem to be on any street it was between one and another this too was like london the young man knocked and the door opened a crack he spoke in low tones and handed in the letter he lounged against the building another young man passed and they engaged in a display of male bravado that would not have been out of place among the toughs of rome in his newfound maturity swan smiled the door opened a narrowfaced man in a long beard and a long gown was standing in the entrance swan bowed this is rabbi aaron said the young man he made a sign with his hands and bowed and walked away please be welcome in my house rabbi aaron said i do not lend money he added somewhat severely swan was startled of course not he said rabbi aaron smiled thinly i feel i must say it why do you want to learn hebrew and arabic i wish to travel to the east swan said as for hebrew it is the language of scripture hmm said the rabbi yes and no greek is the language of much of your scripture hebrew hmm but yes it is a useful language for a theologian no one speaks it in jerusalem for example i memorised the alphabet on the road swan said rabbi aaron heard him out and nodded very well you are serious i will be pleased to have you as a student how often every day swan suggested the rabbi smiled so young twenty ducats a month swan bowed and paid in advance time in venice flew by swan went to the jewish ghetto every day after a week the gatekeepers let him pass without comment after two weeks old women began to nod to him as he passed hebrew kept him busy inside his head and arabic threw him he spent long hours lying on his narrow bed in his inn staring at the crazed cracks in the plaster of the ceiling and chanting verb endings to himself every evening he would meet alessandro and sometimes the other men in his taverns main room alessandro was increasingly restless at the delay early in the third week alessandro appeared at swans door in the early afternoon swan was fully dressed sitting at a table a very small table writing by the light of an open window alessandro leaned over him and watched his pen move arabic he said swan nodded you make a face like a fish when you concentrate alessandro said uh swan said i need you for a duel alessandro said a duel swan asked one of my idiot cousins made a stupid remark in public and now i have to fight said the venetian swan shrugged do i have to fight possibly alessandro shrugged im sorry and i meant to give you lessons but my time is not my own when swan asked reviewing his list of nouns now alessandro said the man was so seldom at a loss that swan took a moment to recognise what was happening are you in trouble my friend alessandro blushed yes but think nothing of it swan had been working in his secondbest shirt he wiped his fingers idly on it and made a face when he saw how much ink hed smeared he found the inns towel and wiped his hands on that instead but the damage was done he pulled on his dull black doublet and laced it the black doublet and hose were worn by virtually every young man in venice regardless of class the slightly fashionable florentine cut of swans actually added to his anonymity dont wear your sword alessandro said you arent a citizen he held his hands wide carry it with the belt wrapped around it do i get a buckler swan asked of course alessandro said swan perched a small hat with an enormous ostrich plume and a small jewel on his head foreigners were not allowed to wear jewels on clothes but hats werent included in the sumptuary law the jewel was glass peter was sitting in the kitchen drinking wine and helping prepare food he was very popular in the inn im going to fight a duel swan called peter waved if you kill the fellow take his money do you need me he asked swan looked at alessandro who gave a minute shake of his head three in a boat he said with a shrug they walked down to the grand canal caught a boat on the steps by st marks and were rowed across the lagoon past murano to a small island with a monastery as they approached alessandro began to fidget care to tell me what happened swan asked alessandro shook his head a matter of honour but i fear my enemy has brought too many men and intends a murder as the boat edged up on the island swan could see six men standing by the monastery wall swan felt his pulse increase three each he said alessandro looked at him you cannot kill any of these men he said you would be imprisoned or killed their fathers are very important men so is your father swan said my father is going to disown me alessandro said and the keel of the boat touched the muddy shore he jumped ashore and looked back perhaps you should go back to your inn he said and pushed the boat off the strand the six men were coming im sorry thomas i didnt think it would be this bad swan ran down the gunwale as hed learned to do on london wherries and leapt ashore he grinned what did you do he asked alessandro shook his head it is difficult to explain it is an old matter the six men were approaching let me get this right they outnumber us three to one but im not to kill any of them yes do not draw your sword they must make the first move alessandro was calmer now we wouldnt want to have any advantages would we swan said he unrolled his sword belt and buckled his sword on he swung his hips to make sure of the hang of the scabbard when the six men were ten yards away they stopped is this your buttboy shouted one all of them were younger than alessandro they were eighteen or nineteen they were well dressed in loud colours and they all had swords of extraordinary length with complex hilts curved knucklebows and finger rings in the latest fashion alessandro seemed unable to speak so swan swaggered forward each of us will fight one of you at a time whos first no said alessandro one of the young men shook his head i dont swan drew his sword coward he said this to the man whod called him a buttboy in his odd venetian accent poltroon liar fool cuckold draw alessandro was stepping up behind him you are supposed to swan took another step forward his sword was out his buckler was on his hand and he was in his favourite stance sword under the buckler pointed up at his opponents throat the venetian seemed confounded by his advance what are the rest of you doing he yelled at his friends he didnt draw and swan feinted and smacked him in the side with the flat of his sword and then stepped with one leg past him and threw him to the ground with his buckler arm while the young man felt his side to see if he was cut the other five were stepping back and swan put his swordpoint on the fallen mans sternum why exactly cant i kill him he hasnt drawn his sword yet alessandro said oh said swan he grinned down at the venetian youth my apologies messire please get up he stepped back and saluted alessandro turned as the young man scrambled to his friends you have rattled them that was well done bembo shouted another his voice rose too much bembo dont hide behind your foreign assassin you are here to fight me alessandro bowed oh its a duel swan said he walked forward again and had the pleasure of seeing the whole crowd of them take a step back it looked to me as if the six of you planned to murder him which one of you is the injured party alessandro sniggered he is the challenger is this the ground swan said trying to remember everything hed ever heard about duelling it wasnt very common in london street fights and tavern brawls yes formal duels but hed read a book right here is good enough for me said alessandro the seagrass was short and thick the ground was flat if a little damp very well you others stand over here with me alessandro this is your ground messire i dont know your name what how can you not know my name dont you know who i am the young duellist asked if you have to ask that swan said never mind stand here jacopo foscari splendid messire foscari please stand here my father is francesco foscari the doge if you insist although to be fair i should tell you that your father probably doesnt approve of duelling swan bowed i read a pamphlet about it messire foscari who is your secondo none of the other five volunteered i can fight him if he wants or we can all watch from a safe distance no one moved very well let me see the swords he was acting enjoying himself the young men were all too scared to interfere and he knew in his heart that as long as he could continue his patter hed rule them the way the snake charmer rules the snake foscaris sword was a handspan longer than alessandros i am content alessandro said swan had no idea what he was supposed to do so he shrugged very well on your guards then alessandro drew he had a buckler and he flipped a casual salute and then cut at the face of his buckler tapped it with his pommel and took up a guard foscari did almost the same moving with dancing steps the two men began to circle foscari took a long gliding step and cut from a high guard at alessandros buckler alessandro collected the heavy blow on his sword and drove it into the ground with a countercut and he stepped forward with his left foot and cut with the back edge of his sword and foscari sprang back dropping his sword and swearing he had a long line of blood on his forearm fuck you cocksucker foscari turned to his friends get him uhuh swan had his sword in hand hed never put it away he stood between the five men and the action fair play and all that one of them a blond man with a fuzzy blond mustache reached for his sword swans buckler licked out and caught him in the arm with a sharp crack he swore foscari realised that his friends werent coming to his aid and he picked up the sword your turn will come bembo swan continued to smile at the five young men if any of you would like to fight me he said suggestively i am completely at your service now or at any hour you would prefer you are scum ventured the one hed thrown to the ground alessandro can i challenge him swan asked no alessandro laughed that would be foolish so im scum swan agreed and you are a coward a poltroon a cuckold a fool and a damn what was the other liar can we agree on this the young man flushed bright red bastard swan ventured the red on the mans cheeks grew brighter stop alessandro said he was suddenly at swans shoulder i order you swan smiled innocently at his victim well he said i will have you killed the young man said swan nodded that only proves the coward part he said the liar the fool and the poltroon are yet unproven the cuckold thomas alessandro said swan realised that he had enjoyed himself he bowed at your service gentlemen he said he backed away and walked to the boat one of the youths threw a clod of mud it missed and swan smiled boys he said alessandro shrugged we lived he said theyre about a year younger than you care to tell me what that was about swan asked alessandro looked at him for a long minute no he said but i think i should teach you to fence the duel made him a threedaywonder at the tavern people knew about it before he got back joanna the tavern slut threw him admiring glances and young men swaggered more when they were close to him cesare sat with him drinking wine a few nights later youll get yourself killed he said swan made a face maybe he said cesare laughed and so did giannis you are young and think you will live for ever giannis said yes admitted swan cesare leaned forward you werent like this in france he said swan sat back it is hard to explain he said i see the fear in their eyes and it makes me an animal giannis nodded i know it he said and they were all rich boys i grew up hating rich boys when i was a royal page he paused cesare shrugged tell us how you became a royal page swan held out his cup if this avatar of aphrodite come to earth will refill my wine cup i will tell everything hows your money holding out asked cesare in latin well enough why swan answered were here at least two more weeks and id like to play cards cesare smiled at the serving girl whose pockmarked face was not quite that of an avatar of aphrodite but she smiled well enough and poured them wine from a pitcher here asked swan giannis had taught him to play piquet but hed never yet played for money no cesare said tell your story swan rocked his head back and forth there for good or ill were his friends he was tired of trying to be mysterious my mother owned owns a tavern in london he shrugged shall i tell you the truth neither of them looked appalled indeed giannis looked relieved as if low birth made him more of a man and not less i think she was a whore giannis looked shocked cesare laughed mine too he said what a terrible thing to say of your mother giannis said swan laughed no no listen when she was young my mother had me my father is someone very important i think he bought her the inn i think she surprised everyone by running it well any other family cesare asked some thieves a pope my uncles swan said both archers mother got them posts in the kings bodyguard they retired to the inn and drank and kept order he smiled jack and dick they taught me everything interesting cesare said how did you get to be a royal page swan drank more wine every year or so my father would remember i existed hed buy me something or send me something a tutor an invitation to a school i got in some trouble when i was fourteen he shrugged but i was at least technically a clerk and so i couldnt be tried cesare shook his head you killed someone swan nodded cesare shook his head why do i like you you are a murderous barbarian he was trying to rob me and maybe more his hands anyway i took his knife as my uncle jack taught me and used it for a moment he was there with blood all over him and the other man lying under him gurgling he shivered anyway my father collected me from my mother and i lived in one of his palaces for a year and had tutors it was he couldnt decide what word to use not what you were used to cesare asked exactly swan said and drank more wine sometimes they treated me like a servant and sometimes as if i was a lord nothing belonged to me except the tutors and their learning he shrugged again im not telling this well he looked into his empty wine cup so he sent me to court it wasnt bad it was like the tavern except everyone was richer i didnt have nice clothes i got tired of being treated like a servant he left a lot out and skipped to and then i ran away back to the tavern cesare nodded its us against them he said even when they treat us decently were never allies you like alessandro swan said cesare shrugged hes a rebel too he said he isnt one of them lets play cards they took a boat to another tavern where the tables were larger cesare paid a small fee and was provided with a pitcher of dark red wine and a table and two decks of the new blockprinted cards an hour later swan raised his hands i surrender he said there were six men playing and he tossed in his cards at the end of the last piquet you werent doubled said cesare im losing a ducat every game and sometimes two swan said dont be a jew cesare said do jews play cards badly or do they just want new clothes jews arent so bad when you get to know italians the hit went home and he grinned either way im out swan counted his tally on the abacus thirteen ducats jesus mary and joseph he clambered over the bench jews are cheap cesare said not in my experience swan said theyre thrifty and exacting and good at maths but not cheap now excuse me gentlemen its fun cesare called sit and drink at least swan went back to his inn lit a candle and did some arabic rabbi aaron seemed to know everyone in venice perhaps more importantly he seemed to know everyone in constantinople he began to draw little charts for swan this street had the goldsmiths this street had moneylenders the genoese used to hold galata he said but they tried to help save the empire and they lost everything he drew a small map in the corner of a text galata is a city of its own across the horn from constantinople my brother simon has a house there gradually swan began to understand the layout of the holy city girded with ancient walls with suburbs across the hellespont galata was a walled city unto itself now held by venice aaron wrote him letters to simon to a dozen other men and one woman he hid them in his secret pocket rabbi aaron fingered his long elegant beard my brother used to travel four times a year bringing jewels taking wools he shrugged were old you are a good listener young man i understand you are a ruffian swans head come up at that hed been copying hebrew nouns what oh yes im a hardened killer you engaged with the youngest foscari rabbi aaron smiled it was a hard smile and just for a moment swan wondered what it was like to be a jew to never fully speak your mind to a christian yet in that halfsmile swan read a very definite dislike of foscari there was a duel yes swan smiled beware he is unhappy and very rich and you can buy a mans death in venice for about the price of a hat rabbi aarons eyes met his a good hat swan found it difficult to hold the rabbis eye the man his goodness rolled off him seemed to look directly into his soul i understand from a friend the rabbi said gently that there are men from rome looking for you as well rome venice had so captivated swan that hed forgotten rome the orsini are as much masters of rome as the foscari are of venice rabbi aaron nodded he smiled you are young and hot blooded but please accept a word of advice from an old jew if you must make enemies make powerless enemies swan laughed but it hit him in the gut are the orsini looking for me the rabbi nodded thats my understanding listen you are doing me a favour carrying my letters east i shall do one for you in return and introduce you to a man he is the one who told me about your problem yes he may ask you for a favour i recommend you do it he is powerful in a different way to the foscari swan had grown to manhood in an inn on the wharves of london he thought he had a shrewd notion of the kind of man they were discussing thanks he said now the rabbi said lets go back to work may i ask you one more thing swan asked yes im hoping to purchase books ancient greek books in constantinople he tried to frame his question can your people help me books greek books rabbi aaron looked off into his study you should go and look at the monasteries on the mainland each of them has a fine collection now lets look at how we say thank you rabbi aaron nodded because if you plan to deal with my people you may find it a useful phrase the next morning as he left his lodging swan turned to flirt somewhat automatically its true with joanna the slut of the place she was washing the floor but she managed to wash it with energy grace and a remarkable length of bare leg that deserved a glance and a word she blew him a kiss swan didnt particularly want her but was as delighted as any young man would be by the invitation but as he turned back to the street he caught a glimpse of a man in an illfitting black doublet the man had missed a lacing hole so his toosmall doublet was bunched to one side there was something about his glance that made swan note him then he set off for the rialto and then in the afternoon the jewish quarter there was a small dark man hovering by the gate to the ghetto conscious of the rabbis warning swan was wary of the man but the man met his eye and bowed you are the english foreigner he said yes swan said he was late he was falling in love with fencing and in addition to lessons from alessandro he was talking lessons from messire viladi whose fame was that he was a pupil of the great fiore and had in his youth fought a famous chivalric deed of arms with galeazzo of mantova but all the time the sword was cutting into his time to do arabic i am balthazar said the little man i arrange loans he raised his hands my apologies rabbi aaron said i must approach you directly i have a package for constantinople he smiled thinly and i believe rabbi aaron passed on my warning swan shook his head i dont have a ship or an itinerary he said he returned the mans bow with a deeper bow but i appreciate the warning messire he paused balthazar smiled pardon me but you do have a ship you will leave on the venetian state galley nike at the end of next week the papal ambassador will be the bishop of ostia the man smiled shyly i collect such useless facts he said turning his head aside as if ashamed but swan stopped dead how do you know that the man smiled slyly i have friends clients men who need a favour or a loan he extended a hand swan took it if you are correct than i will do your favour balthazar smiled and bowed i have something you might like to trade he nodded i have heard you are a man of blood swan laughed and two grandmothers across the street glared at him after he was done with rabbi aaron one of the rabbis sons walked him to the pawnbrokers balthazar greeted him and served him wine and two servants brought in a wicker basket swan wondered how important the package was that this man with a house full of servants and a silver candlestick on every table should have come to meet him in person a man left this with me balthazar said he wont ever be coming back the wicker basket proved to hold a fine breast and backplate a matching helmet an armet in the new style with plate arms and beautiful milanese gauntlets it is very fine said swan aware he was being bribed try it on said the jew id need an arming doublet swan said but it was a quibble when he left england to be a soldier hed had a breastplate an old chain shirt that had belonged to uncle dick and a pair of mitten gauntlets from a bygone age with a new sallet from germany that his father had provided albeit unwittingly the french looters had all that every item in the basket was better than any of the items hed owned in england there were marks on the gauntlets theyd been worn one deep dent atop the left pauldron not a mark on the breastplate but armour has to fit he said the jew steepled his hands he looked exactly like cardinal bessarion for a moment so i understand he said the arms were heavier than he had imagined and wearing them felt odd the breast and backplate were too tight it took one of balthazars sons and both his daughters to get the breast and back closed on his waist on the other hand once it was on it felt fine the gauntlets were very fine the helmet and attached gorget went on well but helmets tended to fit from man to man balthazars daughter sarah clapped her hands oh she said a knight balthazar glared at her and she pulled her veil over her face and vanished up the stairs if there was somewhere to lace the arms his son said ive seen it done he went on i love to watch them arm the knights for jousting swan laughed if i ever joust ill call for you he said after he had it all off he said thats worth a fortune what do you want me to carry the jew nodded not to me it isnt i want you to carry two letters and a single packet which i will provide on the day you sail thats all you need to know the rabbi aaron knows of this swan asked no balthazar said this is between us and i get the armour swan asked no balthazar said you get the armour regardless i mean what i say englishman it is useless to us here and no jew should have taken it in pawn but im pleased it fits you what you get from me is contact with my friends in the golden horn the rabbi says you are a good student and a good friend to the jews jews need friends swan sipped the wine which was splendid and if i cut open your package and sell the contents he said balthazar made a face no jew in the world will ever do business with you he said he laughed eh listen to me what a lie theres always a jew to eat another jew but no jew in venice will do business with you and it wouldnt do you any good he laughed and dont you have enough enemies swan nodded i will need to ship some things out of constantinople he said balthazar nodded i think i would like very much to be your friend swan said if only for your magnificent present and your splendid wine and your very pretty daughter i would value you our family was exiled from england two hundred years ago after our women were humiliated in public the men beaten and all our property seized balthazar said why are you a friend of jews swan shrugged ive never really thought about it balthazar shrugged back perhaps for the best at the door balthazars son solomon stopped him what would you charge to teach me to fence he asked swan had some idea that this might be illegal but so was gambling and prostitution and smuggling do you have a pair of swords safed swords swan asked solomon shook his head wed need a pair they would have to be kept somewhere yes illegal for you to own i think he looked around or for me to bring to the ghetto solomon put a hand on his shoulder but you would swan shrugged yes im not that good im taking lessons myself solomon smiled they were the same age solomon looked so different he might have been an alien different clothes different face different manner but there was something a piratical gleam that made swan take to him instantly we need a place somewhere we can both get to with the equipment and no nosy neighbours in venice solomon shook his head let me see it is a foolish thing i have always wanted to do this i saw you you arent like my fathers bravos he shrugged and the rabbi said you were a good man for a christian swan bowed deeply your servant send me a message he frowned i leave in a week solomons face fell swan smiled listen your father must have a way of moving things in and out of the ghetto get a pair of swords and ill give you a first lesson in the garden solomon smiled thanks my father may see this as a christians attempt to entrap him swan shrugged your servant he said walking along the wharf looking for a boat he couldnt quite see why hed liked the young jew so much it was like seeing a girl he didnt want to follow that thought too closely a boatman waved and poled in as swan stepped into his boat he saw the illlaced doublet standing behind a pile of barrels he saw the man only for a second but it was enough he forced himself to smile and make a remark to his boatman he sat in the cupola at the back of the boat and managed without too much effort to sneak a look behind him another boat was leaving the pier was the black doublet in it he wasnt on the wharf swan wasnt armed beyond an eating knife venice had laws about such things alessandro despite his murmurings about being disinherited was living at his fathers palazzo on the grand canal swan didnt know exactly how to approach him he got out of his boat on the rialto and walked along the waterfront enjoying the great cogs the nefs and the galleys that stretched away like an aquatic forest to the south he walked into an alley after the first bridge and walked up the street quickly to a small bakery that cesare liked he turned in the door the whole shop was the size of a ladys wardrobe there was just room for a customer or two to stand then the counter piled high with bread and behind it the ovens it was hot he bought a sweet roll the very pretty girl behind the counter called them hungarian the girl almost distracted him from his intention but he managed to be in the doorway lingering and munching when the black doublet went past him swan glanced back at the girl cesares interest revealed although the hungarian roll was miraculous but she didnt spare him so much as a look and he stepped out into the alley leaped over the very narrow canal and ran along the walkway behind st marks into the square black doublet walked into the square and then began to search he stopped and cursed it was as good as anything the travelling mimes could produce the man was truly angry and he walked around the square and then back along the wharf swan followed him warily this was something hed done often enough in london as a youth for various purposes the man walked up an alley and came back down and almost caught swan flat footed but a stack of cloth bales saved him and the man had no notion of being followed himself he went up the next alley saw the bakery and stopped ran a hand through his thinning hair and stepped on to the portal he said something nodded and smiled a terrible grin when he emerged he was moving quickly swan assumed hed realised that swan had stopped and was now giving up he walked west through st marks square over the bridges it would have been faster for him to take a boat but he didnt he was cheap as darkness began to fall he went into a maze of alleys behind the grand canal palazzi after one turn and an ill look from a man who seemed as dangerous as swans quarry swan gave up and walked back to the canal catching a boat in the last rays of the sun there was a magnificent palazzo dominating the canal just there on a hunch swan pointed at it whos is that the boatman looked at him as if sorry for his provincial ways where are you from naples he asked as if this was the worst insult a man could be offered swan laughed yes naples he said the boatman smiled seeing that his passenger wasnt a complete fool thats the palazzo foscari he said the next morning swan met alessandro for a lesson they were swaggering swords in a dry alley behind the inn the watch had come and gone were to travel on a state galley swan said alessandro had taught him six positions the positions were called gardes his feet had to go just so his arms and his head also it was very different from standing in the inn yard of the swan with one uncle swinging at him while the other drank and made comments look if he covers his head what can you hit his legs boyo cut at his legs high low left right in fact the instructions often ended in the same place but approached the subject from different angles it was remarkably like learning a language from a new instructor one started with verbs another with nouns swordsmanship had a grammar and alessandro insisted that he learn it properly do not just cut at my buckler alessandro said have i not told you ten times to make a provocazione cutting at your buckler is my provocazione swan stepped back no no it is not if you make such a move it is an attack it uses your effort and now i will get to respond look the venetian came on garde not in fact a garde that hed taught to swan yet swan got his sword and his buckler up and the swords crossed at the tips look alessandro said and he stepped forward powerfully his sword now crossed almost to the hilt with swans swan pushed the sword away and as he pushed alessandros weapon vanished under his and was at his throat instead i provoked you by walking into your measure i forced you to act you acted as i expected with pressure to my blade i left your blade to have a picnic by itself and i kill you thus alessandro nodded that was a proper provocazione he nodded now you he paused state galley swan smiled but he kept his sword up hed seen all this before alessandro insisted that he be on his garde all lesson he reinforced the point by cutting suddenly at his pupil while they talked i have a source who says well sail on nike and that the bishop of ostia is our patron he adjusted his point until he was in the garde that maestro viladi called porta di ferro while alessandro called it coda lunga larga so many names a language of its own alessandro stepped back with a flourish you are already much better maestro viladi is very old fashioned but he has improved your stance he knows how to wrestle the old maestro said swan he still had a sore hip where he all cocky had attempted to throw the maestro alessandro laughed then he became serious we need to find you some armour that is presentable he said i have it at least halfarmour he smiled alessandro shook his head in mock wonderment you work miracles have you had any trouble from foscari none swan said then he shrugged perhaps he told the story of black doublet thats lucky alessandro said then he sighed foscari cant have me killed but he can have you killed one of my new friends says the orsini are looking for me here swan said christ crucified alessandro laughed you may be the only man in venice for whom a trip to constantinople is the safest option alessandro suggested a few options to him one was to spend a little money among the streetwalkers and derelicts around his lodging he put this plan into effect immediately paying a few centimes to each of a dozen vagabonds and paying joanna half a ducat to collect their information at the inn door on wednesday he saw black doublet in the square of st marks but they were fifty paces apart and he didnt think the man was following him he went to his lesson with rabbi aaron and then took a boat across to one of the small islands mostly to see if anyone would follow him no one did on thursday after mass a boy approached swan and handed him a note have a sword it said in hebrew swan smiled he went to his room and picked up his sword wrapped the sword belt around it as alessandro had taught him and walked to the door he flourished the sword at his landlord messire niccolo may i walk abroad like this he said why niccolo asked arsenali will ask you im going to pawn it he said messire niccolo belched a great laugh you lie but it is a good lie and nothing the arsenali can disprove go with god my young friend dont kill anyone i like in fact no one gave his sword a second glance at the gate of the ghetto solomon was on duty he grinned when he saw swans sword i have to take that from you he said no christian may walk armed here swan handed it over another young man came to the gate and solomon escorted swan to his fathers gate my father has sent the servants away he said just in case this is my birthday present swan went into the garden where solomons sisters watched from windows as the englishman taught the jew everything he knew about fighting with a sword in three hours solomon was an excellent student immediately swan discovered that the other young man knew a great deal about boxing and wrestling the laws only require that we not carry weapons solomon said there is a book by a jew of warsaw on wrestling i have read it my grandfather was a famous wrestler and boxer he made a head motion something not italian my father is more of a fighter than some of the men who work for him think the sun began to run down the sky swan was learning as all swordsmen learn that teaching another man to fence is the very best way of learning yourself teaching solomon just for one afternoon had caused him to question a hundred things alessandro and maestro viladi had taught him solomon couldnt stop asking why and swan found he had almost no answers now let me exchange a few cuts solomon begged when sarah his sister brought them watered wine swan shook his head too dangerous you have no control no stop i have something just as good let me see your blade he took the sword it was the newest type a strong stout blade but with the new hilt that swan himself wanted a backwardcurving knucklebow to protect the hand from cuts a finger ring so that the wielder could more accurately grip the sword for a thrust the new hilts were all the rage in venice he tried the edge on his thumb especially up near the point is it a good sword solomon asked swan nodded excellent the lateststyle hilt on a good german blade he laid it on a blanket next to his own which was an inch longer and had more of a taper to the blade smaller finger rings and no knucklebow mine is milanese from about eh twenty years ago a fine sword he flexed it between his hands heavy but beautifully balanced for the weight yours is lighter and quicker when we come to fighting ill show you how each has its advantages he smiled unrolled his cloak and took out two bucklers his own and cesares now well have a little duel but all you want to do is strike my buckler this is how we practise in england he said for as long as it took for the shadows to reach across the garden they were at it swash and buckle the sisters applauded from the windows and solomon grew bolder and at last when solomon tried a great leap forward and swan had to drop his sword to avoid spitting his student there was the sound of one pair of hands applauding from the end of the garden balthazar stood there dressed not as a jew but as a gentleman in a short cloak and wearing a sword he bowed gloves on heart my thanks for sparing my son he said that marked the end of the afternoon solomon embraced him i told father youd do it he said that was amazing promise me well do it again swan smiled i wish all my friends were so easily satisfied in the gateway balthazar held out a purse i hope that this is enough he said swan shook his head you must be messire i did that for friendship the jew looked as if hed been struck he stepped back swan shook his head damn it i mean no offence there was a long pause too long then the other man stepped forward again my package is at your lodging he said i hope that all goes well for you in constantinople your orsini problem is hmmm very close to you he bowed i am honoured that you have chosen to befriend my son he turned in a swirl of his cloak and vanished into the ghetto swan walked carefully down to the wharf but he didnt see black doublet or anyone else he recognised it was dark by the time his boat left him at the entrance to the canal nearest his lodging he knew the old whore who stood under the overhang of the last warehouse by the water it was her turf possibly her home she had hennaed red hair and white face paint two days old and was possibly as old as forty he bowed she nodded theres a man she whispered his shoulders tensed and ice ran down his back your orsini are very close balthazar had said ah madonna not tonight he said with a bow and put a silver coin in her hand by the church she said joanna said to tell you he walked on he felt as if he was being watched felt naked and the darkness seemed to hide a legion of enemies at the next crossalley he turned and walked north jumping over a dead dog and a steaming pile of fresh human excrement just dropped from a chamber pot the alley was so narrow that his hips brushed buildings on both sides and he was completely blind for seconds at a time if they took him here he emerged in the tiny square behind the church the nearest building had a triangular floor plan because of the limitations of the two alleys merging and the square itself was only six paces across the width of the small church of st peter the neighbourhood shrine he stayed in the shadows by the triangular building he could hear voices men on the edge of violence have a sound to them the sound alerted him he stood listening indecisive make for the inn where he lodged but if they were assassins they might come in and kill him and niccolo and joanna here in the darkness he had an element of surprise and a sword and room to use it he drew his sword and laid the scabbard carefully on a garden wall where he could reclaim it if he lived then he moved cautiously because hed gone out to give a fencing lesson he had on light leather shoes like dance shoes and he blessed them he was silent he moved to the corner he could see one man at the church corner that man was leaning forward to talk quietly to another whose voice came back hollowly echoed by the next alley he stood at the corner and listened the man closest to him said something the voice floated back i said maybe he stayed with his jews do you think hes one of them some sort of sorcerer the disembodied voice came back fuck your mother said the man closest to him and swan started across the square he had to be sure so he caught his sword with his left hand at the midpoint mezza spada and ran light footed in on his opponent who had leaned into the alley what he said swan used his sword the way a workman might use a pick his swordpoint rammed right thought the back of his skull killing the man instantly he fell and his fall seemed very loud to swan who froze it must have actually been loud because he saw a shadow move at the far end of the alley and then the man was on him swan retreated in a single leap to get more light and more room to swing a sword he was shocked at the man charging him but only as shocked as the assassin was himself to find himself facing a sword an ell long with a dagger now he stepped back into his alley something in his stance gave swan an instant of warning there was the scrape of leather on a cobblestone a third man swan whirled and cut on instinct he missed but the new assailant sprang back with two men coming at him from widely divergent angles swan knew he had to attack one the new man was closer swan cut back up the same line hed cut down he dropped his cloak keeping hold of one of the bucklers inside he stepped forward with his left foot and punched with the buckler and caught the mans dagger more by luck than skill and his countercut took the man high on the dagger arm he screamed swan punched him in the head with his buckler and the man crumpled and swan pivoted as alessandro had taught him on his hips and got his buckler up the third man stood for the count of three and then he turned and ran swan let him go running through venetian alleys in the dark seemed like a sure way to die or merely ruin his clothes he reached down and the man at his feet stabbed at him and he caught the stab on his arm the buckler took some impact but the mans knife scored into the meat of his bicep and the pain enraged him and he cut viciously at the man with his sword not once but three times then he shook his head and cursed himself for a fool and then he took their purses searched their clothes no one had called the watch one scream and one clash of blades wasnt enough to upset most venetians he picked up the first one and carried him a block to the canal and dropped him in walked back picked up the second and repeated the exercise when he was done his hands didnt stop shaking he almost couldnt walk there were two torches burning outside the inn and if another man had tried to kill him hed have died he didnt take any precautions but walked up to the door only when he saw joanna did he fully appreciate how foolish hed been she looked around cesare and a group of other men were playing dice come she muttered fiercely she dragged him into the kitchen then ran back and closed the front door he sat on a settle by the fire and wondered if he would throw up then he looked down and saw the pool of blood on the stone floor under his feet he came to to find his right arm wrapped tightly perhaps too tightly it was all pins and needles something was pressed against him he moved his right hand and found that what was pressed against him was warm ah joanna said you were cold she was naked he found that he was in fact still alive in the morning he went to his room and found an oiled silk envelope that weighed two pounds with it was a scroll tube sealed with a red seal in heavy wax swan took them both he put the silk envelope into the wicker basket with his armour he watched the basket and his heavy leather bag swayed up over the side of the state galley nike and down on to the deck before going down into the shallow hold under the rowers well sail after matins said the mate a young venetian aristocrat with a full beard good to have a couple of knights aboard will you fight as marines if we have a scrap of course alessandro said show us our stations he turned to swan im going to assume you were attacked he said not exactly swan answered he told the story and alessandro laughed his unpleasant laugh so for all you know you attacked an innocent man he said swan shrugged i dont think so either alessandro said but next time leave someone alive eh barbarossa as alessandros harness and arms were swayed aboard swan saw that he had a long sword four feet of steel with a heavy crossguard a long hilt and a spiked pommel giannis had one too giannis saw what he was looking at and leaned over in a ship fight it is good to have reach and power he said alessandro opened swans basket fine armour milanese does it fit well enough swan said better than the stuff i wore at castillon swan had been to sea twice in great ships a galley was a very different ride he was close to the water and it felt faster and more personal as a knight in the train of an ambassador he rode in the captains luxurious coach with eight other men the bishop his two priests the captain the mate their two menatarms who were wellborn venetians training for the sea and alessandro after one very uncomfortable night swan joined giannis under the awning the deck was as hard as rock but the space to roll over was better than a feather bed the third night peter showed them both how to rig a cloak as a ring for the hips and swan slept well they put in almost every night after the first week at sea they touched in dalmatia every day and down to ithaca and corfu then they turned east and they were in a sea that was supposed to be friendly because venice and the turks were at peace but ser marco the captain of the galley was very watchful he was different from the aristocrats that swan had seen in france he was very professional and he was on deck at all hours he had grey in his beard and no front teeth when he smiled he looked like a drunken bully tom had known in his youth but there was nothing drunken in his style on deck he was demanding and his men loved him he was also very cautious he seemed to expect pirates from every headland he made them practise arming and disarming every day every day at dawn he had all the marines and all the archers on deck fully armed unless they were in port when he discovered how good alessandro was he had the young nobleman direct a sword exercise every day rain or shine on the gangway down the centre of the ship the ports were pleasant small towns carefully fortified the venetian fortifications were always modern and well maintained the guards of their garrisons turned out with a flourish venice took care of its overseas empire that much was obvious on the west coast of the peloponnese genoa still held sway and the venetian galley stayed out to sea and didnt touch land except for headlands swan stayed on deck all the time watching the distant shore and trying to guess what part of the classical world they were passing that lowslung isthmus was that sphacteria was that towering summit mount olympus he got used to donning and wearing armour he fenced with alessandro every morning and with giannis and with the three venetian menatarms the oarsmen would watch them sometimes wager and always offer raucous comments they were not slaves around attica they put in at piraeus and the scarred parthenon towered in the distance i must see it swan said cesare agreed and when the capitano said they had a day the two men rented mules and rode up from the port to the ruins of athens the dukes of athens maintained a residence on the summit of the acropolis but the duke wasnt present swan climbed to the summit of the acropolis in a state of nearawe and stood on the steps of the parthenon looking up at its dazzling white stone the miraculously intact roof the carved coffers in the ceiling the frieze of endless marvellous statues the gateway he spent three hours wandering the crown of the acropolis cesare sat down in the shade of an ancient olive tree too damned hot enjoy yourself he said on the way back cesare cursed his mule and then said you really love all that it is right there swan said its as if pericles might come out and speak cesare shook his head insects and hot sunlight and greedy peasants he said much like home but without the good wine and the taverns and the cities and the money and the good roads i copied down some of the epitaphs swan said excitedly aeschylus you sound as if you didnt believe he was real before cesare shook his head the long haired persians remember me in the grove of marathon swan quoted he looked at his tablets the wax is melting he said disgusted i copied one about another solider diodorus something fought in egypt he looked at the italian yes it seems more real here than in england cesare shook his head and you waited tables in an inn what a fascinating country england must be at naxos the bishop who hardly ever showed his face on deck went to pay a visit to the duke of naxos who was of course a venetian the bishop of ostia was a papal courtier it was not his first trip outside of rome but one would never have guessed it the mans world view was utterly dominated by rome and he seemed to feel that the world existed to serve the pope which as alessandro said was going to make his visit to constantinople very exciting alessandro went with him to the duke of naxos swan looked at a temple of apollo paying two local men to be guides he took giannis who was at least as bored as cesare had been the temple of apollo was on an islet just off the coast the local men spoke a dialect of greek that swan found incomprehensible at first but by the end of the day he could joke with them and buy sausage from a woman in the streets of the principal city while the bishop was feted in the palace he sharpened his spoken greek every day on the third day cesare was summoned to the palace and he joined swan in the cool of the evening sitting on a terrace really the roof of a large taverna this is more like it cesare said drinking wine and admiring the girl serving at the next table what did the bishop want a letter to the pope he thinks hes the legate i think the pope will not thank him for dabbling in local politics but im a mere notary cesare knocked back his wine i met a monk a greek monk we had a bit of a debate he smiled i liked him and invited him to come over for a cup of wine in fact when the monk came the tavern owner treated him with the kind of respect that an italian tavern keeper kept for beautiful women and the very very rich the wine at their table was taken away and replaced with a fresh pitcher that was upon tasting of much higher quality the monk who insisted that they call him fra demetrios waved at the wine and said it was from nemea with the lions said swan in greek fra demetrios laughed not bad you are florentine english said swan fra demetrios nodded fine men the english you know england asked cesare i am from lesvos fra demetrios said the gatelusi have maintained english soldiers to guard us from the turks for oh i dont know a hundred years he smiled the english are great pirates but like good sheepdogs they prey only on the wolves eh the wars of the gatelusi led to the fall of constantinople the end of everything said fra demetrios and he shrugged venice does not yet realise with what she is dealing the turks are ten twenty fifty times as powerful as venice that foolish old man foscari is busy fighting petty lordlings in italy and the turks will take all greece he looked at a pair of turkish soldiers lounging in the street they were mercenaries serving with the duke of naxos but they were nonetheless turks in truth they have already conquered us we merely await the axe after another pitcher of wine he laughed at cesares pretensions to learning any greek monk has read all the ancients he said not just the bits that have wandered out of our libraries to the west cesare didnt rise to the provocation but smiled agreeably what texts do you have that we dont he asked i mean ive read aristotle how many books the monk asked of aristotle all three cesare nodded de anima ethics and the athenian consitution he winked at swan three said the monk by saint george my latin friends aristotle wrote more than twenty books by the fourth pitcher of wine demetrios was writing the titles of every greek book hed ever read on cesares tablets in the market swan found tables of curios dozens of classical seals and coins as well as several small statues rings heads of gods a bronze spearhead a butt spike he bought several of the seals and the spearhead and butt spike alessandro shook his head what will you do with this junk swan handed over a silver coin with the owl of athena on one side and a magnificent head of the goddess on the other alessandro pursed his lips in appreciation that is pretty he admitted worth money in rome swan asked alessandro shook his head i have no idea giannis looked at the coin youll find mountains of this old rubbish in constantinople he said how will we ship the cardinals things back to rome swan asked alessandro stroked his beard christ on the cross i had forgotten the bishop has me dancing attendance every day i think he imagines i actually work for him swan nodded each port weve visited they are expecting a venetian squadron bringing soldiers alessandro shrugged i heard of it in venice genoa is losing a great many towns theyll need garrisons galata too asked swan i see where you are going ill ask around alessandro nodded you think the troopships will go home empty even if theres cargo chances are we can get some space swan said if swan thought that ser marco was cautious before naxos he redoubled that caution after they sailed for the golden horn twice they made long legs out to sea to avoid turkish ships along the coast but off samothrace they ran into thick morning mist and when the hot sun burned it off they were hull up and in clear sight of a pair of galleys arms ordered the captain and he put the ship about nothing to worry about yet friends we are at peace peace or not the ships archers were in the bow and stern in a hundred heartbeats and the menatarms had their armour on deck in the grilling sun the turkish galleys paced them by the time swan was armed there was a galley on either side a few hundred paces away matching them oar for oar the englishman walked to the side trying his arm harnesses feeling his stomach press against his ribs peter was leaning nonchalantly against the ships side bending one of the archers bows his own was strung and he had twenty arrows stuck point up through his belt he grinned at his master look at this bow he said its turkish the italian archer nodded horn and sinew he said as heavy as my bow peter said i would like very much to try it when we are ashore perhaps we could have a little contest said the italian if we arent taken and enslaved in the next five minutes of course swan admired the archers sangfroid the italians had various words for it and swans favourite was sprezzatura effortless performance whether of bravery or of swordsmanship of just the recitation of poetry he smiled at the man who nodded coolly then he smiled best get your breastplate on the ships trumpeter sounded a long note and the drummer beat to arms swan saw alessandro beckoning he wants us all in the stern alessandro said ser marco had his eyes on the island to port i am gong to bear up and leave the island on our port side he said its good sailing anyway but it will force them to commit if they want to continue flanking us that bastard there will have to row across the wind the farther turk had a striped sail as big as a ship he gave the order the timoneer repeated his orders and the venetian galley spun in the water and went due east the captain watched the turks for a minute very well theyre coming for us he said swan didnt see whatever it was that gave the captain this information but his stomach flipped over again alessandro nodded he drew his long sword one of the ships menatarms turned to swan would you like a spear he asked of all things swan answered he took a light partisan and a rotella a steel shield a little more than two feet across and slightly convex he strapped it on his arm tried it and heard a shout the farther turk had turned and was coming straight for them the captain held up a hand archers whenever you have the range peter lofted the first shaft he shot high and the arrow went on the wind and vanished the italian archer said something to peter that made the fleming laugh and his bow came up and he loosed at a much lower angle his arrow fell into the sea just short of the turkish galley a dozen arrows rose out of the turk and fell well short of their ship wind in their teeth alessandro said swan didnt like the feeling the slow creep of fear he remembered it from the first hours at castillon when they overran the french archers on the road and then waited and marched and listened to the officers dicker he wanted to get it over with it was very different from a street fight or the duel one of the venetian archers called something and all of the ships archers drew together and loosed their arrows vanishing into the onrushing ships hull peter drew loosed and watched his arrow shook his head swan turned to see the other turkish galley it stood off and seemed content to let its consort do the dirty work peter looked at the italian ask him how he aims when the two hulls come together so fast the italian shrugged like this he said and drew and loosed his shaft fell like a thunderbolt into the group on the command deck of the enemy ship it was a spectacular shot more than a hundred paces peter grinned and loosed his arrow fell into the same group the italian laughed loosed and then slapped the fleming on the shoulder turkish arrows were beginning to find marks among the venetian oarsmen a man on the second oar from the bow gave a cry thrashed wrecking his oars timing and then slumped over the shaft and two of the deck crewmen pulled him off his bench the venetian galley had just one oar deck there were three men on each oar on long benches set at a definite angle to the centreline of the hull the ram was above the waterline forward and above the ram was a small bow where the marines waited swan headed there aware as only a classicist could be that galley warfare had hardly changed in two thousand years a turkish arrow got past his round shield and hit the top of his helmet making his ears ring he got his shield up and an arrow struck the steel face and ricocheted off it hit the bulkhead and came back broken the arrowhead twice deflected scored a deep gash in the top of his thigh narrowly missing his testicles and he winced he found himself behind alessandro the italian had excellent armour all milanese all matching a small fortune in steel he had to admit to himself that it was comforting to have a highly trained friend in headtotoe steel between himself and the enemy spent arrows rattled around the marine box the venetian archers were loosing so fast that it looked as if lines of arrows connected the two vessels the turk was coming up from abeam and then the venetian captain changed course he turned to starboard so that he and the turk were on parallel courses and then he had his starboard oars retract as far as they could while the port oars drove on the venetian ship turned so suddenly that everyone aboard was thrown to starboard the venetian archers obviously forewarned poured shafts into the waist of the turkish ship and the venetians cathead caught the turkish outrigger a hard blow it wasnt like a ram attack but oars splintered and the venetians seemed to be winning the archery exchange giannis was quite coolly cocking his crossbow and sending shaft after carefully aimed shaft into the enemys boarders and then the turkish galley was falling away behind them oars damaged and with her waist a bloody chaos of arrowshot men for a few seconds the venetians had been at pointblank range just a few paces away and eight feet higher in the water a dozen of them had loosed perhaps six shafts each and the result was that the turkish ship although undefeated yet was crippled so many men were wounded that as she sagged away blood ran from her scuppers as if the ship herself was bleeding the venetian galley settled on a new course and carried on the sailors mending cut lines and trying to replace one oar that had been broken in the collision and wounded all three of its oarsmen swan could hear his breath inside the confines of his burgonet his hand found the catch and he got his visor open one of the venetian menatarms slammed it shut just as another volley of arrows caught them he glanced to port the other turk was coming for them mary mother of god stand with us in our hour of need said the venetian who had closed his faceplate he turned and saw a third turkish galley emerging from behind a rocky islet on the coast of samos amen said swan arrows fell like hail and swan was hit repeatedly twice on his helmet at least twice on his shield and one that went between his foot and his boot sole penetrating the boot on both sides and barely cutting his foot you have the luck of the devil said one of the venetians he grinned inside his barbute and in that moment took an arrow under his arm and fell to the deck dead alessandro turned he looked behind them for a long time theyre going to ram us in the stern and board he said follow me swan didnt ask questions he ran the length of the ship through the arrow storm with the italian one stride behind the turkish galley was a horse length from the stern bearing down on them and the arrows were as thick as snow in london at christmas ser marcos turned to port hoping to confuse the pursuing turk by turning towards his consort but the captain of the enemy ship read his intention and turned inside the nimble venetian ranging alongside and the grapples flew as the enemy ram touched them the venetian rowers pulled in their heavy oars and reached for weapons venetian oarsmen were among the most feared fighting men in the inner sea the turkish borders came in a rush with screams to allah they had round shields and scimitars many had long spears and a few had europeanlooking long swords the whole swarm came for the venetian command deck forty or fifty men swan found himself between ser marco and alessandro he got his rotella up as the first scimitar came at him and then it all happened so fast that there was a sort of hideous pause as his partisan went untouched into a gap between a turks shield and his sword right into the bridge of his nose killing him instantly there was another moment one swan remembered for many nights when his partisan got stuck in a screaming ghazi and the man went down into the oar benches and then powerless as he tried to free his weapon he saw the scimitar that would kill him coming for his neck his shield was on the wrong side and the weapon floated undefended into the gap and slammed full force into the place where his neck muscles meshed with his shoulder muscles his armour held it hurt but the edge didnt bite and he let go of the partisan and reached for his sword drawing it seemed to take for ever and then the pressure on him eased he had been fighting multiple opponents for as long as as there had been time beards teeth screaming suddenly just one man covering the retreat of his fellows a big brave man his sword everywhere alessandro caught the fellows scimitar in a rising falseedge parry and swan was there following the rising sword into the created opening his blow wasnt strong but strong enough the turk dropped his weapon one finger severed from his hand then he managed to block two killing blows with his round shield alone blood was gushing from his severed finger he sprayed it at alessandro and punched with his shield swan got a foot behind the turks front foot and slammed him to the deck he knelt on the mans chest and put his sword across the mans throat the man was beaten he was down the sound of fighting was dying away the turk was smiling swan had time to think damn this bastard is brave i could capture him thats foolish i could just i could capture him and then he couldnt kill the man an arabic word came to him did turks even speak arabic stop he said the turk looked at him raised an eyebrow and said something rapidly in arabic swan had to shrug just stop he said in english of all things alessandro helped him up the oarsmen were killing the wounded and throwing the last turks over the side the third turkish galley was standing off even as he looked the archers aboard the third galley lofted a flight of arrows into the second turk we dont generally take prisoners alessandro said swan looked at the turk the man looked exactly as swan himself had felt at castillon in the shattering moments after the end of fighting hes swan looked at the italian too wiped by the fighting to come up with the words i agree ser marco the capitano looked at their prisoner hes someone important he fought gallantly ill give the bastard that but the arsenali will kill him events proved him wrong the third turkish galley had an enormous red flag amidships and it drove the second galley off quite convincingly ottoman galley said ser marco his voice sounded thick his slight lisp was very pronounced he watched the enemy ship he spoke again after minutes had passed and they hadnt been attacked those are smyrna galleys theres a hundred flavours of turks and syrians and worse he shrugged by gods nose they may even be renegade greeks he spat over the side the new galley is ottoman he may recognise our flag he may even swan pointed youre bleeding messire the capitano ser marco looked down saw the blood running like a fresh spring stream over the cuisse on his hip and fell flat to the deck they had to cut the straps on his leg armour hours of work for an armourer to replace to get at the wound his blood was spurting away his boots were soaked and alessandro whipped a sharp knife out of swans hand and slit the mans hose the wound was just below the groin alessandro looked at swan who shrugged he tried putting pressure directly on the wound and the blood spurted past his fingers he tried to put pressure above it the mans muscles were as hard as rock and he could slow the flow but not stop it cesare wearing a corselet and an openfaced bassinet leaned over pulled off his helmet and spat the bishop has a doctor he said swan knelt there feeling like a fool his hand pressed into another mans groin the blood seeped past his forefinger slowly he pressed as hard as he could alessandro pushed back from the other side of ser marcos hip he wanted his helmet off he wanted all his armour off and he wanted to know what was happening the mate was down dead swan assumed and alessandro was issuing orders as if born to it which indeed he was the silence from the oarsmen was ominous the bishops doctor was sent for the bishop and all his suite had spent the battle in the captains coach in the stern swan thought the worse of them for it cesare for example had blood on his sword and four long cuts on his forearm like the claw marks of some great beast ser marcos eyes fluttered open make sail he said and raised an arm swan refused to be distracted and kept the pressure on alessandro slapped cesare on the hip take over he said cesare knelt in a clatter of metal so much blood he said his face was pale such a fight swan just wanted his helmet off there was shouting behind him the only man he could see through the forest of legs on the quarterdeck was the italian archer who had just wiped his forehead and put a fresh arrow on his string the doctor burrowed through the crowd his black clothes flapping like a ravens wings his face was as pale as milk and he was obviously terrified but he knelt ran his hand down the capitanos thigh and nodded he was a small man and his hands shook give me room he said acerbically he looked at swan do you know any anatomy he asked swan couldnt shrug owing to his kneeling posture and his armour yes no you found the artery the doctor nodded i need a sharp knife some vinegar a needle and thread he looked at swan dont let go young man your captains life depends on it alessandro leaned in i need him if they come at us theyre coming alongside thomas the doctor shook his head rapidly and looked even more like a bird if he lets go of the artery ser marco dies alessandro sighed if they board us he said his eyes met the englishmans if they board us let the capitano die and come and fight the sun was grilling him his slightly tootight breast and back armour was biting into his hip and the base of his waist and the pain was growing running slowly up his side the bishop was there i must shrive him he said and pushed against swans back out of my way the doctor looked up back off he said his voice full of authority bravo little man you sputtered the bishop of ostia off the deck your grace alessandro said ser marco is my clear the deck your grace the turks are coming aboard alessandros voice was low and gentle the bishop turned and fled an arsenali brought vinegar peter leaned over a threaded needle in his hand heavy linen cord i waxed it he said in his flemishaccented english swan translated but the doctor had already snatched the needle he nodded at peter and turned to swan this is what were going to try he said you hold on as hard as ever you can i will open the skin a little more catch the end of the artery i hope in this loop hed made a loop like a horse breakers lasso i pull tight you keep holding let me pass seven loops around the artery and put the needle through and tie off then you let go any time before pfft hes dead yes are you ready swan knew that it was foolish to feel that the pain in his hip was important when they were trying to save the captains life but he muttered hurry then the doctor took a deep breath he was praying this is a man with a genuine courage swan thought the turkish galley was towering over them the oarsmen were silent twenty heads leaned into the circle to watch the doctor work i need light he said men made room the doctors hands moved he slashed the skin blood flowed he folded a flap back and his left hand went in the loop trailed in the blood the blood spread over swans hands and he felt the artery under his forefinger begin to slip the loop missed swan couldnt really see he couldnt get his head at the right angle and his armet suddenly weighed a ton and there was sweat flowing over his eyebrows and he couldnt move he grunted it was not exactly pain but it was a lot of minor discomforts piled one on another fuck said the doctor tell the dutchman to prepare me another loop swan said peter but the fleming understood enough here ive made three the doctor muttered something about the white of the waxed thread his only hope something happening aft got it said the little doctor got it hold hard but the artery was slipping it felt like a snake a hard worm under swans finger and he brought his thumb down alongside the finger one two the doctor counted three he paused there were a series of rapid motions the turkish ship was doing something the sailors were moving the doctor thrust the needle hard hard enough to make the muscles stand out on his neck five he said six seven second stitch third stitch the man looked triumphant like a man who had won a serious fight or won a fortune on the turn of a card he radiated joy he looked over at swan took peters third loop and took a deep breath let go he said slowly swan found it hard to let go his thumb and forefinger were stuck together with blood and pain swan alessandro shouted he got to his feet his knees and stomach muscles didnt want to hold him up the doctor raised his face its holding he said he was staring into the blood and flesh swan stumbled the turkish ship oars folded in like a birds wings lay alongside a man in a magnificent turban with a jewel holding an ostrich plume was standing at the base of the aft mast hands on hips he roared something alessandro turned to swan do you understand him swan leaned out on to the oar box put his bloody hand to his mouth and called shukraan thanks the man at the mast grinned may i come aboard frank he called in arabic from his accent it wasnt his first language may we speak greek swan shouted back and the turkish officer waved without any further ceremony he swung out on the spar of his lateen and landed accurately on the deck by swans feet the turk was taller than swan by a head with a magnificent beard as good as rabbi aarons heavy chested with a long curved nose and heavy black brows on the turkish ship a row of marines were pointing hand cannons over the rail and two officers were screaming at each other giannis snarled i know this one he said the turk inclined his head he was more like a king than anyone that swan had ever met certainly far more like his idea of a king than henry vi of england omar reis spat giannis christ the saviour the turk smiled showing a mouthful of teeth he wore a silk robe worth a thousand ducats and a goldhilted sword worth as much again the emerald in his turban was worth another thousand at least the greeks call me omar reis i am turahanoglu omar reis you are in some small difficulty he said he was looking around alessandros greek wasnt up to the exchange swan translated and then said no difficulty my lord just some pest control omar reis smiled again yes i see that some of the rats had teeth and blood quite a bit of blood may we offer you a cup of fresh apple cider my lord swan was quite sure there was cider somewhere in the bishops gear you are very kind said the turkish lord the wounded groaned and the ships made all the small sounds of ships at sea but otherwise there was complete silence on both ships an oarsman went below for cider we have a safe conduct alessandro said and an ambassador from the pope to the sultan swan nodded and repeated alessandros statement this is our captain alessandro of the illustrious family of the bembii of venice he added the turk inclined his head very slightly alessandro matched his inclination to the degree and you bloody hand asked the turk i cannot place your accent im an englishman swan said some devil made him add my greatuncle is the king of england omar reis had begun to step past him but he paused really he asked king henry has no brothers john of gaunt was my grandfather swan said this turk seemed to know quite a bit about england the turk scratched below his beard at the base of his neck i see he said he bowed his head just a little how may we be of service alessandro was glaring at him but he folded up the glare and put it away before the turk could see it giannis said in french hes looking us over to see if he wants to take us alessandro nodded on the turkish galley the slowmatch for the hand cannons burned and minute whorls of smoke rose from the marines hands and curled away into the sun swan was working through the problem in his head fighting didnt promote careful planning but now that he was no longer holding a man who was bleeding to death or fighting for his life certain thoughts started to percolate through his mind first that omar reis had to have known that the other two galleys were there after all the third galley had emerged from behind an island the two smyrna galleys had been out in the current but they must have rowed hard to get there and hold their stations the captain would have known all this swan made a devilshorn sign with his left hand and flashed it to alessandro behind the turks back giannis grabbed his hand in french he said hes the most powerful turk on the greek mainland his father is turahan bey and hes the lord of thrace swan was watching the young man hed taken prisoner peter was standing by him and the young mans eyes were glued on the turkish lord who looked around never quite seeing the prisoner alessandro bowed a servant presented a tray with a silver goblet full of cider the turk took it he looked at alessandro we must share my lord if you want me to try it first alessandro said and swan translated the turk handed him the cup alessandro drank and handed it back to him with a bow the turk drained it let me see this safe conduct he said swan watching him like a hawk saw his glance pass over the prisoner pause and move on it was like watching a boy trying not to look at a girl with bare legs or nice breasts alessandro was looking at him in latin he said all three galleys serve dido of carthage he smiled the turk turned to look at him the boy with peter must be his son swan went on in latin look at him alessandro nodded he gave that thinlipped smile he adopted when he was going to do something nasty the bishop came on deck he was a heavy man and he made heavy work of crossing the deck from the coach who is this infidel he asked in italian omar reis smiled in italian he said i might ask the same and waved i will have to take this ship until all this is sorted out alessandro snapped his fingers and motioned to peter peter put a dagger against the young mans throat the bishop had a scroll in his hand and alessandro snatched it without a word of apology my lord please allow me to offer our safe conduct signed by the sultan mehmet the second of that glorious name and issued to the bishop of ostia and his train so long as they are transported by a venetian ship this is a venetian ship venice is at peace with the sultan but if you attempt to impound us i promise you three things first that you will die second that your son will die before your eyes and third that your ship will be as easily defeated as your two consorts have been ill add a fourth my lord that venice will go to war for us omar reis didnt show a shadow of fear he smiled and looked around son i have no son he said your threats are as empty as air i have driven off your enemies i am the lord of thrace these waters are mine under the sultan whos slave i am if you touch me all of you will die crucified after you have been degraded by my galley slaves ask your pet greek what i do to my enemies his smile deepened come you have made your threats and i have made mine i would like my food he snapped his fingers and an oarsman brought him the safe conduct he read it as if they were of no further concern to him swan thought it might be the finest performance of bravery hed ever seen omar reis shrugged i do not read latin he said this might be the directions to a brothel he was looking at swan who grinned alessandro couldnt stop himself he grinned too but i will issue you my own safe conduct if you are a venetian ship why is your flag not flying he asked the lion of saint mark is sacrosanct in these waters in fact the red flag with the lion was flapping away a few paces behind the turkish lord giannis snorted alessandro shrugged it must have been cut away in the fighting he said or perhaps it was difficult to see from the angle at which you approached as the two galleys had both attacked from astern this was preposterous as everyone present knew omar reis nodded is your uncle really the king of england greatuncle swan said in arabic he said the boy is your son omar reis met his eye your arabic is terrible he said he nodded very slightly peter let the young man go swan said there was a grunt and omar reiss eyes moved just for an instant i will escort you to constantinople said the turkish lord he turned to swan and bowed i thank you swan waved the turkish lord on his way just as hed seen his father do a hundred times it is nothing he said in his most haughty voice when the turks were gone over the side alessandro embraced him i think that one is on you he said i owe you a fine cup of wine and the virgin a hundred candles of white wax giannis shook his hand you have matched wits with satans own son he said and the virgin will do well from me as well the golden horn was perhaps the most magnificent sight that swan had ever seen and the towers and palaces of byzantium even six months after a brutal siege and sack were the most splendid he could imagine the tower of galata on the asian side was matched or exceeded by the golden onion domes of the great churches some already converted to mosques two new minarets towered over the centre of the palace of blacharnae and yet the great breaches blown in the walls by the turkish cannon remained unrepaired the turkish warships escorted them all the way to the harbour mole for galata the fiction that the two smyrna galleys were somehow enemies of omar reis was thinly preserved the two ships followed the venetian at the distance of a few leagues while the turkish lord himself was always hull up often broadside on a mere two hundred paces away for the last three days they were on deck all the time strings to bows in harness swan had never worn armour four days running the breast and back slightly too tight cut into him like a blade he had constant diarrhoea as did half the ship and the wounds on his right leg bled yellow pus and still he didnt take off his armour the bishops doctor worked double tides he proved an increasingly confident professional and he seemed to grow in stature each day by the time they sighted the tower of galata he seemed four inches taller and six men owed him their lives ser marco was one of them he was awake and he screamed each day when his bandages were changed messer claudio insisted on pouring vinegar on wounds but aside from the screams he seemed better they landed to a silent hostile town most of the citizens were genoese and resented the handingover of the town to venice turkish soldiers still roamed the town it was bad here alessandro said after hed been ashore swan had his armour off for the first time in four days he had open sores despite his heavy leather and linen arming doublet and a wound hed missed altogether a long cut that had somehow gone up under the skirts of his fauldand cut above his buttocks into the base of his back it wasnt bad but it explained why hed hurt so much he stank the pus kept coming out of his leg fuck it he said to alessandro and jumped into the sea the pain was intense but he swam through it as the salt searched out every abrasion every wound it felt to him as if tiny doctors were cleaning him with tiny sharp brushes he swam and swam until his arms wouldnt support him and then he climbed up the anchor cable feeling curiously heavy dr claudio hauled him inboard you are the merest empiric he said you dont know that salt water is good for wounds he leaned over let me look at your back he scrubbed the wound with vinegar and then did something that hurt like fire swan screeched like a small girl who burns herself on a candle claudio laughed alum he said nothing cleans a wound like alum the bishop disembarked and moved into a house in the town swan heard about his embassy from the doctor who as it proved was much happier caring for the soldiers than being ignored by the churchman i was the tenth choice for the embassy claudio admitted he fancies himself a great man on an important mission whereas the rest of us know that hes the only man whod take the job and what hes doing is a formality the doctor shrugged he wanted a famous medico and he got me you are very good swan said you are very kind claudio said before i threw my little loop over ser marcos artery i had never in a practical way manipulated a human body one that was alive anyway by god swan said oh i have experimented on myself the little doctor said as if that made it all better a turkish boat came across and the embassy loaded up to move to constantinople giannis came down to the ship and took swan peter and the doctor and their gear to the turkish boat and they were rowed across the horn a curious and very exacting piece of smallboat handling given the current giannis chatted with the boats crew in greek what do they say asked alessandro that the taxes are lower giannis said he was angry they are traitors swan shrugged im not sure they are he said thinking of the gascons and the englishmen of the dordogne people need peace in order to live giannis glared at him and he hid his smile and watched the rapid current sweep them north towards the euxine it took twenty days for the bishop to present his credentials he was outraged by the wait swan was in heaven and would happily have had the embassy delayed another twenty days it was like a journey to some exotic dream peopled by the best of classical antiquity and a thousand sir palomides the saracen knight of king arthurs court the greeks looked haunted but shops were open if there were gaps enormous gaps where fifty buildings had burned where a whole square of shops had been looted and destroyed there were also whole quarters that looked untouched by war many establishments smelled of fire and in one small square swan could smell the unmistakable smell of human corpses rotting the magnificent hagia sophia was a stable for the sultans horses swan paid a ducat a staggering sum and was allowed to walk around earth had been put over the floors and men on scaffolds were painting whitewash over the mosaics of gold and lapis and marble he kept his thoughts to himself at the great doors he met a young man who bowed to the ground you are the english prince he asked swan was seldom confounded by his own tales but this gave him pause for a moment and then he recognised the young man idris son of omar reis the handsome young man bowed again the same i owe you my life swan returned the bow well it proved to be a fine decision on my part he said i have a suspicion that if youd been lying in a pool of your own blood your father would have killed us all idris shrugged perhaps truth to tell i am not my fathers favourite he shrugged again greeks and turks had that shrug in common come and have coffee tell me how i can be of service to you how is your hand swan asked all contrition idris bowed i can still hold a sword he said one small finger a small price to pay for my life as they walked across the great square swan reflected briefly on how narrowly he and this other man had come to one killing the other and now under a change of circumstance they sat together drinking tiny thimbles of hot sweet liquid and talking about language i have learned turkish of course and arabic italian but the most beautiful is persian i write poetry in persian idris stared off into space my father disapproves of my poetry writing and my taste in friends he added with the frank bitterness of the young i went to sea to prove to him that i am a man he is such a barbarian he thinks that the ability to ride a horse and fight with a sword defines you but of course i was captured swan flashed briefly on the fierce eyes on the man parrying with his shield alone after hed been hit in the swordarm ill be happy to testify to your bravery swan said may i have another effendi murmured the greek shopkeeper i owe you too much already how can i repay you asked the turk cash a bloody great pile of ducats you could teach me turkish swan said idris made a face perhaps he said next day swan took peter as a guard and went to find the jews they werent allowed to bear weapons openly but both of them had daggers under their cloaks swan was sure he was followed every time they left the small inn where they were lodged in what had been the venetian quarter his experience in venice had made him aware of people following him but it was difficult here every street was a sea of new faces there were refugees and beggars on every corner still he had an idea that the very tall thin man hed seen a few times was a shadow and he tried various tricks going down a very narrow alley hed located in the old arcade of silversmiths walking around by the old palace there was a turkish guard on the gate of the jewish ghetto swan took one look scratched his chin then walked back to the inn and sent a note by a beggar boy to idris then he scribbled a note of his own and folded it inside rabbi aarons letter idris was delighted to accompany them to the gate he spoke a few words to the gate guard and swan guessed that hed just been described as the prince of england he bowed the gate guard bowed and the three of them were allowed into the jewish quarter there was damage here the synagogue had taken a cannonball and swan could see the glitter of magnificent mosaics inside the three men stood at the entrance to the ghetto and a pair of young men approached them swan stepped forward bowed and asked for the house of simon the merchant i have a letter from his brother in venice he said the two young men took him to simons house he was led inside and servants bustled about simon was far more prosperous then his venetian brother the rabbi he had a pair of nubian slaves and half a dozen slavic slaves like the richest venetians and florentines they were offered coffee which was apparently to turks what wine was to italians simon came and swan introduced himself and his two companions he handed over the letter simon bowed you will pardon me he said with the siege it is more than a year since i have heard from my brother swan saw him palm the inner note expertly and he relaxed simon left them for a few minutes and they made stilted conversation and admired the calligraphy on scrolls around the walls all of which idris proclaimed to be persian except this one he said puzzling over one particularly odd scroll the letters were both large and violent square almost and yet oddly beautiful chinese said simon coming back into the room i thank you very much messer for your kindness to an old jew may i be of service swan bowed i am interested in purchasing old manuscripts old greek manuscripts i collect them he said your brother suggested you might help me in hebrew he said do you know the house in the note simon nodded i have sent a message he said i expect he will come and fetch his package in person i have it on me swan said in italian he went on my poor hebrew doesnt go as far could you direct me to the simon smiled he waved a hand and one of the servants led him to the neatest and sweetestsmelling jakes hed ever seen there was a basin of water and a basket of towels swan opened the basket of towels and put balthazars package inside then he racked his brain for the hebrew word for towel nothing came to mind when simon looked at him he gave the man a small nod and mimed washing his hands not even a blink of recognition he wasnt going to discuss any more business with idris present so they spoke at random of a dozen things asked after the family and the business as if he were truly an old family friend he heard a stir in the doorway and then there were bows the man who was presented yet another isaac might have been balthazars second son he was the right age and had something of solomons eager friendliness he also appeared simultaneously too friendly and ill at ease idris in particular seemed to excite him and he flattered the young turk unmercifully at last swan managed to withdraw with many protestations of future visits they walked out the main gate escorted by two local men who bowed low as they passed the janissary saluted idris laughed franks are famous for their bigotry he said and you seem to be friends with everyone swan shrugged i make a habit of pulling thorns from the paws of every lion i meet he said my father likes you idris said hes going to invite you to go hunting with him should i swan asked idris thought for a moment it would help me he said will your father give me a safe conduct in my own name swan asked it was a little too bold but he wasnt sure how often hed have access to the young turk idris smiled so thats what you want why these old books what would you do to have unlimited access to persian manuscripts swan asked idris smiled you are too intelligent and i suspect you are using me but you saved my life you are entitled to a little use he inclined his head very like his father and his bearing reminded swan that he was not always as clever as he thought he was i will ask on your behalf he looked at swan listen promise me something swan laughed yes promise me you arent after this thing this head that all the christians want the sultan spoke of it today my father has men all over the city looking for it swan looked confused or at least he hoped he did head he asked christians worship the parts of dead men idris insisted in their churches feet toenails arm bones this is the head of the great warrior maurice swan asked he was sweating now it wasnt really very funny saint george idriss brown eyes bored into his promise me you are not trying to steal it because you turks stole it first swan asked sometimes according to his uncles it was best to attack idris met his eye and laughed almost a week passed in which they werent allowed out of the venetian quarter no reason was given and the janissaries were polite but absolutely adamant swan walked to the market every day and purchased anything that caught his fancy and that he could afford he received notes and invites from aarons brother and from balthazars business associates he had to decline them he wrote careful notes in stilted hebrew accompanied by other notes in italian trying to make clear that his refusal was not his own choice the bishop who had never deigned to notice him turned after one of the messengers had gone away and said how is it that you have friends in constantinople infidel friends swan bowed your grace must know by now that i took young idris prisoner in the fight on the boat he said politely i know nothing of the kind but i forbid you to have any further communication with him the bishop looked at him his father is the most terrible of men an enemy of god the greeks call him the son of satan swan was about to remonstrate but alessandro who was forced to spend most of his time attending the bishop made the motion of a blade crossing his throat which swan took to mean he should shut his mouth the bishop moved on as if having given instructions to a servant he had no further need to communicate which as swan considered it was probably how the bishop viewed him cesare sat back and dealt another hand of piquet if only he said god forgive me for what im going to say but if only he was an aristocrat and not a jumpedup little romagnol peasant swan had to laugh this from you cesare spat bah he said now that i see you are the lost prince of england i no longer believe that you are a true man like me anyway then he grinned you are the bastard of a great man i am the bastard of some roadside tryst im a better swordsman too swan said and cesare aimed a swipe at him that almost connected the four of them alessandro swan giannis and cesare fenced with sword and buckler every day cesare was growing better by leaps and bounds closing the gap between his ability and swans even as swan closed in on giannis and giannis drew fractionally closer to the gifted alessandro there was little else to do sometimes they fenced for three hours drank wine and ate good bread in olive oil and fenced again the janissaries came and watched and wagered one day alessandro paused buckler high and said quietly can your jews cash bessarions bill were running low on money not all jews are moneylenders swan said he shrugged but let me ask he sent simon a note the next day simon sent back that he would be happy to change the note for cash and the janissaries bowed their high hats nodding on their heads you are free to visit anywhere inside the confines of the city walls said murad the corporal the bishop sent word that none of them was to leave the inn alessandro waved him out ill explain he said tell him im on an errand for the cardinal swan said listen tell me the address and ill take a look at the cardinals house alessandro wrote it down for him he went to the jewish quarter first isaac met him inside the gate and walked with him to the house of simon your embassy is very carefully watched he said you know the sultan is contemplating war with venice and the pope swan started isaac went on you franks are the most arrogant creatures on earth do you think that the sultan is fooled by venice he plans to take all greece indeed omar reis who i understand you have met is even now raising the troops to take the duchy of athens and the rest of the morea swan stopped in the narrow alley i know you mean well he said although he wasnt sure of that at all but i am the lowest member of the embassage and i have no idea what you are talking about i am a mere soldier isaac frowned i am informed that you are in fact an agent of cardinal bessarion he met swans eye are you here for the head of saint george he asked swan felt as if he had no ground beneath his feet he couldnt decide how to answer this accusation he wasnt sure why it would be a bad thing to admit to such a status messire i am a poor man who performed an act of friendship for rabbi aaron because he has been kind to me he is my hebrew teacher in venice he paused and looked at isaac to see how this speech was going down you are the friend of young idris the wolf of thraces youngest son you are i understand an english prince come to threaten a crusade against islam isaac all but snarled swan laughed i am no prince of england he said isaac smiled for the first time it was a very small smile but it changed his demeanour and made him seem very much less threatening for such a young man of no apparent power you have quite a few rumours surrounding you he said but balthazar said i should help you at the same time theres so much happening here that im not at all sure that i can help you he paused the turks are ripping the city apart for the head or so they say it may be a pretext some people say the head is in athens and some in corinth and some that it is already in rome some say that the christian princes have a great army and are luring the sultan to his doom it was obvious he had something more to say but they had arrived at simons house isaac bowed i will attempt to see you again let me say englishman if you need to reach me ask any beggar to get a message to king david he nodded and walked off down the alley simon received him like a visiting prince and gave him every centime of three hundred ducats in gold since it was traditional to discount a bill the further it was from its origin swan bowed you are a true friend you came well recommended and in truth sir i will send this bill back to my brother to be changed simon smiled i assume that you will take a packet of letters back to him of course swan answered if we ever leave the sultan seems in no hurry to receive the popes ambassador a few more days he is preparing his armament against the morea he wants the campaign to begin before he receives the bishop it is im afraid the way of the turkish mind to deliver an affront to christendom while receiving christendoms ambassador simon shrugged is the ambassador a man of status is he intelligent swan was about to answer honestly when he perceived that perhaps simon was compromised or perhaps living in constantinople his interests were very different from swans the world was indeed a very complex place and yet at another remove not so very different from the world of his mothers inn he is a famous man in rome swan said as for his intelligence he shrugged hes never said four words to me lying was best done with a tinge of truth uncle dick used to say that and it always seemed appropriate simon nodded a famous man you say he asked swan shrugged even in england i had heard of him he said well that was a lie but hed heard of ostia he took the money bowed agreeably and escaped as soon as he could meeting peter at the gate there was a new man near the gate an arab in a filthy robe whose yellow complexion and turtlelike neck would not have recommended him anywhere his nose was large and pockmarked his eyes were piercing and far too intelligent for the mean clothes he wore swan marked him with a glance and saw him again six streets away emerging from an alley swan walked for an hour and the yellowfaced man was always there not every time he glanced but often enough that although swan walked past the cardinals house and noted it well he didnt pause peter looked at him and he smiled they didnt ask directions all those hours learning the streets with rabbi aaron had had their effect and eventually they walked past another church and swan made a show of being bored in truth he was hot and tired the jewish quarter was a mile from the venetian quarter near the philadephion at the foot of third hill and bessarions house was in the palace quarter the oldest part of the city east of the hippodrome by the bucoleon palace the area was swarming with turkish soldiers filthy ghazis magnificent cavalrymen janissaries as proud as lucifer who were magnificently accoutred in mail plate brigantines yellow leather boots and tall felt hats and yet reminded him of the english archers hed served with in france the cardinals house was like a tall palazzo the portico decorated with original greek columns from one of the ancient temples and the windows edged in marble a mans head was at one of the windows but when swans apparently casual glance swept the building a second time the mans head was gone they walked home the moment they turned south the yellowfaced man was no longer with them but now swan saw the tall thin man from the first days first waiting ahead of them in the street by the hippodrome and then watching them pass and finally trailing along behind them all the way to the gates of the venetian quarter he breathed a sigh of relief as they entered the venetian area peter looked at him trouble he asked we are in over our heads swan said more than usual peter asked i dont even know what the game is much less the stakes swan said he told peter the whole of it down to isaacs comments peter picked his teeth contemplatively its always better to be thought a prince than a beggar he said swan nodded i know but you told him you were a mere soldier swan laughed if you were a visiting nobleman in disguise what would you say he asked peter shook his head im better putting arrows in things he said intrigue makes my head hurt swan stood on the sea wall and looked across the horn at galata somewhere in all of this is a way to make money he said i just have to find the right string and pull he grinned at peter i doubt its a bowstring peter shrugged and continued picking his teeth dont go getting us killed he said master he added as an afterthought the next day idris sent a note inviting swan to drink sherbet and ride swan met the young turkish aristocrat at the gate to the venetian quarter no frank can ride a horse in the city idris said as if it was a matter of no moment he leaned over and handed swan a bag of carefully woven wool the bag itself was beautiful go and change he said behind him were a dozen other turks friends well wait he grinned swan didnt need to be told twice he stepped back into the venetian quarter and laid out the foreign garments baggy trousers of cotton a doublet very like a european doublet but buttoned not laced and a middlelength coat like a jupon he knew that this was called a kaftan as hed enquired this one was of a rich blue wool embroidered with flowers and with buttons of solid silver shaped like pomegranates there was a felt skullcap and a turban alessandro came in while he was changing he wasnt attempting to hide and a number of them shared a room alessandro looked at him it is against the law for a european to dress as a turk he said idris will see me out of any trouble with the law swan said alessandro made a face you are the only one of us getting anything done he admitted see if you can keep the costume when your outing is over he pinned the skullcap against swans head with a dextrous finger and began to wind his turban these were all the rage in venice when i was a boy he said the stirrups were short the saddle virtually nonexistent and the other turks laughed at his attempt to lengthen the leathers a servant a turkish servant slapped his hand away and motioned for him to mount and he did vaulting into the saddle because the stirrup was so high above him he couldnt dream of getting a foot into it once he was up the servant tucked his booted feet into the very light stirrups idris pulled up next to him i have ridden on one of your knights horses he said it is like riding in a sedan chair with us you must actually ride the horse swan was not a great rider life in london offered little scope for riding and his periodic time with his father hadnt offered him any more than a cursory education the small saddle made him uncomfortable and he almost missed the ride out of the city he was so focused on staying on the horse the turks were all superb horsemen and they galloped cantered walked and trotted changing gaits to suit the length of the street and the thickness of the crowd on the other hand the arab mare he was riding was without a doubt the best horse anyone had ever put him up on the horse was small by european standards like a ladys riding horse but she seemed to carry him without effort and she flowed along under his inexperienced seat without offering any protest at one point on a long straight stretch just before the belgrade gate when the other young men were galloping and an old beggar stepped into the road she pivoted neatly under him and then it seemed to him rolled her own hindquarters to keep him in the saddle by the time they had crossed the great walls heading for the farm country to the west he was in love and although there was no one to tell him so he was riding better than hed ever ridden in his life and enjoying it idris was laughing with his friends and servants met them a pair of carts with a dozen hawks and two more young men but after they had reined up and let the carts join them idris came back down the cavalcade to swan do you like her he said pointing with his jewelled crop at the mare i love her idris she is superb swan grinned idris grinned back you english are so honest he said you are like turks you think a thing you say it venetians never tell me this horse is wonderful they are always cautious he looked at the horse to us her colour is not so good that golden coat we call it yellow is he shrugged but she is among the smartest of my horses he leaned over i beg you to accept her he frowned or anything else you see that you want swan laughed if only you knew he thought i love the kaftan he said idris nodded all that is yours you cannot ride without it indeed all of your guards know now that we are friends if you are found in these clothes he smiled again call for me you are very like a prince i find swan said idris shook his head now you sound like a venetian he said flatterer listen of all my friends none speaks italian so none of these men can speak with you but all know that you saved my life the other young men bowed from their saddles or saluted with their riding whips as they were introduced a long string of turkish names that even swan had trouble understanding much less remembering swans training as a royal page came in handy he understood intimately that idris was the great man here and that he couldnt monopolise him so he bowed to the various suleymans murids and bazayets and smiled at all of them and occupied himself riding idris rode superbly of course he took a hawk on his wrist and offered another to swan who had to profess complete ignorance another time ill teach you he said he looked grave see you at lunch and he was off he loosed his bird at a series of ground targets and swan felt this was vaguely at odds with english practice but then the prince sent his largest bird into the air after something that was a speck above them and then the whole cavalcade galloped away across the fields of the greek farms that ringed the fallen city swan reined his little mare in and stayed with the carts he noted that the two men whod joined with the carts also obviously gentlemen in that they had rich kaftans and jewels in their turbans both stayed with the wagons the nearer young man a boy really flashed a smile at him and he bowed in the saddle his mare misinterpreted the shift in his weight forward and went directly to a gallop stretching away over the fields to the south towards the sea it might have been exhilarating except that at the very moment when the horse exploded into motion swans foot slipped out of his left stirrup he sat down hard and tried with increasing panic to find the stirrup under his left foot the little mare turned in a very tight circle to the left and suddenly he hit the ground he lay there and his shoulder hurt and he felt like a fool his mare came and stood by him after a moment he heard hoofbeats and suddenly one of the boys was there he dismounted from a dead gallop actually running alongside his horse for two or three paces and flung himself down by swan are you alive the turk asked in a lilting italian swan looked up into the turks eyes eyes with smudges of kohl around the thick lashes wideset deep brown eyes above a slender arching nose and a heavy sensual mouth you are not a boy swan said oh my neck hurts she laughed goodnaturedly how kind of you to notice she said are you unbroken he sat up the second boy was riding towards them it is how do you italians say this a polite fiction that i am a boy today yes swan rotated his head from side to side a fiction i will endeavour to maintain demoiselle he said gallantly her very palpable presence at his side her hand on his arm reminded him that he hadnt talked to a woman in two weeks the siege had emptied the great city of women there werent even prostitutes in the venetian quarter she put a strong hand in his hand and hauled him to his feet his horse was two steps away and he mounted as efficiently as he could manage he knew he looked like a fool to the turks he couldnt help it my brother has given you this mare she said khatun bengül shouted the second boy in arabic shush the turkish woman said i am salim you touched him he was on the ground and needed help and now he knows you are a woman you shouted my name across the world he is a frank they are as stupid as cattle the second woman was ten years older than khatun bengül and several inches shorter under her mantle and turban swan judged her to be every bit as attractive with beautiful eyes and high cheeks khatun bengül however had a translucent skin that swan had seldom seen hers was the colour of oak newly split not white but like slightly aged ivory and her brows were black and strong he was staring now he will be besotted with you you little witch the older woman laughed he does not seem very stupid auntie khatun bengül said bah all franks are stupid ive owned dozens look at him he cant even ride properly the older woman gave him the onceover handsome though look at those lips the two women tittered together swan who had laboured for months at arabic had a sudden love for the language that no amount of rabbi aarons teaching could ever give him i like his hands khatun bengül said perhaps we might ride back to the carts swan said in italian khatun bengül nodded but he rides like a sack of camel shit really what do they teach frankish boys auntie asked the falconers returned an hour later and they ate a sumptuous picnic of mutton with a dozen sweet things and some spices that swan loved and chicken they all drank an odd salty drink that swan disliked at first taste but grew used to with practice what is it he asked idris the drink idris asked its just milk hmm and some salt and spice and water he shrugged theres a word i dont know in italian when milk isnt milk any more cheese swan asked idris shook his head after lunch the falconing party rode off again leaving swan with the servants he didnt mind he rode his mare into the fields going more slowly then faster changing gaits learning to ride he was resting drinking more of the salty drink from a glass bottle provided by a servant when he heard the auntie shriek you cannot you hussy your father would burst himself hell gut me and you khatun bengül if that was her name appeared around the wagon riding as if she was a satyress the image came quite spontaneously to swan there was something erotic in the way she rode you do not fly the falcons she said in her curious and to him very beautiful italian i do not know falconry he said smiling his most ingratiating smile i could teach you a little she said we are not expected to gallop over fields but i was going to fly my birds her aunt rode around the side of the wagon look at him he knows you are a woman its written all over him said auntie in arabic listen my little filly i was young once too you are a coarse old woman khatun bengül spat i want to teach him to fly a bird auntie said something in turkish khatun bengül flushed swan would have given a year of his life to know what had been said he turned the sounds over in his head one of his special skills and the reason he could learn languages so very fast as fast as the two women could spit at each other he processed the syllables he had no idea what they meant but he would auntie seemed to be backing down if you would care to ride with us khatun bengül said my auntie will keep a very careful watch on us she spat the words dont think i cant understand when you talk love words to the dirty frank said the auntie khatun bengül flushed red this is italian she said nothing to do with love however despite their inauspicious beginning the next hour was a pleasure khatun bengül flew her two small birds with expertise gossiping in arabic and turkish with her aunt on the one hand and coaching swan to fly a gyrfalcon on the other in italian and when the gyrfalcon tired of his inept hand motions bated and then slipped his jesses and flew into an oak tree the women laughed and swan laughed and when he dismounted stripped out of his kaftan and climbed the tree successfully retrieving the bird the two women clapped their hands together as if he were a conjuror he really is handsome auntie said pity he isnt a slave that took the wind out of swans sails auntie was looking at him with the sort of appraisal with which older women had been examining him since he had turned fourteen and ordinarily hed have arranged but he couldnt take his eyes off khatun bengül perhaps fortunately for all of them idris returned shortly after the adventure of the gyrfalcon and the tree he clapped swan on the back i see you have learned the first lesson of falconry how to retrieve a lost bird he said you have done this before one of the boys is teaching me swan said idris laughed and slapped his thigh my father will indeed have us all killed he laughed you know shes my sister eh swan sighed yes he admitted and a force of nature idris acknowledged they had turned their horses towards home most of the turks had mounted a second horse she was very courteous to me swan said idris laughed his head thrown back she makes boys bark at the moon he said ah my englishman do not cast languishing glances on my sister she spits on the men who worship her he took a flask out of his kaftan drank and handed it to swan who drank greek wine sweet and strong all the good persian poets were drunks idris said im working on it he smiled of course holy koran forbids it or so my imam insists later after they had passed the belgrade gate idris said listen i owe you my life but you must never mention that my sister was here today when i saw her never mind i will swear swan promised its a hard life for her idris said in thrace when my father is commanding an army she rides like a man shoots a bow sleeps on the ground it is how we were raised my mother she was a tribal woman you know swan didnt know but he nodded owned her own horses owns farms in anatolia so we were raised to the saddle and in this cursed city poor khatun bengül must pretend to be a good girl a nice girl who stays at home and has slaves take money to the poor who never shows her face who never rides a horse idris shrugged we dont always get along khatun bengül leaned in from swans other side he uses me to protect him from father she said swan looked at her when he breathed in he tasted her scent over the smell of flowers and grass and horse she uses me to protect her from father too idris said i am a nice girl khatun bengül protested i just like to ride she shrugged and i can do anything a man can do better men are all fools she tossed her head behind them all of idriss friends were watching her swan took a deep steadying breath yes he admitted every one of us sufia will be in our stables but available for you at any hour idris said they rode past the great aqueduct through the forum of constantine and past the north end of the hippodrome to the great houses beyond hagia sophia swan breathed a sigh of relief when his horse was not stabled in the great cathedral sacrilege had its limits they rode into the palace quarter and dismounted in the courtyard of a fine square of buildings workmen were facing the front of the stables with beautiful fired tiles in a rich blue with the trailing cursive of persian script less than a hundred paces away a tall minaret was being built on to a low byzantine church swan handed his horse to a pair of slaves he put a hand familiarly on idriss arm you have your friends he said i should go idris bowed you are a good guest will you come riding again swan smiled my lord the bishop will probably give birth to a cow when he hears that i spent the day with infidels idris laughed tell him my father will have his guts ripped out of his fat stomach if he stops you idris meant these words as a joke but they chilled swan idris leaned closer listen you know this is all a sham dont you in the spring my father will lead an army into the morea and we will take everything venice has its not even a secret swan struggled to maintain his composure dont let it come between us idris said he smiled i treasure you come ride with me again tomorrow swan bowed low ill try he was pleased when several of idriss friends offered him casual salutes as if he was a person others remained studiously aloof he turned and crossed the courtyard but auntie blocked his route with her pony she smiled at him he smiled back at her it was his habit to smile at any pretty woman who smiled at him shed like to have you in her bed khatun bengül said but she doesnt know how to ask swan seldom at a loss for words had none for this situation khatun bengül laughed you flush like a girl she said will you come and fly a bird with us another time swan bowed perhaps if my duties allow the company was divine divine khatun bengül tittered now from one of these young men that would be blasphemy swan wasnt sure whether hed scored or not so he smiled bowed again and walked out the gate despite feeling utterly smitten he walked straight into the alley that separated omar reiss palazzo from the next magnificent structure and walked south he was disappointed that his sense of direction had failed him he didnt emerge into the street on which bessarions house was situated he looked behind him and at the crossstreet he didnt see any sign of yellow face or tall man as he had christened them so he followed the next alley south there was bessarions house it rose three stories above the street and was surrounded by a high wall there were outbuildings a stable a slave or servant quarters and perhaps a workshop he walked all the way around the compound the gates were locked there were beggars living in the arch of the front gate he paused effendi said one woman do not harm us do you speak greek he asked in that language all of their faces brightened there were four of them filthy but well enough fed he imagined whose house is this he asked the old woman shrugged some dead frank she said no infidel lives here he asked they looked fearful has a turk taken the house he insisted he was dressed as a turk the word infidel could go either way none yet in this street the old woman said she was obviously concealing something he dug into his kaftan and produced a silver byzant of some value or other the turks hadnt produced a coinage yet and byzantine coins were notoriously debased but it must have some value he tossed it to the old woman how can i get in he asked she looked at the coin i can come back with janissaries he said she looked terrified effendi we live in this gate you may continue for all i care he said we know how to open the gate she said he produced another coin but it was all taking too long and it was late afternoon and the turks were hurrying to the little mosque for prayers and suddenly the onceempty street was full perhaps another day he said turned on his heel and walked away something felt wrong he didnt know what but something felt wrong he walked all the way to the venetian quarter he was afraid that hed be stopped because of his turkish dress but no one stopped him in fact a janissary in the street saluted him it was almost dark by the time he reached the venetian quarter he sat in a tavern with giannis alessandro and cesare and related the events of the day he left khatun bengül out of it when he spoke of the spring campaign against venice alessandro swore i heard the same from some of the jews swan said alessandro shook his head foscari is so focused on the war in italy hes forgotten the turks and how perfidious they are giannis agreed swan took a drink of wine they seem fairly straightforward to me he wanted to say compared to italians but he knew the audience was wrong alessandro sighed if only the bishop were not a complete fool he said i feel i cannot share this with him giannis scratched at his hairline i could perhaps rent a boat go to galata and inform ser marco he shrugged but i couldnt come back surely they know asked swan let me speak on behalf of my beloved signoria alessandro said we are a nation of sea merchants most of whom would sell their mothers as whores to make a profit money and the search for money has its own blindness and its own pitiable lack of scruple if a venetian thinks he can make a profit he shook his head perhaps some know but conceal the knowledge perhaps others close their minds to the news he shrugged perhaps it is inconvenient he said giannis spat carefully in the morea we say that the difference between a turk and a venetian is that at least the turk believes in something he said blessed virgin swan said you must go alessandro said i cannot my absence would be obvious swan would be missed by his turkish friends and so far hes the only one of us to see the cardinals house giannis finished his wine ill be in galata before the sun rises he said its after curfew alessandro said give me your turkish clothes giannis said swan thought for a moment i love that kaftan he said but giannis who hated everything turkish assumed he was kidding at nightfall the janissary at the gate sent for swan when he presented himself the janissary bowed and handed him an ornate parchment a firman a pass signed in persian script for thomas swan prince of britain at daybreak an african servant handed a note into the venetian quarter asking swan to come for a ride in the countryside the note was unsigned on the back in neat italian it said come in secret swan smiled to himself cover me with the bishop he asked alessandro alessandro nodded if i didnt know better id say there was a woman involved swan wondered how it was that this foppish italian could read his mind no he said lying however being besotted with khatun bengül whose deep brownblack eyes had occurred in every dream he could remember from the night before didnt prevent swan from leaving the venetian quarter with all the care his youth had taught him first he no longer had turkish clothes secondly he didnt want his watchers yellow face and tall man to see him at idriss palazzo once they had followed him there they would watch the place it was early he was in european clothes and he took a dagger under his doublet then before the side streets were full of vegetable stalls he climbed up on the wall that separated the venetian quarter from the amalfian quarter and without too much thought jumped down inside he walked across the amalfian quarter drew some cautious stares and duplicated his efforts jumping on to an awning in the pisan quarter and receiving a torrent of abuse from a young man with a florentine accent he mollified the man by buying an apple the pisans as hed noticed a few days before had a tower by their gate he climbed the tower empty at this hour and looked down into the busy square outside the european quarter he didnt recognise anyone outside the gate he passed the pisan sentry without being challenged and walked rapidly towards the hippodrome he passed the severan wall at the first gate and breathed a sigh of relief the two janissaries at the gate looked at him carefully but let him go east of the wall he followed the broad main thoroughfare towards the magnificent bulk of hagia sophia he couldnt see whether he was followed but the great avenue was packed with early morning traffic to the market north of the hippodrome and he slipped from cart to cart trying to be both invisible and normal he was the only man on the street in european dress but he didnt regret it he didnt believe he wore the turkish dress well enough and didnt want to give anyone an excuse to arrest him his intention was simple to use idriss morning ride to cover a visit to bessarions palazzo the groundwork was laid he had a dagger and a purse with twenty ducats to buy the cooperation of whomever he found on the premises and he was going to see khatun bengül he was sure of it he hoped well it seemed possible shed sent the note idris after all came in person a regiment of janissaries was forming on the open ground south of the hippodrome as well as sipahis the elite cavalry of the ottomans he was pleased to note that few of the sipahis had a horse as pretty as his mare he thought of her as his own he made his way through the crowd feeling safer and walked south around the cathedral and the patriachate to come on omar reiss palazzo from the east for safety he was as cautious as youth and love could make him but he didnt see the two faces he dreaded nor would he have said that hed spotted any figure turkish or greek out of place or two places well separated in time the great gate of omar reiss palazzo was shut but as he approached he saw the african from the sunrise visit beckon from a postern gate he walked along the wall took one last look over his shoulder and ducked through the ironstudded door something heavy struck his head and he was he came to with a soft hand over his mouth you hit him too hard said a firm voice in arabic no mistress said another voice a womans hand ran down his shoulder to his arm and then his chest which was bare what a fine slave he will make said auntie
