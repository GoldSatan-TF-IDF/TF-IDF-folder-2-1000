mark chadbourn the devils lookingglass go soul the bodys guest upon a thankless errand fear not to touch the best the truth shall be thy warrant go since i needs must die and give the world the lie sir walter raleigh the lie prologue the merciless sun boiled in a silver sky waves of heat shimmered across the seething main deck of the becalmed galleon where the seven sailors knelt heads bowed as blood dripped from their noses on to their sweatsodden undershirts they muttered prayers in spanish their strained voices struggling to rise above the creaking of the hull timbers flexing against the green swell harsh light glinted off the long curved blades pressed against each of their necks at the sailors backs the grey men waited in silence ghosts they seemed at times not there but there their bonewhite faces wreathed in shadow despite the unremitting glare oblivious of the sweltering heat they wore grey leather bucklers thick woollen breeches and boots all silvermildewed and reeking of rot as still as statues they were drawing out the agony of the whimpering men before the swords would sweep down captain juan martinez de serrano knelt on the forecastle watching the row of seamen from under heavy brows even now he could not bring himself to look into the terrible faces of the ones who had boarded his vessel aft the grey sails of the other galleon billowed and the rigging cracked although there was no wind and had not been for three days serrano lowered his head in desolation how foolish they had been though they knew the devils of the unseelie court were like wolves the lure of gold was too great the captain cast his mind back to that night ten days gone when his men had staggered out of the forest with their stolen hoard barely could they believe they had escaped with their lives and their laughter had rung out across the waves as they filled the hold and dreamed of the glory that would be lavished upon them by king philip in madrid they had set sail with a fair wind and all had seemed well until the grey sails appeared on the horizon drawing closer by the hour the steel bit into his neck and he winced they should have known better now save for the last eight of them blood soaked into the boards of the quarterdeck where they lay each one slaughtered within moments though they were among the fiercest fighters upon the spanish main a rhythmic rattling stirred him raising his eyes once more he watched a strange figure approach the sound came from trinkets and the skulls of mice and birds braided into long gold and silverstreaked hair hollow cheeks and dark rings under his eyes transformed his features into a deathshead he wore greygreen robes covered with unrecognizable symbols outlined in a tracing of gold that glistered in the midday sun like one of the gypsy conjurers who performed at the fair in seville sweeping out his right arm he addressed serrano in a voice like cracking ice you are honoured our king serrano swallowed he sensed the new arrival before he saw him in a weight building behind his eyes and a queasy churn in his stomach he closed his eyes how long would this torment continue a steady tread crossed the main deck and came to a halt in front of him silence followed when he had mouthed a prayer the captain squinted a pair of grey boots fell into view and the furlined edge of a shimmering white cloak he heaved his shaking head up following that pristine cloth until he reached the head of the one who looked down on him but the brutal sun hung behind the figure and the features were lost serrano was glad of that i am mandraxas of the high family and until my sister is brought back to the land of peace i hold the golden throne the voice sang like the wind in the high branches serrano could not believe it was the voice of a cruel man until he remembered that this was not a man at all but a creature with no understanding of compassion or gentleness or the kindnesses that tied mortals together who are you the captain muttered his response his mouth so dry he could barely form words your name means nothing the king replied who are you who dares to trespass on our land and steal our gold who thinks you are our equal when serrano failed to reply mandraxas continued you were damned the moment you insulted us with your arrogance let deortha show you what you truly are to us he waved a languid hand towards the main deck where the robed intruder waited the robed one nodded the skulls clacking in his hair and the nearest swordsman whipped his blade into the air and plunged it into the sailor who knelt in front of him serrano cried out as the seaman pitched forward across the sandy boards deortha knelt beside the unmoving form his lips and hands moving in harmony and a moment later the slain sailor twitched jerked and with a long shudder clawed his way upright he swayed as if the ship rolled in a stormy sea his dead eyes staring por dios serrano exclaimed sickened meat and bones mandraxas said no wits remain and so these juddering things are of little use to us apart from performing the most mundane tasks he waved a fluttering hand towards deortha over the side with it he called let it spend eternity beneath the waves the captain screwed up his eyes at the splash silently cursing the terrible judgement that had doomed them all let this be done with he growled in his own language mandraxas appeared to understand there will be no ending for any of you here he said in a voice laced with cold humour you all of you will join your companion with the fishes never sleeping never dreaming seeing only endless blue but never understanding his words rang out so that all the sailors heard him but for the rest of your kind their ending is almost upon them listen can you hear the beat of us marching to war listen a sword plunged down a body crashed upon the deck and another and another the steady rhythm moving inexorably towards serrano he sobbed it was too late for him too late for all mankind if the cold fury of these fiends was finally unleashed in england now the final act unfolds mandraxas said above the beat of falling bodies and so your world winds down to dust serrano looked up as the shadow fell across him chapter one bedlam ruled in the eight bells inn tranquillity was for landmen who sat by warm firesides in winter and took to their beds early not for those who braved seas as high and as hard as the towers stone walls here was life like the ocean fierce and loud and dangerous delirious with drink two wildbearded sailors lurched across the rushes thrashing mad music from fiddle and pipe with shrieks of laughter the pockmarked girls from the rooms upstairs whirled around in each others arms their breasts bared above their threadbare dresses the rolling seashanty crashed against the barks of the drunken men clustered in the shadowy room in hazy candlelight they hunched over winestained tables or squatted against whitewashed walls swearing and fighting and gambling at cards ale sloshed from wooden cups on to the boards and the air reeked of tallow and candlesmoke sweat and sour beer the raucous voices sounded lustful but underneath the discourse odd melancholic notes seemed to suggest men clinging on to life before they returned to the harsh seas when the door rattled open to admit a blast of salty night air the din never stilled and no eyes turned towards the stranger he was wrapped in a grey woollen cloak his features partially hidden beneath the wide brim of a felt hat behind him across the gleaming cobbles of the liverpool quayside a carrack strained at its moorings ready for sail at dawn the creak of rigging merged with the lapping of the tide the new arrival closed the door behind him and demanded a mug of ale from the innkeepers trestle a seat in one of the shadowy corners called to him away from the candlelight where he could watch and listen unnoticed if they had not been addled by drink some of the seamen might have recognized the strong face from the pamphlets the closeclipped beard and black hair curling to the nape of the neck the dark eyes the colour of rapier steel will swyfte was a spy englands greatest spy so those pamphlets called him the bane of the spanish dogs only the highest in the land knew his reputation was carefully constructed for a country in need of heroes to keep the sleep of goodly men and women free from nightmares of spanish invaders and catholic plotters and other darker things too swyfte cared little he did his dark work for queen and country without complaint but kept his own machinations close he sipped his drink and waited as the reel of the shanty ebbed and flowed he caught snatches of slurred conversation tall tales of haunted galleons and the clutching hands of dead sailors of cities of gold hidden in the lush forests of the new world of a misty island that came and went as if it were alive of golden lights glimmering far out across the waves and far down in the black deeps through the eyes of the sailors the world was a far stranger place than their landlocked fellows believed and will swyfte knew the seadogs were correct they had sailed to the dark shores of life where the truth lived and had paid a price for their wisdom the spy noted the leather patches over missing eyes the lost legs and hands the scars that drew maps of the world across their skin he felt a kinship like him they were cut off from the peace and order that most experienced although his own wounds were not so easily seen he thought back more than a week to nonsuch palace a days ride to the southwest from londons fetid streets while the queen recovered her strength in her bed under the observance of the royal physician turmoil reigned throughout the grand building servants scoured the chambers and searched the grounds the privy council had been cloistered in the meeting room for more than an hour when the knock had come at wills chamber door his assistant nathaniel colt had been waiting on the threshold flushed from running through corridors warmed by the late autumn sun his dark green doublet was stained with sweat under the armpits and his brown hair lay slick against his head sir robert sent word from the privy council meeting to summon you to his chambers he gasped there was fear in his eyes and his voice wavered is this it then will invasion our enemies are marching towards us the spy hid his true thoughts with a grin nat you worry like an old maid do you see me rushing to arms enemies yes but not the ones nat feared not the spanish nor their popish agitators no he meant the true enemy those who lived by night and treated men as men did cattle i do not see you rushing to a flask of sack and that worries me more will rested a reassuring hand on the young mans shoulder england lurches from crisis to crisis as always but we stand firm and we abide this will pass his words seemed to reassure nat a little will left him resting by the open window and made his way through the noisy palace lucky nat who slept well at night he saw only glimpses of the greater war will sheltered him from the worst horrors for the sake of his wits and would continue to do so while there was breath left in him the spymasters door was hanging open when will arrived fresh from the privy council meeting sir robert cecil was firing orders at a clutch of scribes and assistants as he marched around the chamber the queen called him her little elf because of his small stature and his hunched back but his sharp wits and cunning were more than a match for any other man at court he had a feel for the games of high office and his ruthlessness made him both feared and powerful when the blackgowned secretary saw will he dismissed the bustling aides and closed the door gather your men he snapped feigning calm with a lazy wave of his hand you ride north today in search of dr dee you know his whereabouts a carriage was seen travelling along the great north road i received word back this morning that it has taken a turn towards liverpool you are sure yes unable to contain the apprehension he felt the spymaster turned away to calm himself dr dee was seen in the company of that irish whore red meg oshee they must be stopped before she spirits him away to her homeland if they reach that land of bogs and mists we will never see dee again and then england will fall will completed the unspoken thought dee was the architect of the countrys defences he worked his magics to keep at bay the supernatural forces that had tormented england for as long as men had walked the green fields and the irish chieftains had long envied that protection they had suffered long and hard under the torments of the fair folk but whatever wall dee had constructed around england with his ancient words of power and candles and circles had been crumbling dee was the only man who could repair those defences without him the night would sweep in the threat is greater than you know cecil bowed his head for a moment choosing his words carefully the mad alchemist has in his possession an object of great power for years he denied all knowledge of it but shortly before he was spirited away he confided in me that he had used it to commune with angels angels will laughed i have heard those tales but dee is most definitely not on their side this is a grave matter the spymaster snapped a twitching hand leaping to his flushed brow should this object fall into the hands of our enemies there will be no laughter will poured himself a cup of romney from a jug on a trestle table littered with charts and documents then tell me the nature of this threat it is a looking glass the spy peered over the rim of his cup saying nothing no ordinary glass this an obsidian mirror supposedly shaped by sorcerers of an ageold race who once inhabited the impenetrable forests of the new world will furrowed his brow he remembered dee showing him this mundanelooking object at his chamber in christs college in manchester where he had no doubt been tormenting the poor brothers brought back to europe in a spanish hoard cecils eyes narrowed legend says it could set the world afire if one only knew how to unlock its secrets the spy drained his cup very well i will take john carpenter the earl of launceston and our new recruit young tobias strangewayes we will ride hard but red meg has a good start on us the spymaster narrowed his eyes you allowed mistress oshee into your circle you trusted her though you knew she was a spy i would not use that word tolerated perhaps i understood her nature sir and i am no fool is that correct i heard that you were more than associates i need assurances that this woman has not bewitched your heart or your prick if that were so i would despatch another to bring her back there is no one better you have never been shy in trumpeting your own achievements master swyfte sir robert said with pursed lips nevertheless i would rather send a lesser man i can trust to succeed in this most important nay utterly vital work than one who will be led by lust to a disaster that will damn us all to hell i am no fool will repeated setting aside his own uncertainty regarding his feelings for the irish spy there is too much at stake here for such distractions i am pleased to hear you say it the spymaster ran the goldringed fingers of his right hand across his furrowed brow if dee leaves our protected shores he will be prey for the unseelie court and the repercussions of that are something i dare not countenance will left the cold chamber with fire in his heart within the hour he and his men were riding north as hard as their steeds could bear red meg would expect him to be on her trail she was as sly a vixen as he had ever known and she would not make it easy to recover dee he had seen her kill without conscience even the affection she felt for him would not stand in the way of her carrying such a great prize back to her homeland braying laughter jolted will back to the eight bells the musicians had put away their instruments and were swigging malmsey wine in great gulps the girls flopped into laps or draped themselves over shoulders in search of the nights earnings arguments sparked punches were thrown dees knowledge was dangerous and he needed to be returned to london at all costs that was certain but the alchemist revelled in misdirection and illusion the spy knew was this mirror truly the threat cecil feared or in this time of uncertainty had the spymaster simply given in to superstition and fear will shrugged the world was filled with worries and the truth would present itself sooner or later once he had drained his ale he selected his subject a balding seaman with windchapped cheeks and a scrub of white hairs across his chin nursing a mug the man leaned against the wall next to the stone hearth eyeing the flames with the wistful look of someone who knew it was a sight hed not see again for long weeks he looked drunk enough for his guard to be low but not so inebriated that he could not provide useful information keeping the brim of his hat down the spy demanded another drink and walked over will rested one spanish leather boot on the hearth and watched the fire for a moment before he said i have never met a man of the sea who was not interested in adding to his purse are you that rare creature depends what you need doing the man slurred all i require are words the sailors gaze flickered over will he seemed untroubled by what he saw ask your questions i seek news of two new arrivals in liverpool who may be requiring passage to ireland a woman with hair as fiery as her nature and a tongue that cuts sharper than any dagger and a man the spy paused how to describe dr dee in a way that would do the magician justice white hair blazing eyes a fierce temper and a slippery grip on the world we all enjoy he may have been wearing a coat of animal pelts i have heard tell of them an abraham man mad as a starved dog accompanied by his daughter the sailor grunted the woman cut off the ear of black jack larch so i was told his only crime was to lay a hand upon her arm and ask for a piece of the comfort she promised that would be red meg the seaman smacked his lips watching wills hand the spy unfolded his fingers to reveal a palmful of pennies snatching the coins the man continued they bought passage to ireland on the eagle sailing at dawn wait at the quayside and you will see them i would prefer to surprise them before sunrise where do they stay the woman took black jacks shell outside moll higginss rooming house you could do worse than to seek them there you have earned yourself another drink go lightly on the waves will gave a faint bow of the head and turned towards the door he found his way blocked by three men hands hanging close to their weapons what ave we ere then a customs man come to spy on us the middle one growled his left eye was milky a jagged scar running from the corner to his jaw he wore an emerald cap and his voice had the bark of authority a first mate perhaps will thought why you are good honest seamen i could find no rogues or smugglers here will replied his tone as laconic as his gaze was sharp step aside my business here is done and i will disturb your drinking no more he knew any sign of weakness would only encourage the drunken men further the sailors one good eye flickered from left to right and in an instant strong hands gripped wills arms someone tore off his hat the sailor whisked a dagger from the folds of his dirty linen shirt and pressed the tip under the spys chin forcing his head up a blast of alesour breath washed over will as the man searched his features silence fell across the rest of the inn the other drinkers crowded round one of the women leaned in her eyes narrowing i know im she said in a broad accent thats will swyfte that is englands greatest spy a lascivious smile sprang to her lips i would see the length of your sword chuck later in the privacy of your chamber perhaps let us not point up how dull are the blades of these fine men he held her gaze and her smile broadened the great will swyfte the oneeyed man mocked the dewyeyed women and the witless fieldworkers might be easily dazzled by your exploits but here you are just another sharp nose poking into our business your business concerns me less than the contents of your privy i am troubled by greater matters the security of this realm stick im now well dump him in the drink and no onell be the wiser another sailor said let im walk out and well be swarming with tax collectors like rats on the bilge deck wills dark eyes flickered over the leering grizzled faces pressing all round him he had been here before too many times and whether he was looking into the eyes of spanish pikemen or kentish cutthroats he knew the signs there was no point in further talk wrenching his shoulders back he unbalanced the two men gripping his arms with one sharp thrust he planted a boot in the gut of the sailor wielding the knife the milkyeyed seaman doubled over with a forced exhalation will saw that the drunken sailors were taken by surprise by the suddenness of his movement and smiled sober they would be a formidable army of cutthroats soaked in ale they wheeled around like small children tearing his arms free the spy lashed one foot under a threelegged stool and heaved it into the face of his former captor bone shattered blood sprayed a roar rang up to the rafters squealing whores ran for the rickety stairs at the back of the inn the seamen drew daggers and hooks each weapon glinting in the candlelight the men surged forward will felt the familiar heartrush he drew his rapier enjoying the familiar feel and weight in his hand with one bound he leapt from a bench to the innkeepers cluttered trestle cups flew coin jangled on to the boards who will be the first to feel the bite of my blade he called kicking the barrel the wooden tap burst free the honeycoloured ale gushing out the keg spun off the table and into the path of the onrushing seamen the spy felt no desire to kill any of these rogues he wished to save his steel for more deserving blood but they swarmed around him like angry bees eager to sting him to death it was as he searched for a route past them that the flagstones began to vibrate as though the trestle were being dragged over cobbles the sailors came to a sudden halt eyeing each other with unease across the inn the candle flames sputtered and shuddered as one shadows swooped breath clouded as a winter chill descended the sailors murmured casting anxious glances all around one by one they put away their weapons through the small square windowpanes distorted lanternlight danced in an unnatural manner from the carrack a moment later the door crashed open the master of the quay lurched into the space his hat askew his face drained of blood take up your weapons and any light you can find he croaked the devil has come with the fog chapter two the thick fog muffled even the creaking of the sign above the entrance to the inn nothing of the quayside was visible nor any of the lights of liverpool beyond never had will known such a dense mist to sweep in so quickly in the time it had taken him to push his way past the quay master and find a hiding place outside the grey folds had billowed in from the west consuming all in their path he crouched behind the danksmelling rain butt at the edge of the stone frontage watching the sailors flood out of the inn and clatter across the cobbles with pitchsoaked brands to light their way the fog swallowed them in an instant distorted calls and responses floated back before they too were lost they were simple men easily frightened by things beyond their understanding but will suspected that whatever it was that accompanied the unnatural mist would dwarf their present fears moisture dripped from the inn sign an angry cry rang out from near the waters edge a dull querying rejoinder from somewhere further afield the splintering of breaking wood odd sounds incomprehensible in their muted isolation will waited his fingers clenched round the hilt of his rapier he sensed the strangers long before he saw them his head throbbed his stomach churned blood bubbled around his left nostril familiar signs all of them they were coming those foul things that had thrown his entire life off its course cold anger burned in his chest as his thoughts took him back from that misty autumn night to the hot summer day in warwickshire that he could never escape jenny was there then as she was always in his heart waving to him across the cornfield her dress the pure blue of forgetmenots brown hair tied back with a matching ribbon one moment frozen for ever along with all the promises of shared summers yet to come in the blink of an eye she had vanished no trace remained behind no path through the corn to show where she had gone no footprints no body gone as if she had been whisked up to heaven by a choir of angels will peered round the water butt at the figures emerging from the folds of grey no it was these devils who had stolen jenny away he knew now for what reason he had no idea and the mystery of it still sickened him but never would he give up hope that she was still alive whatever his friends said over the years he had learned enough to convince himself that she did still live that she was a prisoner somewhere perhaps across the sea in the new world where men said the unseelie court made their home everything he did every battle he fought every sacrifice he made was to find some way to bring jenny home she was all that mattered not his life and not though he would never give voice to it in public his queen or country four figures swooped forward with nearsilent tread at first almost as insubstantial as the fog that enshrouded them but when a sailor sprawled across the glistening cobbles they appeared to coalesce and take on flesh and bone dread crept across the still quayside despite himself will felt the hairs on the back of his neck prickle here they were the sum of all human fears since the days of the flood the grey men the fair folk the fay their names seemed endless a way for mortals to skirt around the essential horror that lay at their heart three were swathed in grey cloaks and hoods cold faces as pale as the first snows of winter and eyes black as coals the fourth was the leader will was certain he sported a beard and moustache waxed into points and his black hair was long and sleek his eyes were lost to shadow but hard lines edged his mouth and when he smiled he revealed sharp teeth my name is lansing he murmured looming over the fallen figure others are the wits of the high family or the cunning i am the blade and he whispered into the terrified mans ear whispered words that were poisonous and corrupt words that piled horror upon horror words that would drive a man mad will clenched his fingers round his swordhilt tighter still so that his knuckles grew white he wished he could drive his blade into fay flesh to ease his anger though he knew he could never defeat four of them when the sailor curled on the cobbles whimpered the spy recognized the balding man hed talked to at the eight bells at the same time he heard the fay lord say tell me now while you can where i will find this man the sorcerer john dee once we have him there will be an end to this long strife and you will know peace all of you will cursed under his breath the words were comforting their true meaning deeply disturbing if the unseelie court hunted the alchemist so brazenly then the matter was more grave than he had been led to believe he could not afford to allow the hidden enemy to reach dee ahead of him for then he would have seen the last of elizabeths conjurer and most likely the last of england as lansing continued to question his prisoner will lifted down the iron lantern beside the inn door and wrapped his cloak around it to shield the moving light he crept along the wall to the cover of the mounds of bales and spicescented boxes that had been unloaded before sunset running feet echoed close by orange light flared across the wall above his head and he dropped to his haunches just in time he could smell the acrid pitchsmoke and hear the sputtering of the brand three drunken sailors argued about what devils were loose in liverpool they would find out soon enough will thought sneaking to where he could hear water lapping in the shadow of the great vessels at anchor he used his nose to find the reeking barrel of pitch the shipwrights used to seal the hulls he heaved the heavy butt on to its side and flung the lantern into the slopping contents as the pitch ignited and the flames roared out he rolled the barrel hard the blazing keg hurtled across the quayside to where the fay were cloaked by the fog cries of alarm rang out along the waters edge blazing brands flickered in the dense bank of grey cloud like fireflies on the wing circling back to where the burning barrel painted the fog orange the unseelie court worked their cruelties best in the shadows no doubt they would melt away long before the fearfilled sailors discovered them but had he done enough to disrupt their interrogation before they discovered dees whereabouts as the tumult swept towards the crackling fire will raced into the rats nest of narrow streets leading away from the dock the ghost of the unseelie court still lingered a cold breath on the neck in a midnight churchyard the town was dark but his mood was darker still chapter three liverpool tumbled away down the hillside towards the river merse where the thick fog bank held its breath waiting yet above the town the night was clear the everton beacon stark against the starry sky moonlight limned the bluetiled rooftops candle flames glowed in diamondpane windows here was life grubby and bloody and loud down on james street not far from the black bulk of the old castle packs of sailors roamed like dogs from stew to tavern lured by the fresh meat calls of the competing whores displaying their breasts in the lamplit doorways snarls and snapping punctuated the drunken laughter bruised knuckles crashed against jaws as rivals brawled rolling among the contents of emptied chamberpots to the baying of their yellowtoothed fellows liverpool stank of brine and cesspits and smoke one desperate doxy keen to earn her bed for the night ventured into the shadowed alley where she had glimpsed three men lurking from the gloom john carpenter watched her approach pulling down the front of her dirty emerald dress the rougesmeared woman put on a seductive smile come hither lads she called hands on hips the comfort of these thighs will give you sweet dreams when youre tossing away on the waves when she saw one of the men step from the enveloping dark she breathed a relieved sigh carpenter knew her thoughts a few moments of grunting was a small price to pay for a good nights rest and the wellcut grey doublet and grey woollen cloak free of stains and wear suggested a gentleman no less then a shaft of light from the lantern over the door of the white hart struck his companions face and she all but cried out his skin was bloodless and his dark eyes held a hellish glow away you poxridden whore robert earl of launceston ordered in a voice like autumn leaves trouble us no more or feel the prick of my dagger and not the kind you are used to realizing it was a man after all and no grim spectre the doxy cursed at the shock she had been given she turned to summon the sailors to teach this elfskinned scut a lesson before she could cry out carpenter leapt from the shadows and placed one hand on her mouth to stop her his hazelnut doublet was of a rougher cut than his fellows but still clean and though his long dark hair fell oddly across the left side of his face he eased a charming smile on to his lips to soothe her he pressed a silver coin into her grimy palm and released his hand from her mouth my friend has poor manners mistress he knows not what it is like to work hard for a living he said with a bow take this and buy yourself a night off your back the woman giggled and curtsied flashing one fleeting murderous glare at the earl as she darted towards the inn to spend her earnings on drink once she had gone carpenter turned on the noble and hissed sometimes i think you are more of a threat than our enemies i am heartened to learn that you think twas my assumption that you had the wits of a hound running round in circles yapping and baring your teeth before hunting for food and sleep the earl peered past his fellow spy with studied disinterest searching the passing faces for the missing dee he was a gaunt man slim but powerful yet even those who did not know him recognized that there was something askew something strange about the way his cold gaze penetrated as though he were peering through skin and muscle to see the sticky organs within or the manner in which his hand twitched towards his hidden dagger with unsettling regularity i should give thanks that you did not slit her throat there and then carpenter sneered he pulled his black cap low over his eyes one full day without you trying to skewer an innocent let us celebrate he felt weary from the effort of restraining his companions murderous instincts and exhausted by the lonely unceasing work of the spy he wanted to be free of that world even the mundane life of a bookkeeper held its attractions or that of a tailor anything unconsciously he scratched the scars that marred his face beneath the fall of his hair the mark of the thing that had attacked him in muscovy and a constant reminder of the price this business exacted from him you bicker like old women the third man in the alley whispered tobias strangewayes was new to their band as raw as a country apprentice redheaded and wiry the younger man had fancied himself as good a spy and swordsman as will swyfte but when he discovered the true nature of the threat they faced his arrogance was blunted strangewayes still thought highly of himself he proudly showed off the blue silk lining of his cloak like some fop parading in pauls walk but carpenter knew he could be relied upon in a fight and you keep a civil tongue in your head or else i will cut it out launceston breathed strangewayes scowled in response the strain was taking its toll on all of them carpenter could see those wearying hours in the saddle riding north from nonsuch palace and then the futile search for dee through liverpools dingy streets they were starting to tear at each other like caged curs blades needed to be drawn and traitors carved blood stirred and thoughts that fed upon themselves driven out we are all defined by our nature he muttered to himself since dawn we have watched these streets without any reward strangewayes complained that irish slut has taken to her rooms wherever they might be and she will stay there until she can board the ship with her prize and gain the protection of a crew of cockled applejohns and then it will be too late carpenter snapped we will never see dee again and this land will be overrun by the things that walk with printless feet and cast no shadows on this earth and then you you redheaded puttock will know what it is like to thrash in the throes of a nightmare from which you can never wake i am a good christian man and i have the shield of god above to protect me the younger spy announced his chin raised in defiance of his seasoned companions launceston and carpenter exchanged a glance and each gave a dismissive shrug you have no faith in anything strangewayes continued his cheeks growing red you drink to excess you gamble you dally with whores the world is harsh and you must take comfort wherever you find it carpenter said secretly wishing he had the other mans spirit my heart is only for grace i need no other woman the redheaded spy pushed past the two other men and strode to the edge of the reeking alley i believe there is more to this life than the filth and the misery we see around us a higher purpose hidden yet in plain sight if we only had eyes to see it you are a true spy launceston mocked in a dry tone always seeing a face behind the one presented to the world the plan has not yet been revealed to us but that does not mean it is not there and yes we are spies and we should be used to peering beneath the surface for deeper truths but you two have been worn down by the meagre diet of deceit and death you turn your eyes away from the light and see only shadows carpenter could not disagree hrrrm the familiar breathy sound like a death rattle rolled along the alleyway launceston had seen something that had struck him as curious what is it carpenter asked the earl was looking up at the thin sliver of night sky between the eaves where a few stars sparkled someone passed overhead he said on the rooftops launceston nodded carpenter joined strangewayes and the earl at the edge of the alley and craned his neck up the rooftops were a jumble of thatch and tile and plain wood a silhouetted confusion of angular shapes against the lighter sky conditioned by years of strife the spy feared the worst the three men spun in a slow gyre searching the eaves nothing carpenter said after a moment you were mistaken i am never mistaken launceston stepped out into the muddy street to get a better look there he said pointing carpenter gazed along the line of his companions arm and glimpsed fleeting movement along the pitch of a tavern roof in the buttery glow of the moon there too strangewayes asserted waving a hand towards the roofs on the other side of the street carpenter could see them clearly now to the casual eye they could have been moonshadows what those flitting shapes truly were he was in no doubt the unseelie court are abroad in force he said the cold of that longgone muscovy night reached deep into his bones once more here strangewayes whispered though englands defences have weakened in recent times they risk too much by being out in such a populous place like any man they will risk anything if the stakes are high enough launceston murmured his words disappeared into a clamour exploding along the street at the three mens backs men and women rushed towards a swelling crowd near the entrance to one of the ratruns cutting through the jumble of houses what now carpenter growled his skin prickling with suspicion as he edged towards the churning crowd he heard the curious queries from the front turn to fearful cries then yells of alarm shadows crossed faces caught in the flickering pale light from the iron lanterns over the stew doors eyes widened lips drew back from stained teeth at the front of the crowd heads spun away from whatever had been discovered the ripple of concern broke into a wave of horror the men and women in the first ranks driving the others away from the black entrance to the alley crying to god they sheltered in doorways where they watched with frightened eyes carpenter and launceston thrust the last stragglers aside and drew their rapiers strangewayes unhooked the rusty chain of a lantern from the wall beside the white hart door and raised the wavering light aloft the night swept away but the black mouth of the ratrun remained impenetrable the three men stood for a moment at its edge silence fell across the street carpenter advanced with a measured step his blade held for a quick thrust launceston was at his shoulder and the younger spy loomed behind the lantern swaying from side to side from the dark echoed a strangled sound that a man might make with a hand clamped across his mouth step into the light carpenter called the snuffling grew more intense but no man ventured out where he could be seen it tries to draw us in strangewayes whispered carpenter wavered a trap perchance steeling himself he stepped into the dark rats scampered away from the tread of his leather shoes he smelled urine and rotting food scraps deep in the dark a pale shape shifted the animal noises grew louder still almost drowning out strangewayes ragged breathing raise the lantern he ordered he flinched as the light danced over two forms pressed against the wattle wall they were locked in an embrace a seaman his wiry hair flecked with grey his breeches round his ankles and a whore her skirts pulled up her pale legs wrapped around her partners waist in the midst of their coitus their lips were forced together in an openmouthed kiss creeping horror turned carpenters skin to gooseflesh the man and the woman were fused together their flesh melting into each other where he thrust into her and where his hands gripped her white arms and their mouths carpenter thought realizing the source of the snuffling noise two heads joined as one their kiss would now never end wide eyes ranged in wild panic pleading for help their combined grunts sounded more beast than mortal but he heard their desperation clearly there was no helping them he knew the unseelie court left no hope in their wake only suffering put them out of their misery launceston breathed carpenter raised his rapier but could not bring himself to strike i have no qualms the earl pushed the other man aside with two thrusts of his dagger he completed his task then stood over the fallen shape the beast with two backs he breathed they like their sport our enemy we will be wanted for murder now strangewayes protested launceston looked at him through slit eyes you would have left them to their agonies we are honourable men despite all appearances you saw the onlookers carpenter muttered the beadle will not be informed they will burn the bodies and pretend this atrocity never happened though it haunt their sleep for evermore now come sheathing his rapier he prowled out of the ratrun and along the street he felt the eyes of the silent seamen and doxies upon his back all of them at once despising him yet relieved too i see no movement now strangewayes said looking around the rooftops carpenter grimaced our enemy wished to divert prying eyes from their true intentions we have already fallen behind chapter four a glittering constellation danced across the wormholed ceiling beams the silverbearded old man squatted on a stool by the empty hearth watching the shifting stars with a childlike wonder etched into his wrinkled face it looked as if he were seeing through the upper storeys of the rooming house and out into the vast unknown dr john dee alchemist inventor sorcerer and astrologer to the court of queen elizabeth of england wore a cloak stitched from the pelts of woodland animals every head still attached so that he appeared to be swarming with wildlife beneath it skulls of birds and mice hung from silver chains looped across the chest of his purple gown every time he shifted their rattle broke the stillness of the room his slender fingers cupped a circular mirror made of polished obsidian as he turned it back and forth the glass caught the flames of the candles and threw pinpricks of light across the damp plaster of the bedchamber from the small square window overlooking the dark rooftops of liverpool meg oshee studied her companions entranced expression soon the herbinflicted stupor would begin to wear off she would need to administer another dose of the potent concoction that had kept dee supine since she had spirited him away from nonsuch palace more than a week ago she felt uneasy about stealing a mans wits for so long she had seen others never regain them but dee with a clear head was too dangerous a prospect for her to consider the irish spy was dressed in a bodice and skirt of black and gold the more easily to disappear into the shadows of the filthy towns dark alleys she hated it there but she had suffered worse places as she combed her auburn hair meg dreamed of her home a short journey across the turbulent waters too long had it been since she had walked in the fields of her youth but prices aplenty had been demanded of her since she had set out to steal englands greatest treasure and once dee had built his magical defences and ireland was free of the predations of the unseelie court there would be such a celebration no more death and misery no more crops blighted and cattle stricken for mere sport no more children stolen from their cribs and replaced by mewling straw things peace for the first time in generations and then all her sacrifices would be worthwhile she repeated those words in her head but still they did not catch fire her thoughts spun back to will swyfte and the merry jig they had danced together while calamity unfolded on every side annoyed with herself she tossed the comb aside why was she so loath to leave their wild courtship behind her life would be so much easier and certainly much safer if she put him out of her mind lightning flashed on the horizon the church bells clanged in the rising gale first fog now an approaching storm meg peered out of the window and murmured a prayer that the inclement weather would clear before the dawns sailing the end of this lethal business could not come soon enough she noticed that the flickering lights around her had come to a halt and she turned back to her prisoner dee now sat immobile peering deep into the looking glass his wondering expression had grown taut meg felt a flutter of apprehension moving to the corner of the room she opened the sack in which she kept her herbs and balm her mortar and pestle her lockpicks and the knotted cord she had once used to throttle the life from a man twice her size she could have the concoction ground into paste in a matter of moments ready to apply to the inside of dees cheek one stray thought troubled her what if dee had been feigning his bewitchment and the effects of the potion had long since started to wear off the alchemist was cunning but could even he control the ebb and flow of the fading enchantment the sorcerer began to murmur as if speaking to his reflection the unintelligible susurration rustling out into the corners of the chamber meg tensed once in a dirty tavern in some forgotten village in the midlands she had used her charms to encourage him to teach her simple magics and he had shown her how to use a glass to commune with another miles distant she closed her fingers round the dagger hidden in the folds of her skirt if the alchemist was using this mirror to call for help she would take off a finger or an ear or a nose if she had to after a moment meg decided dee was no threat she delved into her sack and withdrew a bunch of wilting herbs and the mortar when she looked up again her breath caught in her throat dee had stood silently and was peering at the wall as if he could see through it the looking glass lay upon the bed stay calm my love she whispered in honeyed tones and i will stroke your brow and soothe away all your worries usually the alchemist fell under the spell of her voice and returned to his dazed state but this time he dropped to his knees and brushed aside the rushes on the floor with a feverish intensity meg watched him at work wondering what strange thoughts were running through his head he seemed oblivious of her presence in all the time she had administered her concoction never had she seen this reaction before dipping into a hidden pocket in his cloak of furs dee withdrew a piece of chalk and began to draw a circle on the boards his feverish fingers flew across the familiar design inscribing inexplicable symbols at points along the arc meg stroked his long hair you are troubled my love she pressed her tone a little more insistent than she had intended put aside these things and return to the bed enjoy the pleasures of my thighs one final time before sleep dee ignored her the first time he had refused her charms she felt worried by the alchemists actions now he seemed possessed his eyes glinting with an inner fire finally he stopped his inscribing squatting in the centre of the chalk circle her hand felt for her dagger once more if she had to she could wound him enough to incapacitate him until she had him aboard the ship bound for her homeland before she could move dees head jerked up and his eyes swivelled towards her his lips unfurled from his yellowing teeth and he uttered one word one sound that made no sense to her but it made the heavens ring chapter five thunder rumbled away to the west will paused at the end of the urinereeking alley and glanced along the deserted high street if the unseelie court were abroad there near the centre of liverpool they were keeping away from candles and lamps he darted through the deep shadow under the overhanging eaves until he saw the grim faces of launceston carpenter and strangewayes they waited for him at the assigned spot in the lee of the silent stone bulk of the town hall good news lads he said forcing a cheery tone or not our irish vixen has made her lair in one moll higginss rooming house now the moment we dreaded must be addressed can we bear the lash of dr dees sour tongue all the way back to london or should we leave him to his fate make your case now and be quick about it we have friends in liverpool launceston said in his familiar monotone the kind of friends who would turn our bones to straw and mount us on sticks to scare the crows till judgement day will nodded i encountered those pale fiends too they also search for dee the risks here are doubled men we must fly like arrows if we are to prevent this from becoming a disaster he looked round the solemn faces not one of them not even the raw tobias strangewayes gave a hint that a mere four spies was a poor force against the supernatural might of the unseelie court will felt proud of them come then good lads there will be wine and doxies aplenty once this work is done the spies weaved through the deserted streets back towards the jumble of stews and inns near the quayside the nighttime drunken revelry had started up again shouts and singing and the calls of women rang over the rooftops carpenter demanded directions from a whore pissing in the street and within moments they were picking their way among ratinfested rubbish heaps in pitchblack alleys where the eaves almost closed over their heads moll higginss rooming house squatted on the edge of the dockside squalor it was the perfect hideaway for the irish spy and her charge will thought close enough to reach the ship speedily but far enough away from the bustle of the port to maintain a degree of anonymity it was a tall house of four storeys leaning in a precarious manner down the slope as if it were about to skid towards the water spicesmelling merchants stores jammed hard against it will looked up at the dingy whitewashed walls most of the small windows were dark but a candle flickered in one on the second floor and another in the roof the storm rolled around the town throwing off spears of lightning and clashes of thunder the wind tugged at his hair slamming shutters and unlatched doors beside him launceston and carpenter were watching the rooftops for any sign of the unseelie court strangewayes stood a few paces down the slope watching for an attack at their backs they are here carpenter said in a flat low voice blood dripped from his nose and will could feel the familiar knot in the pit of his stomach as his senses rebelled against the alien presences that drew near across the roofs grey shapes began to flicker against the night sky circling like wolves no time to lose now he whispered drawing his rapier he felt comforted by the weight of the steel in his hand in and out with dee cut down any who stand in our way and that includes the irish woman carpenter asked with a pointed stare will hesitated for only the briefest moment if she stands in our way meg will not sacrifice her life for even a treasure like dee he thought he hoped the moon chose that instant to break through the roiling clouds and as will glanced up one last time he glimpsed a sight that chilled his blood with arms and legs spread out grey figures crawled across the tiles and down vertiginous walls like spiders drawing in upon the rooming house from all directions i wish i had a fire to burn out this infestation launceston hummed even if it took down all liverpool will snatched open the door that backed on to the alley and led the way into a small scullery that smelled of lamb fat and cheap beer dirty cooking pots from that evenings meal were stacked on a trestle to one side instantly the spy recognized an unnatural feeling to the house a chill hung in the air and intermittent tremors ran through the walls and floor under the old dry rushes what is wrong here strangewayes hissed as he darted in behind the others and closed the door he drew the bolt with a resonant clank will sifted through his impressions for some clue to whatever was unnerving him his face hardened his eyes flickering around for any sign of threat raising his arm he flicked his fingers forward and his men followed him without question into a silent cold kitchen and then into a hallway that smelled of damp everywhere was dark a passage ran alongside a flight of ramshackle stairs though the gale whistled around the eaves inside the house was so still it seemed devoid of life will felt troubled by the quiet any rooming house was filled with a symphony of creaks footsteps snores and conversation for most hours of the day and he could see from carpenters darting eyes that his companion felt the same we go up he said the first board protested like a wheezing old man they all halted listening when no response came they continued to climb halfway up the first flight a throaty laugh rolled out just above them low and resonant behind him will felt his men bristle their rapiers at the ready wills eyes narrowed he searched the dark at the top of the stairs for any sign of movement and listened for a soft tread on the boards after a moment of quiet someone began to hum an old seasong a mans deep voice the melody punctuated by another laugh the four spies looked at each other curious will bounded up the remaining steps and rounded on to the second flight a man in a dirty undershirt and stained breeches slumped halfway up the rise his head against the wall his greasy brown hair hung lankly around his unshaven face but his eyes had rolled back so only the whites were visible he waved one hand in front of his face as if in time to music and then hummed the seasong once more has he lost his wits carpenter whispered the unseelie court have already ventured within if not yet then soon while we waste our time here gabbling will hissed he dropped low in front of the mans face until he smelled the alereeking breath an irish woman and an old man he demanded where are they after a moment the man appeared to hear and raised one finger the third he said as will made to push by the man grabbed his arm and whispered the eyes are afire say your prayers will shook him off and looked up the stairs into the dark at the top of the second flight he heard a clatter on the roof high overhead movement flashed past the small window beside him a crash echoed from the cobbles below a tile had been dislodged he raised his eyes listening then signalled to the other men with his eyes that the enemy had reached the rooming house they go down as we climb up launceston said without a hint of fear and where in the middle shall we meet at the top of the third flight will found a plump pinkfaced woman crumpled on the floor beside a younger man with the marks of the pox on his cheeks moll higgins perhaps and the man another lodger both lived but spittle drooled from the corners of their mouths and they looked right through him when he shook them what has happened here these are all fit for bedlam strangewayes whispered he knelt beside the woman and took her hand will had no answer the unseelie court still sought entry this was the work of another he wondered what terrible thing had happened here to drive the wits from the occupants in the silence dread seemed to drift down the stairs like the unnatural fog along the river mistress higgins and her lodger began to convulse crying out in a language that no one recognized as he climbed the stairs will frowned forcing himself not to look back launceston held up a hand to bring them to a halt but will had already felt it a cool draught sweeping down the stairs smelling of the smoky night air a window had slid open the boards overhead creaked catching a glimpse of uncertainty in strangewayes eyes will whispered if we walk away and leave dee to the enemy all will be lost for england for us there will be no coming back for a second chance we must do what we can though our lives be forfeit on the third floor they searched the first two rooms small and cramped with beds that had not been slept in the third was larger but also empty this is the place will whispered recognizing megs crimson taffeta dress hanging over the end of an unmade bed while carpenter crouched to peer underneath strangewayes moved to the window and glanced out he shook his head the irish woman and her prisoner could not have escaped over the nearby rooftops another creak echoed above them will imagined grey figures prowling around the darkened top floor soon those things would begin to descend he stilled his thoughts and looked around ropes that had clearly been used to restrain the astrologer were coiled in one corner with a blue silk gag on top the rushes had been brushed aside and a circle had been chalked on the floor with mysterious signs scrawled around the perimeter had meg allowed dee to cast a spell he wondered surely she would not have taken such a risk but there was a fat candle half burned and the sweet scent of incense hung in the air his gaze fell upon the obsidian mirror lying on its side beside megs bag such an object of power would never have been discarded so easily he pushed past carpenter to snatch up the looking glass it was insignificant enough few would have given it a second glance but as he stared into the surface cold prickled down his spine he felt the weight of a presence looking back at him before he could dismiss the sensation the glass misted and a face began to form in the depths a part of him wanted to hurl the mirror away but he felt strangely gripped by what was revealing itself and then the face formed and the shock jolted him it was jenny his jenny staring at him with wide frightened eyes carpenter jerked up half raising his rapier in concern but will was caught in the grip of that vision no illusion this so many years had passed since he had seen her and yet it was jenny as he remembered her from that last day in the cornfield brown hair tied back from her pale face he reeled from the rush of emotions that accompanied the sight the memories of quiet conversations at dusk the sensation of her hand in his and yet somehow he knew that this was jenny now and that she could see him as clearly as he saw her her eyes grew wider still when they took in his face but if he expected a smile of relief or love he saw only worry in her features she vanished as quickly as she had appeared will almost cried out pleading with her to return so he could see her for one moment longer a moment that felt richer than any he had lived in the last ten years what ails you carpenter growled in annoyance will began to explain then caught himself at least we have the mirror now he whispered slipping it into the leather pouch at his side now let us find dee and be away from this haunted place the window rattled in the grip of the gale that now buffeted the house perhaps they are long gone and already aboard their ship carpenter ventured will eyed the taffeta dress and flashed a reassuring smile perhaps raising his rapier he stepped out of the chamber and prowled towards the final flight of stairs for one moment he stood looking up into the dark all was still his breath locked in his chest he levelled his rapier twirling the tip once then placed his foot upon the first step a highpitched whine screeched across the upper floor will reeled against the flaking plaster of the wall clutching his ears in agony steel barbs plunged into his head he half glimpsed the other three men stumbling back with contorted features hands pressed against their own ears a moment later a boom resounded across the floor upstairs bringing down a shower of dust white light flared so brightly will wondered whether the house had been struck by lightning or a keg of gunpowder had exploded bedlam erupted before he had a chance to gather his thoughts throatrending shrieks ripped through the house sounding unnervingly like the cries of ravens more flashes of light a billow of acrid smoke the very foundations of the house seemed to shake will grabbed the rocking banister to keep his feet the violent tremors threw the other three men across the landing a body burst out of one of the rooms on the final floor and wheeled down the steps to crash in a brokenlimbed heap at the foot of the stairs fearing it was dee or meg the spy wrenched himself round will felt his chest tighten in shock the figure crumpled in front of him wore a grey shirt and breeches silvered with mildew the cut echoing a fashion of a time long gone the skin was bonewhite the cheeks cadaverous the eyes had been burned out so that only charred black sockets stared back at him he struggled to comprehend what had happened never had he seen one of the powerful unseelie court despatched so easily so brutally he yanked his head back to peer up the stairs through the swirling smoke wondering what force wreaked havoc up there another figure lurched from the open doorway at the top will glimpsed a flash of auburn hair a pale face a bodice and skirt of black and gold red meg oshee clutched on to the banister casting one wideeyed glance back into the room she had left her mouth formed an o of horror will felt another wave of disbelief this spy so hardened by the fight against the english in her homeland who had suffered all manner of threat to her life and wellbeing gripped by terror before he could call out to her she propelled herself down the stairs in desperation to escape what lay at her back in a flurry of red hair and skirts she crashed into him fleeting surprise lost to mounting panic leave she screamed leave or lose your soul as they turned another tremor hurled them to one side and they crashed through the splintering banister on to the flight of stairs below will took the brunt of the impact pain lancing through his ribs meg landed on top of him already craning her head in fear to see what followed strangewayes was pointing and crying out a warning lost beneath the booming that now sounded like a cannon barrage cloaked in the swirls of acrid smoke a figure was descending the stairs at a steady pace will felt gripped by the sight and by the terrifying power he sensed in that apparition it seemed he was in the centre of a storm with lightning crashing all around and thunder breaking overhead and then the figure loomed out of the cloud and will saw a cloak made from the pelts of many woodland creatures the stillattached heads swaying gently white skulls of birds and mice rattled on a silver chain to the rhythm of each step wild silvery hair a wrinkled face that mapped a life lived in the shadows dee will gasped the alchemist turned his terrible gaze upon the spy the eyes flickered with blue fire and in them will saw nothing that was human chapter six black pebble eyes watched from the high branches hunched like old men the crows perched in silent attention so great in number it seemed the stark winter trees were flourishing with sable growth sweating with fear tobias strangewayes wrenched his head round as he ran their unnatural stares chilled him why had they gathered why were they silent why were they watching relief flooded him when he burst from the great kentish forest and saw the large brickbuilt merchants house on the edge of the village the family home safe and secure his father had made no little money buying up the woodland to feed the endless demand for timber for the great seagoing vessels that had made england such a power across the world his breath burning in his chest tobias scrambled up to the door his only thought odd yet somehow right the crows shall not get me now and then he was in the bright morning room and his brother was there good stephen strong and wise sitting by the cold ashes in the hearth tobias felt a yearning that he couldnt explain but then stephen turned his broad rosycheeked face to him and gave a sad smile and tobias realized that his brother was dead overseas as so many of his family had died there is no reward in killing a king stephen said tobias felt a cold reach deep into his bones but before he could respond the vision shattered the glittering shards falling away into the dark he jolted awake the floor where he had been lying was cold his mouth felt as arid as if he had swallowed a hogshead of ale the night before a shaft of early morning sun fell through the open door of one of the rooms and caught a constellation of drifting dust motes all was still in the autumn chill he pushed himself into a sitting position launceston and carpenter were stirring behind him and beyond them he saw the woman they had guessed to be the rooming house owner moll higgins sitting against the cracking plaster on the wall though dazed she looked as if her wits had returned strangewayes struggled to think clearly though the unsettling dream about his brother still had its hooks in him fragments of the previous night emerged he recalled dee coming down the stairs and the terror he felt an unnatural terror as if all his senses were warning him of something he could not see he remembered the flashes of light and the smoke and the booming like the swell of the ocean against a hull heard on the bilge deck and the last thing that sprang into his mind was will grabbing hold of the irish spy and hauling her down the stairs strangewayes heaved himself to his feet and made his way unsteadily down the creaking wooden treads swyfte was slumped next to the open front door the woman nowhere to be seen dee strangewayes gasped as his companion stood up the mirror will shook his head running a hand through his tousled black hair gathering his wits he spun out into the cobbled street liverpool was lit by a thin orange light as the sun edged up over the horizon across the still streets a hum rose up from the direction of the docks zounds what happened last night strangewayes demanded dee was filled with fire and brimstone never have i seen him that way was he possessed by devils possessed aye that is a good enough explanation swyfte replied distracted when i looked in his eyes i saw no sign of the man i knew something dark has been awakened within him his tone was measured his words free of shock or unease and strangewayes guessed he had already started to reach some understanding of the alchemists transformation he laid low those nightthings as if they were drunken apprentices where did he get such power and why did he only reveal it this past night these are questions for another time will replied dismissing any debate with a wave of his hand for now we must hope we still have an opportunity to prevent a greater disaster let us to the docks and pray that we are not too late he threw himself down the cobbled slope towards the crack of sailcloth and barked orders the cries of the gulls and the dank smell of the wide grey river strangewayes shielded his eyes from the bright morning light as they emerged from the shadowed alley on to the quayside the dockworkers were already hard at their labours grunting and sweating as they heaved bales on to the backs of carts the horses stamped their hooves and snorted the applesweet scent of their dung caught in the sharp wind off the water the steady beat of wooden mallets echoed from the shipwrights dens to that rhythm of seagoing life on the merse merchants waved their arms in the air as they auctioned their wares haggling over prices and sailors sang their workshanties on board the great vessels at anchor tobias followed wills gaze along the forest of masts large and small his heart fell when he realized the carrack had already sailed we have lost dee he said with bitterness when we were so close what now for us all keep your spirits up swyfte seemed oddly unmoved despite the desperate situation in which they found themselves what do you suggest that we steal a boat and sail for ireland we will feel the sharp edge of a chieftains broadsword if we trespass into the interior of that benighted land he felt another spike of annoyance as his companion ignored him striding out to the edge of the quay where a blackbearded seaman knotted the frayed ends of a net tell me friend the carrack that sailed for ireland will asked how much of a head start does it have ireland the sailors eyes sparkled its bound for farther shores now what say you swyftes eyes narrowed the seaman drew the final knot on his net and admired his handiwork a new course was ordered before dawn so i eard he replied glancing out across the glassy water theyll be putting in somewhere or other to take on provisions but then theyre bound for the new world chapter seven red meg shivered pulling her crimson cloak tighter around her the autumn wind bit hard lashing her auburn hair as she leaned against the oak rail and watched liverpool disappear into the hazy distance how easily she had sailed into uncharted waters with will swyfte once again steering the new course of her life she smiled though danger awaited better a life of adventure and romance than a slow march to a grey death she turned looking towards the forecastle ahead lay the irish sea with its wild storms and soaring cliffs of black water and beyond she pushed aside all the questions that assailed her unable to stare into the furnace of her true motivations time would judge if she were fool or not captain nicholas duncombe emerged from his cabin he was a strong man tall and broadshouldered with a quiet nature that seemed more suited to scholarly pursuits than to command he was kind too kinder than any other man of the sea she had encountered most of whom always had a lustful look in their eye when they spoke to her the captain saw her watching him and strode over he kept his eyes down his features tense mistress oshee he murmured not wishing to draw attention to their conversation i fear for all our souls this vessel is bewitched he glanced towards the helmsman who stood as rigid as an oak oblivious of the wind pummelling his face meg followed his gaze across his crew who moved as if in a dream your companion is the devils own i know not what spell he has woven over my crew but only disaster can come of this i cannot control dr dee captain if you would keep your life tis best to do as he commands i am a seasoned traveller on these waves mistress but the new world such a journey requires careful planning and men prepared for the rigours that lie ahead the captain furrowed his brow his fears both imagined and real we sail into the haven of pirates and spanish warships and the lord knows what else perhaps hell itself if your companion is any indication but there will be good men coming to our aid and soon you must trust me on this duncombe searched her face wanting to believe her words then i will delay the taking on of provisions for as long as possible when we put in to port in ireland and pray to god that your good men will have a fair wind at their backs meg smiled with confidence but she fervently hoped they could wriggle out of dees grasp before they reached whatever destination the alchemist had in mind she had seen the fire in the old mans eyes and had no doubt that whatever he planned was terrible indeed i have little experience of sorcery save the dark stories sailors tell each other on the waves the captain went on as his fingers closed on the hilt of the dagger he wore at his hip but i fear our lot on board the eagle can only get worse find some comfort in the knowledge that if you are threatened in any way i will defend you with my life meg winced at the captains kindness but quickly offered her thanks here was a man who valued honour above all far removed from the duplicitous and treacherous world of spies that she knew when she peered into his weathered face she found herself thinking of her father though he had been gone for years now and she felt a wave of sadness at that moment she feared for duncombe more than he did for her could men so good ever survive in such a world the door to the cabins clattered open she sensed dees presence before he stepped from the shadowy interior as if he blazed with the white heat of a forge his hair was wild his eyes drained of all humanity and so we leave this world behind he called to the wind he looked at meg and through her to the dim horizon and gave a lupine smile chapter eight nonsuch palace echoed with the sound of feet moving through vast chambers and down winding stairways candles threw swooping shadows across the stone walls as breathless servants hauled wooden chests between them and dragged wellstuffed sacks and staggered under the weight of bales in the moonlit inner ward horses stamped their hooves upon the cobbles blasts of hot breath steamed in the chill air cart after cart creaked under the weight of loads waiting to be transported along the highway to the palace of whitehall just beyond the city walls the queen and her court were returning to london in the ruddy glare of hissing torches along the walls guards watched the hasty exodus their furtive eyes flickering from the frantic activity to the darkness that suffocated the surrounding countryside make haste make haste the orders rang out every voice trembling with unease the bitter reek of sweat born of dread hung in the air grace seldon paused in the long gallery leading from the queens chambers to peer through the diamondpane windows at the confusion in the yard below her arms ached from the weight of the queens sumptuous dresses each one jewelled and heavily embroidered she was wearing her plain yellow travelling skirt and bodice and a matching ribbon held her brown hair away from her face during her labours since sunset had she carried garments to the other ladiesinwaiting in the courtyard and there would be no respite until all the monarchs chambers were bare she had heard the tales of nameless enemies marching upon nonsuch the mutterings of blood and thunder and impending doom as she had heard them so many times before she raised her chin in defiance these were dangerous days and she would not jump at shadows the murmur of familiar voices rustled along the gallery and grace pressed herself back into a darkened chamber before she could be seen she bristled as she heard the arch tones of that duplicitous little man sir robert cecil the spymaster who had often turned his poisonous words against will the other was the earl of essex a selfimportant braggart who swaggered through the palace in his white doublet and hose as if all eyes must ever fall upon him she peered through the crack in the door as they neared too many rumours swirl around this palace threat danger death drawing closer by the hour essex was saying in a grim whisper you think we should speak true cecil exclaimed with contempt better by far that they have their imagined fears though the spectre of the plague still haunts london i will feel some comfort once we are behind the walls of whitehall the defences still hold there for now plotting as ever grace thought never could a word be trusted that came out of either mans mouth and upon their shoulders rested the future of england as they neared she stepped back a pace still watching what an odd pair they made the tall muscular essex looming over the shorter hunchbacked cecil yet power resided with the smaller man she knew and have we news from swyfte the earl asked graces ears pricked and she leaned closer once more as yet no word it sickens me to have to put our faith in such a coxcomb elizabeth favours him clenching his fists cecil ground to a halt only a step away from grace she held her breath will our queen hold such a high opinion of that rake if he fails to return dee and she is tossed into a burning pit with all of england swyfte speak to me of swyfte no more the spymaster snapped he has always been one step away from turning upon us and only his effectiveness has kept his head upon his shoulders if he learned the truth about the woman he lost cecil ground his teeth his voice falling to a whisper he will not if he fails to return dee to us his life is forfeit if he succeeds he has brushed close to the truth too many times and we can tolerate it no more too much is at stake the spymaster grunted his distaste and set off along the gallery at a fast pace essex hurried to keep up once the two men had disappeared from view grace eased out of her hiding place chilled she heard herself hailed and turned to see wills young assistant nathaniel colt redfaced and sweating with a large sack thrown over his left shoulder and another gripped in his right hand nat she exclaimed relieved to see a friendly face clutching the monarchs dresses to her chest she hurried up to him and whispered i fear wills life is in danger wills life is always in danger nathaniel sighed rogues cuckolded husbands poor card players jealous rivals and that is even before we discuss the spanish he saw her worried expression and softened tell me what you know grace she glanced over her shoulder repeating in grim tones what she had overheard and what did essex mean the truth about the woman he lost about my sister jenny she asked as she finished she felt a tremor of unease run through her these spies would find a plot in the contents of their evening stew nathaniel replied with irritation they can as much trust their own as the foreign agents they presume to fight he set his jaw thinking and then replied there is nothing we can do but wait until will returns he will be grateful for this information i am sure and will know the right course to take come let us talk as we walk i have a chamber full of chests and bales to empty and i would catch one wink of sleep this night together they carried their individual burdens along the gallery towards the stairs will never lost faith that jenny still lived never wavered even once grace said feeling the weight of this new mystery and that alone was a beacon of hope in those dark moments when i feared she could only have been taken by rogues and killed that summers day in arden even after all these years will loves her very much more than life itself nathaniel replied i have seen him reading through old letters that she wrote to him in the days of his youth he keeps them locked away in a chest beside his bed grace paused at the top of the stairs looking down into the dark i was but a girl when jenny disappeared that night i was woken by a sound at the well and i ventured out to find will returned from his long search washing his hands i can never forget his expression haunted he looked broken as if his life would never be well again her chest tightened with grief at the memory will was a changed man after that night he has searched high and low for her he will never relent the young assistant struggled with his sacks down the creaking wooden steps has he ever spoken of any knowledge he might have of where jenny might be grace asked adding quietly if she yet lives nathaniel shook his head will is a man of secrets he shows one face to the world a carefree gentleman who likes his wine good sport and laughter but behind that mask there are many chambers all of them dark he leaned against the wall to catch his breath despite what many here think he is a good man i see him in his private moments when the mask falls away and i know the truth and yet i fear he does not believe it himself nathaniels brow furrowed what are you saying part of his darkness is that he believes he is as base as the enemies he faces grace could not disagree they continued down the steps in silence crossing the echoing entrance hall they stepped out into the night enjoying the cool air on their flushed faces nathaniel dumped his sacks upon the cobbles and grinned attempting to lighten the mood you will be awaiting the return of master strangewayes eagerly i would wager she blushed why he had never entered my thoughts until you mentioned his name she lied she felt surprised by her growing affection for the young spy at first his gloating manner had only served to irritate her until she realized that like will he too wore a mask servants streamed around them muttering curses under their breath as they heaved their heavy loads on to the backs of the carts the hard work was near done soon the long journey through the dark countryside would begin you are pleased to return to whitehall nathaniel gasped as he threw one of his sacks on to the nearest cart if i call anywhere home now it is there she pursed her lips trying to identify the prickle of unease she felt then she had it would that i never had to venture near the lantern tower though the young assistant laughed what have you against it it scares me nathaniel shook his head in disbelief the monument our queen built to remind her of her father no wonder no awe no reflection on the achievements of old henry what is in it he shrugged it is empty the other ladiesinwaiting say that all roses planted in its shadow wither and die grace said and charity gomershall declares she heard a strange sound one evening like a mournful song rising from the summit ghostlights flicker around it superstition nathaniel chuckled it is haunted she replied emphatically and i will have nothing to do with it as she handed the dresses to one of the other ladiesinwaiting for storage on the queens own carts her gaze fell upon the spymaster and the earl of essex still deep in grimfaced conversation in the shadows by the palace wall she felt her unease grow stronger still across the inner ward the grinding of the opening gates echoed eager cries rose up from the crowd keen to leave nonsuch for the safety of whitehall but grace couldnt help but wonder if worse things lay ahead chapter nine golden shards of moonlight flickered across the black water of the river thames oars dipped and splashed hauling the tiltboat past the glinting lamps of london along the north bank the night was clear and still and cool in the back of the long low vessel launceston and carpenter nestled on crimson cushions woollen blankets pulled over their legs will listened to them bickering as they continued to debate what could have transformed dee into the horrifying vision they had witnessed in the rooming house near two weeks ago faster lads will called to the oarsmen his voice taut time is short strangewayes brooded on the bench in front of them his thoughts no doubt dwelling on the threat that now loomed over all england whenever he glanced back will saw the redheaded mans eyes searching the shadowshrouded banks for what they all knew waited in the night only a whisper away how long before the unseelie court broke the last of dees defences how long before they never saw another dawn will turned away from his companions his plan so insubstantial only days ago was growing stronger and he would see it through to its end though he brought down the crown the country even all of this world into damnations flame when the black bulk of the palace of whitehall loomed up out of the night the call of the guards along the river wall echoed over the water the master oarsman responded with a piercing threeblast whistle and guided his vessel in to the short jetty candles glowed in the palace windows the queen and her court had returned from nonsuch in search of shelter from the approaching storm grasping at straws strangewayes caught wills arm as he climbed out of the tiltboat tell me you can see a way out of this predicament or are prayers my only hope fear flickered behind the younger spys eyes the new recruit had come far in the short time since he had discovered that the world was not the way he had been told since he was a child few coped easily with such a dark revelation and with each passing day strangewayes clung more tightly to god to guide him out of the horrors will hoped madness was not a few steps away when life appears at its darkest and most desperate tobias then it is time to gamble everything will flashed a reassuring grin caution is our enemy coz we will shake this matter up one way or another he beckoned for launceston and carpenter to follow he felt a responsibility to his men though they did not yet know it their lives were the stake in his gamble was he then any better than the unseelie court the four men passed through the river gate across the echoing cobbled courtyard in front of the silent palace and into the maze of narrow passages among the towering brick and stone halls entering another gloomy courtyard they came to an ironstudded oak door behind which lay many secrets torches burned on either side of the entrance so there would always be light even in the darkest night will hammered on the door with the hilt of his dagger while the other men went in search of beef and ale after their long journey from liverpool a guard in a burnished cuirass led him inside and up a spiral staircase to the black gallery the walnutpanelled room echoed to the rhythm of his leather heels shadows danced away from the light of the logs burning in the stone hearth at a long heavy table in the centre of the hall sir robert cecil looked up with a startled expression as if he feared he was about to be attacked his features were drawn the result of long nights without sleep will suspected the queens little elf took his work as spymaster seriously but not as seriously as his personal advancement he was a humourless man who spent his days weaving webs and his nights dreaming of what life would be like if his hunched back were straight and true when the spymaster recognized his guest he scowled and covered the charts before him with a book always a keeper of secrets will thought cecil wheeled around the table with his rolling gait and peered up at the spy tis true then it is i am adored by all cecil bared his teeth swyfte what others think charm i think callow so you have failed dee has been spirited away under your very nose will perched on the edge of the creaking table and pushed the heavy tome to one side so he could eye the charts with an incensed snort the spymaster snatched the stained and creased maps and rolled them up dee is gone yes but not to ireland the spy said with a bored shrug cecil had a temper much larger than his stature and will knew how to play him to achieve the best advantage then he was taken to the new world with a trembling hand the little elf tapped an insistent finger on the table to gain the spys attention to what end hugh oneill needs dee now to protect ireland from our great enemy it seems that red meg oshee bit off more than she could chew when she stole dee from under our noses this detour was not planned by the irish and the mirror gone too will lied before any further questions came he moved on to describing the alchemists dreadful transformation in the rooming house and watched the blood drain from the spymasters face cecil prowled to the fire and watched the flames for a long moment is this the work of the unseelie court or of some other agency or has dee himself finally gone mad he uttered in a low strained voice the doctor always skirted the edge of sanity whatever the cause this matter is not yet over the spymaster spun round his eyes narrowing have you lost your wits his hands flew to his head we stand on a precipice without dee what hope do we have of fending off the bloody revenge of the unseelie court you and i are not alike will sauntered from the table to pour himself a flask of sack you surround yourself with shadows and see only the dark but the more i move into this nightshrouded world we have created for ourselves the more i look towards the light cecil snorted then you are a fool or you are ignorant of the true state of england in those days before our queen encouraged dee to build his defences when our enemy had full brutal rule over all corners of this land he perched on a stool a hand across his eyes looking like a child at prayer when i was a boy of no more than seven years i travelled with my father and three servants to childs ercall in shropshire where we had family his hoarse voice rustled out in the still room while my father was at business the woman who cared for me a kindly soul jane jane i cannot recall her full name oh how poor are my wits how broken am i as his troubled memories rose cecil seemed to have forgotten will was there the spy thought how sad and small his master now looked all the hardness of the court manipulator stripped away to reveal the infant that lurked at the heart of everyone jane goodly jane she never once mocked my misshapen back never raised a hand to me or called me fool or jester or or little elf she would tuck me up at night and brush the hair from my brow and whisper sweet angel the words choked in his throat for a moment but then he gathered himself and rose turning back to the fire in the hope that will would not see him blinking away tears there is a pond on the edge of childs ercall surrounded by willows and reeds the water black as night the local people say there is no bottom to it indeed that it reaches down to hell he gave a hollow laugh despite the warnings of the villagers i played along the edge of that foul place chasing dragonflies in the sun jane who was wiser and more fearful than i came to fetch me back to the house at once there was music in the air pipes and fiddle a reel that tugged at the heart and spun the head i saw jane stop and stare and her face freeze in terror and i followed her wavering gaze to a beautiful woman with hair like the sun and skin like milk rising from the water a part of me knew even then that it was not a woman and that that face was not the one jane saw a dreamy state came upon me all sun on water and lazy buzzing flies but i recall as clear as day janes visage as she walked towards that woman she looked as though she made her way to the executioners block the one in the water spoke with a voice that rang through my mind like a bell though i understood not a word and jane continued to walk into the pond sinking deeper with each step until the black waters closed over her head the woman who had summoned her turned to me and nodded slowly her face growing paler by the moment her eyes darker her cheeks hollow and she reached out her arms to me i ran crying back to my father and told him all that had occurred but there was no comfort for me he chastised me and sent me to bed because he believed every word i said and was afraid of it cecil fell silent watching the flames dance will felt moved by the intensity of his masters feelings cecil had always seemed cold and untouched by the suffering of others but perhaps they had more in common than he had come to believe janes body was never found the spymaster continued no search was made of that pond for her drowned form three nights later i woke from sleep and went to the window jane stood below her dress sodden her hair plastered to her head and filled with rotting pond leaves and she reached up her arms and silently called to me and i wanted to go god help me for i knew from that moment i would be alone in the world but then i saw the shapes dancing in the night beyond her and i was filled with such dread that i thought i would die i ran back to my bed but for nights after i sensed her out there calling to me and i thought how could one so kind become so cruel and that notion told me all i needed to know about this world he turned back to will his face drawn we have all had our lives blighted by the unseelie court in some way you it was some village girl was it not a childhood friend will replied feigning disinterest but the vision of jenny in that haunted cornfield blazed across his mind cecil stalked forward his hands raised and clutching in the grip of his passion think then sirrah what england will be like without dee to offer a modicum of protection against those nightterrors when the unseelie court have freedom to do as they wish my nightly visits from jane will be nothing compared to the horrors foisted upon every man woman and child the spectre still visited cecil will reflected on the scars that must have been inflicted upon his master through that relentless haunting by the only one who had ever been kind to him yes for the enemy will want even greater revenge for englands betrayal he snapped surprised by his own rush of emotion for stealing their queen and holding her prisoner when they thought we were offering the hand of peace cecil gulped like a codfish you are never to speak of that thing why we are among friends are we not will swigged back his sack and tossed the flask aside cecil squirmed under his cold gaze despite the play you make to the world there are no heroes here we are all tainted england had no choice you know that our betrayal as you define it was a matter of survival and that is justification yes cecil roared the survival of our queen of england of us all a life free from the shackles of fear that is worth any action and you know too that the faerie queen is the heart of dees defences the power that rages within her like a furnace burns the night away from this land wills thoughts returned to the story as he had been told it his own queen elizabeth meeting the faerie queen on windswept dartmoor to seal a pact that might end the long years of conflict between the two races who lived side by side on englands green land though one in day and one in night the meeting had been hardwon the mistrust both sides felt barely overcome but after that night the unseelie court would never trust the mortals again englands forces emerged from their hiding places among the gorse and granite slaughtered the fay cohort and took their queen prisoner and in her meagre cell she had resided for more than thirty years her miserable incarceration keeping england safe will shrugged fighting to contain his simmering anger let us not squabble he said pretending he cared little when in truth he found it harder by the day to tell friend from foe cecil rested both arms on the table and released a weary sigh oh for your simple world swyfte where the only concerns are fresh wine doxies and a bowl of the ordinary the secretary of state searched through the heap of yellowing charts until he found the one he wanted will recognized the outline of europe stretching to the far orient we now know the unseelie court have been planning for this moment for many a year word has reached me of the enemys maintaining positions of influence in the great courts one of those fiends advised the rebel leader severyn nalyvaiko as he led his cossacks through galicia volhynia and belarus in his struggle against the polishlithuanian commonwealth another has the ear of the doges in venice and genoa philip of spain i fear is still troubled by malantha of the high family the story is the same in hungary in the whispers that prompt the serbs to rebel against the ottomans in tuscany austria malta even in rome itself all around us they move their pieces their aim to burn this world after the indignities they have suffered yes at our hands they have decided the time of man has passed then all of humanity will pay for englands grand betrayal leave it be cecils spittle flew across the stained chart as he roared if i did not know better i would think you revel in the suffering about to be inflicted pon us that is treason the spymaster sagged the hopelessness he had tried to contain rose in his features and he flapped a feeble hand towards will enough this tires me i do not know why you wish to provoke me in this dreaded hour but enough calming himself will walked round the table to the fire remembering all the times he had seen dee trying to warm himself but never being able to drive the cold from his bones i hear plenty about the monstrous acts of the unseelie court he murmured prodding a log with the toe of his spanish leather shoe but never anything about what manner of beings they are what do you mean what is their true nature their essence what do we know of them will turned back to the spymaster tugging at his chin hair in thought but he kept one eye fixed on every subtle movement cecil made do they love do they care for their children do they have children or art and poetry and learning they are monsters who wish us all dead cecil interrupted that is all we need to know and you are aware of nothing more they are what they seem these pale creatures of the night will narrowed his eyes watching the faint muscletremor around his masters mouth i know nothing more the spymaster looked away at the last unable to hold wills unflinching gaze he turned back to his charts and pretended to sift through them while he sought to change the subject for all your many flaws you have a sharp wit swyfte and you have played your public and private role well in service to the queen tell me your thoughts for at this moment i would clutch at even a thread to draw me out of the dark will felt the weight in his chest lighten everything was unfolding as planned we feared dr dee had been stolen by the irish we came close to losing the mad alchemist to the unseelie court but his transformation saved us from that fate while at the same time denying us the opportunity to reclaim him but we must not lose sight of the fact that at the moment dee is free yes somewhere in the wide atlantic nevertheless will replied throwing his arms wide he is for now at large and with a fair wind at our backs and the will to achieve it we can bring him back how so cecil snorted do you know where in the new world he travels or why warming to his performance will smiled i know we are in a race sir robert the unseelie court will be in pursuit whoever finds dr dee first wins cecil weighed the words his furrowed brow revealing the hopelessness he felt dees carrack will have need to take on supplies for the long ocean voyage the spy continued and the vessel i saw bore no comparison to our own racebuilt galleons across the stretch of that vast ocean we can catch up and he added i may perchance be able to uncover some clue as to the course dees vessel takes the spymasters eyes narrowed even if you found the route the doctor has taken you would have to fight off the full force of the unseelie court you and a handful of mere men that is madness you would be sailing to your deaths my life means nothing will said in all honesty cecil paced around the table kneading his hands together in thought but can we prepare a galleon for an atlantic voyage at such short notice the cost of food and munitions englands coffers are already bare the shortages of meat and grain after this long plagueravaged summer you will be counting gold when the unseelie court arrives at your door will said with a wry smile the tempest is moored at tilbury our best ship not the tempest you may need her to defend london should i fail requisition another ship in the queens name after the poor trade of this year there must be many a merchant keen to be reimbursed i will see what i can do one other thing will strode to the window and peered out across the moonlit roofs of the palace of whitehall not far away a faint crackle of emerald light sparkled in the sky if i am to risk my neck i would arm myself with any information that might help a reasonable request ask of me what you will not you there is one other who has all the answers i could ever need will rested an arm on the window frame and pressed his forehead against the cool glass take me to the lantern tower i would question the faerie queen herself chapter ten emerald flames crackled around the tiled roof of the stone tower like marsh lights far below a swaying lantern echoed that glow as a knot of six men processed across the courtyard beneath the gentle soughing of the nightwind the click of their leather heels on the cobbles was the only sound in the still palace at the oak door studded with black iron the group came to a halt the four armoured guards gripped their pikes their stern faces revealing that they had no notion what was contained within the lantern tower sir robert cecil lowered his eyes but will gazed up to the spectral display his brow knitted his great gamble began here do not let anyone else inside the tower cecil barked at the guards looking each man in the face in turn defend it with your lives he removed a large iron key from a velvet pouch and unlocked the heavy door the tumblers clanked into place taking the swaying lantern he stepped inside and closed the door behind will the candlelight illuminated stone steps spiralling upwards into the dark dees magical defences have been disarmed he whispered we are safe to proceed safe an odd choice of word will began to climb the steps the air was dank and smelled of tallow and burnt iron do not concern yourself she cannot escape none of us can escape sir robert the spymaster did not query his charges enigmatic response perhaps he understood for he was no stranger to prisons and bars and duty and fear they climbed through floor after floor with the secretary of state growing more anxious with each step who feeds her will asked she takes no sustenance as you and i know it the spymaster muttered in the early days of her imprisonment i am told attempts were made to bring her meals but the food rotted in the bowls and was returned untouched she has guests rarely though dee has ensured his sigils and spells keep her trapped in place still all who encounter her fear her power sometimes cecil smacked his lips with distaste sometimes you can feel her words deep inside your head like a maggot burrowing only that fool spenser has dallied here awhile until my father sent him away for fear he had fallen to her wiles alone in a cell for so long how hot must her rage burn will thought how terrible would be her vengeance if she ever escaped the steps ended at another heavy oak door marked with mysterious whorls and symbols inscribed in red paint cecil hesitated looking up at the portal with dread will thought his trembling master was about to fall to his knees and pray for their salvation the silence was heavy but it was not the silence of emptiness will sensed that the cells occupant waited on the other side of that door listening dangerous poised perhaps for any opportunity that might arise go then ask what you will cecil whispered he held up the lantern so that wills shadow swooped the spy leaned in his nose almost brushing the wood he couldnt imagine the prisoners terrible beauty though he had heard stories a beauty that could drive a man mad or blind but he imagined her lips parting in a dark smile your highness he began her laugh sounded like an echo in a deep well he dabbed the side of his right hand to his nose where a droplet of blood had formed my name is will swyfte he continued i am in the employ of queen elizabeth of england and i have dedicated the last ten years of my life to fighting your people for the tragedy you inflicted upon me another uncaring laugh punctuated by a low scraping will pictured her drawing her long nails over the rough oak perhaps imagining in her turn his skin peeling his eyes being drawn out i have killed your kind he said silence you think yourselves greater than mortals but your lives still pass on the end of cold steel he continued after another moments lull her musical voice rolled out though muffled by the wood her words were laced with humour but had a cold cold core you speak boldly would you do the same if you stood beyond the protective sigils deep within my cell i would for i speak truly very well her voice hardened is the indignity of my imprisonment not enough that you have come to taunt me further will reached his fingertips towards the surface of the door just as they were about to brush the wood something crashed against the exact spot on the other side and he snatched his hand back involuntarily i have no interest in cruel sport he replied that is the province of the unseelie court i hold myself to higher standards indeed you do think highly of yourself that a mere man should speak to a queen of the unseelie court like an equal she mocked were you here beside me i could if it suited me peel away your flesh to the rough construction that is your essence but we are craftspeople delicate and skilled and we can find subtler ways to teach harsh lessons i have seen some of those ways one whisper in an ear that can turn thoughts in such a way that it drives a man mad we see the weakness in all mens hearts that one flaw that we can prise apart with a few words until it becomes a yawning chasm i see into your heart will glanced back down the steps to his master assuring himself that cecil could not overhear the conversation i know my own heart well enough no you do not no man does you only think that is the case and that is why the truth drives you from the illusion you all hide behind to stay sane beyond her muted words he heard a faint scraping as if she were stroking the door he imagined a lovers caress and shivered despite himself you waste your breath i see sadness a deep abiding sadness the queen rolled the words around her tongue with pleasure i see the pain of loss and separation a life that has become corrupted by mystery to such a degree that it can no longer be lived you would rather know the truth and be destroyed than live in this twilight world any longer will raised his head in defiance and i feel anger he replied in a low voice for you stole from me the only thing i ever valued he shook his head and his blood spattered across the door i hear the impotent cry of the wounded child her breathy words sounded low and closer still he presumed she had pressed her cheek against the wood now they were barely separated like two lovers teasing towards an embrace her seductive voice luring him in the hairs on his neck tingled as if she had brushed his skin he should break the enchantment and leave that place without a backward glance he knew but the rage in his heart held him fast he sensed her smiling yes she knew his weaknesses well you see sadness he whispered you see rage i know but you do not see fear she laughed again fear is the sane response to us then i am not sane and proud of it tell me your weakness the very definition of insanity you presume i would bare my throat to you will glanced back at cecil who had retreated further down the steps the spymaster quivered in the wan light of the guttering lantern flame you will tell me will kept the confidence in his voice luring her in as she had attempted to ensnare him for sport a mere man is no threat you have said so yourself what have you to lose by indulging my desire to seek my own destruction you think yourself clever perhaps you are by the standards of man yet there is much you do not know about the unseelie court about yourself and your place in this world nevertheless i agree our weakness is something your kind would never understand honour our word is unbreakable even though it mean pain or loss or defeat do you find any gain in that knowledge does your kind even understand what honour means i think not she added with cold contempt will folded the information away and continued lightly is it true that you have made your home in the new world would you visit my palace o man she enquired he heard a crackle of dark humour in her voice i am sure you would offer me all the courtesies extended to every mortal who has crossed from this world of hard things into your moonlit realm he waited a moment and then added yet perhaps i could offer a few common courtesies of my own the faerie queen laughed oh what sport that would be would you wave your sword at us would you rage and curse and threaten before we fell upon you like wolves we have more steel in us than you imagine your highness then i extend an invitation to you should you wish to prove yourself she replied with cruel glee damn yourself sail to the new world cross the gulf between our realms if you can find a gate to the place where both lands exist as one and then follow the great orinoco until you reach the confluence with the caroni along that river you will discover the fortress of the unseelie court will felt a squirming sensation deep in his head he reeled away from the door as his minds eye was flooded with a vision of startling richness at first he struggled to comprehend what he was seeing a monstrous black spider as big as hampton court palace squatting on a verdant landscape where green hills rose above the treetops of a mighty forest iron cartwheels wider than the grey thames revolving within a sphere and then he found himself looking down on a grim fortress with soaring walls of black basalt and gold the fortress crepuscule the faerie queens voice echoed in his skull your kind will always find our home should that be your wish but it is much harder to leave his gaze drifted down a vertiginous cliff across a stone labyrinth set in the forest to a high tower with a soft white glow emanating from the summit he heard himself murmuring what is that the tower of the moon the beacon that illuminates the way between our worlds as long as the light shines the paths remain open swyfte will heard cecils strained voice as if it were rising from a deep well take your leave now before she steals your wits the spy snapped out of his delirious vision into the cold grey of the lantern tower the queen of the unseelie court scraped her nails down the door while you mortals are base lead my people are gold for the first time will heard a hint of yearning in her voice and our home is gold a golden city which the men of that hot land call manoa the wonders you would see there mortal it would drive you mad one day your highness one day i will sail there and bring the vengeance of the english to your doorstep and as your life ebbs away try to read some meaning in the entrails of your suffering there will be none will forced himself to break her spell and turned away from the door i have purpose in my life your majesty i will never be deterred from finding the truth truth she repeated with dark humour would you know the greatest secret of all we are all in cells to greater or lesser extent this world you see around you is a prison though the bars and locks are hidden but who is the gaoler ask yourself that and what does it take to escape her voice grew fainter will imagined her drifting away from the door into the confines of her dismal cell even as we speak my people rise from their silent chambers under hill and under lake i hear them in my heart drawing nearer one vow is on their lips to stop you recovering the mad magician who is your final hope you will never set sail from this city you will die here all of you the end is close say your prayers kiss your loved ones the end is close a laugh like cold crystal fading away into the lonely dark chapter eleven the man surged through the sea of bodies flowing along cheapside in the wan morning sunlight furious servants heading to the market yelled curses and apprentices searched for stones to hurl at his back but still he ran casting anxious glances over his shoulder he was swarthyskinned the widebrimmed felt hat he had used to hide his identity long since lost will thundered in the running mans wake queens business he bellowed the crowd peeled away on either side he was lighter on his feet than the other man stronger and faster though he had barely slept since his haunting conversation with the faerie queen sensing his pursuer was closing the distance the fugitive threw himself into a flock of geese kicking wildly until he drove them into a frenzy of honking and beating wings the birds scattered across the street in wills path without missing a step the spy vaulted on to the back of an apple cart trundling through the flock scrambled over the seat beside the startled carter and leapt across the flapping obstruction allowing himself a tight smile his prey was oblivious of what lay ahead as they passed the towering fivestorey houses near the great conduit where apothecaries sold herbs and spices he watched the runaway glance round in shock at the eastern end of cheapside at the stocks market confluence of three great thoroughfares an army of labourers was milling around with armfuls of cordwood for the ring of beacons that were to be built beyond the citys northern wall while men in sunburnished burgonets and cuirasses looked on the swarthy man put his head down and tried to weave his way through the confusion without drawing attention but the towering heap of firewood blocked most of the trivium and the three streets were choked with jumbles of carts and frustrated merchants as the fugitive stumbled trying to force his way through the throng will called out again a traitor to the queen stop that man three pikemen swung their weapons towards the runaway when he veered away from them will sprinted the last few yards and hurled himself forward the two men crashed across the cobbles will leapt up in an instant drawing his knife and pressing the tip against the fugitives neck the man snarled in spanish will only grinned through the gathering crowd cecil barged his way from where he had been overseeing his hastily planned gathering of fuel what have we here he snapped a spanish spy will sheathed his blade as the pikemen levelled their weapons at the prisoner our earthly enemies see an opportunity to make mischief while we are so distracted the spymaster leaned in close and whispered prompted by the unseelie court no doubt that witch malantha of the high family is working her wiles upon philip of spain threats wait in all quarters we must never lower our guard wills attention was caught by grace and nathaniel pushing their way through the throng grimfaced they stopped beside the labourers unloading the wood from the carts their eyes urging him to come over to the tower with him cecil barked we will see how loose his lips are after he has rested pon the rack as the spymaster directed the pikemen will made his way over to his two friends grace i know i have not seen you since my return from liverpool but now is not the time this is not a social visit she interjected clasping her hands together against her emerald skirt i have grave news give her a moment of your time will nathaniel put in you will not regret it the spy had rarely seen his assistant looking so serious speak then he said grace glanced towards cecil still strutting along the ranks of pikemen when i was at nonsuch i overheard your master speaking she paused blanching of jenny will furrowed his brow remembering cecils mention of jenny the previous night he knows little about her not so grace recounted what she had overheard as the court fled nonsuch will felt his pulse quicken could this be true cecil had some knowledge of what had happened to jenny that day so long ago the spy looked over to where the queens spymaster bustled about gesticulating at the assembled troops he felt a cold nugget of anger form in his stomach were that so should the spymaster have kept such information from him he could not be held responsible for his actions always the voice of caution nathaniel said perhaps grace misheard and it is often hard to divine the truth from eavesdropping perhaps will continued to watch cecil now in deep conversation with the commander of the pikemen he knew the nature of the man and all the things of which he was capable grace leaned in and whispered this business you are involved in in liverpool and here in london does it concern jenny i cannot say will replied truthfully for anything involving the unseelie court was linked to his loves disappearance do not treat me like a child grace raised her chin in defiance she is my sister and i would know what you know will could barely draw his gaze from cecil he felt the anger starting to burn through him you know you must not ask me these things he said more sharply than he intended we will talk later unable to contain himself any longer he strode over to the spymaster i would have words he said curtly cecil began to dismiss him until he saw the cold look in wills eyes the spymaster edged to the lee of a cart where they could not be overheard and nodded i am told that you have information about my jennys disappearance will said as calmly as he could practised at revealing nothing of his innermost thoughts cecil only pursed his lips in thought last night you feigned ignorance of her the spy snapped you know more than you are saying i know nothing do not lie to me or what pray tell cecil blazed are you doubting my word will steadied himself this was not the time if you know anything of what happened to jenny tell me now cecil snorted what has come over you you conjure these suspicions out of thin air why should i know anything about your woman walsingham was spymaster when she disappeared was he not will searched his masters face for a long moment grace had been adamant in her assertion of what she had overheard and cecil was a man enveloped in secrets there was a mystery here for sure but will could see he would get no joy from the other man he frowned weighing his options his suspicion of the spymaster grown a hundredfold i know no more than you cecil pressed through gritted teeth why would i will felt queasy at the thought that his masters might have known something about jennys disappearance for all these years and told him nothing what reason could they have unsure of his ground he stalked away though a part of him wanted to drag cecil to one side and beat the truth out of him beside the pile of cordwood he glanced back the spymaster was watching him intently will knew that look and realized he should be on his guard from now on he pressed on into the crowd his shoulders heavy and didnt stop until he rested in an alley beside a grocers shop leaning against the damp wall he closed his eyes trying to calm his churning thoughts if cecil kept many secrets he had a few of his own dipping into the leather pouch at his hip he pulled out dees obsidian mirror which he had wrapped in a thick velvet cloth to keep safe he studied the glass for a long moment he would find the answers he needed whatever the cost chapter twelve an arc of fire blazed across the nightdark fields surrounding london spirals of gold sparks whipped up in the breeze rose from the beacons enclosing the city from the marshy western reaches by the grey thames to the riverside woods beside the eastern city wall carpenter leaned on the battlements at the top of the white tower and felt the acrid smoke sting the back of his throat it had been four days since the faerie queen had issued her hatefilled warning four long wearying days of organizing the militia spinning a web of deceit to sustain the rumour that the suspected attack came from spanish agents surreptitiously spreading a long line of salt and protective herbs among the beacons to bolster dees failing defences four days of hope and worry will our preparations be enough he asked rubbing at the scar tissue under his hair it was an unconscious tic in moments of anxiety harking back to that bitter night in muscovy when the bearthing had left him for dead hrrrm launceston murmured acknowledging the question without answering it he looked across the slowmoving river towards an orange glow in the east another ring of beacons surrounded the docks at greenwich where men laboured through the night to provision their requisitioned galleon the gauntlet for its long ocean crossing can you not offer me even a crumb of comfort carpenter snapped he fought down his bitterness what good would that do the earl breathed his dry voice almost lost to the wind carpenter prepared to give a barbed response then thought better of it what was the point in wishing his companion could comprehend such trifles as human feelings instead he muttered we are modern men not superstitious fools like the country folk and i have long since discarded the bibles cant but sometimes i hope the word caught in his throat tell me robert do you think there might be a god if there were a god would he allow a thing like me to exist carpenter heard no selfpity in his companions voice only an acceptance of his unnatural urges for a moment he recalled the diabolic vision of the earl drenched in blood he felt surprised that the emotion it stirred in him was not disgust but sadness i have had my fill of this business he sighed it wears me down by degrees and seals me away in a dark place where i fear i will never see the sun again i would break away and soon where would you go the earl drew his grey woollen cloak around him and stepped beside his companion to look out over the jumbled roofs of the city this business has stolen your life no family no woman no friends no trade we company of travellers are all you have carpenter gave a bitter laugh this is it then you are my family and swyfte and that redheaded maggotpie strangewayes kill me now and be done with it the enemy will come soon enough launceston said looking up to the billowing smoke from the bonfires even when dees defences were strong they still wandered across our territory the alchemist only kept them from attacking in force now not all our charms will hold them at bay for long we must hope that we can be at sea before they strike at least if we can regain dee we stand a chance of repelling them and without dee there is no hope at all carpenter thought cries of alarm rang up from the dark of the waters edge far below them frowning carpenter stifled his pang of anxiety as he peered over the battlements some waterman in distress he tried to tell himself the sound of running feet echoed more cries the river is protected by the charms on the wherries working their way back and forth between the banks launceston said as if he could read the other mans thoughts all is as dee prescribed i can see nothing carpenter snapped come he wrenched himself away from the battlements and ran down the winding stone steps launceston only a few paces behind in the ward he shouted to the guards to open the gates out of the fortress they raced and along the grey walls to the rivers edge the cries of fright had ebbed away only the lapping of the thames broke the silence struggling to see in the thin light of the crescent moon carpenter found the muddy path by the black water it was low tide and the river reeked from the stink of offal dumped unlawfully in the flow by the citys butchers after night had fallen on a small stretch of gravelly shore he glimpsed the flare of torches bobbing in the dark he cast an uneasy glance at his companion but the earls sallow face was impassive carpenter crunched across the slick stones feeling colder by the moment his hand searched for the hilt of his rapier for security nearing the crackling torches he made out a group of six watermen in caps and thick woollen cloaks to keep them warm in the chill of the open river their attention was gripped by something he could not see the earl had drawn his dagger and was keeping it hidden in the folds of his cloak we are on the queens business carpenter announced with a snap in his voice grabbing the shoulder of one of the watermen and easing him aside what is the meaning of this outcry six faces turned towards him in the dancing light of the torches each one etched with fear one of the men stretched out a trembling arm to point the spy followed the line of his finger hunched on the edge of the cold black water squatted a man clad in the filthy corselet of an old soldier his breeches were coated with river mud his hair and beard wild his face drawn from a life lived in hedgerow and street he had the thin frame of a man who went too long between meals beside him a rod and line was set in the mud and gravel and a small fire had been built with driftwood ready to be lit the figure didnt move his gaze fixed on the eddies lapping against the shore dead carpenter thought but even as the notion crossed his mind he found himself unsettled by a faint shimmer across the mans body launceston must have seen it too for he grabbed one of the torches and held it over the still form the old soldier all but glowed like some apparition carpenter took an unconscious step back the dead man was rimed with frost his hair and beard white his skin gleaming with ice crystals as though he had spent a night out in a muscovy winter what is this the spy exclaimed an autumnal chill hung in the air but nothing that could account for such a state launceston squatted beside the soldier moving the torch around so he could examine the frozen face for some clue as to what had occurred a murmur washed around the huddling watermen as if a dam had broken one blamed the devil another the fair folk a third some curse or other the earl withdrew his dagger and jabbed the point against the mans cheek a clink echoed above the gentle lapping of the river solid he mused like ice he jabbed harder and the side of the soldiers face shattered shards of frozen flesh rattled on the gravel the squatting body teetered for a moment then fell back cracking into a hundred hard fragments the watermen cried out as one and fled back along the rivers edge towards their boats zounds what evil is this carpenter gasped i fear it is the beginning of something launceston breathed rising to his feet he waved the torch over the glistening remains one final time and then turned to the water of what i am not entirely sure would the unseelie court attack a starving soldier fishing for his supper there must be some other answer if you leave this work if you flee into a new life i will come with you the earl murmured in a distracted tone gripped by the sight of the shattered body carpenter barely realized what his companion had said before the earl added in this mystery lies the key to what we will face in the days ahead if we can only divine it and if we cannot carpenter asked then winter comes early for all of us chapter thirteen candles summoned glittering jewels from the stained glass window above the altar the ladys chapel in the palace of whitehall had heard the whispered devotions of monarchs lords and ladies but this night it was strangewayes low voice that rustled up into the shadows head bowed he knelt on the cold flags hollowed by too much doubt and fear dear father hear my prayers he entreated his pressed palms shaking deliver us from the evil that draws nearer by the day the only answer did not come from god tobias his name echoed from the dark at the back of the chapel the young spy stumbled to his feet running one trembling hand through his auburn hair who goes he snarled shock adding a crack to his voice a hooded figure stepped into the candle glow his heart leapt when he saw that it was grace wrapped in a thick woollen cloak against the growing chill she folded back the cowl and forced a weak smile come back to the fire you have been here in the cold for too long soon he said i find some peace here in the midst of all this turmoil and if god hears my pleas then we have hope in the struggle that is to come her brow furrowed we have defeated the spanish before surely we can again strangewayes felt a pang of regret that he had to lie to her it seemed a betrayal of the love they shared and yet how could he not deceive her when her sanity perhaps even her life was at stake swyfte had warned him time and again how many others had been driven mad by knowledge of the unseelie court you are the voice of reason grace i worry for naught i am sure he replied putting on a confident smile it is in my nature to grow anxious before a battle then you must listen to will she said with a warmer smile he is always as calm as a millpond the spy flinched but he nodded politely tis good advice i will be along once i have finished my devotions her face darkened we have only been close for a matter of weeks tobias i miss your gentle words and i would enjoy your company before the queens business calls you away once more once she had left his heart grew heavier all his sacrifices were for her alone he would do anything to keep her safe in the face of the supernatural threat that circled all their lives after a moment more footsteps disturbed his thoughts and he was surprised to see sir robert cecil emerge from the gloom the spymaster gave a faint nod of greeting tobias as always found his masters eyes unreadable sirrah i must apologize cecil said it was only my intention to pray awhile here like you i am a godly man i could not help but overhear your exchange with your woman grace and i have nothing to hide i would think not cecil knelt before the altar and made the sign of the cross upon his chest pray with me he said beckoning the other man to join him strangewayes knelt his uneasiness in his masters presence giving way to the churn of his own troubles you have been a loyal and trusted servant since you joined my band sirrah cecil said his head bowed that has not gone unnoticed i do whatever is required of me in service to the queen of course of course the spymaster nodded and i would be remiss if i did not reward you for that service a job well done is its own reward that and the knowledge that i serve god you would do well to accept this reward master strangewayes for it is only a small thing a warning he paused for one moment allowing the weight to build i fear for the safety of mistress seldon tobias jerked his head towards the spymaster grace what are you saying you must beware of swyfte he is always scheming to his own ends and he cares little who gets hurt in the process what do you know cecil closed his eyes muttering a prayer after a moment strangewayes shook his head there is no love lost between swyfte and me but i cannot believe he would allow grace to suffer unnecessarily indeed he has protected her since her sister jenny was lost the spymaster shrugged if you are certain you must tell me if grace is in peril i will do whatever is necessary to protect her a small smile flitted across cecils lips gone before strangewayes could be sure he had seen it all i can say for now is that you must keep close watch on our friend master swyfte the older man repeated at this time of greatest threat he is at his most dangerous and he will do aught to save his own neck even sacrificing those closest to him never let him out of your sight listen to his weasel words judge him you do not have to accept my account trust your own heart and if you feel he is about to betray us to save himself you must be prepared to act in an instant for to tarry for even a moment could cost us all dearly including the life of your woman strangewayes bowed his head a part of him had always feared that swyfte could not be trusted what should i do he whispered there is only one course you must slay him before he drags us all down to hell chapter fourteen grey mist rolled across the river the nightsounds of sleeping london whispered through the fog like the breath of a child at sleep the calls of the beadles the hoots of owls from the wooded shores the splash of oars and creak of rigging along the quayside at greenwich pikemen in burgonets appeared to glide out of the folding cloud darting eyes searched for the foreign agents they had been told were preparing to attack they glowered at the boys heaving cordwood to the beacons hurling abuse to mask their fear beyond the circle of light cast by the sizzling lantern over the inn door two men huddled together in intense conversation both kept their heads down to obscure their identities will swyfte glanced suspiciously at a merchants cart further along the quay the horse snorted and stamped its hooves as the blearyeyed driver nodded in his seat two bickering labourers heaved an oak cask of salt beef off the back of the cart cursing the men lowered the barrel to the cobbles and then trundled it to the winch beside the gauntlet the provisioning of the galleon was almost complete salt fish biscuit wine water and rice all stored in the hold they would be set to sail at dawn as planned will hid his unease it had been seven days since the faerie queens warning three since launceston and carpenter had discovered the frozen soldier on the river bank with nary a sign of the unseelie court then we have agreement the other man enquired sir walter raleigh was many things explorer occasional spy soldier and famed at home and abroad yet since he had fallen from the queens favour he had spent his days skulking away from attention under his cloak his fine midnightblue doublet with jewelled buttons showed he had not lost his taste for flamboyance will noted but his refined features had hardened you have met your side of the bargain it seems your secret society can achieve great things and with speed raleigh turned his face away as one of the labourers strode towards the inn in the ranks of the school of night we have many men of wealth and influence he whispered your request was difficult at such short notice but not impossible he held his hands wide see master swyfte together we can achieve great things wills mind swam with the faces of the men he had learned were part of raleighs conspiracy henry percy the wizard earl and dr dee himself george chapman the playwright thomas harriot who studied the stars and numbers and good kit marlowe raleigh had hinted that there were many more besides men of good standing who showed one face to the queen and another in their private meetings nobles and educated commoners and the brave explorers who had uncovered the darkest secrets of the new world the school of night wished to chart a course away from the neverending war between england and the unseelie court but will suspected the conspirators had a further agenda that had grown out of their love of forbidden knowledge but that was a consideration for another day and your aid is given freely and without obligation he asked with a wry smile he did not wholly trust raleigh nor feel any desire to be indebted to him indeed at that moment he felt there was barely a man in the world that he could trust i am a genial fellow master swyfte but i did not achieve my place in the world by being naive quid pro quo that is how every man does business the spys attention was caught by a golden glow deep in the mist over the river it moved steadily towards them you seem unsettled sir you fear the attack is imminent raleigh asked he followed wills gaze but appeared untroubled i prefer not to lower my guard at this late stage our defences hold for now but the unseelie court are as cunning as snakes the hazy light became a lantern swinging on a pole at the prow of a wherry two oarsmen heaved in unison they were both bearded in the manner of watermen their thick woollen cloaks wrapped tight against the nights chill the charm boat raleigh asked will nodded it sails an unceasing course between the twin banks with dees magical concoctions and amulets aboard the unseelie court will not be able to use the wide thames as a route into the heart of london he thought how desperate they had all become dees protective magics had given them the illusion of security for so long they had grown to think they were immune to the terrors that waited in the night now they had all been revealed as frightened children from the lowest in the land to the queen herself as the wherry eased out of the grey curtain he saw it carried three passengers on the benches near the stern the small hunched shape in a hooded black cloak could only be cecil come to inspect the provisioning of the gauntlet will watched the figure coldly the other two men had the look of guards implacable stares broad shoulders hands hidden inside cloaks where their daggers lay i must away before the little elf sees me raleigh said with a grimace that befanged spider squatting in the centre of his web is an echo of the queen and she sees me as betrayer though in truth it is more a matter of wounded pride but quickly our bargain in return for the aid given to you by the school of night we require your loyalty treason then raleigh shrugged matters are never so bald it is my intention to launch another expedition to the new world shortly i would meet with the unseelie court perhaps common ground can be found we may learn from their vast knowledge of the mysteries that underpin existence and thereby enrich the lives of all men or the enemy may eradicate you in the blink of an eye nevertheless it is a risk worth taking i would ask that if you return from the new world you relate to me personally all that you learned there elizabeth does not need to know will nodded but kept his eyes guarded i have served the queen well for many years but the time has come for hard choices the ceaseless scheming of monarchs and men of power grows tiresome there are other matters of greater import to me very well raleigh nodded taking this as acceptance then let us say farewell for now the wherry crunched against the side of the quay and one of the guards called out for the oarsmen to take care will guessed the watermen had been drinking to numb the boredom of their repetitive journey when he turned his attention back to raleigh the other man had melted into the mist striding to the rivers edge will put aside his suspicions about the spymaster and hailed him cecils head jerked up and he glowered anxiety drawing new lines on his face but he took the hand offered him and clambered up the stone steps to the cobbles the queen is safely ensconced in the palace of whitehall with two hundred good men to guard her he said though she is still recovering from her recent ordeal she is determined to lead her people in the defence of england i would expect no less but for now she can only wait and worry if all goes well our sailing will take the heat away for a while at least cecil glanced towards the men rolling barrels up the planks on to the gauntlet and gave a relieved nod wait and worry indeed our sentries round london report that all is calm no hint of threat no sign of anything out of the ordinary perhaps the faerie queen sought to frighten us with lies she has no reason to lie cecil clenched his teeth peering into the mist over the water let them strike then we will show them what fire burns within us it was then that one of cecils men in the wherry half stumbled as he edged towards the stone steps he clutched on to the side to stop himself from pitching into the drink but his velvet cap fell on to the water steadyo the older waterman called in irritation spluttering through a mouthful of sack he had swigged from a skin the burly guard growled a curse under his breath and leaned over the side to reclaim his sodden headgear from where it floated on the black water will felt his chest tighten though he did not know why some instinct perhaps honed in his constant fight for survival leave it he yelled he felt cecils reproving gaze upon him but his own was fixed on the guards hand reaching towards his hat as the mans fingers brushed the inky surface the river boiled all around the man gaped at the churning water that rocked the wherry and then sudden rapid movement erupted screaming the guard pitched on to his back in the bottom of the boat the senior oarsman dropped his skin of sack whirling now cecil gaped what in gods name the waters became as calm as they had been a moment earlier but the guard continued to scream and thrash in the bottom of the wherry the waterman leaned over him his eyes widening in horror will bounded down the stone steps and leapt into the rocking boat thrusting the oarsman to one side he knelt beside the guard whose struggles were easing as shock took hold of him the man had lost his right hand he pawed feebly at the stump with his left moaning teeth had ripped through flesh and bone will saw he had heard tell of a pike in a pool in kent that could consume a man and of sharks the wolves of the sea one of which john hawkins had brought back to a horrified reception in london after his second expedition yet such a monstrous creature in the peaceful thames never had he heard of such a thing as he inspected the wound he realized there was no flow of blood and the surrounding skin had taken on a greyish cast puzzled he brushed the forearm with his fingertips only to recoil in shock the flesh was frozen solid he recalled carpenter and launcestons account of the soldier turned to ice at the waters edge only a few nights earlier and felt a sick realization dawn inside him what is wrong with the fool cecil barked a faint tremor lacing his words will peered over the side of the wherry his skin prickling the still water was black and impenetrable turning to the oarsman he said see this poor soul is cared for i fear he will not survive this torment with renewed purpose he leapt back up the stone steps and raced past cecil who waved his arms in confusion catching hold of one of the labourers he snapped find captain prouty tell him the plans have changed the gauntlet must be made ready to sail as soon as possible if we are short of provisions so be it we will have to survive with empty bellies until we reach our destination but dawn is too late do you understand the labourer shook off his slowwitted expression nodded earnestly and ran towards the inn his shoes cracking on the cobbles will turned as cecil hurried up to him breathless and angry that he had been ignored i must take the charm boat back to the other bank will said before the spymaster could speak i have urgent business to conclude before we sail speak to me swyfte cecil roared shaking his fists in the air what is happening will looked towards the mistshrouded water but thought only of the silent nightworld beneath its surface we thought ourselves untouched we believed we had time on our side but the war is already under way and our advantage long since gone chapter fifteen do you understand nat lives are depending on you will tried to keep the crack of disquiet out of his voice his young assistant blinked blearyeyed from being woken and turned away from will to find his shoes at the end of the bed riding hard i will be at tilbury in no time he said he glanced back at his master stung by what he perceived to be an understated criticism i have never let you down before i could not have wished for a better assistant the need for urgency is more to do with the severity of unfolding events than any reflection on your abilities will softened thinking back to how inexperienced his assistant had been when his father had entrusted him to the spys employ angry at being torn from his village life and thrust into a dangerous world where he was never allowed to ask any questions nathaniel had grown into the job and learned a maturity beyond his years though his tongue remained as sharp as ever will trusted him more than any other man and took his vow to protect him with the utmost seriousness never had he revealed any hint of the unseelie court or the threat they represented for nathaniel the world was still a sunny place where things happened as they ought and in that way he was kept from a life of madness in bedlam nat perched on the edge of the bed still eyeing his master askance it troubles me when your tongue is not sharp am i still lost in dreams or are you awash with sack and still seduced by the honeyed words of some doxy at liz longshankss i can find some words to lash you with if that gives you comfort nat will strode to the window and peered out over the palace no longer sleeping candlelight gleamed in window after window with new flames flickering to life by the moment the fog hung heavy over the secret courtyards and maze of shadowed paths among the grand buildings muffling the shouts of the sentries on the walls and the tread of marching pikemen preparing for a threat that none of them truly comprehended no let me savour this moment his shoes on nathaniel rose and took a steadying breath yes this must be how employment is for every other man apart from the being woken in the middle of the night to risk my life on rogueinfested byways without a crust to break my fast will looked back at the young man and saw the innocence that still nestled in his heart he almost remembered how that used to feel nat you have been a good and loyal servant he began nathaniels eyes narrowed with suspicion and there you go again what have i been consigned to the block and no one told me hear me out i promised your father that i would guide you and keep you safe in truth i have learned as much from you and your honest hopeful nature as you ever have from me will said choosing his words carefully but now i have taught you all i can and after this task is complete i release you from my service nathaniel looked as if hed been slapped have i wronged you in some way you have exceeded all expectations nat this is a reward not a punishment will smiled to soften the blow but he felt a pang of sadness that he had to turn his back on his faithful assistant after all they had shared what if i do not wish to leave your service do my views matter will turned back to the window to avoid his assistants hurt gaze i plan to write a letter of recommendation that will gain you any position in london that you would wish for he continued you have lived with danger long enough you deserve to make a life for yourself where there is some material reward a wife children peace not this business of sweat and blood and shadows nathaniel started to speak but will silenced him with a hand and sent him on his way he knew the curt dismissal had wounded nat but if he had allowed any space the young man would have woven a tissue of words of argument and protest there was little time for that and no point much as he would miss his friend and he would greatly he had spoken truly this was the best reward he could offer nathaniel hope freedom and the opportunity for a fresh start drawing a stool to the trestle in one corner he took the quill and inkpot and by the light of the candle flame wrote the letter of recommendation his name at the bottom alone would buy nathaniel a good future even that did not feel enough once done he put aside his regrets and raced to the black gallery where carpenter was drinking sullenly by the roaring fire launceston paced the room in silence like some ghastly revenant will told them what had taken place at greenwich the two spies grasped the implications without any need for explanation and together the three men made their way through the fog to the palaces river gate kneeling on the jetty carpenter peered at the black ripples lapping against the posts what foulness now resides here he asked something with teeth which carries with it the bitter cold of winter will replied you would do well to keep your face away from the water if you do not wish to be left with a permanent grin find strangewayes and then make ready a wherry to take us to greenwich i have one final piece of business to attend to and by then captain prouty should be ready to sail hrrrm launceston mused as he peered into the fog is it wise to take to the water we do not have the time to cross the bridge and ride along the bank to greenwich the river is faster and no vessel has been disturbed so far the earl replied will left the two men to select one of the boats tied to the pier and went in search of grace but as he hurried through the still palace corridors to where the queens ladiesinwaiting slept she found him first he saw in an instant that trouble awaited him her cheeks were flushed and her eyes blazed wrapped in an emerald cloak she strode up to him and snapped i have just seen nat he is concerned for you i fear for your sanity grace do not play games with me i am no fool she thrust her face towards his nat is a good man and although he has spent long years at your side he has not grasped the true twisted paths your own mind follows and you have will said remaining calm at some level we were joined by the tragedy of my sisters disappearance will swyfte that terrible event set us apart from the rest of the world yet in its shared misery bonded us yes i do know how you think i know what shapes you what drives you whatever face you present to the world a hero loved by all a drunken fool a rake who fornicates with doxies i see the sadness and the hardness and the determination and when you give nat such a glorious reward i know it means only one thing that you believe you are sailing off to die graces perception caught will offguard and for a moment he could not find the words to respond a bleak smile leapt to her lips when she saw that she was right but her expression quickly darkened grace do not make this more difficult than it needs to be you have dwelt in the shadow of jennys disappearance for so long that you can no longer see the light you welcome death as a release from your pain i sail to rescue dr dee not to end my own existence he saw the determination in her face the echo of the elder sister he loved and that only lacerated him more we have been close you and i and there was a time when i wished us to be closer still she said and now you would come here and bid me farewell as if you were only crossing the river to drink in bankside i deserve better you always did grace but i gave you only what i could let us part in a manner that will bring us both some comfort in the weeks and months ahead not with harsh words that we will come to regret he would miss her and nat too and all of london but he had lived in the halfworld for too long he could not go on that way for good or ill there had to be an ending very well she said stepping forward to kiss him on the cheek but you must vow to do all in your power to return to me step away from her will turned to see strangewayes standing at the end of the corridor his rapier drawn the redheaded spy looked furious will sighed tobias it is not as it appears grace began but jealousy seemed to consume the other man he ran towards them will drew his own blade and parried the younger mans wild thrust sheathe your weapon you are acting like some wounded child he snapped adding baffled why do you behave in this manner that merely drove strangewayes to greater rage you know grace keeps a flame for you in her heart and you trifle with her affections to swell the head of the great will swyfte do you care for no one but yourself curb your tongue you will regret this outburst englands greatest spy strangewayes sneered what a confection that is you are a wastrel and your time is done i am the future he thrust again with more care this time will deflected the attack once again the other spy had some skill will saw but it was still raw given time he would be as great as he imagined himself to be now tobias if you love me as you say you do end this grace demanded angrily you are mistaken in your suspicions but will saw that strangewayes hurt pride would not let him back down in a flash he clashed rapiers spinning the other man offbalance and then cuffed him on the right ear strangewayes crashed against the wall dazed your heart is in the right place if your head is not will said i am glad you love grace enough to risk your neck but this is a futile display everything we have fought for now hangs by a thread and i do not have the time to knock sense into you if you continue to fight i will run you through and leave you here to die though grace hate me for evermore do you understand strangewayes glared but the defiance had been knocked out of him will turned back to grace and took her hand fare you well grace i hope we will see each other again tears sprang to her eyes tell her strangewayes pleaded when he saw her sadness tell her what we face silence will snapped allowing the threat to surface in his eyes she deserves to know the truth no stories for children no false comforts tell her so she can put her thoughts in order if we do not return i said silence will flicked the tip of his rapier to strangewayes throat you are young you have only just learned the secret knowledge that we share the knowledge that can destroy goodminded people i have considered this matter greatly while at prayer grace is strong enough will dug the tip of the blade deeper raising a bubble of blood you think you are doing her a kindness but it is only cruelty i say one final time silence very well but now it is my turn to say goodbye will watched the other mans face he wondered briefly if it wouldnt be simpler to kill him there and then but then grace took his wrist and gently eased his sword away he will not tell me your secrets dear will she murmured i will not allow him to will held her gaze for a long moment he felt a deep affection and only wanted her to be happy he thought that perhaps she understood putting up his sword he walked away without another word in the shadows at the end of the corridor he glanced back strangewayes held her in an embrace whispering in her ear he was not the man will would have chosen for her but he loved her and at that moment that seemed enough back at the jetty carpenter and launceston argued pacing around each other like dogs preparing to fight they grew silent when they saw will and clambered into the wherry where a lantern glowed on a pole in the prow carpenter eyed the water with unease the earl hummed tunelessly as he selected an oar a moment later strangewayes joined them in sullen silence flashing one unguarded look at will as he found a place beneath the lantern he pulled the hood of his cloak up and kept his head down take us out into the current will said but have a care as we ride the fast water at the bridge a dip will bring more than a chill to our bones do you lie awake at night searching for increasingly elaborate ways to kill us carpenter grumbled undoing the rope tied to the quayside ring he grasped another oar and pushed the wherry out into the flow my intention is to keep your days interesting john will crouched in the bottom of the wherry and peered into the dark water the bank faded into the fog as the grey enveloped them the lapping of the river grew muffled and distorted will cocked his head and looked around but he could neither see nor hear any sign of the greatest city in europe they could have been alone in all england drifting through a wilderness carpenter and launceston heaved slow measured strokes each man watching the point where his blade dipped into the river as if he expected the oar to be torn from his grasp when they had moved downstream in silence for a few moments strangewayes wrenched to one side and pointed there will felt an eddy that rocked the wherry twas the length of a seal at least strangewayes said with unease perhaps larger still i saw grey skin just break the surface there too launceston pointed on the other side of the boat it swims fast to circle us so quickly no will said looking around not one many see in the circle of lanternlight round the prow they saw repeated rapid movement at the surface the wherry rocked more vigorously all around the sound of splashing echoed they are like salmon at spawn carpenter said have we disturbed them in our passing not fish strangewayes whispered leaning back will moved to the prow and leaned over the edge grey shapes flashed past arching their bodies and rolling near the surface before diving down he fixed his gaze until one passed in front of him he saw a face that was human in shape though longer and thinner than most mens with hollow cheeks and huge lidless eyes straggly hair like seaweed streamed down from the top of the skulllike head yet it was the mouth that burned in wills mind lipless with two rows of needlesharp teeth forming a permanent grimace sharp enough to tear off a mans hand he thought the skin was pale merging into mottled grey and as the unearthly creature darted from view he caught a glimpse of an eellike lower body ending in fins neither man nor fish but both he said in a cheery tone that belied his unease row a little harder lads he still could not guess what the unseelie court hoped to achieve with these creatures although they buffeted the wherry as they swam past they made no attempt to overturn the boat in the taverns around tilbury seamen tell of such things swimming in northern waters it is considered a bad omen to see one launceston informed the others it is a worse omen to see one if you are in the water carpenter muttered they fell silent watching the churning river will began to count the number of times the creatures broke the surface but soon gave up and then as suddenly as it had begun the disturbance in the water ended and the thames was quiet again carpenter and launceston bent to the oars vigorously the wherry forged on when the current grew stronger as they neared london bridge strangewayes shivered and said has winter come early will knew what the younger spy meant the air had become distinctly colder his breath misted he peered out across the water puzzled and thought he glimpsed something that troubled him strangewayes passed him the lantern and he stood in the stern and held it high the light glinted off the river now he understood the purpose of the swimming creatures and why the sailor and cecils guard had seen their flesh turn to ice row faster he called with urgency ride the fastest current under the bridge never mind the danger our time is running out the thames was freezing chapter sixteen ice glittered around the stone pillars rising from the river in the growing cold the fog was thinning the narrow arch of the bridge supporting its jumble of merchants houses and shops began to appear out of the grey the night was filled with the thunderous rush of water between the supports as launceston and carpenter heaved on the oars to guide the wherry to the centre of the flow will watched their labours shouting encouragement or guidance when they drifted too far to one side or the other he had seen more than one vessel dashed to pieces on the bridge pillars most watermen would not risk the turbulent currents and dropped their passengers short of the bustling bridge to walk to where they could hail another boat on the other side the spies did not have that luxury and now the risk was even greater the briefest dip in the water would see them torn to pieces by the creatures that swam there just out of sight despite the chill sweat glistened on carpenters forehead his long hair flicked back with each jerk of his shoulders revealing the pink scarring along the left side of his face heave to the right will yelled as he watched the wherry swirl towards the nearest pillar his face impassive launceston pulled on his oar the boat continued to swing in the violent current as the vessel swept into the dark beneath the bridge will inhaled a blast of dank air the lanternlight flared up the stone support the high tide mark now glistening with hoar frost tobias to me he called throwing off his hood strangewayes lurched along the yawing wherry to wills side as the boat skewed towards the bridge the two men swung their legs out over the side of the boat and pushed them off the pillar carpenter jabbed his oar against the wall and the three of them steadied the drift together they heaved the vessel away will and strangewayes teetered over the churning river until carpenter snatched two handfuls of damp cloak and yanked them to safety the current caught the wildly rocking wherry when it hurled the vessel across the roiling water will crashed on to his back on the bottom by the time he had managed to raise his head they had shot like an arrow out at the other side here the mist hung in wisps he could glimpse candlelight in the windows of the large merchant houses that lined the northern banks a bitter blast of air struck him bony fingers of ice reached out from both edges of the river clutching for the wherry sblood how fast it freezes strangewayes exclaimed glancing back will saw that a white sheet now covered most of the thames the ice appeared to be spreading from upstream where they had witnessed the frantic activity of the pale fishcreatures he imagined their ritual dance through the dark depths drawing up the cold power as they weaved together the final strands of their supernatural masters scheme will began to grasp the true scale of the unseelie courts plan dees tattered defences were still strung out invisibly across london reinforced by the wards cecil had put in place round the citys boundaries and the quay at greenwich but the thames a silver lance piercing through to the heart of london had always proved the most difficult to protect as they rounded the bend of the river along the narrowing black channel wills worst fears were confirmed the charm boat was locked in the ice not far from the north bank the two watermen were futilely hammering their oars on the white glaze it cracked like dry wood but held firm no longer able to maintain the ritual path the frozen wherry had left the river route open to the enemy carpenter launceston and strangewayes saw the icebound boat and looked back to will with unease he nodded they will soon be here the other mens heads fell but only for a moment carpenter and launceston threw themselves into their oarstrokes driving the wherry forward the gauntlet will be trapped at the quay strangewayes called what chance have we of freeing it from the ice before the attack comes we will do what we must wills voice was grim he pulled his cloak around him against the cold and rested one foot on the side as he searched the sky for the ruddy glow from greenwichs beacons a band of orange sky flared behind the silhouettes of trees houses and the great bulk of the palace of placentia wrinkling his nose at the ash caught on the breeze will finally saw the stark outline of masts and felt a surge of hope but only a thin black strand of water stretched out ahead their hair and eyebrows white with frost carpenter and launceston shuddered as they struggled to get good strokes with their oars the wherry bumped against the encroaching ice on either side time and again finally the boat came to a juddering halt the keel groaned from the pressure of the rime forming around it abandon ship lads will called the shivering spies hauled themselves out of the wherry each one gingerly testing the ice before putting his full weight on it the frozen river crunched underfoot will scrubbed the white glaze off the surface with the sole of his shoe through the neartransparent newly formed ice he glimpsed movement the fishcreatures glided just beneath their feet as if it could read his thoughts one came to a halt in the space will had created and peered up at him with those unblinking eyes it gnashed its needleteeth once and then swam away on the river they could have been in muscovy in winter putting his head down into the chill wind will headed towards the silhouetted masts the crunch of his footsteps echoed across the still waste the other men followed their breath clouding after a few moments the golden lights of the quayside inn glittered through the stark trees and will could make out the shape of the gauntlet leaning askew under the force of the ice that had formed around it before he could take another step strangewayes called out the fog returns will turned to see a low wall of mist reaching from bank to bank at their backs but this fog was a pearly white and seemed to glow with an inner luminescence it rolled towards them as if a tailor were unfurling a bolt of cloth faint stars twinkled in its midst make for the quay as fast as your legs will carry you he urged the spies raced towards the inns lights slipping and sliding with each step so that will feared they would fall and break their necks when he could smell the acrid stink of the pitch on the gauntlets hull he paused and looked back tall grey figures were emerging from the mist cloaks billowing behind them they stalked towards greenwich grasping swords spears and axes will felt a chill sweep through him even deeper than the one brought by the frozen river a droplet of blood fell from his nose and froze before it hit the ice the unseelie court were in opposition to nature and every sense rebelled whenever they were near their clothes had a timeless feel bucklers and leather belts breeches and boots all of them silvery grey as if they considered colour too much of a celebration of life for things that flirted with death long hair lashed in the wind their faces were the colour of frost shadows pooling around their eyes scanning the steadily advancing group he counted around thirty small in number yet devastating in force we have a fight on our hands the wind plucked his words away and if we fall this night england is lost he turned and raced up the icy stone steps that led up to the quay where a crowd of puzzled onlookers had gathered to see the frozen thames at his back the winter storm swept in chapter seventeen will bounded on to the quayside calling to the pikemen cecil had set to guard the gauntlet gather your weapons and prepare for the fight of your lives he knew he was probably sending them to their deaths but their sacrifice would not be forgotten if the ship could be freed from its icy prison he caught the officer of the guard by the arm and leaned in to whisper tell your men not to look those bastards in the eye nor listen to their words they will undermine you with lies and deceit keep your eyes on their weapons and kill without mercy the captain nodded running towards his men barking orders their cuirasses rattling as they ran the defenders hurried down the stone steps on to the ice should we join them in battle launceston peered towards the pale figures drawing in on the quay i need you here to help marshal the crew and these labourers we must break the ice around the gauntlet and carve a path out to where the river remains unfrozen unsettled whispers rustled across the quayside the crowd grew in number as attention fell upon the unseelie court will beckoned for the other spies to gather closer we must prevent these good men from having their sleep ruined for evermore however long that might be after this night he whispered spread the word that it is spanish agents who approach we need all good englishmen to do their part in standing firm against the invaders keep them occupied how do we do that carpenter asked tell them to collect all the pitch from the shipwrights in greenwich and carry the barrels down on to the ice one of you find captain prouty and order him to prepare to sail he will think you mad strangewayes complained mad i am for only one of bedlams abraham men would dare to do what i plan will grinned but this is why the crown selected us for our work we are all mad and as you well know the gods protect fools and lovers he spun round shouting come lads to draw the attention of the gathered crowd carpenter and strangewayes followed suit whipping the men up with shouts and cheers and sending them off to the shipwrights stores marked out by piles of stone ballast along the quayside emerging from the inn with launceston captain prouty tossed aside a mug of ale and bounded up the plank to his ship his orders rang out through the night as he moved across the deck at the mainmast he paused to point up towards the yards will ventured to the edge of the quay on the river the queens men edged away from the safety of greenwich pikes levelled and swords drawn before them the unseelie court advanced with long determined strides heads down into the wind like wolves preparing to fall on a wounded deer will forced himself not to rush to the aid of the men their sacrifice had bought him time turning back to the frantic activity along the dockside he jumped on to the plank leading up to the galleon and demanded more haste in a voice that carried across the docks as the labourers trundled the barrels of pitch from the stores the spy directed them to carry their casks down the steps to the ice and there lay them in a line from the ships prow out into the river carpenter and strangewayes marshalled another group of men to collect axes and the longhafted hammers that the boatbuilders used to drive wedges to split timber captain prouty insisted i inform you that he does indeed think you are mad launceston murmured as he urged the men on drawn sword in his hand then we are all in agreement this is not a place for sane men bring the others and let us wallow in our madness will eased into the flow of men trudging down on to the ice once the barrels of pitch were laid out in a line he ordered a labourer to stand beside each cask with a hammer or an axe and on his signal smash it open when his arm fell the crashes of splintering wood drowned out the clash of steel and tormented cries echoing from the battle on the other side of the galleon the pitch spewed out across the hoarfrost from barrel after barrel flowing stickily into a black line pointing the way to freedom bring me the brand will called a workman thrust the spitting torch into his hand and he lowered the flame to the sable stream the fire licked at the pitch raising bubbles that spattered and crackled after a moment the tar caught acrid smoke whisked up then an orange wall of fire racing out into the middle of the thames cracks like cannonfire boomed out into the night as the searing heat met the biting cold of the frozen river do not wait for the ice to melt will roared as he marched along the line of workmen take your hammers and your axes and smash it to pieces but take care not to fall into the water redfaced from the sweltering fire the men rubbed their hands and spat grasping their tools and swinging them over their heads the iron came down like thunder chunks of glittering ice flew will felt a swell of hope as he saw the jagged cracks race out man after man repeated their strikes until the ice shattered and the spy could glimpse lines of black water keep at it until a channel forms he yelled twirling an upright finger he summoned the attention of carpenter launceston and strangewayes then flicked his hand towards the galleon they raced for the steps on the quay will glanced back as a blazing pool of pitch slid into the water with a sizzle a cloud of steam billowed up when it cleared he saw a trail of broken ice reaching out to the unfrozen channel in the middle of the river launceston gave a satisfied nod let us hope that is enough cheers rose from the labourers as they swung their tools to break more of the ice but then with a resounding crack a large section broke free and turned vertical like a platter tipping off the edge of a table three men standing upon it plunged into the water will closed his eyes knowing what was to come but still he jerked when the screams tore out the dark pool boiled labourers inched towards the edge of the cracked ice reaching out axes towards the thrashing arms but the limbs fell away at odd angles and the churning water turned red after a moment the river calmed as the feeding ended the surviving workmen gaped in horror will stifled his dismay at the deaths and ran up the planks leading on to the galleon master swyfte let us see if this wild plan has found its legs captain prouty boomed from the quarterdeck he was in his fourth decade his face pockmarked and his curly hair streaked with grey at his barked orders crewmen scaled the rigging to unfurl the sails on the forecastle will saw that a clear channel now reached out through the shattered ice widening by the moment would the water freeze over before they could set sail he wondered on the poop deck carpenter called out he leaned over the rail his mouth a grim slash in the flickering light of the ships lantern pointing across the wastes upstream will followed the line of his arm bodies littered the frozen river the white now stained with pools of blood the unseelie court had torn through the resistance the last few pikemen fought on bravely thrusting with their weapons but they seemed like statues against the mercury of their foes the fay whirled their blades slicing open throats lopping off hands or arms or opening up bellies the last man fell like a strand of barley before a scythe as one the unseelie court turned towards the galleon and stood motionless for a moment the bitter breeze whipping their long hair will felt their cold gaze upon him he sensed their contempt for lesser beings and their urge for vengeance and hot blood the moment passed and the grey figures strode forward together slow relentless as if they knew no prey could ever escape them time has run out carpenter said flatly not yet will growled his rapier sang as he drew it from its sheath let them earn their victory with a deep rumble the sails caught the wind and the gauntlet jerked like a horse under whip the hull protested the wood flexing against the hard ice a loud grinding echoed through the night as the vessel pulled free will wondered if the keel would survive its ordeal launceston and strangewayes darted to the rail the younger man glanced up at the billowing sails and uttered a prayer you waste your breath calling to your god carpenter snapped we will not escape greenwich without being tested what hope do we have strangewayes replied in a small wavering voice they die on the end of cold steel like any man will said trying to reassure him whatever they are they breathe their hearts beat their blood flows and it can be spilled strangewayes nodded hiding his fear i am keen to earn my first kill carpenter gave a sarcastic grunt and launceston hummed one eyebrow raised let us put our differences aside will whispered resting one hand on the youngest spys shoulder tonight we watch out for each other the enemy had advanced to within a stones throw of the lurching galleon which seemed to be moving through molasses the cracking and rending of the ice against the hard oak of the hull resounded through the haunted night at the last the fay warriors broke into a run strangewayes was chilled by the sight of the shadowy faces and the silence of the speedy attack will could see but still he grinned believing the fay were incapable of boarding the galleon from the frozen river will knew better prepare to repel the enemy he called hold them off until we reach open water and that is victory enough before strangewayes could question the order the first line of the enemy reached the side of the galleon simultaneously the fay leapt the thuds of the bodies hitting the wood echoed through the vessel the next line of warriors followed peering over the side will and strangewayes glimpsed the fay clinging to the hull like grey spiders their heads swivelled up as one their eyes glowing uttering an oath under his breath the younger spy crossed himself the fay began to climb for england will called his voice rising above the shattering of the ice along the rail any crew members who could be spared drew their swords carpenter moved along their ranks reassuring them with a clap on the back or a touch to the arm will could almost hear his quiet urgings do not look in their faces strike fast whatever you might think they are spanish agents in disguise and then the first head appeared above the rail the skin near as white as the frozen river below the face blessed with high cheekbones and a straight nose yet made like a rose rotting on the stem by the cruelty glittering in the dark eyes before the nearest seaman could even raise his sword the fay warrior lashed out with his left hand talons ripped through the seamans pale throat blood sparkled like rubies in lamplight as the gorespattered fay warrior leapt on to the rail the other men rushed forward levelling swords and swinging cudgels sheer weight of numbers dislodged the boarder but then the silent fay attack erupted in force all along the rail a grey figure swung in front of will the spy parried one strike and pivoted to ram his shoulder against his opponent for a moment they hung together against the rail enveloped in the loamy odour of dark tunnels far underground their eyes met will saw no compassion there only contempt for some rough beast that was almost beneath its notice and then the fay fell backwards and down towards the ice the cries of wounded men echoed across the deck the iron tang of blood caught on the cold breeze when a man fell will darted into the space thrusting with his rapier as each new bonewhite face heaved into view he glimpsed launceston a curious expression on his face as he studied the deep wound his blade had made across the neck of his opponent a lick of his lips a flicker of a smile carpenter swung his sword like a butcher carving a cow with strong hard blows his lips curled back from his teeth and strangewayes darted fast and low each thrust made with grim determination yet the wave of fay warriors seemed as if it would never end lost to the delirious whirl of swords and bodies and the cries and screams and oaths will barely realized the galleon was gathering speed until it lurched free of the ice with such force that it almost threw him from his feet almost there master swyfte captain prouty bellowed from the quarterdeck hold them off a moment longer and we will be away will caught carpenters eyes and they nodded renewing their efforts they yelled encouragement to the men the enemys attack appeared to falter then die away and the spy dared to hope but the resonant cracking of wood signalled a new approach throwing himself to the rail will peered down the hull to where the remaining warriors clung like spiders another crack echoed as a fay tore off a gun port and flung the shattered oak behind him twisting like a snake he slithered through the black square into the vessel to the gun deck will cried beckoning his fellow spies as he raced past the bewildered crew and ducked down through the door in the forecastle he understood the cunning of the unseelie court in the dark cramped gun deck filled with cannon there would be little space for swordplay the enemys speed and strength would give them an even greater advantage he slowed as he stepped into the pitchblack of the lower deck the steely taint of powder hung in the air holding his rapier in front of him he allowed his eyes to adjust to the dark at the far end the lighter night intruded in three shafts where the gun ports had been wrenched off all was still will waved his blade from side to side searching for the attack he knew would come they would lure us into their midst so they can slit our throats unseen launceston breathed at his shoulder let them come to us though the earls words made sense will felt a tingle of apprehension his worry was answered a moment later by a flaring light a flint had been struck a candle flame flickered into life in the open door of a lantern white faces appeared from the gloom like pale fish rising from the sightless depths will saw a triumphant smirk spread across the lips of the fay warrior who held the lantern and he knew what was to come back he yelled keeping his rapier levelled as he urged the other three up the steps we are too late the powder barrel lay on its side its granular black contents flowing across the boards two of the fay warriors darted past the cannon and wriggled out the way they had entered the third stood against the open gun door his gleaming eyes locked on will with a flick of his wrist he released the lantern the guttering flame arced will pounded back up the steps after the others the blast ripped through the heart of the vessel flinging all four spies through the forecastle door and across the main deck his head ringing will felt the ship lurch to one side beneath him grey smoke billowed out of the open door the roar of the raging fire below deck drowned out the terrified cries of the crew will hauled himself on to shaky legs flames were already licking up the side of the stricken vessel curls of sparks whisking towards the sails he reached out a hand to drag carpenter to his feet launceston and strangewayes staggered behind another blast tore open the main deck an orange sheet of flame rushed up through the fissure catching stays and canvas and lines as it swept along the vessel a sailor was caught in the inferno and screaming in agony hurled himself overboard in a bid to quench the flames will choked holding up an arm to protect his face from the searing heat pressing in on every side they had perhaps only a moment before the powder store blew taking the galleon and every man aboard to kingdom come yet the fire beat him back at every turn is this how it ends then strangewayes gasped his face ruddy in the light of the flames for us for england will spun round searching for a path through the conflagration then as the mainmast cracked with a sound like cannonshot the blazing sailcloth plunged down towards them chapter eighteen flames roared up into the night dancing orange light flared across the frozen river as the listing galleon was consumed in the jaws of the conflagration blackened wood cracked and spat black snow fell across the icy waste flakes of charred canvas swirling in the breeze in the trees on the far bank of the thames sir robert cecil watched from under lowered brows and thought of the midwinter fire festivals in the far north no celebration here it was a bonfire of all their hopes after so long holding the unseelie court at bay england was lost sickened he reined in his skittish horse no longer able to see a path ahead what would he tell the queen that dee was lost to them that they should free the faerie queen immediately and plead for mercy from the fay when they came like a storm in the night his bodyguard shifted uncomfortably in his saddle he was a big man his face a map of scars but he sensed his masters dismay and had grown scared swyfte and his men he asked dead and gone they failed us all the galleons powder store exploded the deafening blast a bitter punctuation to his comment a plume of fire soared high above the treetops shards of smouldering timber and burning sailcloth rained down the spymasters horse whinnied in terror and reared up almost throwing him from its back with a curse he fought to bring it under control when the fog of smoke cleared nothing of the gauntlet remained save a few burning staves slipping below the black water cecil covered his eyes hoping the soughing of the wind in the branches would soothe him after the din yet when he raised his head to survey the dismal scene he felt as if despair would be lodged in his heart for ever damn swyfte for raising his spirits after such hope this failure tasted even more bitter back to the palace of whitehall he snarled to his bodyguard i must give the queen my counsel he urged his mount back on to the lonely road to london as he rode his gaze flickered towards the white ribbon of the thames glimpsed through the trees he could no longer see any sign of the misty figures he had witnessed sweeping towards the galleon from a distance they had looked like moonshadows but he knew their true nature even if he had raised the militia they would have stood little chance of repelling the invader the tales of the days when the unseelie court roamed across england without hindrance haunted him and always would the ruined lives the lost souls jane poor jane still visiting him every night without fail as the two riders thundered towards londons walls the bodyguard bellowed to the sentries to open the gates inside the city their hoofbeats rattled off wattle walls candlelight gleamed in windows here and there but the cold streets were empty cecil had thought the explosion at greenwich would have brought the curious and fearful out into the night and he wondered if somehow they all sensed that grim atmosphere stay with your families and pray for all our souls he silently implored and on they rode out of the west gate and up to the palace of whitehall ablaze with lanterns to hold the night at bay within the walls cecil felt the tightness in his chest ease a little an illusion he knew he took in the pikemen marching in their ranks and the sentries lining the walls in preparation for what was undoubtedly to come and then he hurried towards the black gallery he dreaded giving the queen the news that he had failed her elizabeths temper burned hot and he had resolved to lay the blame squarely at swyftes feet when a woman darted out of the shadows to confront him it was the spys mare grace seldon the one swyfte had sworn to protect and who mooned over him like a girl who had yet to bleed she was wrapped in a cloak the colour of forgetmenots but her eyes were pink from lack of sleep her hair had been pulled back with little care and tied with an old ribbon sir pray tell me news of william swyfte she lifted her fineboned face up to him as pale as the moon he came to me in a manner that suggested he feared he would not be returning then you should have listened to him the spymaster barked trying to push by the ladyinwaiting master swyfte has passed from this world god save his meagre soul the womans eyes widened for a moment as she clutched her fluttering hands to her lips before falling back in a swoon cecil regretted his cruel response for the inconvenience it had caused him turning he beckoned to his bodyguard take her to the physician so she does not clutter up this place and do not allow her near me again women were a mystery to him and a weakness to all men swyfte had been proof enough of that he hurried into the black gallery hoping for a moment to order his thoughts before he faced the queen instead he found the earl of essex pacing the chamber in the candlelight the earl was all aglow in a white doublet and halfcompass cloak and breeches the colour of snow a fine show cecil inwardly sneered so wealthy and gallant and charming no smuts would ever dare taint his attire at last the earl snapped stabbing a finger towards the spymaster hiding yourself away to avoid all blame while england burns someone has to keep the wheels of government turning in this time of trouble i suspected you were arranging a ship to flee to flanders or france essex narrowed his eyes you think we can run from them cecil snorted the earl slumped on to a bench head in hands the spymaster glanced at the other man askance surprised to see the usual swagger stripped away we have lived fat for so many years we have forgotten what it was like the bodies in the ditches leaking pus and shit the children stolen from their cribs women turned to stone and men left blind or mad essex ran his fingers through his lustrous hair perhaps we should run whatever you say they will come for us first the ones who kept them at bay and colluded in the imprisonment of their queen not the ignorant common man who goes about his life with eyes only on the next meal if we earned ourselves even a day more of life that would be of some value cecil lumbered to the hearth and tossed another log on the fire it had grown chill in the room i would hold your tongue sir he replied with unconcealed disgust we do not run like rats we have sworn an oath to stand by the queen and england essex stared into the corner of the chamber unable to meet the other mans eye the privy council cecil asked has gathered as you requested what will be your advice to the queen before the spymaster could answer pounding feet drew nearer and the door crashed open a pikeman lurched in his helmet askew and his cheeks flushed the spymaster could see the flames of fear licking in the mans eyes i plead indulgence for this rude entry sirs the man stuttered but your your attendance has been requested by whom cecil snapped the pikeman moistened his dry mouth men wait upon the frozen river men his voice trailed away and his blank gaze roamed the room as he recalled what he had witnessed the spanish the spymaster said the ones who plot against the crown it was a small kindness he knew but it allowed the pikeman an opportunity to pretend the man nodded they would meet upon the river to discuss the terms of englands surrender cecil threw a hard look at essex fetch the privy council we should face this rabble shoulder to shoulder and show what englishmen are made of essex bowed briefly and left the pikeman followed once he was alone the spymaster threw his head back and sucked in a gulp of air trying to stop the shaking of his hands he found the privy council gathered near the river gate beadyeyed and greybearded like a murder of crows in their black gowns shivering in the chill coming off the river cecil flapped a hand to urge the sentries to drag open the gates he stared at the widening crack with mounting dread feeling his heart beat in rhythm to the creaks and groans of the protesting hinges finally the gates crashed wide with a resounding thoom cecils breath caught in his throat at first the expanse of white river appeared empty a cold wind moaned over the icy wastes the stark branches of the trees across the thames on bankside whisked but just as he began to hope that the enemy had departed he glimpsed movement as if a hunting party were emerging from a thick fog grey figures appeared in the centre of the frozen river silent sentinels watching him with hatefilled eyes long hair and bonewhite faces doublets and bucklers and breeches silvery with mildew as if they had been stored in dank cellars on either side and behind the tight knot of the main group of ten or so warriors waited they appeared misty their features hidden as if glimpsed through a haze cecil swallowed then he pushed up his chin and marched out he prayed the privy council were following him resisting the urge to look back he walked out along the jetty and climbed the short wooden ladder down to the ice through clear patches around his feet he could see pale shapes swimming near the surface of the river beneath he shivered feeling himself moving into a world he no longer understood the spymaster came to a halt four swordlengths from the unseelie courts representatives he turned a cold face towards them but would not could not meet their gaze at the centre of the group was a tall figure with long black hair a sallow complexion and a beard and moustache waxed into points beneath a felt cap shadows pooled in the eyes but cecil noted a cruel turn to the pursed lips this one is the leader the spymaster decided i am lansing of the high family the fay said in a whispery voice that somehow carried over the sighing of the wind all you hoped for has turned to ashes these are the final days have you made your peace with your god we are not afraid of you cecil hoped the defiance in his voice rang true your last hope has died with the burning of your ship the fay continued as if he had not heard the spymasters comment this moment was inevitable from the instant you betrayed us and stole our queen i find it laughable that you ever thought otherwise we held you at bay for many years the blink of an eye in the way we see time we are eternal we watch and we wait and we make our plans and when the time comes we strike be it years or decades how you must hate us cecil sneered lansing knitted his brow hate do you hate the beasts of the field they are to be herded and punished when disobedient and slaughtered should we see fit is that not how it is in your fields he looked across the troubled faces and then raised his gaze to the lights of the palace you lived in caves once you hunted with stones and sticks you whispered oaths to the moon and the trees and the wind we watched you as you sat around your fires praying the night would end when you sowed your seeds we were there when you raised the stones and built your homes of timber and turf when you tamed the horses and made weapons of iron always a whisper away one corner of his mouth crinkled in a puzzled smile and then you challenged us he looked directly in cecils face i have peeled back your skin and your flesh and broken your bones and delved into the smallest part of you and i have found you wanting this judgement has been made and now the time for talk is done and silence must fall bring me our queen and prepare for the harrowing the spymaster sifted through lansings words seeing meaning hidden in the shadows behind them as only a spymaster could he smiled quick and fast no he said the fays eyes narrowed if you want her take her in a single fluid movement the earl of essex drew his sword in readiness for a fight as did a number of the younger privy councillors yet the unseelie court remained as still as the ice beneath their feet the cold wind tugged at their hair its whispers the only sounds across the desolate river as he searched those unreadable faces with their unblinking eyes cecil felt a moment of satisfaction he spun on his heel turning up his nose at the aged members of the privy council who had been cowering behind him follow me he said to them with only a hint of contempt and strode back towards the jetty even at such a moment he found himself smiling inwardly at the notion of the deformed little man he knew himself to be piping on the rats who had always secretly mocked him he felt the fay leaders cold gaze upon him but he did not look back once he had passed the river gate he leaned against the stone wall shaking yet proud of himself gathering himself he turned to the other men we die with dignity not as cowards let us to the queen and see if we can find a sliver of hope in this time i have bought us with that he marched away head high chapter nineteen silence haunted the dusty privy council chamber in the candlelight the blank face of elizabeth queen of england and all its dominions glowed as white as a death mask the makeup so thick to hide the ravages of age and high office that flakes intermittently fell to the lace ruff round her neck her eyes though were black pebbles of despair cecil thought she saw the end of her reign of all england she folded her hands in the lap of her golden skirts and looked around the sallow faces of her councillors few would meet her gaze finally her eyes alighted on the spymaster sir robert it seems only you have the courage to speak throw me some crumbs of comfort cecil bowed your highness these are indeed the worst of times our hopes of bringing dr dee home to bolster our defences have been dashed by our enemys cunning we feared an impending invasion he moistened his lips measuring elizabeths mood from halflidded eyes and yet in my encounter with those blackhearted fiends pon the frozen thames i spied a sliver of hope or at the least a moment to catch our breath you almost lost all our lives there and then with your play of defiance you flybitten wheyface essex muttered just behind the spymasters shoulder ignoring his rival cecil continued in recent times our enemy have shown no desire to negotiate they take what they want and yet they come to us demanding that we bring their queen to them why do they not storm this palace and seize her themselves he paused for effect raising his chin because they cannot if the threads of dees defences still hold they will not do so for much longer little elf the inevitable has only been delayed that is true your majesty then what use is the time you have bought us the queen leaned forward on her throne her brow knitting beneath her auburn wig majesty i would suggest a final desperate gamble cecil had thought long and hard about the options left to them while he waited for the queen to make her way to the council chamber he knew elizabeth well she was not weak in times of anger or fear she had a strong stomach for courses that would be unpalatable to many speak she said even dry bread is a feast to a beggar you are right to say our defences will crumble soon without dr dee to bring his magics back to them yet we have one thing of value one thing only but it is a jewel beyond measure the faerie queen herself she will not offer us mercy elizabeth snapped no but she has one other thing to offer us her life a shocked murmur ran through the blackgowned men at his back cecil watched the same shock light elizabeths eyes yet she had steeled herself once to order the execution of another queen and that queen her cousin could the removal of one as despised as their immortal enemy really be a step too far certainly they had never encountered a more desperate time my counsel your majesty is that we build a pyre to the very top of the lantern tower should the unseelie court threaten us further we set it alight and burn their queen alive in her prison and watch her die as we ourselves go down in flames the unseelie court would not risk losing the only thing of value to them it is a balance it is a foolish notion the queens eyes blazed do you think we can keep the unseelie court at bay for ever while our men stand by with brands once the defences collapse they will be working their magics in every corner of the land they will attempt to steal me out from under your nose sir robert and place me on a pyre tempting you to blink first cecil bowed his head for a moment allowing the monarch to calm and then he replied in a quiet voice it is all we have your majesty elizabeth slumped back in her throne her chin falling to her chest this may not hold for ever your majesty in the end we may all go down in flames though knowing we have inflicted a wound that will burn our enemy for all time and yet the unseelie court are cautious time as their representative told me means nothing to them they will not take rash action and so we may earn respite for a day a week a month a year while we search for some new defence and live in dread never knowing if each night will be our last i would rather the queen caught the word in her throat and shook her head while there is life there is hope but only dr dee has ever found a way to shut out those foul creatures where will we turn in this hour of need cecil knew he had no answer but he was spared a hollow reply outside the door argumentative voices could be heard elizabeth scowled at the disturbance what is the meaning of this intrusion the spymaster called with a flamboyant sweep of his white cloak essex strode over and threw the door open the two pikemen who guarded the entrance to the chamber had crossed their weapons to bar a young man it was swyftes assistant nathaniel colt flushed and sweating his forehead streaked with the dirt of the road behind him the spymaster glimpsed the young woman grace seldon the news of her friends death had clearly sloughed off her with surprising speed for her face had hardened and she looked to have recovered her fire she pressed the assistant forward against the pikes the young man saw the queen on her throne and bowed his head your majesty he murmured playing with his cap have you lost your wits cecil demanded do you wish to call the tower home sir nathaniel stuttered i i must speak to you he glanced back at grace and found new strength in her determined look on a matter of great urgency he continued with a deep bow i have a message from my master chapter twenty the rising sun had set the sky ablaze gulls wheeled in the salty wind blowing from the east greeting the morn with hungry cries the forest of masts silhouetted against the red glow swayed as the great vessels strained at their anchors in tilbury docks on the wide grey thames the slap of sailcloth and the crack of rigging accompanied the shanties of the sailors on the only galleon abuzz with activity to most of those who crowded into the taverns lining the quay the tempest was a ship of mysterious purpose none knew the vessel had been set aside long ago for use by the secret service a ghost in the ledgers of the quay master and the queens tax men often coming and going under cover of the night with a crew that rarely mixed with the other seadogs shielding his eyes against the brassy dawn light will swyfte allowed himself a tight smile of approval his black and silver doublet was still smeared with ashes and soot from the fire aboard the gauntlet and the ends of his hair were singed a small price to pay he knew you have done us proud sir walter he said with a nod and you are a cunning dog master swyfte and a man after my own heart raleigh clapped his hands together grinning at the success of the deception in his limegreen doublet and ochre cloak he looked out of place on the quayside with its barrels of stinking pitch dusty piles of ballast and heaps of dung from the merchants carthorses two ships provisioned one by the queen and one by the school of night one in full view and one in secret keep a door open for a quick exit that has always been my code will closed his eyes and saw once again the wall of orange flame that had engulfed the gauntlet but they had been ready the rowing boat towed along behind the galleon had always been their planned escape route should they come under concerted attack while the other seamen leapt into the river only to be consumed in a whitewater frenzy by the ferocious creatures swimming there he had battled through the flames with the other three spies at the sterncastle he launceston carpenter and the young spy strangewayes had slid down the oiled rope into the dinghy and rowed away an insignificant speck beside the blazing ship the fast current had swept them towards tilbury where nathaniel awaited them ready to be despatched to the palace of whitehall raleigh eyed the other man askance you knew the unseelie court would be lured by the gauntlet and once that vessel was destroyed they would have no reason to believe you had prepared a second ship a strong plan a winning one he paused have you made your peace with the loss of the good men who died in the attack will raised his head to watch the sailors climbing the lines like monkeys as if he had not heard every war has its casualties their sacrifice will not be forgotten he said after a moment though raleigh nodded the spy could hear the unspoken codicil the men had not been asked to give up their lives and would not have accepted if they had with each day it seemed he made another accommodation with his conscience how far was he prepared to go to bring jenny home how many lives was he prepared to sacrifice he had no answer though he wondered if the unseelie courts bleak judgement of human nature was true he cast an unsettled glance back along the winding thames i fear i must take my leave time is of the essence our enemy will not be blind to my guile for much longer and we must reach open water before they give pursuit but i thank you for your aid i am in your debt raleigh tugged at his beard and smiled you are indeed master swyfte do not forget our agreement raleigh played a long game not so far removed from the machinations of the unseelie court will realized the information he brought back from the new world should he ever return would be more valuable than gold to the school of night the great men who made up the numbers of the secret society could translate knowledge into power with ease but what were they plotting why was the new world so important to them raleigh would certainly never tell with a smile and a nod the explorer slipped into the shadowy alley beside the shipwrights workshop where he had tethered his horse turning back to the tempest will pushed past the queue of men carrying the last of the provisions up the plank at the poop deck rail he searched the broad river to the west where the grey fug of londons home fires tainted the sky no sign yet of any pursuit but it would come the wolves of the unseelie court would sniff the wind and know their prey was loose master swyfte we are ready to sail the booming voice cut through the raucous singing of the labouring sailors captain john courtenay was a giant of a man seasoned by the sun and the salty wind his brown beard and hair proudly untamed no other could be trusted to lead the expedition into the dangerous uncharted waters that lay ahead a veteran of the new world he knew all that had yet been learned of that mysterious place he knew of the trade routes where they might encounter heavily armed spanish galleons bringing their rich hauls of silver and spices back to europe and of the river inlets bristling with fleets of small boats filled with indians with blowpipes he knew too of the plants that brought sickness and death and of those that supplied bountiful fruit of the taste of the wind that heralded a tropical storm he had helped claim nova albion for the crown and had been at sir francis drakes side during the sacking of cartagena and the capture of san augustin in spanish florida and yet there were some who believed him quite mad bloody jack they called him the seadog who tore out the throats of his enemies with his teeth and dyed his beard bloodred before every battle will wondered if that wild nature was the result of the torture the captain had received at the hands of the spanish his mind as scarred as his face which was marred by a ragged pink x that ran from temple to jaw yet for what lay ahead a madman was the sanest choice of all unfurl your sails captain we cannot depart soon enough do ye have a course for me yet soon take us out of the channel and into the wide atlantic and then i will have what you need but i must warn you we venture close to the very home of the unseelie court he waited for the captain to berate him for embarking on a quest that could only be suicide for every man aboard instead courtenay laughed too loud finally we shall take the battle to those pale bastards too long have we cowered master swyfte let them come in their thousands with their magics and their creatures and their phantoms let them drag me down to hell i will take down a hundred for every man we lose and die with no fear in my eyes will saw the unsettling gleam in bloody jacks eye no other man would go so willingly to the source of the nightmares that had plagued humankind since eden he knew then he had made the right choice bloody jack threw his arms wide and burst into song striding back to the main deck to watch his men swarming up the rigging to the yards will stared into the distance the hairs on the back of his neck prickling the sun was turning gold in a cloudless blue sky and haze hung over the river where it flowed towards the sea it was a good day and likely to be warm for the season he frowned his spirits should have been soaring but all he could sense were the shadows closing in on every side on the quarterdeck carpenter and launceston stood against the rail bickering will had seen the signs and he feared carpenters mood was growing darker still the unseelie court had a way of infecting men with a creeping despair that usually ended in death carpenter should have been stripped of his duties and given time to recover yet here will was taking the wounded man to the very heart of the thing that was slowly destroying him as for launceston who knew what moved in his dark depths yet did that give will the right to lead the earl by his nose to his potential doom and there on the forecastle was strangewayes still struggling to come to terms with the haunted world in which he found himself will had stolen him from grace denying two people happiness in one fell swoop and hurting one whom he had professed to protect he turned away from his men feeling the weight of his decision had he damned everyone he knew and his own soul in the process he wondered if it was the natural order for men to become as terrible as the things they fought yet the stakes were high and no reward was easily bought this was the path he had chosen and no other would lead to victory as the wind filled the sails and the anchor rose from the river in a cascade of glittering jewels the tempest began to pull away from the quay gathering speed will leaned on the rail watching the fields move away from him and the oaks and elms and all that he knew and he wondered if he would ever see england again chapter twentyone the poop deck heaved on the heavy swell and a good wind filled the sails under blue skies the tempest scudded towards the new world bearing down hard on the darkness and the mystery yet will and captain courtenay stood at the rail and looked out across the choppy water at their back they watched a wall of grey cloud rolling across the whitetopped waves on the eastern horizon keeping pace with the galleon both men felt uneasy master swyfte i fear we have a problem captain courtenay removed the beechwood and brass telescope from his eye if that is a natural formation then i am a toadspotted skainsmate will took the telescope and studied the drifting fog even so powerful a tool as dr dees most recent invention could not pierce that dense cloud no sign of pursuit had troubled them as the tempest sailed out of the channel past southern ireland and into the wide atlantic but when that strange cloud appeared one hour ago will had felt the first prickle of unease does it appear to you to be drawing closer he asked hard to tell the ocean plays tricks on the wits i have seen seasoned sailors look at the green waves and believe them the fields of their home they step out to walk a while and sink straight to the bottom bloody jack took back the telescope and shoved it into the waist of his saltstained breeches and islands that seem a cannonshot away can take days to reach then there is little we can do but watch and wait will replied and if it is some threat unleashed by the unseelie court we must be prepared to act courtenay threw his head back and laughed you have indeed led us by the nose into hell master swyfte should we fight the devils at our back or flee towards the devils that lie ahead now that is a choice as the captain made his way to the main deck angry cries rose up from the crew a hooded figure wrapped in a plain brown woollen cloak flew out of the doorway to the lower decks and sprawled across the sandy boards the first mate prowled out a moment later a swarthy man with a drooping black moustache and only one eye brandishing his sword he loomed over the fallen figure a stowaway lads stealing the food from our barrels he roared over the side with im stay your hand will bounded down the steps from the poop deck with the cold efficiency for which they were known two sailors had already hauled their captor half over the rail they glanced back towards will unsure do as e says the first mate muttered he eyed the spy from under low brows making no attempt to hide his irritation at being overruled the sullen sailors dragged the writhing stowaway back from the brink and threw the cloaked figure to its knees when the first mate yanked back the hood to reveal the strangers identity a shocked murmur ran through the watching crew a woman the first mate exclaimed grace will uttered stunned the young woman looked up at her former protector with defiance i could have remained hidden for days longer if not weeks if that rat had not startled me what a foolish girl i am the spy reeled are you mad he couldnt help but think of the dangers she now faced at the outcry strangewayes launceston and carpenter stumbled from below deck where they had been drinking sack and playing cards in the captains quarters the young spy gaped when he saw his love say nothing grace snapped eyes blazing or i will be forced to show you the edge of my tongue launceston shook his head bored i thought this would be a matter of interest that might relieve the tedium of this long journey who would choose a life on the waves only joltheaded maltworms thats who he eyed the crew with contempt either oblivious or uncaring of the murderous glances they shot back and sauntered below deck once again this woman of yours will not be satisfied until she has ended all our lives carpenter blazed i knew it from the moment i first laid eyes on the reckless sow still your tongue will ordered grace feigned an air of haughty indifference and looked away from this day on we will have to risk our own necks to keep her safe as usual carpenter continued i said be silent wills voice crackled with anger strangewayes face had drained of blood he held out a hand to help the woman he loved to her feet and she took it as if she were accepting an invitation to dance why did you do this grace he murmured i am no weak little thing she said with defiance if this matter concerns my sister i would be a part of it your sister carpenter said baffled have you taken a knock to the head wills heart sank was that what she had taken from their parting words his conscience was already on its knees and here was another burden for it strangewayes stepped closer to her and hissed in her ear you are aboard a ship full of lustful seamen who will not feel a womans soft embrace for many months he looked around the silent crew but that is the least of your worries do you have any notion of the terrible situation you have placed yourself in his voice cracked with despair and he looked at will we must turn back no grace exclaimed her eyes widening you cannot abandon this voyage because of my will watched her choose her words carefully foolishness too much is at stake too much invested in this expedition you would not be able to raise the funds for another voyage for months if at all she is right carpenter whispered in wills ear bracing himself against the movement of the deck beneath his feet if we turn back we lose everything you have no right to make that decision to save this woman however much she means to you please strangewayes begged arms outstretched the word was almost lost beneath the creak of the rigging and the boom of the wind in the sails grace has been foolish but she should not pay for that error with her life will hid his dismay and beckoned to grace carpenter was correct he had no choice holding her chin high she followed him back on to the poop deck where the crew could not overhear their conversation what have you done grace i can cope with any hardship i have in me the heart of a lion like our queen she turned away from his damning gaze and looked out over the heaving bluegrey swell you have led a sheltered life she spun round her cheeks colouring sheltered my life was destroyed when my sister was torn from the heart of my family as was yours if i can survive that misery i can survive anything will saw her pain still raw after all those years and changed his approach i know there is steel in you but even with all that you have endured you have barely scraped the surface of the dangers that exist in the world you must trust me on that seeing that he had only her wellbeing at heart she softened i know you wish to protect me as you have always done but i have had my fill of being pushed aside like a girl and told only what is good for me i believed jenny dead but your unwavering faith has given me hope and that somehow is more painful by far tears stung her eyes over the years i have grown to understand the secrets hidden in your words and between your words and behind them she laughed brushing the teardrops aside perhaps i would make a good spy and what secrets have you learned she lowered her eyes and whispered the ones in your heart the ones in mine i would rather be dead than suffer any longer in this twilight world filled only with ghosts and whatmighthavebeens will understood completely and hated himself for it you vex me grace he sighed she smiled taking it as a compliment when nat returned to the palace with your message i made him tell me what you had planned she saw his face harden and added hurriedly do not blame nat he is a good soul and i can twist him round until he tells me anything he thought he was doing me a kindness by telling me you had survived but while his back was turned i took a carriage to tilbury and you crept on board and hid away on the orlop deck sneaking down to the bilge when anyone came despite himself will felt some admiration you are very determined he said showing a stern face but now you have created a great problem for me i fear what you might see on this terrible journey and whatever you may say my men cannot help but try to protect you when danger arises and by doing so they will put their own lives at greater risk i would not see any of them hurt on my behalf nevertheless that is the grave situation in which we now find ourselves how to proceed his brow knit he glanced out to sea but saw only that strange troubling cloud on the far horizon what had already seemed dire was now fraught with even greater dilemmas i must think on this awhile go to tobias but do not distract him from his duties he will find you a berth in the captains cabin and curtain it with sailcloth you must stay away from the men at all costs do you understand she nodded in her brightening eyes he thought he saw a glimmer of excitement for all the danger she was enjoying her great adventure at the top of the steps she glanced back will i am sorry if i have angered you but to ease this pain in my heart i would risk anything he held her gaze for a long moment and then she descended to find strangewayes ignoring the lingering stares of the crew master swyfte courtenay bellowed from the main deck i would have that course now the atlantic is not the pond at baldock green we can sail around here till doomsday without ever stumbling across our destination prepare your charts captain will called back i will have your settings in no time his hand fell to the leather pouch hanging at his side feeling the weight of the secret he had concealed all the risks he had taken all the deceptions and all the plans he had made were coming to a head this ship of fools had passed the point of no return and only darkness lay ahead chapter twentytwo the naked woman bucked and writhed above the old man the rhythmic creak of the narrow bed echoed around the captains dusty cabin accompaniment to a symphony of moans the waves lapped the hull groaned flushed from their ardour red meg oshee wiped the sweat from her pale forehead with the back of her slender hand beneath her dr dee grunted his grey eyes glassy though she ground her hips and swung her breasts and used every lovemaking skill she had mastered in her hard life the irish spy felt that the magician was almost oblivious of her presence she knew he was aroused his hardness inside her was testament to that yet his gaze searched only an inner horizon and his lips moved in whispered conversation with things she could not see sometimes she thought she heard responses from the corners of the cramped cabin and then her arms prickled into gooseflesh she hid her distaste for what she endured this was business no more and she had long since grown inured to the demands of staying alive in a trade not known for the longevity of its practitioners but she wondered how much longer she could continue this way since she had stolen dee from under the noses of the english she had kept him bewitched with her thighs and the stuporinducing concoctions she had been taught to mix by the wise women in the green hills of her homeland but after liverpool other devils rode him she had watched him weave his magics with mirrors hunched over their glittering surfaces uttering a guttural language that sounded like pebbles dropped on wood in response she had seen the shadows seem to lengthen around the cabin and move of their own accord and as of that moment he had been like a man drifting through a dream ignoring her honeyed whispers as he took command of the vessel the crew had fallen further under his insidious influence going about their work in silence with the same glassyeyed distraction captain duncombe had stood by her at every turn as the west coast of ireland faded from view she sensed other unseen passengers aboard voices whispering down in the bilge or on the gun deck or the orlop deck although each proved empty whenever she investigated flickers of movement in shadowy corners gone when she looked directly the nights were worse until she had become afraid to sleep a haunted ship carried her away from all she knew she could deny it no longer she felt dees muscles grow taut and raised herself off him before he spilled his seed finishing with her mouth in a manner that would have drawn admiration from the doxies along bankside once done she whispered in his ear you have made my head spin as always my sweet i am caught in your spell i have business on deck he muttered pushing her aside meg flashed a murderous glance but hid it before the doctor saw though she doubted he would have cared he already appeared to have forgotten her where do we sail my love she asked as she had many times in her gentlest voice west he grumbled distracted where the dead live she sighed at his usual reply climbing off the bed to tie back her red hair with a green ribbon that matched her eyes while she pulled on her white linen smock dee prowled around the cabin with the vitality of a man half his age at ease with his nakedness he tugged at his beard as he examined charts then stood at the window and watched the white wake trailing from the carracks stern i know he snapped to no one she could see we will be there when we are there mad she thought eyeing him as she slipped on her black and gold skirt and bodice mad and drunk with power a lethal combination when he had pulled on his purple robe he stepped out on to the deck his silvery hair flying in the salty ocean breeze meg followed no eyes flickered her way she was unused to that for she had worked hard to learn how to draw mens attention then steal their gold or their papers or their life while they were distracted in dreamy silence the crew went about their tasks mending sails climbing the rigging to the yards or drawing the lines to bring fresh fish aboard no singing no ribald laughter duncombe was caught up in his duties not trusting these joltheads to keep them on a safe course never had she felt more alone though she had been a solitary soul since her chieftain had decided to utilize her natural talents for the good of ireland it felt as though she was condemned to purgatory aboard a ship of ghosts on the forecastle dee peered down at the magic circle he had inscribed in scarlet paint she watched him take position in the centre of the strange symbols untroubled by the rolling sea as if his legs were affixed to the deck for long moments he bowed his head beginning one of his monotonous incantations his words lost beneath the wind red megs chest tightened and she shivered not with cold but with unease as the shadows thrown across the deck by the masts and the rigging shifted without explanation behind her she thought she heard a sound like a giant snake coiling on the poop deck as dee threw his head back and raised his arms the wind grew stronger it lashed his hair and whipped the deep sleeves of his robes overhead the sails boomed as they filled to their limit she watched the doctor as the carrack surged across the waves and then satisfied that he would be distracted for a while returned to the cabin sliding the bolt across the door she hurried to the chest under the window and searched through the jumble of contents until she found one of the gilt mirrors dee carried with him for his divinings in her time with him she had learned some of his tricks when she had studied the charts scattered across the trestle she set the looking glass in the centre and peered into its depths the words seared through her mind with such force that she almost recoiled and was momentarily disorientated then the mirror clouded over clearing to reveal a familiar face peering up at her will swyfte she said with a seductive smile how i have missed those dark eyes chapter twentythree golden spikes of morning sunlight glinted off glass across the low ceiling of the captains cabin shimmering pools flickered as will peered into the depths of the obsidian mirror set unsteadily on the trestle table the pounding of the waves on the hull throbbed through the stifling stale air loud enough to hide any conversation from prying ears in the looking glass megs lips and eyes teased him as always will felt relieved to see she was well yet if anyone could survive in that perilous atmosphere it would be red meg oshee this merry ocean jaunt is to your taste he enquired i see no reason to wallow in gloom my sweet there is always pleasure to be found in every situation the smile was just one of many masks that prevented any man from knowing her true thoughts he knew she was a strange woman the irish spy duplicitous on so many levels as lethal as any opponent he had ever encountered yet at her core he had found some wellprotected part of her in which he felt he could place some trust wills thoughts rushed back across the waves to liverpool and to that tumultuous night when he had seized the opportunity presented to him and embarked on this desperate gamble driven mad by the rush of his new power dee had raged through the upper floors of the rooming house while will and meg fled down the wooden stairs to the front door meg was terrified by the inexplicable transformation she had witnessed and had been gabbling about the alchemists ordering her to accompany him on some mysterious journey to the new world it seemed even her charms no longer had any effect on dee and she feared for her life and her sanity how wills mind had whirled with the opportunities that chance had suddenly presented to him snatching at a single straw he had decided at that moment to risk everything from that point on he knew there could be no going back though his very life the queen and all england were forfeit when meg had recovered her wits sufficiently he had offered her a harsh choice stay by dees side and glean whatever information she could from him or be taken back to london to face punishment for her crimes if the dilemma troubled her she didnt show it indeed he thought she seemed almost relieved that she would not have to return to her homeland and she had even suggested how they could make his plan work they hid while dee thundered out into the night raging about his missing looking glass which will had hidden in his pouch in whispers meg quickly related the secrets of mirrorcommunication that the sorcerer had taught her though half a world lay between them they would be able to speak through dees glass she insisted and then her eyes bright she had kissed him with surprising tenderness before darting out into the street to accompany the alchemist to the quayside will smiled at the memory of that kiss he could only presume she saw some advantage for herself in his plan for meg was not a woman spurred on by the kindness in her heart she could not have returned to ireland if she had failed in her task to kidnap dee and cecil would have ensured there was no safe haven for her anywhere in england perhaps she felt the dangers of a sea journey with the doctor were preferable to a flight across europe where the malign influence of the unseelie court would still be felt will had not told her that what lay ahead was far worse than she could ever imagine it was but the first of many quiet betrayals that would no doubt see his soul damned but it was a price he was willing to pay what news he asked the irish womans beautiful features darkened she glanced over her shoulder towards the door and then whispered i must speak quickly for dee will only be briefly distracted and if he finds me here my punishment will be terrible indeed she paused biting her lip he is much changed have you learned what has possessed him she shook her head all i know is that he uses his mirrors to speak with angels as he did on the road to liverpool even when he was under my spell her brow furrowed though now he rages against them like a madman they must be the ones who ride him angels will was struck by the irony and grimaced devils more like he thought back along the years to all the times when dee had believed his magics had allowed him to commune with those higher beings he claimed to have learned the enochian language from them and had filled vast journals with their messages all of it had been the manipulation of the unseelie court there was no doubt now long had they played him posing as angelic guardians whenever they appeared in his mirror luring him into false security subtly subverting his suspicions until they could exert their control dees increasingly erratic behaviour the voices that only he heard his inability to find warmth even in a hot room each a sign of the unseelie courts influence which will had witnessed before yet why did they now pursue him if they were close to having him in their thrall whatever afflicts the old man has spread to the crew she continued they drift through their chores as if they are in a dream only captain duncombe retains his wits and though he is a goodhearted man there is little he can do have they harmed you it is as if they do not even know i am aboard she replied with a note of indignation dee tolerates me i think as long as i offer him comfort but i know my influence is waning and your destination she held out her hands as agreed i have the course here for you to follow perhaps your own captain can plot our eventual port of call glancing at the charts and captains journal on the sea chest beside her she passed on the bearing dee works his magics to try to speed us on she added will saw unease flicker across her features keep a steady course my love i would not have you lost to me he smiled as reassuringly as he could there will be good sack and a merry jig waiting for you when we finish this business mistress meg oh i expect much more than that master swyfte she replied with a twinkle some noise off caught her attention and she leaned in and whispered i must go soon my love the mirror clouded over and wills own dark features loomed up in the glass he bowed his head hoping he had not doomed meg as he had doomed so many others with the passing of each day he moved further away from the light he realized in the end was he so different from the unseelie court for a moment he struggled with his conscience listening to the roar of the sea and the bright singing of the tempests crew putting aside his doubts he strode out of the cabin in search of captain courtenay chapter twentyfour the trade winds had stilled becalmed the tempest simmered under a merciless sun on deck sailors squatted sullenfaced in what little shade they could find their sodden shirts clinging to their skin captain courtenay brooded in his cabin loathing the inactivity that left his crew with too much time on their hands in a heat that always spawned arguments and blood strangewayes and grace sat under a makeshift sailcloth shade on the forecastle engaged in intense conversation launceston roamed around the hold a ghost who could not face the sun from the poop deck will watched the grey cloud on the horizon through courtenays telescope in what had become an hourly ritual he wore his white linen undershirt open to his breeches but still felt no respite from the heat peering through the glass he had started to believe he now saw something hiding within that swirling grey miasma if there is some ship within that fog it is becalmed as we are a small mercy carpenter muttered at his side he was stripped to the waist his lean form tanned by the tropical sun will shrugged unconvinced then let us concentrate upon catching dr dee he said he thought back to how the cold november of the english channel had gradually given way to the december heat of the canaries and how they had been forced to put into port to pick up fresh water and victuals his cap pulled low against the hot dry wind will had prowled the docks questioning the darkskinned men in their white tunics selling wooden cups of sweet wine and skewers of spiced lamb meat seared over charcoal they had told of a carrack that had moored there two weeks gone with a strange devilhaunted crew who moved as if through a dream and spoke in slow measured tones as they resupplied their vessel the carrack had remained in port for near twelve days and the darkskinned men spoke of seeing strange lights around its mast at night and hearing disembodied voices echoing across the water no one had been sorry to see it sail back to sea their tales had raised wills spirits he was certain that they yet had a good chance of tracking down their prey and much to the english crews annoyance he had encouraged captain courtenay to put back out to sea after barely two days they battled squalls along the tropics and sweltered in the relentless heat christmas came and went with courtenay ladling cups of festive wine to a long queue of his men and prayers at dawn and song at nightfall and when the topmen spotted a spanish treasure galleon they fought their natural instincts and veered off course for a day to avoid a confrontation and then just as the end of their journey was in sight the winds had dropped one week out of the west indies for two days now they had drifted watching for what might lie at their backs while tempers simmered courtenay had taken to wandering the deck with lash in hand his gimlet eyes offering a warning of what lay ahead if any man dared cause trouble no clouds marred the blue sky not even the faintest breeze wafted across the water how much longer could they endure this cauldron of heat before something broke will wondered he sensed carpenter shifting uncomfortably beside him and put down the telescope what is on your mind he asked the other man ran a hand under his hair to rub the pink scar marring his face the woman is no business of mine he began but we have had words launceston strangewayes and myself about your delay in instructing her in the true nature of the threat we face and they sent you to speak to me i came of my own accord carpenter snapped we all know what happens to those unprepared for their first meeting with those paleskinned bastards even foreknowledge is not always enough to offer protection for some as you well know but she deserves a chance to steel herself does she not will flinched inwardly he knew he had been remiss in not revealing to grace the secrets of the unseelie court the moment she had been found aboard but she had shown such spirit in coping with the privations of the past weeks never complaining always bright ever offering a kind word when she saw the other spies in a gloomy mood that he hadnt the heart to bring darkness into her world he looked towards the main deck where she walked among the sweltering crew with a leather pail of seawater with which the sailors could mop their burning heads and necks she reminded him still of jenny and the life she might have had if she had not been taken from him he had no desire to see graces innocence tainted her hope and her future stolen as her sisters had been and he would protect her until the last possible moment the more you delay the more danger you put her in carpenter pressed as if he could read wills thoughts i will deal with her when i am good and ready he said ending the conversation already irritable the other man flushed with frustration he gripped the rail and hissed will you take no advice from anyone the great will swyfte englands greatest spy who knows better than all others until disaster strikes and then he throws his friends to the wolves what happened between us is long gone john will you not let go of it easy words for you you do not see the results of that betrayal every time you look in a mirror will grunted what could he say to ease the other mans pain that he had not said a thousand times he thought back to frozen muscovy and the flight through the stark woods where they were attacked by the nameless creature that had been summoned by their enemies he had thought carpenter slaughtered in the assault if he had returned to search for his friend he could well have lost not just his own life but all they had gained for the queen during their expedition for a while carpenter seemed to have come to terms with what he saw as a grand betrayal clearly resentment still simmered inside him but will had a greater fear john when this business is done should we survive you must ask for time away from your duties he said i sense the taint of the unseelie court in you that creeping despair that afflicts all of us eventually when we have spent too long battling those things carpenter looked over the water not meeting wills eyes time away i am sick of all this sick to the heart i would leave the service of sir robert cecil for ever and seek a new life for myself where there are no nightmares walking under the sun you know cecil will never sanction that will said gently you are too valuable in this long fight this neverending fight few others have your expert touch john your knowledge of the enemy your ability to look them in the eye and survive the queen needs you enough the other man snarled i tell you now that i will be gone from here sooner or later i deserve a life of my own and by god i will take it if i have to cut my way through a hundred colleagues to get it he rounded on will his eyes narrowing see to the girl do not let her days be blighted as mine have been he stalked away from the rail clattering down the steps to the main deck where he shoved aside any who crossed his path as he made his way to his berth before will could consider whether he truly was betraying grace a cry rang out from the topman looking up to the top of the mainmast he saw the lookout pointing towards the northeast where lightning crackled from a looming black cloud captain courtenay bounded up the steps to the poop deck storms coming he barked clapping his large hands together in these waters that could be good or ill itll blow some muchneeded wind in our sails and speed us on our way but in the tropics storms can come down like a hammer on an anvil with us caught between the two i will gladly take our chances captain i have had my fill of stewing here waiting for something to happen be careful what you wish for master swyfte courtenay laughed his eyes reflecting the crackles of lightning before he had even roared his orders his men jumped to their posts as eager to return to activity as will the spy watched them scramble up the lines ready to react to any sudden change in the elements he knew that if the storm struck hard a full sail could tear off the mainmast and drag them all down to the bottom of the drink yet if they were not ready to take advantage of glancing winds the weather could turn just as quickly and leave them becalmed once more he raised his head to the roiling clouds and felt the first hint of a breeze on his face he closed his eyes enjoying the relief will grace waited at the top of the steps her hands clasped in front of her her skirts flapped in the strengthening wind and her brown hair whipped around her face he thought how much she had grown in confidence in recent months no longer the young girl he had played with in warwickshire yet he still saw only jenny in her eyes her smile her bearing that had always been the problem return to the cabin grace he said not without warmth it will be safer there i shall soon but tobias and john both insist that i speak to you though neither will say why even robert urged me to come and normally he acts as if i am a dog yapping at his heels they seem angry with you will set his jaw wishing the others would leave well alone this is not the time grace but yes we must have words about a matter of great importance is it about jenny he hesitated watching the hope light in her dark eyes in part she forced a wan smile our friendship has been tempestuous since jenny disappeared she said we have fought and bickered though i i always looked on you fondly will you know that they both knew her feelings had been deeper than she implied she was confused he had always recognized that in truth she had seen him as the only pillar of stability in a world gone mad he had felt proud to offer her the protection she needed and he would never have abused that position and he had always believed he could save grace as he had been unable to save jenny she seemed to sense some of the thoughts that passed through his head for her brow furrowed i have never thanked you for all that you have done for me she said grabbing hold of the rail as the ship began to heave beneath them but more than anything i would thank you for keeping the promise of jenny alive when it would have been so much easier to let her go and return to your life jenny has always been my life he replied feeling all the pain wrapped in those few words we will talk soon she said but tell me one thing before i go do you truly believe we will ever find answers to any of the questions that have haunted us these past years i believe we will find an ending grace for good or ill whichever it may be i hope there will be peace that seemed to satisfy her she gave a faint smile then skipped down the steps and fought her way across the rolling deck he watched her until she disappeared from sight into the captains cabin beneath him as the clouds marched overhead the sky darkened until it felt like dusk aboard the rolling galleon the sullen sea began to protest low waves turning to a heaving swell the colour of old ivy sails boomed and the rigging cracked the wind howled tearing at hair grown too long and wrenching men from side to side with every step when lightning flashed the world turned white will began to fight his way through the grimfaced sailors swirling across the deck each one concentrating on his own wellrehearsed task they danced to courtenays tune his orders booming like the thunder tearing through the halflight hands on hips he threw his head back in insane laughter as he felt the first spatters of rain on his face this is a contest master swyfte he roared between men and the gods of the storm shall we see who wins if any man could battle the elements and win it would be bloody jack will agreed it took a madman to face a tropical storm without a flicker of fear in his heart the spy gripped the slick rigging as the deck bucked beneath his feet like an unbroken barbary steed the rain was starting to come in harder on the gusts wiping his eyes clear his gaze flickered out to sea as a bolt of lightning lanced down in the flash he glimpsed something that should not have been there wrapping one arm through the rigging to steady himself he pulled out the telescope and attempted to place it to his eye the view through the lens danced across the green ocean and darkening sky cursing under his breath will moved the telescope in incremental steps until a dark shape appeared before him a galleon the grey cloud bank that had followed them across the atlantic was dissipating in the storm and the ship sailed out of its billowing depths like a shark a row of white diamonds had been painted along the castle on a standard flapping from the mainmast was a black bird a crow will thought the galleon surged towards them sails full our enemy are revealed will thought and they have skilfully chosen this moment of confusion to attack cupping his hand to his mouth he yelled for courtenay the captain saw the spys urgency and bounded over snatching the telescope he studied the ship for only a moment and then turned to will his features dark i know that flag all sailors do and they would sell their own mothers to avoid the misfortune of encountering it across the spanish main the ship is the corneille noire the cursed barque of that cutthroat jean le gris will knew well the bloody reputation of the french pirate who had plundered the trade routes for five years now and he is not alone bloody jack added answering the spys unspoken question he handed the telescope back will frowned looking once more this time he alighted on the galleon quickly as it bore down on them when the crew swam into view shock flooded him as he saw the haggard faces of the men the hollow cheeks the grey skin each one looked dead apart from a tall sinewy man with an eyepatch and a wild black beard whom he took to be the captain other shadowy figures drifted in the halflight pale spectres like fish from the deep will held his breath as he watched lansing and the fay overseeing the ship like a court from hell a part of him had expected no less but the evidence of his eyes still felt chilling the question now master swyfte courtenay boomed in the middle of this godforsaken storm is do we run like dogs and pray for the best or stay and fight and risk a slow death in the deep chapter twentyfive the storm engulfed the tempest in a hell of fierce wind and driving rain and walls of black water cresting mountainous waves the galleon plunged into deep midnight valleys where the sailors feared they would never see the sun again barbs of lightning lanced down booming thunder throbbed into the roar of the sea will clung on to the rigging for dear life barely able to keep his legs from the deluge sluicing across the deck he glimpsed carpenter and strangewayes with one hand gripping a stay sodden and gasping and launceston seemingly unmoved by the terror of the gale one hand twirled around the rigging as he observed the fearful antics of the crew courtenay too looked untroubled by the elements as he barked his orders though the ship was tossed this way and that he strode through the ankledeep brine on the deck as if on dry land those that can man the guns he roared we have a fight on our hands lads will craned his head to look over the crew with even greater respect he knew the risks of opening the gun ports in a storm the waves could flood in and take the ship to the bottom but there was no choice putting aside their fear seamen scrambled down to the gun deck obeying their captain without question though it was hell above he wondered how much worse it was below in the confined nightdark space deafened by the hammers of the waves thrown around by the pitching and yawing and fearful that every plunge would end on the seabed peering into the face of the storm he glimpsed the swinging lanterns of the corneille noire the pirate vessel drew ever closer despite the wild seas he had seen before how the unseelie courts ships defied the very elements and he understood now why the enemy had chosen this moment to attack in the tumult the tempests guns would be nighon useless carpenter clawed his way to wills side both mens hair and beards drenched this is why i turned my back on a life at sea he raged damn all this hell give me dry land and i would fight an army it could be worse john how could it be worse there could be two ships filled with those fay bastards determined to send us to the bottom carpenter cursed loudly you find this sport you are as mad as bloody jack there are times i think you are seeking out ways to die the corneille noire swept across the waves a singleminded predator with the tempest caught in its cold glare courtenay waited with one foot on the rail one hand gripping a line his grim gaze fixed on the other galleons progress as it swept alongside he raised one arm will stared at the enemy ship frowning in the light of its swinging lanterns the greyskinned unblinking crew seemed like statues oblivious of every sensation even from that distance will could tell they had the taint of rot about them but if the captain jean le gris was troubled by what had happened to his men he showed no sign of it levelling his sword at courtenay and shouting abuse into the roaring gale behind him the pale sentinels of the fay waited for the bloodletting will sensed their terrible gaze upon him let us not wait for them courtenay bellowed send them a greeting from hell he slashed down his arm the message darted from man to man until it reached the master gunner on the gun deck a rolling wall of fire erupted into the watery world from bow chasers to broadside cannon to stern chasers the booming of the guns thundered out louder even than the storm plumes of white smoke whipped away in the wind most of the shot plunged harmlessly into the towering walls of black water as the squall flung the two vessels around the high ridges and deep valleys of the swell but one smashed a hole through the pirate ships castle to where the captains cabin would have been and another tore rigging from the mizzen top bloody jack shook his fist and roared his jubilation leaning so far over the rail that will thought the waves would pluck him away no cannon will drive them off carpenter shouted his brow furrowed they will not rest until we go down if our only choice is to take them with us that is what we shall do will yelled back though in these turbulent waters it will take an age to whittle each other to pieces the tempest rolled at an alarming angle as another wave crashed across the deck will swallowed a mouthful of brine only his grip on the rigging saved him as his legs flew out beneath him when the galleon righted he saw the corneille noire broadside on its gun ports open the captain was waiting for the swell to draw the two vessels in line before giving the order to fire heads down will called the fire spewed out of the pirate ship and the cannon cracked he flung himself on to the deck as redhot shot screamed by to his right the rail disintegrated a sailor slow in dropping low disappeared in a red mist another screamed his leg gone deadly shards of timber flew around and the cacophony of cries of men in agony echoed along the length of the galleon courtenay hung over the rail to survey the damage inflicted on his vessels hull all above the waterline he concluded with a pleased nod then let us not stop there as the swell lifted the tempest high he bellowed the order to fire again thunder rolled all around the acrid stink of burnt powder whisked in the wind sizzling shot tore through the enemy vessel more by good fortune than judgement seasoned oak as hard as iron burst into shards rigging tore free lashing across the deck the mainmast cracked and skewed at an angle bloody jack made his own luck by throwing caution to the wind will knew any other captain would have taken the decision to flee rather than fight in those seas at the pirate captains orders his grey dead men clambered up what remained of the rigging to cut loose the mainsail before it dragged the mast over the side and the ship to the bottom jubilation flooded will the gamble had worked and the pirate ship had been crippled but the triumph was shortlived even without its mainmast and sails the enemy ship swept closer they are going to ram us carpenter yelled board us more like will corrected as he watched the frantic activity along the other ships deck the rotting crew lined the rail with grapnels and rapiers in hand behind them the unseelie court waited to seize their moment prepare to repel boarders bloody jack roared striding along the deck his men wrenched out their own rapiers and daggers and scrambled to the rail will hauled himself up drawing his blade this is more like it carpenter grinned without humour now i can put my idle hands to good use a hogshead of sack to the man who carves the most the corneille noire swung close will braced himself for the impact whatever magics were at play brought the galleon firm alongside despite the heaving swell it was as if they were locked in congress rising and falling with perfect rhythm the grapnels flew out across the black gulf catching in the tempests rigging the pirates gripped their ropes and kicked away from the rail some of courtenays men attempted to cut the lines pitching a few of the swinging figures into the roiling sea they went down without a cry sucked under the black water in an instant will blinked away the driving rain he glimpsed the bloom of decay on the grey dispassionate face of the onceman swinging towards him yet another of the unseelie courts crimes against the natural order he thought glowering as the pirates feet crossed the rail will lunged cold steel plunged through the things chest yet still it came he withdrew his rapier and slashed down the face peeled open from temple to chin but still the wide eyes stared as the pirate dropped to the deck he swung his knife high will threw himself forward so that his shoulder rammed into his dead foe the dagger whisked a hairs breadth from his cheek as he drove on and pitched the pirate over the side along the rail blew a smaller storm of steel and curses and spattering blood blades clashed as courtenays men wrestled with their dead counterparts one sailor barely twenty summers old went down in a gout of crimson from a slashed throat without pause his staring attacker plunged his gorestained dagger into the chest of the seaman fighting beside him in the confusion of the battle whirling across the stormlashed deck will lost sight of his colleagues he thrust himself into the melee when the fighting was too close to use his rapier he lashed out with elbows and fists and knees and feet he glimpsed courtenay roaring with laughter as he plunged his dagger into a grey face a moment later the mad captain lifted the corpse over his head and pitched it into the sea beyond the frenzy will sensed movement as fluid as the brine washing across the deck his nerves jangled shadows flitted here there when a lightning flash froze white faces he realized that some of the unseelie court had boarded the tempest they kept to the gloom on the fringes so that it was impossible to tell how many there were will tore himself away from the fight and made his way stabbing and hacking as he went to where launceston was tipping a pirate over the side leave the men to fight these dead things he ordered the fay are aboard and they are our business we must find john and tobias now he darted to the other side of the deck in the halflight he glimpsed shapes creeping low like wolves at night lips pulled back from sharp teeth as a hand flicked towards the hilt of a rapier will sucked in a sharp breath and leapt for a rope dangling from a grapnel in the rigging bracing himself he swung both feet into the nearest fays chest propelling it over the rail another attacked the instant he dropped to the boards slashing with fast controlled strokes when a dying seaman stumbled back into his grim opponent will seized his chance thrusting through the heart with one fluid strike somewhere nearby strangewayes yelled an anguished warning will wrenched around tobias was pointing at the door to the captains cabin it swung wildly in the lashing gale the fay lord lansing whom will had seen drive a man mad on the liverpool dockside now had grace pinned to his chest with his left arm as he eased her out on deck the fay lord turned his cold face towards will and called in a clear voice lay down your weapons as the other fay circled lansing drew his slender fingers along the curve of graces neck pushing her head back resist him she called in a defiant voice my life means nothing when all of england is at stake will knew she was right and so did strangewayes kill them lansing said to the other fay kill them all and let us be done with this rabble and return to the golden city victorious before the first of the unseelie court could attack grace hammered her heel on to lansings foot in the shock of her attack he loosened his grip and she wrenched herself free throwing herself among the battling sailors we play for high stakes here win all or lose everything courtenays gruff voice boomed through the storm the captain stood at the end of the main deck with a powder barrel over his head beside him a shaking crewman held a burning fuse spitting in the rain there is no room for any middle ground bloody jack continued a light gleaming in his eyes get off my ship or ill blow us all to hell will saw the unseelie court weighing up whether courtenay would go through with his mad threat he had no doubt if they faced defeat better to take a few fay bastards along with them bloody jack roared shaking the barrel with the fury of a goaded bear the fay had seen enough will stifled his relief as they ghosted away into the shadows by the poop deck moving towards the rail and the grapnels courtenay raised the barrel high in triumph and bellowed we must seize this moment master swyfte once back on their ship they will loose their guns again and blow us out of the water will fought to stay on his feet as the galleon spun like a leaf on a stream walls of black water smashed down pitching the ship at such an angle that the hull groaned like a dying man he fell cursing and skidded across the briny deck he glimpsed lansing by the rail one hand on the rope that would swing him back to the corneille noire the fay had hold of grace once more he dragged her into a cold embrace clearly intending to take her back to the pirate ship with him strangewayes lay dazed at his feet blood streaming from a gash on his forehead the fay lord stared at will and yelled some threat but the fury of the gale tore his words away lightning flashed white overhead making stark the fear in graces wide dark eyes her mouth was a wide o a cry of anguish perhaps or a plea for will to aid her thrown around by the pitching deck will could only watch as lansing pressed his mouth to the womans ear and began to whisper desperation rushed through him graces eyes widened for a moment the terror in them plain to see her head fell slowly back on to lansings shoulder her lids flickered and she collapsed limply into his arms gripping the rope the fay placed one foot on the rail of the tempest as he prepared to swing himself and his captive across to the other ship devastated will knew he could not reach lansing or grace in time yet as the dead pirates responded to some silent signal and turned back towards their vessel will sensed movement at the edge of his vision carpenter was perched on the poop deck with a snarl he leapt he slammed into the fay wrenching grace free of lansings grasp the two men careered over the side will staggered his way to the rail and peered down into the roiling sea surely no man could survive in that cauldron for a moment he saw only slategrey water which rose up higher and higher still until it towered above him before crashing down with a sound like a thousand hammers a moment later he spotted a figure in the water but only for an instant before it disappeared beneath the surface behind him he heard courtenay bark orders to the helmsman to try to move the galleon away the storm was already starting to ebb and if the captain caught the last of the strong winds he could put space between them and the enemy launceston appeared at his elbow his ghastly face made starker by the gloom we must save him he cried with an edge of emotion that will had never heard in the aristocrats voice before tell courtenay to hold fast swyfte blinked rain out of his eyes as he looked into the other mans face robert i would not leave a friend to die in such circumstances but if we tarry here we all die and so too the hopes of england he felt sickened to hear the words come out of his mouth launceston nodded in acceptance and without another word stepped on to the rail and dived into the boiling sea wills cry rang out but the man disappeared and however desperately will searched the waves he saw no further sign of his friend the spy cursed to himself what had possessed launceston to throw himself after carpenter the rain eased and a glimmer of silver light broke through the thick clouds on the horizon with a boom of filling sails the tempest pulled away from the crippled enemy galleon desolate will tore his gaze away from the angry sea and knelt down beside grace he took her in his arms she was still breathing but that was but a small mercy he had seen the corruption of the unseelie court worm its way into even the strongest mind and consume it from within until only a shell was left grace he whispered in her ear speak to me there was no response she might have been sleeping though he would not wish her dreams upon another living soul will bowed his head so much had been lost yet the worst still lay ahead chapter twentysix the storm had blown itself out by sunset under heavy clouds the tempest sailed through a night as deep and dark as any the crew had ever experienced with no stars to guide them courtenay stowed away his compass and charts and concentrated on putting distance between them and the pirate ship on deck the subdued singing of the seamen raised no spirits they mourned the eight of their companions lost in the attack as will mourned carpenter and launceston sails hung ripped and yards broken two sailors hauled planks of wood fresh rigging and sailcloth from the store below while a gang of five cut and shaped to start the repairs even the sound of the mallets had a funereal beat we lick our wounds and we move on courtenay growled in passing the closest he would come to words of commiseration by dawn the skies had cleared to a perfect blue and the sea was calm with his astrolabe bloody jack shielded his eyes against the merciless sun and began to calculate the latitudes in order to discover how far they had been blown off course into dangerous uncharted waters his mood darkened by the hour grace had not yet regained consciousness her breathing shallow her eyes motionless beneath the lids she lay on her berth in a sleep akin to death will sat over her through the long night watching for any sign that she might recover afraid what would be left of her wits if she did time and again he cursed himself for his failings haunted by his vow to protect her at all costs strangewayes would barely look at him and when their eyes did meet will saw only simmering hatred he felt angry at the young spys attitude but held his tongue as the stifling heat rose in the dusty cabin he realized he was only making matters worse by being there it was now strangewayes responsibility to care for grace will left him there cooling her brow with a damp kerchief and muttering constant prayers will asked the captain if he could be left alone on the poop deck for a few moments once he had assured himself he couldnt be overseen by the other men he squatted down at the far side of the castle and pulled the obsidian mirror from his pouch laying it on the deck as he hunched over the glass he whispered the words meg had taught him and waited long moments passed it was the agreed time and meg had not yet disappointed him he uttered the incantation once more and again yet the mirror remained clear and he began to fear that the unseelie court had claimed another life wearily he bowed his head and closed his eyes when he looked again the black mirror had clouded over yet the face that was gradually appearing in the misty glass was not megs he felt his heart begin to beat faster though he scarcely dared hope yet the familiar curve of the lips emerged and the bright clever eyes and the tumble of brown hair just as they had that night in the rooming house in liverpool jenny he murmured uncontrolled joy rushing through him she still wore the blue dress she had on when she vanished from his life all those years ago her eyes widened and he knew she could see him too but then he saw the worry in her face with apprehension she glanced nervously over her shoulder in the darkness and then leaned closer to the glass will it is you he recoiled at the shock of hearing her voice after so long there was so much he wanted to say to her he had played this moment through a thousand times or more in all the years of longing how could he ever begin to express the emotion that had been stirred in that seeming eternity of time apart jenny he began struggling to find the words but she silenced him with an insistent shake of her head will there is very little time she whispered when i saw you before i barely dared believe you still lived that you remembered me i would never forget you he could barely stop his voice from breaking her features softened and he saw the affection in her smile not a day has passed when i have not searched for you in some way and you must abandon the quest she sighed that is the very reason why i have reached out to you you must put me out of your thoughts and out of your heart never you must he saw the tears begin to run down her cheeks will please do this for me if you love me still i do then forget me she implored there is no time for explanations you must trust me on this matter to find me could cost you your own life and i will never allow that to happen she half turned as if she had heard someone approaching and then added in a hasty tone i must go wait he called out too loud but the looking glass had already misted over and a moment later it showed only blue sky will slumped back against the rail and closed his eyes turning her words over in his head listening once again to the music of her voice he felt afraid to stop in case he could no longer remember how she sounded and yet jenny lived there could be no doubt about that now his heart leapt and it was all he could do not to shout to the heavens her warnings meant nothing to him how could he accept her plea for him to stay away nothing would deter him from bringing her home he inhaled a draught of salty air and took a moment at the rail looking out over the blue waters though his spirits now soared he yet felt doubt what of meg did she still live and without her to guide them what chance did they have of reaching their destination he was in reflective mood as he descended on to the main deck and barely noticed courtenay beckoning him to enter his cabin strangewayes knelt beside the stillprone grace so intent on his prayers he seemed unaware that the two men had entered will followed bloody jack to his trestle where his dogeared charts were scattered the astrolabe weighting them down keeping an eye on strangewayes the captain whispered do you have a new course for me not yet soon will replied you have identified our position courtenay jabbed a finger on the chart right where we shouldnt be master swyfte weve already had our fill of the horse latitudes where the wind comes and goes like a womans affections and you can drift becalmed for days under a sweltering sun aye thats bad enough but that damnable storm has dumped us back in it and worse here he drew a filthy nail along the chart is a sea within the sea cursed it is good ships disappear without a sign pirates some say he shrugged not believing other vessels are found deserted with treasure still in their holds and food and water in their barrels every captain knows to steer well clear you did this the low growl of strangewayes voice rustled across the cabin will turned to see the redheaded spy confronting him rapier drawn his face flushed with an anger that must will surmised be born of despair if you had taken even a moment to prepare her for the horrors of the unseelie court she might have survived the encounter but no the great will swyfte had better things to do with his time put your sword away boy courtenay growled youre making a fool of yourself england is littered with dead and wounded men who have made your acquaintance ofttimes decenthearted godfearing people you have used and discarded once they have served your purpose so i have heard strangewayes continued not taking his gaze off will you care for no one but yourself and yet you are tolerated because in your cunning way you offer a service to the queen and her government but you must be held to account sooner or later if not by god then by me tis true that i am not a good man but i am an effective one will replied in a calm voice he could see the hurt burning in the other mans face and you are mistaken on one count there are people dear to me and i would defend them even at the cost of my own life i would never see grace harmed lies strangewayes thrust with his rapier missing will by a hairs breadth as the older man stepped aside at the last moment will could see there was no reasoning with him his passion burned too strong for that snarling tobias thrust again and this time wills sword was at the ready and he parried the clash of steel rang through the cabin redfaced and puffing courtenay looked fit to burst at the display of disrespect upon his ship shed one drop of his blood and ill have ye keelhauled he roared strangewayes thrust again will deflected the tip of the sword with a flick of his wrist though he had some skill with the rapier the redheaded spy was too raw too consumed with emotion in a way that no true swordsman would ever be will saw his bravado and arrogance had always seemed a shield to protect his insecurities traits will had presumed he would eventually grow out of given time and experience now he wondered if they would be the death of the other man before he had a chance to learn driven by anger strangewayes prodded with his rapier as if he were poking a smiths forge will parried once twice and at the moment when he could have easily disarmed the other man he let his rapier fall courtenay gasped strangewayes blade thrust true towards wills heart at the last the younger spy caught himself the tip of his rapier piercing linen a rose bloomed on wills shirt tobiass hand shook as he tried to drive the blade on but in the end he could not bring himself to kill damn you swyfte he muttered blinking away tears of frustration i am already damned would i be here watching friends suffer and die were that not so will bit down forcing himself to ignore the pain from the sword digging into his flesh there are few friends in this business but we are all brothers the bonds run deep we would give our lives for each other as john gave his life for the woman you love no one would ever have called him a good man but he was an honourable one yes even to the end and honour has more value than gold for it buys a man a clear conscience and a light heart and you think you are honourable strangewayes spat we all try to do our best in hard times and sometimes we fail that is the nature of men is it not and our failures are greater than others because we play for high stakes and we feel them more acutely know only that i would die for grace as would you strangewayes hesitated torn between his impotent rage and his sense of honour in the lull courtenay cursed snatched up the cudgel he kept by his trestle and clouted the younger spy round the head strangewayes pitched to the floor in a daze his sword clattering across the boards let that knock some bloody sense in ye the captain thundered leave him he is heartsick and worried for the woman he loves will said aware of the irony in his words this is my ship not a bankside stew courtenay snapped my rules master swyfte he paused eyeing the fallen spy yet i will show a little kindness on this occasion as hes a friend of yours but if he raises his blade in anger to one of us again its over the side with him he grabbed the scruff of strangewayes undershirt in his meaty hand and dragged him across the cabin flinging him out of the door with a boot up his arse will felt concerned that the humiliation might only make strangewayes angrier but he had more pressing matters to concern him keep an eye on that one courtenay rumbled as if he could hear wills thoughts hes still got too much of the spoiled child in him if his temper gets the best of him again you might find that steel going right through ye will shrugged feeling the weight of his responsibility to grace we will shape him to be a man one way or another bloody jack grunted dismissively a warning call rang out from the topman and courtenay and will stepped out on deck to find the men leaning over the starboard side pointing brows furrowed the captain barged his way among them making a space for will for a moment shock lit wills features the ocean had turned brown as far as the eye could see and the air was thick with a stink like wet dogs peering closer he saw that the tempest now sailed through a dense bank of seaweed the glistening tendrils tugging at the galleons hull avast courtenay bawled to his men once the sailors had trudged away from the rail the captain leaned in to will and whispered i told ye right where we shouldnt be chapter twentyseven the sea of stinking brown weed seemed to stretch to the blue horizon the tempest sailed through the boiling heat as if she were ploughing a furrow in an autumn field the seamen lined the rails watching with uneasy eyes while they recalled all the fearful tales of that place they had heard in quayside inns across europe leaning out will glimpsed dark shapes weaving sinuously among the floating clumps of seaweed eels he thought he glanced around for the land he presumed must be near bloody jack shook his head no land here he said not for days this is the great sargasso a sea within a sea all around the currents are the strongest you will ever encounter but here ships drift in this forest of weed and grow becalmed it is a strange place sailors tell haunted and most give it a wide berth the weed will not hold us fast the wind or lack of it is the greater problem the weed can snarl a rudder at worst it floats on the surface in vast mats i have fathomed it meself here and there is no bottom a spanish seadog told me how his vessel was becalmed for weeks in the middle of this stinking sea to conserve their water the crew were forced to throw the war horses oerboard and feared they would not get out with their own lives there is nowhere like it in all the oceans his brow furrowed and yet my mind plays tricks with me the last time i skirted the sargasso the weed looked different his voice tailed off it remains a mystery to me how that storm blew us so far off course will heard a troubled note in the captains voice but his attention was caught by the swimming shapes one broke the surface black skin glistening in the sun as thick as a mans arm the eel seemed to have a face akin to a babys with wide eyes and full lips that revealed a hint of sharp teeth a strange mewling sound rose up cut short as the thing darted back below the surface courtenay recoiled god ha mercy he hissed under his breath will thought back to the white menfish that swam beneath the surface of the frozen thames and asked you have seen the like of that before never nor have i heard word of such he crossed himself i do not believe this is the sargasso at all it is some devilhaunted place we have sailed into the sun beat down the breeze began to fail an uneasy mood descended on the men as the tempest drifted through the reeking seaweed eyes flickered up to the sagging sails watching for the moment when the breeze finally died and the galleon would be stranded there the seahardened crew pretended not to notice those mewling noises rolling across the gently lapping swell and with each hour that passed the weight of apprehension grew until every man was suffused with a deep dread of what lay ahead when the sun was at its highest point the lookout called three dark smudges emerged from the heat haze over the seaweed ahead shielding his eyes against the glare will saw that they were barques as the tempest neared he realized that there was no movement aboard two were little more than rotting hulks listing low in the water the sails but tatters he did not recognize their design but the crudity of the build suggested great age courtenay tugged at his beard his brow creased the third ship sported a spanish flag hanging limply from the mainmast brown weed swelled up its hull i would investigate that barque will said pointing bloody jack sighed i had a feeling you were going to say that master swyfte all eyes remained down when the captain asked for volunteers to board the spanish vessel roaring in anger he chose three men at random and they shuffled off to lower the rowing boat as will prepared to climb down the rope ladder to where the vessel bobbed strangewayes stepped up a bruise bloomed on the side of his forehead i would accompany you he muttered his expression sullen after a moments consideration will consented with a nod the seamen sculled away from the tempest with hesitant strokes their unsettled eyes darting around the waves of brown vegetation will sat at the prow studying the path ahead the weed bundled up ahead of the boat the choking stink of it even thicker now they were surrounded by it one of the sailors a pockmarked pinkfaced man cried out as one of the eel creatures leapt out of the water disturbed by the oars its jaws snapped and its eyes swivelled towards them as if it knew what it was seeing the men muttered prayers rowing faster but that only disturbed the creatures more the sea on either side churned as they leapt up mewling and crying in tones that were unsettlingly human fish nothing more will called out in a reassuring voice keeping his eyes fixed on the spanish ship ahead only fish the seamen continued to mutter strangewayes withdrew his hands from the sides of the boat and clasped them between his thighs in the sticky heat they pulled alongside the larger vessel and one of the seamen hurled a grapnel over the rail one after the other they climbed the ship was still the only sounds the whispers of the hull will wrinkled his nose an odd smell hung across the stained deck like a butchers shop on a summer noon search below he said to the three men who looked as if he had ordered them to leap into the sea call out if you find anything of note he beckoned to strangewayes and strode to the captains cabin his hand resting on his rapiers hilt the cabin was no cooler he sucked in a mouthful of stale air casting an eye over the berth and the chartcovered trestle by the compass a halfeaten biscuit lay in its crumbs next to a cup of wine strangewayes prowled around the trestle eyeing the food as if it would bite him the captain left in a hurry he said abandoned his own ship taken then by pirates perhaps will looked round seeing no signs of a struggle dropping to his knees he traced his fingers across the dusty boards but found no bloodstains he flicked open a chest under the broad window to reveal the gleam of gold plate cups and coin i do not like it here strangewayes said looking round the hot gloomy cabin it feels haunted at the trestle will pushed a quill and inkpot aside and opened the captains leatherbound journal he ran one finger under the florid scrawl silently translating the spanish entries he speaks here of an isle of devils and hearing the tormented cries of lost souls in the night he skimmed the pages and read on a city of gold manoa he calls it no man may escape it save that he traverses the labyrinth before the moontower if this city of gold exists philip of spain will have sent a fleet of galleons to loot it the younger spy said perhaps will recalled the faerie queens words from her cell in london and her mention of a tower of the moon which kept open the way between their worlds he continued reading the journal long hours were we caught in that maze fearing what was at our backs and yet the way became clear twice stare into the devils face then bow all heads to god thrice more the unholy must call again again again until the end will reflected on the message for a moment then tore out the page folded it neatly and slipped it into his leather pouch strangewayes wandered to the window and peered out into the west god has abandoned us he said in a low desolate voice i fear what lies ahead the pounding of running feet echoed across the deck accompanied by the frightened cries of the seamen will stepped out to meet them eyes wide with fear they gibbered and plucked at their clothes with anxious fingers will glanced towards the dark entrance to the lower decks the door swinging slowly shut survivors he enquired in a calm voice his fingers folding round his swordhilt voices the pockmarked man said breathlessly looking over his shoulder at the closing door we were on the orlop deck and we eard em from the bilge strangewayes enquired from from the other side of the hull in the water will demanded the man nodded we heard their nails scratching on the keel and their whispers what did they say strangewayes snapped grabbing the sailor by the shoulders join us one of the other sailors whispered his hands were shaking join us will pushed strangewayes to one side and leaned in tapping his head the mind plays strange tricks he said but the seaman shook his head furiously having none of it this is a ship of ghosts he insisted we are doomed if we stay here they will come for us will felt strangewayes eyes on him but he did not acknowledge the look let the dead whisper to the fishes he interjected we are done here sweating and redfaced the seamen heaved the rowing boat back to the tempest with furious strokes their gaze never leaving the drifting seaweed will himself half expected to see hands rising from the surface or dead faces looking up from the pools of dark water among the vegetation once they were back on board the galleon courtenay set the helmsman to steer a steady course west through the strange dead sea the deserted spanish ship fell behind them but even then will thought he could feel eyes on his back for the rest of the day they creaked along under the unforgiving sun and as twilight began to fall they broke out of the bank of vegetation and into open water will felt the mood lift and not long after he heard courtenays throaty laughter rumbling across the deck as the crew began to sing yet he found himself haunted by what he had read in the spanish captains journal an isle of devils lost souls in the night with the red sun low on the horizon he found his worst fears confirmed wreckage drifted on the swell ahead a shattered hull chests and barrels masts tangled with rigging and ragged sailcloth caught in the storm will asked as courtenay joined him at the rail the captain tugged at his beard in his habitual manner as he studied the shattered remnants mayhap they watched in silence until bloody jack caught sight of a torn flag floating by a red cross on a white background one of ours then he said neither of them needed to express what lay heavy on their minds the captain sent two of his men out in the rowing boat and in the dying light they returned with a sodden remnant of the captains log bearing the ships name the eagle the carrack which had carried dee and meg will felt a momentary pang of despair strangewayes appeared at their side fresh from ministering to grace he looked tired and drawn will had not seen him eat since the storm there had still been no improvement in her condition and wills mood darkened further can there be survivors from such a wreck strangewayes asked if dee is lost this is not the time to speculate will said a little more curtly than he intended for a moment his thoughts turned to meg but he set them aside when the lookout cried land ahoy courtenays brow furrowed there is no land in these waters yet when they rushed to the forecastle they saw whitetopped waves crashing against a jagged reef and beyond it the hazy outline of an island in the dying ruddy light hard a starboard the captain bellowed to the helmsman adding with a growl well not end up on the rocks like those other poor bastards will gripped the rail peering towards the island he could make out a hilly treecovered central area and grey cliffs to the south and north with a stretch of sandy strand directly ahead dee could have washed up there strangewayes said in a hopeful tone aye bloody jack growled raising the telescope to his eye hes as tough as a tanners hide that one wring his scrawny neck and hed still keep on breathing and ive wanted to do that a time or two well sail to the north and drop anchor only a madman would try to cross that reef with night coming in he added without a hint of irony will watched the darkening waves as the ship sailed astern so much misfortune had afflicted them in recent days he barely dared to hope for some small relief beside him courtenay cursed what afflicts that fool at the helm once more the island lay directly ahead he snatched the telescope from his eye and roared to the helmsman i said hard a starboard the tempest turned a starboard again but within moments will blinked his eyes in the growing gloom and saw the island ahead of them once more courtenays face darkened will we never be out of these cursed waters he muttered three more times they attempted to sail round the islands northern edge and three more times they failed it seems will said that this island is waiting for us chapter twentyeight streams of torchfire blazed through the dark of the london night alarmed cries rang off the high stone walls of the palace of whitehall as the guards raced across the courtyard their boots clattering weapons clanking as they ran in the flickering light of the brands worried white faces were caught eyes urgently trying to pierce the deep gloom around the lantern tower find it sir robert cecil bellowed a sheen of sweat glistened on the spymasters forehead despite the wintry chill that had reached long into spring slay it without a moments thought he whirled as a low snarl rumbled out from a corner of the courtyard a sound that would not have been out of place in the queens menagerie but which he knew came from something that walked like a man a moment later the growl echoed from the other side of the square so fast he thought quaking the torches whisked around in confusion in the gloom stars of ruddy light danced off burgonets and cuirasses the spymaster glimpsed a pale face frozen in the wavering flames mouth ragged with horror but it was gone in an instant another man dashed past him yelling in fear round and round he spun caught up in the visions flashing before his eyes a stabbing pike a guard staggering back clutching his head a bloodspattered burgonet bouncing across the cobbles until he grabbed at his chest where his heart was pounding fit to burst those inhuman snarls seemed to be echoing all around as if there were a host of the things and not just one another face flashed by torn and bloody the guard stumbled in the dark and lay still cecil cried out in a fury born of fear demanding his men do something anything to end this slaughter and then as the snapping and snarling reached a new pitch the bestial cry was cut off with a strangled gurgle to me the spymaster bellowed as the surviving guards gathered around him their combined torchlight lit a chaotic scene fallen bodies gleaming pools of blood and scattered cordwood where the intruder had attempted to tear through the towering bonfire surrounding the lantern tower to free the faerie queen is it dead he barked he needed to show that he was not afraid but his hands would not stop shaking tis gone the voice floated out of the dark cecil snatched a torch and stalked towards the sound the flames lit a man dressed in a costly sapphire doublet and breeches the face half turned away he gripped a rapier dripping black blood and his cloak covered a still form on the cobbles send your men away they should not see this the spymaster recognized the intruder and waved the unnerved guards away once they had gone sir walter raleigh stepped out of the shadows into the circle of light from cecils torch if her majesty knew you were here cecil began and will you tell her so that i can relate how i achieved what your impotent band could not the adventurer stooped to wipe his blade on the already bloodied cloak a foul thing he said turning his nose up at the twisted shape beneath the folds there have been many of them in recent times too many cecil pressed the back of his quivering hand against his mouth steadying himself the unseelie court may not be able to set foot upon this still protected part of england but that does not prevent them from sending their agents in to engineer disaster raleigh sheathed his rapier but the faerie queen still resides in her towerprison and the bonfire is still piled high to roast her like a suckling pig all is well in the world cecil snorted his laughter bitter how much longer can we go on those fiends whittle us down by degrees and now you are here raleigh bowed sweeping one arm out with ironic flamboyance your secret society your school of night seeks to use this calamity to your own ends the spymaster continued with contempt while the queens government is distracted and out of joint you step in and seize power is that how it is sirrah you wound me we in the school of night are all good englishmen loyal to the crown cecil paced around the other man looking him up and down then why are you here risking the wrath of the queen you have not yet earned your way back into her favour in these darkest hours the school of night will stand shoulder to shoulder with you the spymaster laughed again to worm your way into the heart of government to learn our secrets things that you can put to good use should we survive this catastrophe raleigh tapped the form under his cloak with the toe of his shoe and that matter of survival is still in doubt for now can you refuse our aid we have knowledge we have wealth when the coffers of england are near empty and we have some skills you may be able to use cecils eyes narrowed go on dr dee is one of our number i knew it the spymaster clenched his fist some of his occult knowledge was passed to other members not all of it by far but enough perhaps to be of use in keeping the unseelie court at bay this will buy her majesty and england time for swyfte to succeed in his quest you know of that cecil turned away pretending to examine the huge pile of kindling in the wavering torchlight of course you do yet how can i ever trust the school of night when you have been secretly working against us for so long raleigh gave a tight smile how can you trust us we believe in the power of knowledge sirrah in natural science and the occult arts coming together for the good of all men and a new way in this neverending war with the unseelie court one that will not tarnish our integrity and may yet save the lives that are so regularly sacrificed and we believe in honour above all can you say the same cecil refused to meet his gaze i have heard tales raleigh continued lowering his voice if they are true you would do well to hope master swyfte does not discover what happened to his lady love he is a man of some fame with a powerful voice and a powerful temper his rage would be a fine thing if he were to learn the truth i would not put money on any man standing in his way or upon the survival of those responsible this time cecil whirled a cold anger lighting his eyes you have the luxury of honour sirrah you hold no power you are not faced with harsh decisions on a daily basis where choices must be made in sacrificing one life to save two or ten to save a hundred do you think my life peaceful do you think my soul remains untainted by those choices forget master swyfte he will never be allowed to foment rebellion here he will die on foreign soil once his quest has been accomplished or he will die when he sets foot back in england either way there will be an end of it chapter twentynine the lantern glimmered deep in the gloom at the far end of the orlop deck carpenter felt little comfort from the tiny speck of light in the stifling heat and stale air of the dark space the cargo hold throbbed with the rhythm of the waves pounding against the creaking hull and sometimes when the din diminished a little he could hear the scrabbling of rats in the bilge beneath him he grimaced as he sucked in a breath heavy with the stink of rot and worked at the greasy ropes binding his aching wrists behind his back here on this ship of the dead the spy fought back his fear he had been in many tight spots in his life but few as desperate as this his plunge from the tempest into the violent sea had smashed the breath from him brine had flooded his nose and mouth the undercurrent sucking him into the black water below swept back up to the surface he had seized a fleeting chance to gulp one last gasp of air and as he did so he glimpsed the white face of the foul thing he had dragged into the seething cauldron if lansing of the high family had been swept to an agonizing death at the bottom his own passing would have been worth it the last thing he remembered was feeling arms close around him as launceston attempted to keep him afloat he marvelled launceston who had no feelings for any living thing who slaughtered innocent and guilty alike with the dispassion of a butcher preparing meat for the table carpenter screwed his eyes shut for some reason the hated enemy had saved him and stowed him away here in the filthy stinking hold why did they not kill him and be done with it he was no use to them he knew nothing perhaps his suffering was simple sport or revenge against a man who had been a thorn in their side for years however ineffective do you miss your friends your family he flinched at the voice and almost cried out his senses had told him that the hold was empty but he should have known better the unseelie court were like ghosts the voice was that of lansing he was disappointed that the hated fay had survived too but he should have expected it the fay asked his question again his voice measured i have no family carpenter spat and no friends either i have nothing in my life except the work i do so do not think you can torture me with false hopes we are not the monsters here the spy laughed long and hard footsteps echoed as lansing drew closer carpenter tensed expecting to feel a blow or the prick of a dagger but instead he heard the fays passionless voice at a lower level as if he were crouching to look his prisoner in the eye there is great beauty in our world music that can move men to tears art philosophy the joy that comes from being at the centre of life and all the wonders it offers you think us demons but we are not so different our two people and yet you have treated men like cattle ready for the slaughter since the beginning of time carpenter sneered stolen our children for sport or our youth or our lives turned women to stone destroyed families and whole villages blighted lives for amusement or because we did not bow and scrape before you and men are so different we do not hurt our own kind can the same be said of your privateers in africa or in the new world of your own queen in her own homeland so much misery inflicted on those who worship by another creed and yet pray to the same god an incredulous laugh rolled out from the dark since man walked tall the world has been awash with blood not one race not one country has never raised a weapon in anger against another those who have suffered at your own hands far exceed the number we have tormented and we are the monsters you twist things to seduce me with words carpenter said he let his shoulders sag nothing is as simple as it is made out to be by men of power they always twist things to achieve the outcome they require but i do not have power i am just a warrior like you in this ceaseless shadowconflict those greater than us have carved out like me i think not for all my flaws i have honour then you have not had your fill of this battle as i have you do not wish to see it end and return to your home and your life if this war were over i would go in an instant and hold no hatred in my heart for any man that is my most fervent wish the spy did not reply at once the fays words struck a note deep within him he had been left for dead scarred betrayed deceived had seen the woman he loved murdered and been denied the opportunity to walk away from the business of spying cecil would never let him leave all the secrets he knew were too valuable he accepted with bitterness i have heard of your plans he said at last giving no sign of his true thoughts he pushed his head up in defiance you would wash us all away in a tide of blood you want to win this war by leaving no trace of men upon the earth we want only one thing lansing interrupted in a soothing voice the return of our queen my sister taken from us in an act of grand betrayal when all we wished to do was make peace do you think i can trust a word you say your very existence is based upon deceit and lies carpenter felt icy breath on his ear and recoiled in revulsion he smelled strange spices one more time lansing whispered we are the same the spy wanted to feel anger but the fays calm words seemed to have sapped his rage he sagged back against the damp boards dreaming of a home that had not existed for many years do you ever feel lost lansing continued his soles scraped on the boards as he began to circle his prisoner if that word chimes with you ever then you know my people we are lost all of us wanderers who travelled from four distant cities gorias murias finias and falias four places of such wonder and enchantment they could bring any who laid eyes upon them to tears of joy but our way was lost and we could never find our way home and for as long as we have known we have been yearning for those magical fabled cities no peace in our days no contentment only endless searching our sadness eats into our hearts and turns our thoughts grey but one day we believe we will finally find our way back and then and only then will we find peace carpenter felt a dismal mood descend upon him he closed his eyes letting his thoughts float back through the years and across the miles to his father in his cups and laughing by the hearth and to his mother wearing her best mustard skirts and white apron as she trudged through the snow to church on christmas eve what uncomplicated lives they led if only he had recognized that before he had left in search of coin in the queens employ other scenes marched through his thoughts the fields around his home where he knew every birds nest how every shadow fell in the autumn twilight the sound of the men singing as they drank their applebeer after a hard day bringing in the harvest he bowed his head lost he thought with such poignant regret it made him wince did launceston survive he croaked your friend is safe lansings footsteps retreated a few paces carpenter wondered if the fay was drawing his blade for the first of many cuts and realized he cared little you may see him again soon the fay continued if only there would come a time when this war no longer tore friends apart the spy read what his opponent was saying i will never betray my queen he muttered nor would i expect you to you are an honourable man as am i but there are steps we foot soldiers can take which could free us all from daily suffering steps perhaps unseen by our masters caught up in their grand visions carpenter allowed himself a moment to imagine what life would be like without that struggle he did not hear lansing approach again we need no grand betrayal to end this war the fay was saying only one thing one small thing the sorcerer dee the spy snorted without dee england falls you will be able to do whatever you want with us as i said before all we want is our queen returned when she is seated once again upon the golden throne there will no longer be need for struggle we are no different you and i we want the same things lansing repeated the sentiment in a honeyed voice the words almost dreamlike as they wove among carpenters thoughts the spy felt himself falling under their spell we are the same we want the same things lost dees hands are drenched in blood you know as well as i that few would call him a good man he has no honour what a small sacrifice he would be to achieve such a great end and on lansing spoke the steady beat of his quiet words an enchantment that swept carpenters wits away little of what followed did the spy recall only the great swell of his yearning as he thought of fleeing his blooddrenched work for a simpler life and then he heard lansing say will you help end this war and he replied i will though it was dark he was sure the fay was smiling we would join you with us so we can whisper our secrets guide you comfort you why do you need me he murmured you can raise the dead to do your bidding you have your scarcrow men i am but one man and a lowly one at that one man who gives himself freely can achieve greater things than an army of mere flesh devoid of thought lansings footsteps drew closer once again do you give yourself freely if it will bring an end to this war and this suffering if we can have peace once more and lives without strife the fay lord knelt beside him and struck a flint carpenter screwed up his eyes as the white light blazed in the gloom once a candle had been lit he saw that lansing held a silver casket in the palm of one hand this path must be chosen the fay said we can no more enforce it than we can turn back the wind carpenter shook his head trying to dispel his hazy stupor an insistent voice echoed deep inside him but it was too faint to comprehend the words lansing flicked open the casket lid to reveal a silver egg lying upon folds of purple velvet it is a caraprix he said with an odd hint of fondness so simple in appearance yet containing such great power it lives the spy asked lansings lips twitched yes it lives it will be your most trusted companion should you let it oh the things it will whisper to you the wonders it will unfold and it will help me achieve the ends we both want so fervently it will then free my hands and let me hide it in my pouch i would be away from here and bring an end to this madness sooner rather than later you do not need your hands the fay said in a calm voice which carpenter found inexplicably troubling before he could probe further lansing delicately lifted the silver egg out of the casket and balanced it on his palm in front of the spys eyes the unblemished surface gleamed in the candlelight we will become one lansing said with a cold grin legs sprang out of the caraprixs side like a beetle it scurried across the fays palm and leapt on to carpenters face he cried out in shock as the sharp tips of those legs bit into his flesh and held fast it crawled down and though he clamped his mouth shut the spindly shanks wormed their way in between his teeth and forced his jaw apart as it wriggled past his lips he felt its smooth surface as warm and yielding as flesh sickened he tried to yell but only a strangled cry came out the caraprix forced itself further into his mouth towards his throat filling up every space until he choked darkness closed around his gaze as lansings emotionless face filled his vision he could only think how weak he had been and what terrible things were now to come chapter thirty night had fallen and the sea bellowed its fury iron waves hammered the tempest as it crashed towards the rocky fangs protruding from the swell wrenched back and forth in the grip of turbulent currents the galleon seemed caught in a battle it was impossible to win hold fast to the course courtenay bellowed his gaze fixed on the flashes of white water ahead sparks of orange light glittered across the dark sea from the vessels blazing lanterns yet the channel ahead remained pitch black god save our souls strangewayes called to the heavens he clung on to the rigging for dear life his shirt and breeches sodden from the surf gushing over the rail with every dip and crash only bloody jack can do that now will shouted back his fingers ached from gripping the greased rope the ship careered into the dark like a leaf caught in a flood for one queasy moment the prow pointed towards the glittering stars then plummeted down into a sable valley a deluge thundered over the prow before the brine had sluiced across the deck the ship crested another wave seasoned crewmen flew from their feet had the island lured them in only to dash them on the rocks will wondered his ears rang from the thunderous roar as they neared the long line of whitetopped breakers crashing against the lethal rocks it seemed there was no path through but courtenay stood like a sentinel on the forecastle unmoved by the furious heaving this is madness we will all die strangewayes cried i should be at graces side there is nothing you can do for her now hold fast or you will be thrown over the side will called back the galleon heaved as a loud grinding echoed through the hull from the rocks scraping along the side any moment will expected the jagged reef to tear through the pitchcovered oak in those violent currents the ship would break up in no time he gritted his teeth as the grinding grew louder until he feared the end had come the tempest lurched men crashed to the deck then suddenly the grating sound stopped and the galleon swept free of the clutching fingers of the black rocks relieved grins leapt to the harrowed faces of the seamen caught in the wildly swinging lanterns the violent shaking faded the seas grew calmer and a cheer rang out from all on deck when the tempest reached placid water courtenay gave the order to drop anchor as he strode the deck the men showed him their respect with broad grins or bowed heads bloody jack only laughed louder clapping his hands together in triumphant glee we have stared death in the face and once again the bony bastard has backed down he bellowed as he passed the night was cool and smelled sweetly of fresh vegetation now the danger had passed will wondered where his plans would take him next he found his thoughts swinging wildly between hope that one day he might see jenny again and dread that grace had been lost because of his own failings strangewayes cast one eye towards the island is this the place mentioned in the captains journal pon the abandoned spanish galleon we will find out in good time tobias but there have been tales of many a devilhaunted island in these parts perhaps the influence of the unseelie court grows stronger with each step closer to their home then let us pray we draw no nearer he glanced up past the men hooting and chattering as they scrambled up the rigging and then strode towards the captains cabin to see how grace fared once the sails had been furled and calm had descended on the galleon will sought out courtenay on the poop deck where the captain was swigging from a cup of wine by the light of the moon aware of the dangers that might lie ahead they agreed no landfall would be made until sunrise eager as he was to discover dee and megs fate will took the opportunity to snatch a few hours rest in a corner of the main deck while the men played cards and drank in the berth sleep came quickly through the dark he sailed deep into dreams once again he walked with jenny through the garden of the cottage she shared with her father and mother and grace in warwickshire in the sun honey bees buzzed lazily past the marigolds on their way to the hives at the end of the garden purpletopped lavender swayed past their legs his gaze flickered towards the dark band of woods ahead like a storm cloud on the horizon and he felt uneasy as he sensed that something watched him from their depths though he could not see it for some reason he couldnt fathom he believed it to be a raven those black glass eyes lay upon him heavy with judgement he was sure and then he realized that jenny was speaking to him her voice insistent and when he turned he saw worry in her features she was telling him not to go on to turn back forget everything live life for the west was where the dead went turn back turn back the world skewed and shadows rushed out from those dark woods to swallow him when his head had finished spinning he somehow knew it was the night of jennys disappearance he had spent hours searching the lanes and fields around her home desperation then fear then grief burning a hole in his chest no sign of her anywhere no sign of her ever again in arden and he was washing his hands by the well washing furiously to rid himself of the stain but he knew that it would never go that it lay deeper than flesh he was changed for ever no longer william swyfte the poet with a fine career ahead of him after he departed the debating halls of cambridge university no longer innocent and then he turned as he had and grace was there little grace pleading for news of her missing sister he tried to hide his hands so she would not see he tried rough hands were shaking him awake his eyes snapped open and he peered into strangewayes face as the spy loomed over him in an excited state his fists gripping wills shirt come he urged with passion come shaking the last of the dark dream from his head will staggered after the other man his heart beat faster when he saw tobias dash into the captains cabin inside grace was sitting up in her berth her head in her hands her lank hair falling across her face when she looked round as the two men entered she appeared baffled and will feared the worst her wits burned away by the searing touch of the unseelie court his breath caught in his throat yet after a moment she forced a weak smile and said you both look so troubled what is wrong relief flooded will you gave us a scare grace he said beaming you have been a bundle of trouble as long as i have known you she rolled her eyes and sniffed men call a woman trouble when she does not dance to their tune i am proud to be so described the two men laughed their moods lightening for the first time in days will knelt beside grace and tested her memory and her wits with several questions she answered every one clearly her puzzlement moving to annoyance until finally she told him she had had enough of being mothered promising he would explain everything to her soon he insisted she rest and build up her strength for there were more tribulations ahead outside the cabin door he closed his eyes and put his head back letting his relief show never would i have hoped for such an outcome he breathed it seems grace is stronger than you think strangewayes said his voice hard you see the little girl you first knew but she has grown into a woman as courageous as any man in that you are correct i have misjudged her when she has regained her strength i will reveal all she needs to know about the unseelie court and their foul ways do not expect forgiveness strangewayes said this time we were fortunate but grace should never have been placed in that danger he stalked away before will could respond the night drew on and on will climbed up to the forecastle and watched the shore feeling unease begin to replace his jubilation when footsteps drew near he turned men slept on the decks under the lit lamps courtenay strode past them his brow furrowed and the spy knew he was not alone in his worries the sun should have been up long ago bloody jack said eyeing the full moon and the milky sweep of stars as he neared yet this night stays and stays how much longer are we to be tormented by strangeness it is a strange world captain and an island where night outstays its welcome is not the worst thing in it courtenay shrugged vertiginous seas and bloodcrazed pirates were as nothing to him but will could see that the unnatural dark troubled him deeply well we cant sit here waiting till doomsday the captain muttered ill assemble the shore party but you must watch yourself out there master swyfte chapter thirtyone the island brooded in the deep dark no fires or lanterns glimmered no voices carried no sign of human habitation showed itself anywhere there was only the creak of the tempest at anchor and the wind across the waves uncommonly subdued courtenay disappeared below deck and returned with ten of his fiercest men will watched the rowing boat pull away as it ferried the sailors to the shore it disappeared into the dark and after what seemed an age lanterns flickered to life in a circle on the beach he joined the last boat with strangewayes who would not meet his eye you must put aside your feelings until we are back aboard ship will said in a low voice our survival could depend on us looking out for each other strangewayes did not reply through the gloom they could make out whitetopped waves lapping on to a small beach which led up to a dense line of trees silhouetted against the night sky the dark beneath the canopy was impenetrable the sweet scent of cooling vegetation drifted on the night breeze make a fire here on the strand will ordered when he stood in the circle of lamplight it will be a beacon for us as we explore the island while the men collected driftwood and dry brush from the treeline will clambered over the rock pools at the edge of the horseshoeshaped cove though he gained a different perspective of the island still he could see no sign of life once he had glanced towards the beach to ensure he had not been followed he crouched down and removed the obsidian mirror from his leather pouch it felt cool and comforting in his hand how much he had gambled bringing such a powerful object so close to the redoubt of the unseelie court and yet it had proved the source of such hope he laid the looking glass on a seaweedcovered rock and peered into its depths it seemed to glow of its own accord long moments passed but just as he began to lose hope the mirror clouded and jenny appeared in the glass once more she smiled but her eyes looked unaccountably sad you knew i was here wishing to speak to you he asked she nodded the mirror is powerful it calls out to to this place and she lowered her eyes trying to hide the depth of her feelings i look out for you will to see you again after so long she shook her head grimacing no i am being weak you must ignore my words stay away will there is too much at stake here i am worth nothing he shook his head with vehemence you are everything to me and i will risk everything to bring you home her tears welled and she screwed up her eyes to stifle them will felt overwhelmed by a rush of memories sensations and emotions crunching through crisp gold and orange leaves in the woods with jenny beside him their eyes meeting at the christmas feast amid the scent of cloves and hot sweet wine and the world seeming to hang though the dancers whirled around them a kiss on the day he left for cambridge thinking that surely there could be no worse pain than this parting if only he had known i have many questions he continued aware that time was short but first tell me have they harmed you in any way i am well she replied so quickly that he knew she was lying and his blood boiled who took you jenny and why why who can fathom the minds of these creatures she replied in a strained voice who she paused swallowed i was taken on the orders of mandraxas the king of these people and the first of the high family then he is the one who must feel the bite of my blade will replied his voice cold one day i will find my way to you and then you can never do that she said her voice breaking this fortress is impregnable high strong walls and many guards and to enter this land of the fay you must first pass through one of the gates into the place where the two worlds overlap how will i find them she sighed will tell me jenny he pressed the unseelie court say you will find the gates if you ever need them though it is much harder to leave twin pillars of stone they are in the sea around the new world you will surely know them for the rules of the natural world do not hold sway around them while he reflected upon her words a cry of alarm rang out he looked round and when he turned back the looking glass was clear his heart sank but only for a moment for he knew now that jenny was looking out for him too another cry rolled across the strand will stood and saw strangewayes lit up by the ruddy flames of the crews bonfire beckoning him back one of the men was pointing out to sea following the line of the mans arm will discerned lights bobbing far out on the dark ocean beyond the reef another ship was sailing towards the island when the tempests gun cracked will could only imagine that the new arrival was jean le griss devilhaunted pirate galleon the warning shot from captain courtenay would let their enemies know they had little hope of sailing through the rough waters beyond the reef in one piece at the bonfire the men had made burning brands with pitchsoaked sailcloth wrapped around fallen branches to light their way through the thick woods we must use well what little time we have will told them search for any paths leading away from the beach but stay in sight of each others torches and if we find nothing strangewayes muttered pray that we do tobias as they moved into the trees the dancing torchlight glowed like fireflies through the branches a symphony of subtle sounds surrounded them the whisper of leaves the groan of dry wood underfoot and the distant call of some night bird soon the dark swallowed the beach and the bonfire no one spoke will imagined dee and meg and the other survivors clawing their way out of the surf and staggering up the beach and into the woods it gave him hope where he knew there should not be any the ground sloped steadily upwards towards the centre of the island in the sultry heat sweat dripped from brows and soaked shirts the mens breath rasped with the exertion if the unseelie court find another cove to put into how long before we encounter them i wonder strangewayes thought aloud will noticed he kept one hand on the hilt of the dagger tucked into the waist of his breeches ahead one of the men whistled and the torches swept through the trees in the direction of the call the two spies found the other men gathered in a clearing looking up on the side of the hill at the heart of the island a tower stood silhouetted against the starry sky curious will said stroking his chinhair now who would call this dark place home on the far side of the clearing one of the men waved his torch cracked flagstones marked a path leading up through the trees so worn and overgrown they suggested great age strangewayes flashed a questioning look if i had survived a shipwreck a stone tower would have seemed a perfect shelter will replied holding his torch high he stepped on to the path happier now he had a destination in mind yet only a moment later a bloodcurdling howl echoed across the island uneasy the men huddled together eyes wide and darting around what was that strangewayes hissed man or beast will drew his dagger cold steel cuts either one he continued along the path more cautiously this time the path wound round the contours of the hill even with the torches will found it impossible to see any distance ahead when he paused to get his bearings beside a craggybarked tree the baying rolled out again so close this time that several men cried out in shock the sound stirred ancient fears in his head yet another yowl came a moment later behind them this time circling us will said hunting strangewayes whirled brandishing his dagger in front of him behind them along the path the baying changed into a low growl the sound of some beast preparing to attack stand your ground will called but the fearful seamen ran as one towards higher ground realizing they had no choice but to follow the two spies raced after them the frightened men burst out of the trees into another clearing at the foot of a rocky outcrop the torchlight glittered across the surface of a black pool fed by a spring trickling from the glistening cliff face make a stand will shouted putting away his dagger there will be no better place blades bristled out as the men formed a circle their drawn faces stark in the flames will snatched out his rapier and turned to look back down the shadowy path a snapping and snarling rang out but then a familiar womans voice called out leave them mooncalf they are not your prey silence fell across the woods when wills pounding heart had slowed he raised his torch and searched the dark beyond the pool in the wavering light a grey shape appeared coalescing into red meg she was barefoot her dress smudged and worn a grin sprang to the spys lips and he ran over to her it does me good to see you well meg he said with relief i had feared the worst her eyes narrowed as if she were trying to recall his face will swyfte she enquired with a faint baffled smile had she taken a knock to the head in the shipwreck he wondered but then her eyes sparkled and her smile broadened and she almost hugged him in her joy will swyfte after so long i never dared hope i would see your cocky face again ten weeks since liverpool is long indeed mistress meg but it could have been eternity ten weeks she shook her head puzzled once more since the storm washed us up on this island twelve years have passed chapter thirtytwo the stifling dark enveloped carpenter coarse sackcloth scratched his face as he stumbled along blindly at the bidding of his captors his breath rasped against the covering that had been thrust over his head aboard the galleon but sounds came to him clearly the whispering voices of the unseelie court speaking in their strange birdlike language the splash of the oars in the rowing boat the crash of waves and the crunch of sand underfoot as he lurched up the strand blood dripped from his stinging wrists where the rope chafed him but the pain only focused his mind with an effort he drove out the sickening sensation of the thing forcing its way down his throat and thought simply that he still lived when he came to a swaying halt rough hands yanked the sack off his head he stood on a small beach edged by steep cliffs facing a wall of dark spikyleaved trees torches hissed and spat in the hands of the dead pirates their greygreen skin peeling away to reveal the bone beneath the stink of rot floated on the breeze beyond the circle of light he could just discern the spectral faces of the fay in the gloom their fierce unblinking stares locked upon him reeking of unfamiliar spices jean le gris the pirate captain peered into the spys face with his one good eye scar tissue marred much of his skin above his wild black beard but carpenter saw that this man wore his wounds with pride with a gaptoothed grin the pirate tossed the sack away and said in heavily accented english savour your few last breaths dog your time in this world is done he swept a hand across his throat and laughed carpenter shrugged refusing to give the other man any satisfaction how can you throw your lot in with these foul creatures he said with contempt le griss grin faded leaning in closer he hissed do you think i had a choice if i had resisted i would have become like them he nodded towards his dead crew so you sacrificed your men to save your neck there is no honour among pirates it seems le gris snarled and carpenter felt the prick of a knifepoint at his neck a bubble of blood rose up they came like wolves in the night as we sailed down the channel ten men were dead before we even knew they had boarded us a cur like you cannot judge me the unseelie court never lost their ruthlessness the spy understood they needed a galleon that could survive an atlantic crossing and took the first one they found that would not be missed you survived that encounter because they needed your skills he said but soon you will have outlived your usefulness what then frenchman le griss blade moved back ready to cut carpenters throat but the englishman saw the other mans eyes flicker towards something further down the beach and the foulsmelling pirate stepped back propelled by unseen hands another hooded prisoner lurched beside the spy le gris snatched off the sack to reveal launceston his deathly pallor aglow in the torchlight you live carpenter said surprised by his rush of relief at his companions survival little good it does us the earl breathed the fay lord lansing sauntered past the men carrying a small gleaming chest a hand larger than the one that had held the caraprix he nodded for the pirate to follow him glowering at the two spies le gris took the chest and followed the fay like a servant carpenter imagined the frenchmans searing resentment at the humiliation and smiled to himself did they harm you he asked launceston they were poor company the earl replied with a shrug but i have endured worse when i was a child my father sealed me in a hole in the cellar with three rats for company to teach me a lesson he said he looked round the beach his voice unnervingly quiet i learned how to kill rats a little way away the silver box had been set on the sand lansing kneeled down and flicked open the lid drawing out a glass ball like the ones carpenter had seen in dees chambers he held it gently in the palm of his right hand four times lansing came to me his words were sugared but each one hid a demand for betrayal what could he offer me i have all i need now satisfying work companionship launceston paused we all have a place in this world and i have finally found mine i would not let him take that away from me carpenter hid his guilt pretending to be engrossed by the fay who was dismissing le gris with a lazy flick of his hand muttering under his breath lansing gestured as if drawing a silk kerchief off the glass ball a flood of colour rushed out the two spies recoiled as one more magics carpenter spat the shifting colours coalesced into a plane on which formed a relief chart of the crescentshaped island with a stone tower standing on the hill at the centre carpenter gaped as he saw thick woods and paths running through them valleys pools and streams and grassy clearings lansing crooked a finger at the pirate and then pointed to the tower the magician hides away here find him and bring him back and kill anyone who stands in your way le gris nodded his one eye wide with amazement here the fay continued moving his finger to a faint red glow following a path to the tower are the english spies he traced a line along a deep valley if you follow this route you will shave hours off your journey and perhaps reach the tower before our foes and this the pirate pointed to a single red spot keeping pace with will and the others carpenter saw lansings brow furrow the fay shook his head and turned back to the silver chest removing a giltedged mirror holding it up he whispered a few words and the glass clouded over gripped now carpenters eyes narrowed as a hawklike face appeared from the mist one golden eye one purple wide and unblinking under arched brows a long pointed nose ending at bowshaped lips that added a feminine touch to the strong features mandraxas brother lansing said with a curt bow of his head all strands come together here on the edge of the great everlasting you have the ortelgan mirror the voice rolled out from the glass high and sweet in time the fay lord responded first we will snare the magician dee once we have brought him home to endure the pleasures of fortress crepuscule all things must follow and so we make our plans brother and so we make our plans carpenter felt his stomach knot queasy with fear yet with the caraprix nestling deep inside him he knew there was no going back he set his doubts aside and wondered why that face in the mirror frightened him so it was as if his senses understood the essence of the creature and rebelled at the contact once the face had faded and the looking glass had clouded once more lansing returned it to the silver box with the glass ball and flipped the lid shut he stood saying to le gris organize your men or what is left of them while i see to the prisoners with his chin raised the fay wandered behind carpenter and launceston your time here is done he said in a quiet voice but your passing will not be painless for what would be the point we all have our skills my brothers and sisters and i our strengths our joys mine is the taking of a human life sometimes i come like a ghost men fall in a court in a foreign land their blood pooling around them and those standing beside them know not how their companion came to be dead sometimes i linger drawing out longheld secrets or cries or vows for the benefit of my people or for pleasure sometimes i slaughter wantonly allowing men to sink into the fierce beauty of my face the mere sight of me adding another subtle layer to their pain another delicate seasoning to my rapturous feast the high family knows my expertise and they use it well i am their sword enforcing their will in the world of men carpenter wondered then why lansing had not tortured him or launceston to achieve his ends he had used only words perhaps he had spoken truly when he expressed his desire for the peaceful return of his sister come to it then launceston said as if he were calling for another cup of sack i have no fear of death we are old friends carpenter heard lansing pass by the earl and step up to his back he felt cold breath upon his neck our agreement stands the fay whispered so launceston could not hear find the magician first and deliver him to me and no one will suffer you will be free to return to your life and this long war will be over the spy felt the kiss of cold steel against his skin as lansing slid his dagger under his bonds and slit the rope choose your moment well to flee the fay added before saying loudly i will leave the thoughts of your passing to settle deep into you and thereby make the experience all the richer soon now soon he strode across the dry sand to where le gris directed his men they appeared to understand his meaning robert carpenter whispered from the side of his mouth i have worked my bonds free when i make my move follow my lead the earl inclined his head in assent giving nothing away carpenter watched lansing guide the pirates until their backs were turned and then he grabbed launcestons arm and drew him silently into the trees when they were deep in the dark and running as fast as they could he heard le griss cry too late to raise the alarm carpenter said once we have put some space between us i will free you from your bonds robert and then we shall bring this matter to a close his chest swelled with exuberance soon he would be going home chapter thirtythree black clouds loped across the sky devouring the stars and the moon branches thrashed in the claws of the wind raking through the trees on the hillside the torches roared and spat as the frightened men of the tempests shore party forced their way through the rising gale towards the tower where dee and meg had taken shelter with the storm they could sense something darker coming too long fingers of shadow reaching across the tropical island to snuff out their lives as easily as the lights that guided their way when the howl of the mooncalf rolled out near at hand they jumped and cursed death lay everywhere what is that thing will asked his shirt damp against his hot skin dees watchdog meg replied she lifted the hem of her grey skirt as she climbed the overgrown stone steps of the narrow path occasionally she would flash glances at her companion that ended with a puzzled smile as if she still could not believe he was there the alchemist made it made it out of she paused looking away into the dark under the trees no matter will still hadnt decided whether her suffering on dees haunted ship and in the wreck on the reef had driven her mad her ship had been at best only two weeks ahead of the tempest how then could she believe she had been upon that island for twelve years he had not yet broached the subject for fear the questioning would unbalance her further but he needed answers if he were to snatch a victory from the coming conflict strangewayes strode up behind them from the rear of the column how long before the sun comes up he snapped i have had my fill of this night put aside any hopes of feeling the sun on your face the irish spy responded that will not occur until dee decrees it the doctor holds the sun at bay will said with incredulity he had seen the alchemist at play with charts of the stars and potions and incantations but never had the old man displayed the kind of power that could shake the heavens dee has gone quite mad she said and in his madness he has found a way to tap into forces that should never be conjured by mortals this island too is a special place where strange and troubling things occur and whatever qualities it possesses only seem to serve to add to the old mans magics but holding back the sun strangewayes gasped why that is the remit of god alone then god he is meg looked up as the first fat drops of rain began to fall when he senses threat he brings the night to confound his enemies or calls storms to dash ships upon the rocks and she added the mooncalf hunts better at night will heard the unseen creature snuffling and snorting in the undergrowth breaking branches as it kept pace with them it terrified the men with every step but whatever it was it seemed to obey the womans every word so they were safe for now men are not as easy to control as the unseelie court believe he said they think they can run us like rats but dee has confounded them how so strangewayes asked in posing as the angels he believed he contacted he was lured away from the path of light and eventually when they were ready they sent him spinning off into the dark he took with him our last hope to repair our defences against them and in their hands but he is not in their hands in liverpool the enemy thought they could spirit him away as easily as they steal babes from their cribs but they have been forced to chase him across half a world right to their very doorstep twould seem to me that dee had long since prepared his own defences anticipating that the fay would one day attempt to take him and when they did try to exert their control he unleashed his moonside which still holds sway will wiped the raindrops from his eyes enjoying the cooling touch on his skin in his madness he is unpredictable and uncontrollable and he would hope beyond their reach then why come so close to their home the other man asked surely he would flee away from them dee is cunning if he is here there is a reason for it the path wound round the hillside as it rose towards the tower emerging from the thickest part of the woods they saw lightning crackling along the horizon and bands of heavier rain marching across the treetops towards them in one white flash will found meg staring at him and asked what troubled her you still look as young as that last day i saw you so long ago in liverpool she replied how can this be and you have not altered one whit he watched her face ready to change the subject if she became distressed no she said with a shake of her head rubbing her fingers over her smooth cheeks tis true can you not see it dee allows me sight of no mirrors pon this island the windows of the unseelie court he calls them her brow furrowed you say the years have not taken their toll pon me there have been no years meg will said gently for us only ten weeks have passed since liverpool the irish woman bowed her head struggling to comprehend what she had heard this cannot be my memory is filled with so many things happening here so much struggle and misery such loneliness that at times i thought i could not bear it coping with the old mans caresses while my stomach turned and listening to his ramblings about magic and philosophy and history and yet he told me once that in the home of the fay time did not march as you and i know it it hovered or folded back upon itself ofttimes the sands did not run at all that is why he said the fay never aged and why their schemes run over years and centuries even perhaps this island has similar qualities perhaps so if not the home of the fay mayhap it sits upon the borderlands in the shadow of that place will felt his heart go out to her as he saw her troubles laid bare in her face the other members of your crew those who survived the wreck died over time the mooncalf has a taste for human flesh and in those early days soon after he was created dee struggled to control him he kept one mirror in those first months on the island and taunted his enemies through it one fay of fierce beauty a witch by any other name attempted to seduce him with her charms her name was malantha one of the high family and she and dee battled wits for long weeks while the mooncalf stalked the island killing men dees weakness was always the pleasures of the flesh and the unseelie court see every mans weakness clearly malantha spun a web around him with her seduction and only when the old man appeared on the brink of revealing the location of this place did he break free of her spell and shatter the mirror this island was hidden to the unseelie court that is why dee settled here will brooded for a moment as he thought he played the fay had they in turn played him pretending to try to stop him reaching dee while in truth following him to the prize he silently cursed himself for his overconfidence where the unseelie court were concerned nothing could be taken for granted he should have learned that long ago thunder cracked overhead and rain sheeted down forcing the sailors to move under the canopy of leaves to prevent the torches from being extinguished meg seemed oblivious of the downpour after these twelve long years i am weary she admitted i yearn to be free of this business to walk once more across irelands green meadows and hear the songs of my people twelve years on an island with only dr dee for company might have seemed like an eternity mistress meg but the world still waits for you just as it always was nothing has been lost will understood well her doubts and sorrows they were too much alike the two of them that is a second chance few people get for a moment longer she kept her head down but when she looked back at him with a seductive grin and the fire alight in her eyes once more he saw the meg he knew then let us waste no more time on miserable thoughts the sooner we can overpower the mad magician the sooner we can return home and then we can dance and make merry and perhaps he smiled at the promise in her eyes before he could reply calls and the sound of running feet echoed from the path ahead as the sailors drew their knives and rapiers two men careered out of the gloom and the wall of rain will recoiled fearing he was seeing ghosts hair plastered to their heads and clothes sodden carpenter and launceston skidded to a halt will stared for a moment stunned at last carpenter said breathless i could not bear to run another mile john will exclaimed grasping the other mans shoulders he beamed barely believing his own eyes robert you survived the unseelie court took us aboard their ship the earl replied his whispery voice almost lost beneath the pounding of the rain but we escaped them will laughed relief flooding him his conscience had been stained by many things but here was one that would no longer haunt him fortune indeed smiles on us grace has recovered and meg here and the two of you have wriggled out of deaths grasp only a day ago i never would have believed it possible pfft we have survived worse launceston sniffed wiping the rain from his face let us save our tales for another time carpenter insisted glancing over his shoulder lansing marches towards the tower to seize dee with the pirate le gris and his dead crew alongside him we have little time they know a short cut will felt on fire his spirits had been low but now it seemed as if no obstacle was too great come then lads now we are reunited let nothing stand in our way for england even as the other men gave full voice to his cheer another oath seared through his mind for jenny soon now he thought soon he would have answers and then revenge chapter thirtyfour from out of the driving rain the dark finger of the tower appeared thunder boomed and lightning flashed turning the world white the column of sodden men raced up the final steps of the crumbling path into a forecourt of broken flagstones where yellowing grass pushed through the cracks a low wall ran round the edge overlooking a deep drop down the rocky hillside to the woods below one by one the torches fizzled and went out in the deluge until they had to splash through pools to cross the final few feet to the foot of the soaring structure will looked up but the summit was lost to the dark no lights gleamed from the slit windows worn by the elements the tower looked ancient as old and rough as the stones standing in circles on englands moors above his head he could just glimpse carvings running round the periphery their original shapes lost to the slow erosion of the years so that it appeared strange creatures were being birthed from the rock itself carpenter returned from a circuit of the towers foot and yelled above the gale there is no doorway dee has hidden it since i departed meg shouted with his magics the good doctor is greatly changed by his experiences will explained to the other men his words barely audible above the blasting wind and he has powers now that allow him to walk with the gods we must not underestimate him all well and good strangewayes bawled but how do we get inside before the enemy get here meg peered up the vertiginous walls of the tower pointing up there at the height of five men there is an arched window are we apes carpenter raged you expect us to climb that smooth wall and in this storm even if we could find fingerholds we would be dashed off by the gale in moments the irish spy narrowed her eyes at him then it must be my second suggestion ram your hard head against the wall enough times and you may batter your way through when carpenter bristled will rested a calming hand on his shoulder what choice do we have john cup your hands for my shoe i will try first how high must one climb before bones break in the fall i wonder launceston mused stroking his chin before organs burst curb your hunger robert will said you may find out for yourself once the rest of us have failed wait meg stepped forward pressing the palms of her hand together as if in prayer there is another way but it has many dangers more dangers than climbing this tower in the storm strangewayes growled more suffering before you die meg said arching one eyebrow the mooncalf could climb this tower with ease indeed i have seen him do it many a time he could carry one of you on his back but at any moment he might unleash the savagery in his breast and rip you limb from limb and eat your heart before it has stopped beating will nodded to meg very well we cannot be defeated at this stage i will take that risk why not let him try meg said in a wry tone pointing at carpenter who glowered back i have asked you all to put your lives in jeopardy in recent times now it is my turn will said summon dees beast he instructed the tempests crewmen to guard the perimeter of the courtyard thus sparing them the sight of what might be to come the sailors were only too ready to comply the five spies stood shoulder to shoulder peering into the dark as meg called out to the creature the howling wind dropped for an instant and the sound of snuffling and growling drew nearer will sensed the others grow tense the reek of bloody offal whipped by on the wind a low hunched shape darker than the clustering trees appeared at the top of the steps leading to the courtyard loping forward with a rolling gait it gathered speed snarling as it bounded towards will at the last meg stepped in front of him she held her head up in a commanding stance mooncalf heed me she called out into the night do not harm these men you will have other food soon enough at the crack of her voice the beast slowed and came to a stop two swordlengths away she controls it like a prancing pony strangewayes hissed how so the spies took a step back as they took in the horror before them will studied the shadows pooling in megs face and thought he glimpsed the softening of her features as the mooncalf raised itself up on powerful legs he caught sight of the outline of a broad flattened head that reminded him of the bulls baited in the bear garden on bankside the skin was blacker than the night and seemed to gleam as it moved like pitch white eyes burning cold moved across the spies strangewayes gasped as a lightning flash revealed a face like melted candle wax the flesh running down to the broad shoulders the mouth was a black gash showing a hint of sharp stained teeth the strong body looked twisted as if the mooncalf had been tortured on the rack yet its muscular power was unmistakable despite its terrifying appearance though will sensed something oddly human about it do not harm them meg repeated as a threatening growl rumbled deep in its throat you are mad to risk your life with that thing carpenter whispered it is a wild animal barely tamed at all i would be mad to stand here and do nothing will replied meg flashed him a look of concern but then put on a confident face and spoke to the mooncalf so quietly that none could hear what she said the beast lurched forward its breath reeking of meat it flung its arms round will and lifted him effortlessly pinning him in the crook of its right arm it bounded at the tower wall taloned feet and the long fingers of its left hand found cracks and crevices barely visible to the naked eye in the dark with a rolling movement the mooncalf began to climb pressed tight against the leathery flesh will glanced sideways and saw those eyes flicker towards him in them he recognized some semblance of intelligence and it troubled him what was this thing not beast not man with a snarl of warning the mooncalfs lips curled back from its yellow fangs forcing will to look away the anxious voices of the other spies slipped beneath the howl of the wind and the rattle of the driving rain the dark closed in around them an endless chasm threatening to suck them down higher the mooncalf climbed seemingly up into the very heart of the storm just when will feared he would be dashed on to the courtyard far below the beasts fingers closed on the crumbling lip of an arched window heaved inside will crashed on to dry flagstones the rainwater pooling around him the creature crouched by the window watching the spy through slit eyes its low growl echoed through the still chamber if you can understand my words i thank you though will was hesitant to turn his back on the beast he felt along the wall until he found an extinguished torch and lit it with the flint from his leather pouch the darkness danced away from the flame and he saw he was in a bare stone room with an empty hearth two arched doorways led out of it though the tower was silent he felt that it was not empty as if someone waited only a chamber away he imagined dee sitting in the dark somewhere above him not the dee he knew the wildly inventive but mad scholar who had devoted his life to holding the line against the forces of the moon that threatened to usurp the sunlit world but a brooding dee corrupted by a different kind of madness and consumed by the well of power into which he had tapped who saw all as his enemy he had built his fortress here on this island with the only human who meant anything to him and he would not easily be shifted edging along the wall with one eye on the mooncalf will ghosted through the nearest doorway on to a spiral stone staircase leading down into shadows chapter thirtyfive hard rain lashed the knot of spies huddled against the tower wall suspended in a sea of night they could have been a thousand miles away from any other living soul as they searched the dark for the coming attack but the windthrashed trees sounded like waves crashing against their small island of stone drowning even the noisiest approach and the gale snatched at their hair and clothes to distract them strangewayes gripped his rapier remembering his days learning the blade in the precinct of chelmsford cathedral under the tutelage of the master adam abell a good student but hotheaded that had always been his teachers assessment and over the years as he had earned his reputation and joined the employ of the earl of essexs newly minted band of spies he had fought hard to control that simmering temper but now it burned hotter than ever when he had left essex to join cecils more seasoned group he had hoped to learn more at the feet of the lauded will swyfte englands greatest spy but swyfte had proved a straw man he was only concerned with his own needs caring little about the harm he caused to others even grace especially grace strangewayes would never have survived his first brush with the unseelie court if grace had not been his rock and for that alone he would give his last breath to save her if swyfte placed her in danger one more time strangewayes would kill him with no qualms he thought back to the accusations the spymaster sir robert cecil had made in london and realized that this battle was no longer between human and fay but between himself and swyfte for the soul of the woman he loved for an instant the wind dropped and in the space a low unearthly moan rolled out across the courtyard strangewayes felt the hairs on his neck prickle what devilry is that he demanded launceston ignored him as graven and unreadable as ever and carpenter only swore at him to stay silent conjure up no nightmares meg told him there will be time enough to face our fears though they all treated him like a child it was the irish spy he hated the most she acted as brazen as a bankside doxy spinning men round with her wiles of all of the spies the irish woman was the least trustworthy he had decided i am not scared of anything he replied then you are a fool she came back as quick as a flash strangewayes felt stung for only a moment before movement away in the dark caught his eye a figure lurched towards them it was one of the crewmen and his gait was as rolling as if he stood on deck in a storm the spy grew cold though he did not know why the staggering sailor seemed to glow in the dark as pale as launceston his clothes as well as his skin the sight reminded the spy of the fish he had once seen swimming in a cave pool he swallowed uneasy the unseelie court have arrived launceston intoned as the man stumbled nearer a lightning flash lit him clearly he was white from head to toe as if encrusted in salt his eyes staring in terror from his scabrous face mewling he reached out to the spies with one clutching hand which seemed to diminish with each passing moment the rain is washing him away strangewayes thought horrified in the deluge the sailor dissolved piece by piece a part of his jaw gone here an arm there his body dissipating yet still alive still calling out in that incomprehensible whine the flood of white crystals frosted the rain pools in the courtyard barely able to believe what he was seeing strangewayes watched as the man sank to his knees which melted away to leave the torso flailing from side to side until finally only a crumbling face peered up from the wet stone still crying when that too was gone strangewayes reeled out of his sickened trance shadows whirled in the rainswept night the remnants of the shore party fighting with le griss decaying crew the spy watched one of the tempests men hacking into pieces an unrecognizable but still quivering piece of dead flesh strangewayes would have run to the aid of the men but a hand fell hard on his shoulder they need our aid he protested set aside feelings and be cold we have work to do launceston replied struggling to ignore the cries of the dying strangewayes reminded himself that returning dee to london was all that mattered all their lives meant nothing in the pursuit of that aim then le gris emerged from the dark and three other grey pirates followed one missing an arm another an eye once your entrails hang from my sword i can claim the treasure i have been promised le gris yelled above the cacophony of the storm he levelled his rapier daring one of the spies to confront him carpenter broke away from the others and leapt to cross swords with the french pirate the unseelie court jangle shiny things in front of weak men but they are as insubstantial as rainbows the spy said with a vehemence that puzzled strangewayes they can never be reached and men waste a lifetime trying le gris only laughed as the two men danced around each other thrusting and parrying in the downpour strangewayes glimpsed a figure bearing down upon him spinning he swung up his rapier just as a dead pirate hacked with its own blade a dull ache burned in his shoulder from the force of the walking corpses blow choking on the stink of decaying flash he easily sidestepped the next thrust yet what the thing lacked in expertise it made up for with untiring force the unblinking face loomed closer ragged lips hanging off clenched teeth fat white maggots at play on exposed cheek flesh when the spy pierced the heart for a second time he grasped the futility of his strategy before he could find another approach he saw carpenter slip to one knee on the wet stone defenceless the other man could only look up as a leering le gris levelled his rapier for the killing stroke without a second thought strangewayes dropped his own defence and parried le griss thrust he sensed the dead pirate swing for his neck and screwed his eyes shut in the certain knowledge that his life was over when the blow failed to strike he looked round to see meg whisking her dagger back as the pirates entrails splashed into the puddles sweeping an arm out the irish woman gave strangewayes a theatrical bow carpenter recovered and thrust his blade into le griss thigh the pirate howled in agony and staggered away blood seeping between his fingers as he clutched his leg brushing back his wet hair from his pink scars carpenter turned to strangewayes and gasped i owe you my life and i owe mine to her strangewayes replied masking his irritation that the woman he loathed had saved him we keep no score here very well carpenter replied looking round two other bodies lay writhing in black pools launceston loomed over them his sword dripping gore and a hungry gleam in his eyes as he examined each man in turn you have done your work there robert carpenter called with a weary shake of his head let it be the four spies backed against the wet stone of the tower one by one the cries of the dying seamen ebbed away beneath the howl of the storm until no human voice remained strangewayes squinted trying to pierce the night he saw misshapen heaps that had once been human innards turned to straw or faces twisted into twirls of blackthorn all the monstrous work of the fay he felt sickened by the atrocities committed by their enemy beyond the bodies grey shapes flitted like moonshadows the unseelie court began to creep forward stand firm lads meg called twirling her dagger well show them some cold steel before we take our bows strangewayes gritted his teeth and thought of grace until the rattle of a bolt at his back distracted him a door that he could have sworn was not there before swung open at the base of the tower a torch flared in the dark interior better late than never swyfte said with a grin step lively now this door will not hold them off for long chapter thirtysix shadows swarmed away from the hissing torch flame as will bounded up the worn steps two at a time at bay beyond the thick walls the storm was barely more than a susurration the other spies followed their breath rasping they will keep coming strangewayes wheezed his gaze downcast they always do always nothing can hold them back let us hear no signs of weakness launceston had an edge in his voice will felt relieved to see they had all survived though from their drawn faces he could tell they had all fought hard he would have liked to know the fate of the sailors who had accompanied them but decided that question could wait constantly glancing back in case dees twisted creation the mooncalf attacked he had taken what seemed like an eternity to navigate the towers vertiginous and winding steps and he had feared the worst yes like the tides they come and they come but they have not overwhelmed us he said with determination we must use our wits and our guile to stay one step ahead and soon the time will come when the tide will be turned after travelling half the world he could scarce believe they were so close to their goal he would not allow the fay to stop him laying claim to dee at this late stage such fine swordsmen have nothing to fear from any enemy why your prowess melts a womans heart meg teased but her next words were edged with caution but the alchemist will have protected himself if he hides in the highest room in the tower he will be unreachable in his madness and fear of attack his mind has turned in these past years to fiendish traps which he has secreted on the approach to his chamber dees inventions were mad even when he professed to sanity carpenter muttered how can we outwit such a man he paused then added strangewayes you should lead the way the younger spy glowered but said nothing will threw up his left arm to halt the others cocking his head as he listened whispers floated all around sounding like the voices of the dead piercing the thin veil between their world and his own when he realized the eerie voices came and went with the strength of the draught whistling down the steps he raised the torch to reveal carvings of grotesque faces following the curve of the wall just above their heads small holes had been fashioned in them as they caught the air currents they produced the unsettling whispers in our first years here dee spent some time attempting to discover who built this place megs deep singsong voice drowned out the ghosts gods or fay or men he never found his answers but they left many wonders behind will began to climb once more torn between caution towards what lay ahead and haste from what was behind them watch our backs robert he said to launceston if you have even the slightest suspicion the enemy are coming up sing out as they climbed the bare walls became covered with faded tapestries or shelves of mouldering tomes muffling the echoes of their tread they passed bolted doors hiding silent chambers strange scents drifted on the dry air some sweet and spicy others with a bitter tang but will could smell no hint of any man just as he was beginning to wonder if dee had hidden himself away somewhere else he was confronted by a flare of light and a dark figure it was his own reflection in a giltedged mirror that filled the width of the passage the way is barred strangewayes asked have we wasted our time he turned his narrowing eyes on meg her brow creased no dee told me another chamber lay at the top of the tower will traced his fingertips across the smooth cold surface of the glass and after a moment gently applied pressure a click echoed and the mirror pivoted to reveal a space a swords length square bounded by three more mirrors on the low vaulted ceiling more twisted faces whispered their unsettling entreaties it seems he said with a hint of a smile we are now playing dr dees game as the five spies pressed into the tight space the mirror pivoted shut behind them launceston pressed his shoulder against it but it held fast trapped carpenter grumbled or not will said that would be too simple for a man like dee tricks and puzzles and games are what fire him and in them he finds his own kind of torture he peered into each of the three facing mirrors in turn then said i would wager we are in a maze meg nodded understanding each mirror opens on to another space like this one we lose hours if not days if not our wits or our lives finding a way through when carpenter reached out to press one of the mirrors will caught his wrist we should choose carefully john if i know dees cunning he will have arranged it that once a choice has been made neither of the other two ways can be opened otherwise it would be a matter of simply searching all possible paths and no going back launceston mused studying his reflection he smoothed one eyebrow with his index finger we have no time to dawdle let us make our choice and move on strangewayes snapped they are all the same how can we know which way to go the younger spy was correct will accepted they could not afford to tarry he selected the mirror to his left and swung it open as he had expected another square of mirrors confronted him once the others had squeezed in he heard the mirror at their backs close with an echoing click this is madness carpenter exclaimed we will be lost in this hell until judgement day for long moments they passed through an endless procession of themselves their faces seeming more haunted in each new space they entered will found his head swimming with flashes of reflected torchlight sparkling eyes and the constant whispers from the carvings overhead he shook his head trying to dispel visions of other shadowy figures looking over their shoulders he could see that the others also struggled with the assault upon their senses in the confined spaces there is more at play here than mirrors he said as he stepped through another opening the words had barely left his lips when the door jerked from his grip and slammed with surprising force separating him from the rest he hammered on the glass but it seemed unbreakable through the barrier he could hear carpenters muffled curses but after a moment they died away only silence remained perhaps this too was part of dees trap divide and conquer with grim determination he turned to move forward alone time seemed to stretch out in a constant parade of mirrors and doors in every space images of himself reached out for ever an unending but insubstantial pageant of will swyftes ineffectually fighting a battle that would never end he began to notice that the incomprehensible droning whispers were starting to make a kind of sense urging him on towards despair the mirrors themselves pricked his unease the unseelie court communicated through them lived within them for all he knew were they now watching his every move laughing at his failures luring him on to his doom barely had the thought crossed his mind before he saw his reflection melt away in its place loomed up the yellowing and hideous skull beneath the skin death is waiting for you it told him and it is closer than you think his heart began to pound and a sheen of sweat glistened on his brow reeling he tore open another mirror and stepped through to the next small chamber and the one after that he felt hours pass days years his reflection aged the skin hanging from his face in loose folds until it crumbled to dust then became young and vital once more wrenching open one mirror he was greeted by an image of dee the old man sat in a highbacked wooden chair that resembled the confessors throne in westminster abbey his eyes were black pebbles in a frozen face brooding he was plotting death not the dee that will knew at all the vision vanished in the blink of an eye but not before will felt it sear itself upon his mind more mirrors glittered endless will swyftes as he stumbled into another chamber the glass showed no reflection nor a hint of what might be but a memory it was night and he stood by the well in arden on the day and night that had changed the course of his life for ever it was the day jenny was stolen from him but that had not been the only assault upon his life he was there washing his hands over and over again desperately trying to rid them of the blood that now turned the water brown and he heard the soft tread of small feet at his back and knew that it was grace he could not let her see his crime his failure and so he turned to her and smiled and spoke as sweetly as he could but that was the moment he knew he was not a good man and could never be again redemption would never come for him all that remained in life was saving jenny if he could do that at least he could achieve something good in his miserable existence and then in his befuddled mind a single clear thought surfaced it felt like a revelation a burning truth the unseelie court steal our innocence he thought that is their greatest crime they corrupt our highest aspirations and force us to be base and grubby with shaking hands he ripped open the mirror and teetered on the brink of a pure black abyss buffeting wind lashed rain into his face somehow his fingers clutched on to the jamb the door had opened in the wall of the tower and he half hung over a vertiginous drop into the night the blast of air and the wet cleared some of the delirium from his mind and he understood what a trap dee had set only reactions honed by a lifetime of battle had prevented him from plunging to his doom others would not have been so fortunate as he dragged himself back he glimpsed movement below him even in his feverish state his senses jangled gripping on to the jamb he leaned out into the storm once more and peered down squinting he could just make out shapes shifting on the sheer wall like fat grey spiders the enemy scaled the tower clinging on to the galelashed stone with supernatural skill bypassing the mirror maze they would be upon dee in no time at all chapter thirtyseven the mirror swung open without a sound blinking in the glare of candlelight after so long stumbling through the dark carpenter looked round a small antechamber lined with leatherbound books on a trestle in a corner stood rolls of yellowing charts a human skull with a fragment of pate missing an ivoryhandled knife with a curved blade and a small silver casket he could still smell the sweet aroma which had hung in the air since they had entered the mirror maze but over the top of it now drifted the reek of human sweat his head swam from the visions that had floated across his minds eye since he had become separated from the others his love alice dalingridge calling to him still as beautiful as when she had been alive his father now so long in the grave showing him how to chop wood behind the thatched cottage in the forest clearing and that thing tearing at his face in the frozen muscovy woods when swyfte had left him for dead and he had felt all hope desert him time no longer meant anything to him he might have been in that black glass world for years with a shaking hand he wiped the sweat from his brow and steadied himself at least that damnable whispering had left him in peace creeping forward he listened at the door to the next chamber when no sound reached his ears he opened it a crack and peered inside amid shelves of books dee sat on a stool in front of the cold hearth his back to carpenter the old man had his head in his hands deep in thought the spy drew his dagger in case he had to prick the alchemist to urge him to obey as he prepared to step into the chamber a hand fell on his shoulder he almost cried out and lashed out with his knife the steel whipped a hairs breadth from launcestons throat pulling the door shut carpenter pushed the earl to the other side of the antechamber and whispered you fool i could have killed you he flinched at the other mans penetrating gaze what was your intention the earl asked in his blank emotionless voice to capture dee of course carpenters gaze flickered away from the other mans probing eyes after a moment the earl spoke his tone measured i have had little comfort in my life despite the land my family has owned and the wealth we have amassed or perhaps because of it my father was not a man given to sentiment ledgers and balance sheets prescribed the limits of his life the cold stone of our castle rarely heated even in winter was the womb of his existence he sought to teach me harsh lessons feeling mayhap that it would best prepare me for the kind of life he lived cellars and drains and holes were my billet days spent in dark and damp with only rats and beetles for friends blood and bruises and broken bones no traitor in the tower fared worse i wonder sometimes if god made me the monster i am or if it was my father he wrinkled his nose and shrugged it matters little we are what we are carpenter glanced towards the door half expecting dee to come out and cast some vile spell on them why are you telling me these things he asked in irritation i killed him my father he was my first at the time i thought it would ease the ache that reached deep inside me launceston cocked his head narrowing his eyes as he stared into the middle distance it only increased my appetite when something has been taken away we try to replenish the space left behind with other things but that is like filling the sea with sand you are a madman why speak like this now here you have lost the woman you loved seen your face scarred and the very foundations of your life shaken you are trying to fill the sea with sand the earl said carpenter furrowed his brow trying to tease out the meaning in his companions words he sensed a weight there and it puzzled him launceston rarely spoke and never expressed his innermost thoughts or feelings indeed carpenter had come to believe the earl had none i know not what lansing offered you when you were his prisoner but it was a deal with the devil the aristocrat said his voice now a whisper and then carpenter understood no one saw into the earl but launceston had seen into him your belief that you can achieve your hearts desire has blinded you to the truth the bastard offered me nothing carpenter lied with a derisive laugh i resisted all his attempts to torture me the unseelie court rarely have need to torture and i know you better than you know yourself the other man replied turning his gaze towards the candle flame carpenter thought he appeared to be trying to dredge up the remnants of whatever human emotion had survived from his earliest days a monk trying to comprehend the ways of a bankside doxy might have looked equally baffled the decision you make this day will define the course of the rest of your life launceston continued i will not stand in your way whatever you choose you have stood by me when most other men would have walked away in disgust that is something i have never known in my life and i value it more than you could understand for the first time in my dismal existence i have found a place where i am at ease here among men who deal in false faces and deceit yet hold themselves to a higher standard than most honest men i made no deal with lansing carpenter interrupted trying to hide the bitterness in his voice launceston continued as if the other man had not spoken and i feel there is a place here for you too if only you would open your eyes to it in the midst of all this strife we can find peace yes and swyfte too to replace the things that have been stolen from us seek out the morals that have always guided you carpenter laughed i am being lectured on morals by a man who has killed children if he had expected the earl to be stung by the gibe launceston did not show it we must not become the men the unseelie court believe us to be the aristocrat ended his searching gaze fixed upon the other mans face carpenter felt the guilt rise inside him how weak he had been and he had known it and tried to deny it yet here was a man without a heart refusing to judge him and wanting him to aspire to greater things what a mad world they had entered when they had stepped within the tower i made no deal with lansing he repeated adding in a gentler tone and i would never have given dee up to them let us work together to capture the old man and deliver him to the tempest then perhaps we can escape this steaming hell and return home but as they crept back to the door he felt his falsehoods lying heavily upon him amends would need to be made he shook his head to dispel the bitter taste of failure and saw traces of candlelight stream through the air there is still magic at play here he muttered easing open the door he peered through the crack dee still sat in the same position bowed in front of the hearth carpenter wondered if the old man had died so still was he but he drew his dagger none the less with a man like dee he would take no chances holding his breath he eased towards the hunched figure his head throbbed and his mouth felt dry when he crooked his arm to slip it round the alchemists neck he suddenly felt a fist grab the back of his shirt and drag him backwards a breeze whisked past his face as an axeblade swung from the shadows above and smashed into dees side throwing him to the flagstones carpenter gaped one step further and it would have been his head rolling across the floor launceston knelt and picked up a thread that had been broken as carpenter entered another of dees traps but with this one he had paid the price yet as carpenter whirled back to the fallen figure he saw the truth in the shapeless robes pulling them to one side the spy revealed a frame of twisted saplings how could i ever have believed that was dee he muttered you were entranced by whatever spell the alchemist has woven here launceston said his tone was flat but he clearly did not want carpenter to blame himself carpenter sighed so the old man still hides away we must resume our search he turned towards the door so that the aristocrat would not see the worry in his face deep inside he could feel the caraprix wriggling and whispering its seductive words deep inside he could feel himself dying by the moment chapter thirtyeight the torch guttered and hissed will watched its endless reflections in the glittering mirrors deep in thought no shadows could exist in that blazing world of light and for the first time the spy thought he could see clearly outside the unseelie court still climbed the tower drawing closer by the moment he pushed his anxiety to one side and remained calm focused when he had slammed the door and escaped back into the mirror maze he realized the blast from the storm had cleared his head the whispers from the carvings washed around him but now he paid them attention the dancing light of the torch flame was no more a mere distraction he sucked in a deep breath letting the sweet smell with its bitter undertones envelop him all he needed had been there from the beginning but as dee had no doubt suspected his attention had been elsewhere the alchemist was a man of intellect given to rigorous thought and reflection he enjoyed his games of strategy his chess his nine mens morris puzzles with solutions that could be extracted through reflection will nodded to himself ignoring the call to urgency kneeling he waved the torch close to one of the mirrors around the area where a hand would push the door open a faint sticky residue smeared the surface will smiled cunning dee who loved his concoctions his herbs and clays and bubbling pots of lamb fat in times past the wise man had demonstrated the mysterious but effective potions he had brewed in his chambers some had been poisons with rapid lethal effect others sent a man to sleep or made them foam at the mouth in a wild rage and some turned wits to quicksilver and conjured visions out of thin air the spy stripped off his sodden shirt and flicked it round his right hand with his skin covered the paste would not seep into him and he would have time to recover from earlier contact he held the torch high and watched the flames whip away from the hollow mouths of the whispering carvings the unsettling sound had been designed to add to the offkilter effects of dees paste he realized but they required a strong draught to work the torch flame pointed away from the source he lowered his eyes refusing to look into the mirrors as he fought to overcome the subtle effects of the drug then when he was ready he pressed open the door with his covered hand and began to follow the trail back watching the torch as he progressed through the mirror chambers he saw the draught grow stronger when the whispering became the chattering of madmen in bedlam the dancing light revealed the edges of a trapdoor in the vaulted ceiling the breeze blew through small holes on each of the four sides will reached up to a shallow indentation in the centre of the trap and pressed with a click the door swung down followed by a coiled rope ladder he squinted into that dark square and thought he could see a distant glimmer of faint light determination burned through his foggy thoughts the time of confusion had ended laying the torch on the cold flagstones he set one foot on the ladder and began to climb into the dark he found himself at the foot of a flight of narrow stone steps leading up to a small arched door standing slightly ajar candlelight gleamed through the crack the sweet fragrance of incense drifted on the draught and he could hear faint mutterings of incantations in latin drawing his dagger he crept closer through the slit of open door he could just discern a small circular room on the wall hung a purple tapestry covered with magical symbols of crescent moons stars runes circles and squares in gold open volumes with stained pages were scattered across the flagstones dee stalked past his gown swishing across the floor the animal skulls clinked on their silver chains at his chest his wild mane of silver hair swung as he flung out his arms gesticulating at invisible companions now he was near the spy realized that what he had taken for latin incantations was gibberish the old man was lost to his world of madness as soon as the alchemists back was turned will kicked open the door and barrelled inside dee let out a bestial howl of rage his eyes glinted with insanity his lips pulling away from clenched teeth the spy crashed into the older man knocking him across the carpet of mildewed tomes pinning him down will pressed the tip of his dagger beneath dees eye and said i will not insult you by treating you like a frail old man dee thrashed like a wildcat in a sack but as the spy dug the steel deeper into his flesh he quietened a trickle of blood ran down his ashen skin yet still his eyes ranged with madness and he snarled animal sounds what have you done to yourself doctor where is that sharp wit that could cut a man half your age acutely aware of the fay drawing nearer will searched the alchemists flickering gaze for any sign of comprehension and began to wonder if all their sacrifices had been for naught let us talk you and i he said as we did so many times in the black gallery and perhaps the echoes of those days will stir some sense within you in a calm voice that belied the urgency he felt will recounted how dee had taken him under his wing when he had first arrived at the palace of whitehall from cambridge within days of jennys disappearance though as gruff and uncompromising as always the doctor had shown him some kindness then recognizing the scars that had been inflicted and the worse things that lay ahead patiently he had instructed will in the ways of the unseelie court and the horrors they had perpetrated for generations and their wiles and their magics and over days he had led the freshly minted spy to an accommodation with his new life remember doctor how you spun your fable of an english empire stretching across the shining seas a world lifted free from the yoke of the unseelie court he continued lulling the old man with his steady tone remember how we stood side by side at the court of stephen bathory when you conjured the ghost of the polish kings longdead father how he trembled will smiled at the memory another of dees tricks to bend the foreign royal to the will of the english and how you poured a flask of sack over the head of that preening popinjay the earl of leicester what a waste of good wine his soothing voice worked its spell and the old man calmed cautiously will removed the dagger and stood up unsure if dee would slip back into his madness his heart pounding with awareness that time was slipping away he looked around the small windowless chamber until he found an inkpot and a quill hastily he sketched a few lines on a page torn from the front of a book once done he dangled his work in front of dees face it showed a horned circle with a dot in the centre a cross beneath and under that a wavy line a representation of a devilish man do you recognize your glyph dr dee the one you described at such length in your vast tome the monas hieroglyphica you see the astrological symbols the power it represents you laboured over this design for years did you not you told me how this glyph showed the true secret of all there is how everything is connected at the smallest and highest levels and that all we see around is illusion a stage on which we are the players once this wisdom this glyph is understood true power comes you said here is your great work doctor here is you in essence remember the alchemists eyes widened and the page was reflected in their depths his madness was no natural loss of wits will felt sure and if anything could breach his defences and reach the dee that was it was his true obsession his lifes work the source of all his beliefs and perhaps his powers the old mans gaze swam and for a moment will felt sure he had failed but then a mist appeared to rise in the depths of those eyes and the brows drew together dee blinked once twice and his gaze drifted to will he scowled so i am in hell he croaked as are we all doctor will replied but his smile faded as the lilting strains of pipe and fiddle floated through the smoky air like the waking echoes of a dream the scent of honeysuckle wafted on the draught when a drop of blood fell from the spys right nostril and spattered on the flags dee closed his eyes and mouthed a silent curse the spy drew his rapier and backed against the wall his gaze drifted up as he heard a clattering overhead time to leave doctor he called amid the sound of rending a hole appeared in the ceiling as tiles and wooden laths were torn away rain gusted into the dry atmosphere and the crack of thunder rolled all around too late will said through gritted teeth if your wits have fully returned now is the time to use them chapter thirtynine the candle guttered shadows flew across the chamber as the storm crashed against the tower like waves against a reef in the flickering light will levelled his rapier and waited for the first of the unseelie court to crawl through the holes in the shattered ceiling he could sense them clinging to the rainlashed roof as they waited for their moment and then they would come like the storm he knew teeth and swords and talons wild eyes and blood dee clambered to his feet and lurched to an iron lever protruding from a slot in the flagstones gripping it with both hands he wrenched it back a deep grinding reverberated through the walls there he exclaimed the path through the maze is open go then will replied the tempest waits in the cove i will hold them off though death was closer than it had ever been he set aside fear and doubt he breathed deeply bringing the stillness inside him the storm faded away the flickering light troubled him not he was ready as dee stumbled through the door will heard a distant shout and another answering tapestries flapped in the gale rain pooled on the flags soaking the ageold books still the unseelie court waited were they taunting him trying to frighten him they knew what strategies worked from generations of torment at lonely farms and on paths through dark woods but this time they would be disappointed the door crashed open and carpenter and launceston burst in blades drawn behind them strangewayes stumbled delirious ignore him he is less than useless carpenter sneered with a nod he failed to discover dees paste upon the mirrors ah john you are sharp as a knife as always will said with a flourish of his left hand the other man shrugged only a fool would have failed to find it sooner or later muttering to himself strangewayes stumbled back out of the door launceston eyed the holes in the roof so they wait for their moment like rats in a barn at night he shook his head and called you waste our time come now and be done with it the candle guttered one final time and then winked out as the dark swept across the chamber will braced himself he had the door at his back carpenter to his left launceston to his right but they were at a disadvantage the fay always wrapped themselves in the night when the wind dropped for a moment he heard the soft thud of someone dropping to the flagstones then a second he could sense the other presences in the room like a yawning grave but how many had entered he did not know gooseflesh prickled on his skin as the chamber grew colder for too long a moment an unnatural silence hung and then lansings icy voice floated through the void this is what awaits you a mere taste of death no heavenly reward no soothing fields of green or longlost loved ones an endless nothing reassuring words from the masters of deceit will replied one eyebrow arched why whatever i hear from your lips i believe the opposite we speak the truth when it suits us lansing replied what say you master carpenter shall i tell a tale of weakness and betrayal or your lies are wasted on us launceston interrupted unfamiliar passion edging his voice will swished his rapier from side to side he was ready should the other fay creep forward in the impenetrable dark if he could keep lansing engaged at least he could pinpoint the fay lords position in the chamber what are you he asked in all the stories we are told your form and nature change with the teller imps sprites spectres bloodsuckers fallen angels and demons from the depths of hell are you the devils children in the ringing silence that followed his question will thought he was being ignored but then lansing began you think this world belongs to man we were here first bitterness swelled his voice no man could ever understand our pain our grief our loss you call us devils but in truth we are angels saviours carpenter snorted with derision our saviours this worlds saviours from our new homes under hill and lake and sea we watched your slaughters and your brutality the destruction you set in motion with barely a thought for consequence when you put women and children to the spear and burned others at the stake and seared flesh with hot iron and put out eyes and lopped off limbs we saw you were unworthy of this land that you inherited all men are flawed but we deserve the right to aspire to greater things will replied sensing a presence only a hairs breadth from his cheek he whipped his rapier around but the steel met only thin air he felt cold eyes upon him nearby and flexing fingers keen to tear out his throat or turn his innards to straw or stone it is too late for that the fay lord replied perhaps once before you stole our queen and meted out your atrocities upon our kind but now this world will be better without the infestation of man a fight to the death then will said twas always going to be that way launceston sighed could you imagine our two races living side by side let us be done with it though the world burn down in the process and there is man in essence lansing whispered let us be done with it trusting his instincts will lashed his rapier downwards the blade sliced into one of the fay creeping towards him through the dark a furious howl filled the chamber beside him he could hear launceston and carpenter putting their blades to work and cursing at their inability to see as he swept his sword back and forth a haunting song reached his ears from the stone steps beyond the door the words growing clearer as the singer neared a womans voice it was and it could only be meg there were three ravens sat on a tree they were as black as they might be with a down derry derry derry down down dees potion still gripped her will thought and he called out to warn her away but still she sang then one of them said to his mate where shall we our breakfast take down in yonder green field there lies a knight slain under his shield notes of sadness and regret drifted out through her lilting voice even the unseelie court seemed entranced for will sensed them pause in their attack when the door swung open candlelight glowed glancing back he saw meg framed in the archway bafflement filled him he saw no trace of stupor in her face but then he noticed her smile darkly triumphant and he recognized the meg of old when such a smile preceded a length of bloody steel yet her eyes were filled with the deepest sadness and that puzzled him his hounds they lie down at his feet so well they can their master keep his hawks they fly so eagerly theres no fowl dare him come nigh she sang and then she raised her candle up so her red hair was all aglow and beckoned behind her the roar that echoed up the stairs would have chilled even the most hardened warrior will thrust carpenter and launceston to one side on the other side of the chamber the fay crouched like cornered animals mouths black slashes in their bonewhite faces something thundered up the stone steps will glimpsed only a flash of oily black skin and fierce white eyes as the mooncalf bounded past him with a fullthroated roar that made his ears ring no male could fail to be entranced by meg he laughed to himself and even this wild beast danced to her tune as a tumult of rending and tearing howls and shrieks erupted the three spies tumbled from the chamber your surprises always come with a sting in the tail mistress oshee will murmured you can thank me later my sweet she replied and fulsomely i would hope but let us not tarry here fierce though the mooncalf is i fear he is still no match for a pack of those predators a shadow crossed her face and will thought he glimpsed there a hint of regret or guilt that she had sent the beast to its doom perhaps her heart was not as hard as she liked to pretend carpenter and launceston hauled the barely conscious strangewayes to his feet and the five spies made their way down the steps to the mirror maze each trying to shut out the awful sounds as if a bear were being set upon by a pack of dogs coming from the chamber above fear not for dr dee will told the others he has gone on ahead safe and sane i would hope but as they passed the final looking glass he grabbed red megs hand and slowed her descent what was that creature he asked the irish spy looked away her voice but a whisper the captain of our ship transformed by dees deviltry to be his servant when first we washed up on these shores now will thought he understood her dismay what suffering had that man endured should his wits have remained in his new misshapen form and what corresponding monster lurked in dees heart that he was capable of such a thing launceston caught his arm we have an opportunity here he breathed our enemy are engaged at the summit of this tower it would be good if they could not leave i have little stomach for nighon three months of sea battles all the way back to england will understood the earls mind he turned to meg and asked would there be such a thing as a powder store in this place she smiled down winding steps and into the dank cellars they ran in her wake and in the lowest point where water pooled and rats as big as cats ran from the light she threw open a door to release the bitter reek of powder six barrels stood by one wall where they came from i do not know meg said many things were left behind by whoever occupied this place before us twill suffice will said with a grin he nodded to carpenter and launceston who found a chest containing ample fuse once they had laid a long strand will took out his flint now he said let us see how hot those devils like their hell chapter forty will and the other spies raced from the door at the foot of the tower into the blustery night the rain had stopped but the encircling trees thrashed in the gale as they splashed through pools of rainwater the spies saw torches dancing in the dark along the edge of the courtyard ahead of them will caught a momentary glimpse of dee sweeping towards the lights courtenays voice boomed out finish off those dead bastards hack them to pieces swords rose and fell glinting in the flickering light without the help of the fay the remainder of the ghastly pirate crew didnt stand a chance take cover will yelled as he ran the captain and the crew gaped waving his hand to force them away he shouted again and this time the men scattered beyond the lip of the courtyard when meg struggled to keep up in her skirts will swept her into his arms without missing a step how dashing a protector she teased flicking her hair away from her face even in the face of death meg especially then as they reached the edge of the courtyard the night cracked in two fire blazed across the sky the earth shook and the thunderous explosion sounded like a hundred cannon the force of the blast flung the spies down the incline from the courtyard chunks of masonry rained about them ahead of a wave of smoke and dust fireflakes of wood and parchment spun by coughing will staggered to his feet throwing one arm against his face as protection against the choking fog he found meg leaning dazed against a tree and dropped beside her taking her slender hand he felt his fears subside as her eyelids fluttered open she smiled when she saw his face the angels have come to claim me she said wryly the spy pulled her to her feet and she half fell into his arms our lives are hard fought meg but the richer for that he said blowing a strand of auburn hair from her face from the side of her mouth she rolled her eyes feigning aloofness but will sensed the warmth between them as the smoke and dust cleared they searched in the gloom among the trees until they had rounded up everyone and gathered at the end of the courtyard from somewhere in the trees courtenays bellow assured them that he too was hale and hearty will turned to survey the wreckage of the tower the wavering torchlight revealed a jagged stump licked by flames beneath a plume of black smoke reaching up to the lowering clouds of the unseelie court and the mooncalf there was no sign nor did he expect one courtenay strode into the circle of torchlight with dee and grace by his side he raised an eyebrow when he saw wills accusing glance and said she insisted on coming ashore filled with fire that one i am glad to see you well she said as blithely as if she had met him in the palace gardens grace will sighed you are a fine bundle of trouble can you not stay out of harms way just once i can well look after myself master swyfte she snapped stepping past him to tend to strangewayes who sat on the low stone wall with his head bowed a fine thing to be scolded for worrying about close friends and loved ones she called back will shook his head wearily and turned to dee who seemed to have recaptured some of his vitality along with his wits his back was straight his eyes flashing with intelligence his stride purposeful but still will worried that he might slip back into insanity i have had enough of cowering away like a whipped cur the alchemist exclaimed jabbing a finger at the spy my blood is up and i am ready for the fight with those paleskinned bastards back in england he paused then added if elizabeth will have me and if that hunchbacked plotter cecil isnt whispering in her ear to have me sent away to the darkest parts of the realm we need you doctor and the queen needs you the spy reassured him dee nodded curtly satisfied i need the sun on my face glancing up at the clouded night sky he spun on his heel off to work his magics will guessed the island mirrored the alchemists mood while courtenays men took the captured pirate jean le gris still limping from the wound in his thigh back to the tempest to face justice will sat with carpenter and launceston watching the dark sky steadily the wind dropped until an eerie stillness lay over the woods it seemed that all of nature was holding its breath the storm clouds overhead scudded away without a whisper of a breeze and after a moment a silvery glow lit the sky on the eastern horizon at last carpenter muttered i thought this night would never end launceston pursed his lips watching the light shade to gold four hours i would say four hours until what until i have to listen to you bemoaning the oven heat that beats you down to the deck and wishing it was night again the earl sniffed walking away carpenter hurled a stream of abuse at the other mans back laughing to himself will stood and went in search of the sorcerer as he walked he sucked in a deep breath relieved that this long night had ended far better than he could have hoped when he first set foot upon the island along the path to the beach he found dee resting beside a mossdraped statue of a nymph you have completed your ritual then doctor he asked that business came so much easier when i was hiding behind the walls of my madness the old man grumbled to the west the lightening sky flickered with folds of a rainbow of illumination will felt reminded of the green lights he had seen in the northern skies in scotland what is that strange display he asked his brow creasing more of your magics dee glanced up the odd radiance playing in his eyes this island stands on the boundary between the world we know and whatever lies beyond the place where the dead go some call it such since our most ancient times we have always looked to where the sun sets the light fades and thought it the home of those who have moved on when i was a boy my father told me about the boat that waits by the shore to ferry the souls of the newly departed across the great wide ocean for judgement and then on the night he died i saw the boat waiting and his own pale shade walking the lane from our house he shook his head as if to dispel the memory and looked away it is the home of the unseelie court he said in a quiet voice will sensed a confusion of thoughts in the old man dee had spent his days probing the great mysteries that enveloped life and here was one of the greatest a puzzle that wrapped up life and death and grief and yearning the promise and threat of greater powers than mans and all mans fears about the purpose of life what if dee had said to him once staring deep into the blazing fire in the black gallery man was only placed upon this world as sport for higher powers without another word the old man trudged down the path towards the shore will was about to follow but heard courtenay calling him with a sigh he returned to the courtyard where a few men had been sifting through the wreckage of the tower for anything that could be salvaged le griss men have been released from their torment and can now face their just rewards in heaven or hell he said cracking his knuckles another triumph for englands finest by noon i will have charted a course for the island of hispaniola to take on fresh water and supplies and if we encounter any spanish dogs it will be a joy to despatch them after the things we have battled these past weeks and then to fair albion with a good wind dee can be rebuilding our defences with his cursed sorcery before the bluebells have gone from the woods in kent may good fortune watch over you captain courtenay will said clapping a hand on the other mans arm you and your crew have earned the queens gratitude and a joyous release in the stews of bankside courtenays eyes narrowed you speak as if you are not sailing with us the spy glanced back to the dancing lights in the western sky it was never my intention to return to england i am a lost soul captain and i must find my way to the land of the dead this morning i will take le griss ship and a skeleton crew and sail to the home of the unseelie court nothing shall stop me finding the answers i seek and then i will bring the walls of that fortress crashing down though it cost me my life chapter fortyone the ribbon of white sand glowed in the morning sun sparkling blue sea lapped in the cove and a cooling breeze rustled through the woods as the two men wandered along the shore the intoxicating scent of the large pink flowers on the spikyleaved shrubs along the treeline drifted down to meet the salty air you are a fool dee growled the skirts of his purple robe swept a wide path along the beach will felt an unfamiliar lightness now he had finally given voice to the inevitability of his destination if it is foolishness to want an end to the torment of unanswered questions then so be it the answers may be worse have you thought of that will shrugged it is a gamble i am prepared to take if only the alchemist knew how much he had risked he thought how long it seemed since that night in the liverpool rooming house when he had first started to form his plan the sight of jenny in the obsidian mirror had let loose a rush of desperate emotions and thoughts as if the dam holding back all those years of misery had suddenly broken he still felt surprised how little it had troubled him to put the queen and all england up as his stakes in his great gamble never would he alone have been able to amass the fortune necessary to fund a galleon to sail to the new world in search of jenny but once meg had told him that was dees destination he knew he could trick the crown or the school of night into giving him what he needed and so he had let the alchemist go knowing full well that the old man could have fallen into the unseelie courts hands and everything he held dear been washed away in a tide of blood all for jenny you have always been a gambler swyfte with your own life and with others that recklessness will be your downfall though the tone of his voice was accusatory dees look was not unkind my life was blown off course that day the day the person i cared for more than any other disappeared the spy replied looking to the far horizon i have made do as best i can but not a day has passed when i have not thought of her i am trapped in a maze where my mind keeps me in one place and i would be free of it what happened to her that day why was she chosen and not me has she suffered has she endured the words caught in his throat these questions haunt me dee snorted you speak as if these things matter wills head whipped round they matter to me the old man swept out an arm to indicate the sea and the island all this is illusion this world a stage on which we play out parts assigned to us we wallow in the mundane detail of our life all the petty hardships and the struggles that occupy our every waking moment and we lose ourselves in them they take on an import that far exceeds their worth they are a distraction no more and we are complicit in allowing ourselves to be distracted because those things however hard are easier to comprehend than the greater questions that hang over us who plays the fiddle and pipes and why must we be forced to dance the answers we seek are here but they are hidden amongst the illusion in the smallest detail he snatched up a handful of sand and let the grains trail out of his clenched fist we only have to sift and look and pull the jewels from the mud and yet these things you dismiss so easily cause us so much pain that cannot be discounted so readily doctor though all be illusion we still hurt dee smiled perhaps that is one of the jewels when you hurt you are forced to look more closely the mundane details he snapped his fingers dissolve perhaps will turned his face to the sun enjoying the unfamiliar warmth on his skin but i know this doctor when you look away from that mortal suffering you become inured to it and thereby allow it to endure indeed if there is no substance to it only one further step is needed to perpetrate that hurt for it is like the mist insubstantial and soon gone he waved his fingers in front of him there are dangers in thinking too much and removing yourself from human concerns doctor and you feel too much the alchemist snapped before catching himself perhaps the true path lies somewhere between i give you that i am not blind to my many and varied flaws master swyfte though you think me as hardhearted as the rocks of that reef i know the true nature of the mooncalf will found himself unable to keep the cold tone from his voice after a long moment dee replied in my defence i can only say that i was in the throes of my selfinflicted madness you destroyed a mans life to provide yourself with a guardian the alchemist sighed you know as well as i that this business makes monsters of all of us we each do things we never dreamed of in the days of our youth you say i am too distracted by scholarly pursuits but i have devoted my life to this long battle with the unseelie court to keep men safe and dreaming sweet dreams in their beds at night i have sacrificed my youth driven an ache deep into my bones and shattered my mind sometimes we are forced to do terrible things to prevent even greater atrocities should one man suffer to prevent the deaths of a hundred a thousand these are questions we should not have to ask ourselves most men can hide away and pretend such dilemmas do not exist or turn up their noses and pass judgement upon those forced to make sacrifices to keep the realm secure we are faced with the harsh reality every day and we cannot flinch from its glare when they reached the end of the beach will perched on the rocks where he had peered into the devils looking glass the previous night he felt a troubling confusion not too long ago i might have agreed with you doctor but now i wonder if we should hold ourselves to a higher standard the question you ask should one man die to save a hundred is too simple there is comfort in making the choice so easy but good men should always suffer to uncover the more challenging but truer course with the toe of his shoe dee flicked a greenshelled scuttling crab into a rock pool and i am not a good man is that what you say there is some truth in that i was certainly a fool for losing myself in intellectual pursuit and failing to see that the angels with whom i thought i communed were in fact the unseelie court how they must have laughed at my arrogance dr dee who thought he of all men had the power to speak with heavens messengers how easy it was to expose my weakness and then play a game to try to twist me to their ends you were not unprepared though dee smiled rubbing his hands together i knew the fay would come for me at some point just not in that way long ago i built defences deep inside me that would come into play should they ever try to seize control of my wits madness would consume me and i would flee england to a place where the unseelie court could not find me and use me against the queen and albion will came to a halt in awe of what the alchemist had done why here so close to their home because if all seemed lost i would allow them to take me into their midst and thereby destroy them dee stretched his arms wide as if rising from a deep sleep the spys ears pricked up how so by denying them access to our world and trapping them in their own miserable land but it is a place of wonder so they say dee laughed he waved his arm across the sunlit view more wonderful than our own home why then do those fiends sweat blood to take our green fields from us no there are more wonders here than you realize and all the secrets the unseelie court need to understand their own forlorn existence they are lost master swyfte and sometimes i believe more lost than us he folded his arms nodding to himself the angels told me of a beacon that keeps open the way between our worlds the tower of the moon will interjected recalling what he had learned from his conversation with the faerie queen the alchemist eyed him askance you are better informed than you appear master swyfte yes the tower of the moon i would bring it crashing down and seal them in their dismal land for ever and you with it dee shrugged a small price to pay you are a courageous man will shielded his eyes from the sun as he looked out across the azure sea i am a fool and never you forget it only one thing troubles me now the devils looking glass tell me you were not such a simpleton as to bring it here i left it in your chamber at the palace of whitehall will lied so dee would not see his face he ducked down to pick up a pebble at least some sense resides in that thick head of yours i have spent my life keeping that mirror out of the fays hands his face darkened so much power resides in that thing it could change the course of this war in the blink of an eye you have mastered it will asked he threw the pebble out into the crashing waves i have heard tales dee mumbled clearly knowing more than he was saying it keeps its secrets well but the unseelie court could unlock it never must it be allowed to travel anywhere near those paleskinned bastards will swallowed his guilt another gamble worse by far than all the others yet the mirror was his only link with jenny and he could no more give it up than his own life reflecting on what he had learned he lowered his eyes to watch the crab take shelter in a crevice in the rock pool it is so easy to hate our eternal enemy for the miseries they have inflicted upon us upon me and jenny the unseelie court think us the wicked ones in this game and there are many times when i am inclined to agree he furrowed his brow his voice reflective we have committed some terrible crimes in pursuit of victory doctor yet what a mess this business is how simple it all seemed when we thought we were on the side of the angels fighting devils now we know there are devils masquerading as angels on both sides further down the shore a longboat pulled up and two sailors clambered out and splashed into the surf they began to haul their vessel up the sand amongst a group of onlookers will saw carpenter launceston and strangewayes and meg and grace here is my question doctor he added when we fight monsters must we become monsters dee shook his head his face preternaturally sad set me free from this damnable island he muttered without answering the spys question he strode across the beach towards those gathered on the shore after a moment will followed picking up her skirts grace hurried to meet him it is true then she enquired her eyes gleaming with hope you travel to the home of the unseelie court to rescue jenny do not think for a moment that you are accompanying me grace i am coming she snapped her cheeks flushing do not try to abandon me here on the brink of discovering my sisters my sisters fate will swyfte she was close to tears when i return and if you do not return how can i live my life knowing i came so close to the answers i have prayed for and then walked away no i am coming too and if you try to put me back on the tempest i will leap into the waves and drown myself grace you have no power over me i make my own decisions she glared at him after a moment he nodded grace was no different from him she deserved a resolution too for good or ill over her shoulder he saw strangewayes look at him his eyes daggers will knew he had made a bitter enemy in the younger spy and he wondered if there was any way he could change that tobias was misguided nothing more he only wished to protect the woman he loved but he could never understand the deep currents in grace and will and the ties that bound them and you he called over to the little group why my sweet i could not leave you to look after the children meg blew him a kiss grace scowled at the other woman will recognized the truth and the tragedy the irish spy tried to hide she had failed in her purpose and now was a woman without a country an enemy in england with dee returned to london she had betrayed her chieftain and risked pain or death if she returned to her own home and yet knowing what was at stake she had aided will every step of the way he walked towards them relishing the sound of his feet scrunching on the sand i wish you well carpenter said an unfamiliar smile of relief upon his lips but i have no desire to die young i will ensure the doctor reaches london safely and then i will leave this mad world behind and find a new life though cecil and his dogs pursue me to the ends of the earth and good luck to you will said you have earned it he turned to launceston who was cleaning his nails with a knifepoint in the sun his skin seemed paler than ever john is incapable of looking after himself and so it is my burden to watch over him the earl said his face expressionless though will thought he saw a surprising hint of humour in his eyes when the two men had walked back to the longboat strangewayes muttered to will i will accompany you very well will nodded we are going to take the corneille noire and i have asked captain courtenay to supply a handful of men to crew her once we reach our destination i will send them home i would not have their deaths on my conscience and how exactly do you intend to return dee asked he eyed will from under his overhanging brows in reply will smiled tightly a cry from the longboat interrupted their debate carpenter was bent double clutching his stomach after a moment he appeared to recover he exchanged a few words with launceston and then the two spies trudged back along the sand to the others will frowned at the sight of carpenters ashen face and sweatlined brow what ails you he asked my conscience carpenter croaked i cannot allow you to sail to your doom alone another sword or two might mean you return with your life we will join you will grinned shaking the other mans hand firmly brothers in adventure then he said cheerily adding in a more serious tone i would thank you john with a man like you at my side who knows what we will achieve yet the compliment seemed to fall on deaf ears carpenters expression darkened and his eyes skittered will thought he saw a hint of despair there although he could not guess what it meant he banished it from his mind then it is agreed he continued looking around the assembled group put steel in your hearts for this day we take the fight to the enemy chapter fortytwo sunlight glinted off the waves in the bay out on the rising swell the corneille noire strained at anchor the fullthroated shanties of the seamen preparing for sail drifted over the water carpenter squatted in the thin shade of a barrel among the last few provisions on the beach watching strangewayes glowering at the galleon where his woman waited with that guilefilled irish spy he shook his head struggling to dampen his rising despair a puppet thats all he was with strings tugged by the enemy so that he danced when they played their tunes deep inside him the caraprix squirmed flooding his head with its whispers why had he been so foolish a new life free of worry had seemed close enough to grasp when lansing had woven his deceitful promises but in his weakness he had set in motion the events that would deny him his hearts desire hed been so close too one foot placed upon the longboat that would take him to the tempest and the first leg of his journey back home and then the hated thing inside him had snatched him back and propelled him in the opposite direction away from freedom away from hope towards only doom he jerked his head up at the crunch of sand and saw will and dee deep in conversation their heads nodding seemingly in time as they walked towards the cove where the tempest lay at anchor carpenter noticed what seemed to be an unfamiliar bond between them a new understanding perhaps he overheard dee saying when you leave this island you must pass through the pillars of medea carpenter watched as the old man pointed out to sea past the galleon to where two columns of black rock protruded from the waves in the hazy distance why there will asked surely it is safer to sail around them they are a gateway once you have passed the pillars you are in the territory of the unseelie court may the gods have mercy upon your soul as the two men made their way along the sand carpenter hauled himself to his feet and trudged towards the treeline where he had seen launceston prowling earlier he had begged the earl not to accompany him on swyftes mad voyage of the damned but the aristocrat would have none of it carpenter felt only more guilt at that loyalty not only was he dooming himself he was dragging launceston down with him when he stepped into the shade of the trees he breathed deeply tasting the sweet scent of the pink blooms unfamiliar birdsong rang out through the gnarled branches whoops and cries that reminded him of the chatter of the women who hung the dyed cloth out to dry on the tenter grounds beside moor fields a red butterfly as big as his hand fluttered by the green eyes upon its wings mocking him through the fronds he glimpsed a grey shape launceston wandering among the flora he guessed but then a low whine rolled through the undergrowth and carpenter stiffened fearing the worst he dashed across the twisted roots and burst into a small clearing lit by a shaft of brilliant sunshine blinking he discerned launceston on the far side hunched over something he felt his heart sink as he edged round the clearing the object of the earls attention fell into view a wild pig not yet fully grown it appeared to be half stunned a bloodied stick lay nearby the earl hovered over it knife at the ready carpenter watched a look of disgust cross his colleagues face when launceston saw his friend he murmured dismally i thought i could still the urges within me with the life of a beast but god help me it is not the same i hunger still for a human life his anger searing through him carpenter felt all control drain away in a blaze of white heat he flung himself at the earl knocking him to the tangle of halfburied tree roots his blows rained down as he took out all his selfloathing and hopelessness upon the other man finally he realized launceston was not defending himself rolling off he sat with his head in his hands fighting to contain the rush of emotion and the sobs that threatened to follow damn you robert why can you not control yourself he croaked must i spend the rest of my days pulling you back from the brink of another atrocity he laughed bitterly this is my life in essence after a moment he heard the aristocrat climb to his feet and move to stand in front of him carpenter bowed his head waiting for the blow when none came he looked up to see launceston holding out a hand to help him to his feet the pallid face was dappled with bruises i realize this is a burden for you i cannot control my urges alone the earl said his whispery voice almost lost in the rustling of the leaves carpenter sagged his guilt magnified we are both lost souls he muttered dazed the wild pig lurched upright and with a squeal crashed away through the undergrowth the aristocrat slipped the dagger into his grey breeches the world can look as black as pitch but there are things which bring a little light in when i first recognized my desires on the third night of my incarceration in the hole beneath the cellar with the rats and the beetles scurrying around and my father above ordering the fiddler to play louder to drown out my cries i thought i would follow a solitary path for the rest of my days but when you offered me the hand of friendship in my bleakest moment i realized there was still some hope even for a rogue like me he hauled the other man to his feet we are who we are and we do our best to struggle down this long road but the journey is better for having someone at your shoulder carpenter sucked in a calming gulp of air then i have a request from one friend to another anything if there comes a time when i ask you to kill me you must do so without a second thought launceston blinked slowly the endless depths of his pale eyes revealing nothing of his thoughts nor any dismay he might have felt that such an act of friendship would condemn him to the life of loneliness he feared carpenter strode away without waiting to hear if an answer would come back at the beach he helped load the remaining provisions into the rowing boat sweating in the midmorning sun when they were done the two men sat in silence for the journey across the waves to the corneille noire with everyone now aboard the small crew spared by courtenay prepared the ship for departure sails were unfurled and the anchor raised an apprehensive mood seemed to have fallen across everyone carpenter noted on the forecastle swyfte leaned against the rail watching the shore where dee still stood his mood seemed to have darkened was he now regretting taking a path that could only end in death for all of them carpenter wondered did he feel anything as the anchor burst from the waves trailing glistening diamonds a low plaintive howl rolled out across the lonely island carpenter felt the hairs on his arms prickle at that sound and he shuddered had the mooncalf somehow survived the destruction of the tower but when he glanced to the prow he saw a curious thing swyfte was smiling on the beach dee gave a slow wave and then turned and walked into the trees amid the cries of gulls the corneille noire heaved away across the swell and after a while steered a course for the columns of black rock protruding from the crashing sea carpenter felt the galleon judder as it slammed into the currents that swirled around the towering formation there were easier routes away from the island but dee had been adamant sanburne the acting captain was a seasoned voyager and had accompanied courtenay on many a foray into enemy waters lean and weatherbeaten with a shaven head and a gold hoop in his ear he was more taciturn than the tempests captain but he commanded no less respect he kept a weather eye on their destination and the surging currents shouting adjustments to the line of approach carpenter gripped the rail as the ship bucked how much simpler it would be to leap into that bluegreen swell he thought but even if he found the courage or the cowardice he was not sure if the caraprix would let him salt spray misted the air above the whitetopped waves a haze hung around the looming rocks the brassy light thinned and the temperature dropped in the growing wind there is no going back now swyfte had appeared at the rail beside him his gaze fixed on the pillars of medea an ending is all i want carpenter muttered after a moment will said i would thank you for accompanying me john we have had our differences you and i but you are a good man carpenter felt a spike of guilt in his heart at that and then the shadow of the basalt columns fell across them and the sea heaved and they could only grip the rail and pray for the calm waters on the other side in the boiling cauldron between the pillars the haze closed around them and the far horizon and the island both fell from view gripping on to the stays sanburne stood as if made of stout oak unyielding in the face of the elements his barked orders rose above the roaring of the ocean and rang out across the deck with the rhythm of a galleys drums carpenter craned his neck to look up the length of the black columns how unnatural they appeared through the mist he thought he could discern carvings of grotesque figures and symbols etched into the rock face but the tossing of the deck threw him so violently he could not be sure he shivered in the chill of the shade but then the corneille noire heaved one final time and swept them out of the most turbulent water the wind subsided the spray eased and as the pillars of medea fell behind them the sun beat down once more swyfte was smiling carpenter noticed a faraway look in his eyes and wondered what was on his mind was he not afraid of what lay ahead as the galleon turned towards open waters sanburne strode up frowning trouble captain will asked you might say that master swyfte in his right hand he held out the ships compass and with his left he jabbed a finger towards the sky though i be bound for bedlam it seems we now sail in a world where the sun rises in the west chapter fortythree blood puddled on the stone flags five bodies lay scattered across queen elizabeths antechamber in the palace of whitehall all good men and true all despatched in an instant by the thing that had swooped through the open window on leathery wings cecil hauled himself on to shaking legs from the corner where he had cowered like a frightened child his white ruff was now stained and more blood speckled his right cheek but he had survived by little more than the grace of god as he wiped his face clean with his kerchief he looked around the scene of slaughter and tried to compose himself how close they had come to disaster this time the door to her majestys bedchamber flew open and a rush of bodies swept out the queen herself wrapped in a cloak of midnight blue her frail body hunched over her face hidden in the depths of a cowl essex at her elbow aglow in his white doublet and hose as he guided her towards safety and three pikemen with faces like kentish ragstone essex flashed an anxious glance at the spymaster as he went what passed between them moved from desperation to dread how much longer could they carry on this way was the question they asked each morn when the sun finally rose the threat crept ever closer to her majestys door soon they would not be able to repel it once essex had led the queen out of the antechamber silence settled but only for a moment raleigh slipped in the pink lining of his halfcompass cloak looking unnecessarily flamboyant in that butchers shop gone like the wind he said going over to the open window and looking out across london our enemy never fail to find inventive ways to make us suffer you speak as if you envy them their skill in murder cecil snarled i respect a dedicated foe that is the only way to find a means to defeat them the adventurer inhaled a deep draught of the cool air scented with the coalsmoke from the first home fires of the day one day the queen will find you skulking around the palace and then your only view will be of the rats in your cell in the tower the spymaster muttered he joined the other man at the window relieved to see the first silver streaks of dawn food is short and people starve fresh water is fouled and cows deliver young with two heads we are assailed on all sides but spring is here the winter cold is gone raleigh replied wryly at least the damnable plague has finally departed the order has been given to open the playhouses and inn yards so the queens subjects have something to take their minds off their miseries raleigh closed his eyes enjoying the breeze this play would have long since ended if not for the school of night you know cecil gritted his teeth loath as he was to give any credit to the secret society he knew the other man was right but still no news of dee from swyfte and his band even the great resources of the school of night cannot keep us alive for much longer you plot and scheme from the shadows as walsingham did before you seeing only the ends but not the road that takes you there how has that served you the adventurer pulled the casement window shut and turned to inspect the bodies his expression grave you and all your kind have lived a life of compromise he continued moving to each corpse in turn you said not long ago that the unseelie court whittled us down by degrees but you and walsingham have done that to yourselves watch your tongue sirrah cecil glanced at the kerchief in his hand and disgusted threw it away as if it had burned him i know the agreement walsingham made which you perpetuated raleigh said in a cold voice the spymaster flinched you think one life here or there makes no difference when weighed against the security of the queen and all england all is a balance look here raleigh said with passion sweeping his arm across the fallen guards where is your balance where is your security those poor souls you sacrificed suffered for naught and the ones who were stolen they suffered too cecil cast his eyes down as for swyfte why no better man has served you the adventurer continued yet neither you nor walsingham could find it in you to tell him what happened to the woman he loved no because then you would have had to explain why you allowed her to be taken and for what reason and the others too it was a gamble cecil snapped rage born of guilt rising inside him if it kept us safe it was worthwhile it did not the adventurer took a deep breath to calm himself and walked to the door he paused on the threshold and looked back your compromises have failed to deliver what you hoped you have failed this world is changing fast sir robert and you are yesterdays man this new age demands better principles sooner or later it will be time to step aside and let those who measure themselves by a higher standard guide this nation to glory raleigh fixed his penetrating gaze upon the spymaster for a long moment and then with a flamboyant sweep of his cloak he strode out cecil watched the space he had left behind as the shadows in the room slowly melted in the thin light after a long moment he strode to the door and called out two pikemen came running find sir walter raleigh he ordered tell him the queen says he is no longer welcome here and escort him from the palace grounds should he resist take him to the tower chapter fortyfour lanterns glowed deep in the hot night spikes of reflected light shimmered across the black waves as the silent fleet sailed towards the east haloes of green and red flickered around the greysailed galleons the otherworldly illumination fading like marsh lights will watched the unseelie court ships feeling troubled by the display of firepower extinguish the lights master dusteby captain sanburne called the lanterns winked out one by one and the corneille noire sailed on westwards wrapping herself in the dark tense moments passed as will and the others aboard held their breaths but the fay cannon was not trained upon them even if they glimpsed us we are insignificant the spy said with a nod they have more pressing matters to hand dee launceston whispered spectral in the gloom when you sent the magician back to england you knew the enemy would pursue him strangewayes narrowed his eyes accusingly that gaze had barely left will since the galleon had departed the island was there any possibility that the unseelie court would let the prize they valued more than anything in our world sail away freely the younger spy snorted and in no way did this enter your calculations as you dragged us all on your personal quest for destruction you chose to come launceston interjected no one forced you indeed we might have found more joy on this voyage if you had been left on that island strangewayes glared at the earl to answer your question tobias of course i knew the attention of the unseelie court would be drawn to dr dee allowing us to sail quietly by will said with a grin seemingly unruffled then should we not have accompanied him two galleons could better fight off two galleons are neither here nor there against the overwhelming power of the enemy will leaned on the rail staring into the night the tempest is the finest galleon in all the world racebuilt and fleet we would only have slowed her down gnawing on a ships biscuit carpenter added courtenay has four days start and he will give them a good fight if they want one against the unseelie court fleet strangewayes interrupted incredulous and with dee in his right mind once more carpenter continued as if the younger spy had not spoken there will be magics and trickery aplenty if battle is joined in truth i would not wish to be on a fay galleon will watched grace walk up to the clutch of men her brow furrowed in suspicion why do you argue she asked she kept her voice light but will sensed in it a hint of caution for the one who professed to love her she was more than aware of strangewayes loathing for will and she had taken it upon herself to prevent any trouble from developing between the two men nothing strangewayes muttered he turned away seeing the other men were closing ranks against him too but will sensed that not only strangewayes but all there recognized that he had taken a gamble with the lives of men he knew and indeed with england itself for if he had truly sacrificed dee to gain an advantage all would be lost they still trusted him for now but he wondered when they would begin to suspect he would sacrifice even their lives to bring jenny home will watched as the unseelie ships disappeared into the night enjoy this moment of peace the unseelie court will become aware of us soon enough and then we will feel the full force of their fury you have a plan carpenter asked i always have a plan for near three weeks with the crew surviving on meagre rations the corneille noire seethed under a merciless sun heading towards the west away from the main trade routes though the compass remained reliable captain sanburne would scowl and stare up to the heavens as the sunrise flipped from west to east and back again with no rhyme or reason will wondered if the land the enemy called home was like the autumn mist on the thames flowing in and out of every nook and cranny along the crowded banks of the city he took comfort from the fact that they sighted no other fay vessels and that only one spanish treasure galleon crossed the blue horizon as they neared the new world will felt the obsidian mirror calling to him time and again he found himself in one of the cabins with the looking glass on the trestle in front of him hoping against hope that jenny would appear before him only once did he catch a fleeting glimpse of her face her eyes seemed heavy with worry and that only spurred him on she lived and that was enough and soon he would bring her home or die trying as he climbed back into the sweltering sun from his latest attempt to use the looking glass he glimpsed meg watching him with a curious expression from the narrow strip of shade near the forecastle it was as if she knew every doubt that plagued him he turned away pretending not to see the beautiful irish womans searching gaze but she glided over and hailed him in a jaunty manner such a handsome face should not be troubled by a brooding look you need good company to raise your spirits she said with a smile flapping a hand to cool her flushed brow indeed we both do life aboard ship has little in the way of excitement or comfort and it seems i have been looking at nothing but blue waves for a lifetime i fear i would be poor company he replied putting on a practised smile my mind is weighted down by plans and strategies he heard a splash and watched carpenter draw up a flapping silver fish on a line at port as if standing guard launceston stood nearby with his arms folded and a blank expression studying his colleague meg cocked her head to one side there is still time to turn this galleon round and sail for more entertaining climes when she saw he lacked enthusiasm for her suggestion she sighed and added but no there will be no turning away while the memory of your longlost love has its hook in you i have waited too long to discover the truth meg i would have some peace in my life he grabbed a stay and looked up to the yards and the blue sky beyond but the intensity of her attention drew his eyes down to her once more you would have her back beside you more like her features softened briefly and he glimpsed some honest concern there i hope you gain your hearts desire i truly do she added on a wistful note her words struck too close to home and he changed the subject nodding towards strangewayes and grace locked in intense conversation by the mainmast i have a favour to ask grace is not accustomed to the life we lead i allowed her to accompany us against my better judgement but she deserves her answers and her own peace and i know she would rather die than live the way she has been he ignored the irish womans searching gaze if you could do all within your power to keep her safe i would be in your debt should we return to england i will find as much gold as you require it is not gold i need she replied with a teasing smile sometimes she buzzes like a fly and i must resist the urge to swat her but i will do as you ask i fear i cannot trust tobias to protect her he is too raw too fired by his passions megs eyes narrowed as she flashed a glance towards the younger spy you cannot trust him at all he is a lovesick fool who can only see the world with the simple eyes of a child black and white good and evil he thinks you place his girl in danger and so you are his enemy if only he knew the truth how much you harm yourself enough will waved a dismissive hand let us not wish upon him this grey world of compromise he will arrive here soon enough he saw a softness in her look but she hid it quickly and yet there is some truth in what he says will watched the cut and thrust of dolphins fins slicing the waves alongside the galleon he sighed i presume you are going to tell me your thoughts whether i wish to hear them or not meg leaned in close so no one could overhear your desire to save your lost love has consumed you she said i understand that it is driven by more than just the heart and that for long years now the wound has festered he felt that she wanted to hold his hand to comfort him or to share their hidden bond but she restrained herself knowing it would be unseemly but young strangewayes sees your blood quicken as you perceive the end of your long quest and how in your eagerness you are prepared to risk others lives to achieve your ends will rested on the rail not meeting her eyes all she said was true he knew but he had reached the stage where no gamble was too great the irish woman smiled to soften her words i care little john and robert too i feel and even young grace we are with you in this and do not mind your she fluttered a hand while she searched for a word that carried no poison insensitivities insensitivities he nodded smiling wryly but all men can be pushed too far and you must remember who your friends are she continued they will walk through fire if you would but ask them a shadow crossed her face as she leaned against the rail watching the waves this long war kills us all by degrees we begin as good and decent but gradually edge away from the light so slowly we barely notice until one day we look up and we are surrounded by night do not let that happen to you my sweet before he could respond she turned and walked towards the forecastle but after a few steps she paused as if she had recalled something vital and then turned back her expression sad you have more faith than any priest she said more hope than i could ever have but think will what has happened to every soul ever taken by the unseelie court he showed her his back not wanting to hear but she continued men lured under hill by the sound of fiddle and pipe only to crumble to dust upon their return to the daylight world knights and dancing maidens turned into stone others twisted into straw men or bound by unbreakable briar or dissolved into water you must ask yourself how many have survived contact with the unseelie court none he knew none damn her you must prepare yourself she said quietly i do not wish to be cruel but i would not see your heart broken when we reach our destination do not hope too much and with that she walked away two more days had passed when the lookout bellowed that land had been sighted soon gulls were wheeling across the blue sky their hungry calls filling every heart with relief that the days of endless blue had passed a line of green smudged the horizon in the cabin will and sanburne pored over the pirate captains charts and the one that courtenay had given to them which showed all that was known of the new world coast will thought back to everything he had gleaned from the faerie queen of her distant home that night so long ago in the lantern tower legends of the unseelie courts bastion had circulated since the first european had set foot upon that mysterious land the city of gold manoa the fortress crepuscule the home of all wonders and terrors the chart showed a river system reaching out from the dark interior like a skeletal hand from his discussions with raleigh will knew some of the tributaries had been partially explored but the land was wild and inaccessible heavily forested and filled with villages of brownskinned people who hated strangers after so much of their blood had been spilled by the spanish over the years sanburne traced one dirtynailed finger along the main river then we take the orinoco to here and then the caroni he said the river is navigable for a ship of this size so i am told and then then captain sanburne your passengers will be set ashore and you may depart this devilhaunted land and anchor offshore where we now sail should we survive we will find a way back to you and how long should we wait sanburne said in a dismissive tone that suggested he did not expect any survivors take on fresh water and sit here for no more than two weeks and if you come under attack from the unseelie court leave immediately sanburne nodded hiding his apprehension nor did he show any sign of fear to his men as he ordered them to steer the galleon into the mouth of the wide river a brave man as were all of them to risk so much in the service of the queen will noted he joined carpenter launceston strangewayes meg and grace at the rail where they watched the nearing land with some trepidation hardened by the long struggle they had become adept at putting on brave faces but here so close to the source of their worst fears they could no longer hide the truth in their hearts only grace held her chin up as she studied the verdant line with an unflinching gaze will understood her hope that whatever waited there was better by far than the endless hell of notknowing that she had lived through for so long as if she could read his thoughts she suddenly turned towards him their gaze locked in shared understanding she smiled and nodded is this our world or the unseelie courts world or something of both launceston asked carpenter rubbed at the scar under his lank hair that is the damnable thing about those foul creatures he growled his eyes darting they play so well with illusion that nothing can be trusted one moment you think you are on solid ground the next you are sucked down into the bottomless bog we travel into the very heart of madness and death strangewayes muttered crossing himself god save our souls as the corneille noire entered the river mouth the dense forest loomed up a blanket of green stretching towards purple mistshrouded mountains far to the south in the sweltering heat stillness lay across the wild country for all they could see no human had ever walked there nor within a thousand miles they felt alone unfamiliar birdsong echoed all around whooping cries and staccato clicks punctuated by the low roar of some wild creature that sent shrieking rainbow flocks swelling into the blue sky river dolphins stitched the shimmering water alongside the hull and what they had perceived to be a log slipped off the muddy bank with a yawn of a wide mouth revealing rows of ferocious teeth paradise the first explorers called this place will remarked as he surveyed the lush countryside hell more like carpenter muttered give me the mermaid and a cup of sack any day that is my paradise as the galleon sailed on along the twisting river the stifling forest closed around them and the sea and the freedom it promised fell away from view though they kept to the centre of the channel sanburne plumbed the depths regularly afraid that his ship might become beached as the day drew on the mood of unease became more oppressive silence enveloped the deck all eyes flitting towards the trees when night fell the captain ordered that the anchor be lowered and no naked light be allowed on deck the watch changed every hour so no lookout had the time to be lulled to the edge of sleep by the gentle lapping of the river and the breeze through the swaying branches in the choking heat of the berth the light of a single candle flickered across sanburnes grim face as he told them we are at war let no man lower his guard our enemy could come at any time at first light they raised anchor and set sail once more will watched the treelined banks press closer with each turn of the river when the narrow caroni river appeared in the wall of vegetation the birdsong died away and the wind dropped the water frothing around the ships hull looked almost black climbing up to the forecastle he searched for the landmarks the faerie queen had shown him when he glimpsed a familiar range of hills rising up above the treetops he felt a chill here was the stuff of nightmares the haunted realm of the unseelie court he waved a hand to sanburne who ordered the anchor to be dropped we continue the rest of our journey on foot he said when the other spies had gathered around him by the mainmast he added wryly will it not be good to stretch our legs after so long on ship only meg and grace smiled they had dressed for the hard trek to come and were wearing rough woollen kirtles of the kind a country girl might own with the sleeves of their chemises rolled up the longboat was loaded with a small sack of ships biscuit and skins of water attached to twin staffs for ease of transport within the hour the four men and two women had said their goodbyes and stood on the bank watching the corneille noire sail out of view round the bend in the river after a moment will turned and strode into the dark among the trees there was no going back chapter fortyfive four black basalt towers punched through the sea of green blades of light stabbed out from the gold roofs each one burning like the sun as he pressed aside the thin curtain of leaves will shielded his eyes against the glare the narrow branch bounced and shook under his feet and threatened to hurl him down the dizzying drop to the forest floor far below steadying himself he screwed up his nose at the bitter taste of sulphur on the wind but though he strained he could hear no sounds echoing from the fortress truly it seemed a city of the dead he let his gaze run down those grim towers noting the proliferation of grotesque carvings silhouetted against the silver sky and the bands of gleaming gold encircling each column at regular intervals he saw echoes there of the pillars of medea those towering columns through which they had sailed to reach this mysterious place surely there could be no doubt that this was the unseelie courts fortress he felt a seething power radiate from it prickling the skin on his bare forearms into gooseflesh his nose began to bleed will bowed his head peering through the branches to where the others waited below he felt proud of the way they had coped with the hardships he had thrown in front of them the trek from the river had been harder than any of them had anticipated under the forest canopy the heat sweltered like a bakers oven over tangled roots they scrambled sweat stinging their eyes and plastering their clothes to their bodies buzzing insects with wingspans as large as their hands hunted for exposed skin to bite and draw blood no amount of water seemed to ease their thirst yet tempers had not frayed as they struggled steadily uphill from the river hands never strayed far from weapons and eyes continually searched the green world all around will had seen the strain in every face and had marvelled that he could not hear the throb of their hearts while they had rested carpenter had sidled alongside him and whispered when will you reveal your plan with a reassuring smile he had replied in good time the response seemed to satisfy the other man at least temporarily but will knew that soon the questions would become more pointed what could he say that he needed them to help him survive the forest trek but then he planned to abandon them and sneak into the fortress alone they would never let him go yet for all that he had manipulated them to his own ends it was time for him to stop risking their necks and once inside that merciless fortress there was little chance of emerging alive it was his burden alone his misery and suffering his one chance of redemption edging back along the branch he swung down the towering trunk and dropped the final few feet to the mossy ground with feline grace we should be there by dusk he said steel yourselves launcestons whistle rolled out of the undergrowth the others darted through the trees to where the earl waited on the edge of a clearing sallowfaced and seemingly unruffled by the heat he waited by a broadtrunked tree immobile his eyes flickered towards them and then he nodded towards the clearing dropping to his haunches will crept forward the aristocrat had been scouting ahead for signs of the routes the enemy took through the forest what seemed to be a village stood on the other side of the clearing ten or so log dwellings on stilts beside a creek several hidecovered boats had been dragged up the bank nothing moved will sniffed the air but could smell no smoke from cooking fires he had heard tales of the forest folk who armed with bows and arrows moved like ghosts among the trees he gestured left and right drawing their daggers carpenter and strangewayes loped in opposite directions round the clearing then hunched down behind trees and watched and waited long moments passed will spied no hint of movement nor heard any sign of life the inhabitants of the village could have overheard their approach and be waiting to strike he knew but he noted the straggly unbroken grass around the wooden buildings and the holes in the boats where the hide had rotted and he chopped his arm forward the spies edged into the clearing eyes flashing all around when no arrows struck will felt the tightness in his chest ease launceston ghosted to the nearest house slipping inside with his dagger raised he moved on to the next and the one after and returned sheathing his blade long since deserted he said with a shrug rats as big as cats in there and spiderwebs trailing from every corner if all you have told me about the unseelie court is true surely they would never tolerate any human village within their purview grace said showing not a trace of fear will felt proud of her the earl grunted i still cannot tell if i am in their world or our own wherever we are it is our world because we make it so meg strode past the men tossing her red hair are we to stand here gossiping like maids when there is work to be done grace followed her gentlemen we are put to shame will said with a sweep of his arm carpenter bowed his head and followed muttering will they jump in our graves afore us too in single file with meg at the head they made their way across the clearing and past the silent houses as they reached the treeline on the other side will frowned something had made the hairs on his neck prickle though he could not tell what he called for the others to stop and turned slowly in an arc scrutinizing everything that fell before his eyes a faint movement on the trunk of a goldenleafed tree gripped him still unsure what he was seeing he felt the hairs on his neck prick erect as he eased past the others to investigate white eyes blinked in the brown bark carpenter and strangewayes leapt back in shock daggers at the ready a figure was submerged in the trunk a man with brown skin a broad nose and black hair will thought he looked as if the tree had grown around him so that it was impossible to tell where flesh ended and wood began and yet he was still alive the eyes blinked again and as the lips twitched a dark hole appeared where the mouth would have been put him out of his misery carpenter growled no man should have to live like that graces hand flew to her mouth when she realized what she was seeing oh she exclaimed blanching do not look meg caught the other womans arm and tried to turn her away i would know what monsters we face grace said resisting her expression hardened if we flinch from the truth we cannot be prepared for what is expected of us kill him carpenter pleaded his face contorting let him suffer no more will was surprised by the vehemence in his voice launceston slid his dagger out of its sheath once more and stepped forward his face impassive will wondered if it was even possible to kill the poor soul short of chopping down the tree that contained him but as the earl raised his blade those lips in the wood finally recalled their ability with a twitch they formed an o caught by the sight of that dark hole in the trunk the spies recoiled in shock when a rumble reverberated deep inside the wood rising up until it burst free as a highpitched squeal of alarm clear and unending it soared up above the treetops even as the aristocrat struck out with his dagger other voices picked up the sound until the forest rang with warning shrieks what do we do grace cried run will beckoned for her to follow as he turned to dash into the trees as if in answer to the cries the air filled with the sound of mighty wings black shapes wheeled across the brassy sky will squinted unable to tell if they were winged men or giant birds but he had already guessed before meg spoke the corvata she said her features darkening the eyes and ears of the enemy the spies darted beneath the verdant canopy hoping they had been quick enough to avoid being seen by the flying sentinels as they stumbled through the thick forest tripping over roots and crashing into trunks carpenter snarled we were fools to think we could approach the fortress without discovery we were fools and now it will cost us our lives chapter fortysix shafts of sunlight pierced the canopy of leaves branches lashed the faces of the six humans as they raced over the soft treacherous mossy ground all around them screams rang out through the hot humid air offering no respite or chance to catch a breath high overhead mighty wings beat like the sound of rending sailcloth will glanced up but he saw nothing and hoped that meant the things could not see him strangewayes ran up to will we cannot outrun them let me take grace and return to the river he gasped we can follow the course more easily fool launceston breathed that is the first route the fay will investigate will raised a hand to bring the group to a halt as they gathered around him eyes searching the green world strangewayes cried what then tears of desperation stung the corners of his eyes he let his gaze fall upon grace as he blinked them away do we run wildly like stags before the hunt until the enemy bring us down one by one this forest is vast and the unseelie court few will replied even with their vaunted supernatural powers we can evade them megs green eyes glinted her face now as hard as marble take heed of will she said anything but a calm head will lead us into the enemys hands his recklessness and wilful disregard for our safety have brought us to the brink of disaster strangewayes protested and you say we should follow him still if he makes much more noise i can silence him with one stroke launceston volunteered his stare unwavering tobias you must listen to will grace clasped his hands in hers as she addressed the youngest spy i know you fear only for my safety but will has never failed us how can you say that strangewayes threw his hands wide the fay will expect us to flee in panic will continued in a calming tone in their arrogance they think us weak driven by our passions our fear we must show them we are better than that if we run like rabbits you are right tobias they will hunt us down with ease what do you suggest then carpenter sucked in a deep breath to calm himself stealth is the only way we can win this fight will replied we continue towards the fortress crepuscule no strangewayes shuddered into their very arms his hand slipped to the hilt of his dagger the unearthly shrieks had ebbed away but the beating wings still circled overhead will held up a hand we must keep our wits about us and maintain a clear head while they look for us running towards the river we can steal to the very walls of their home unseen unexpected please tobias listen to him grace implored the hotheaded young spy seemed agitated still i will not stand idly by and watch him lead you to your death strangewayes was acting like a fool but will pushed aside his irritation he had seen this behaviour too many times before when the unseelie court entered someones life the world suddenly looked strange and terrifying men coped with it in different ways and some like strangewayes were driven to extremes to try to hold on to things they valued and people they loved it was a kind of madness that ofttimes passed if the person was given space to recover the ground had moved rapidly under strangewayes feet and will only hoped the young man could find the strength within him to survive this turbulent time carpenter and launceston were less tolerant will knew they exchanged a quick look and he could see they were poised to act we must not fight he insisted trying for a calming note they are listening for us that is why the warning cries have stopped then just when will thought he was about to relent strangewayes lunged with the dagger as grace cried out in shock will threw himself back feeling the blade whisk past his neck he sensed that the younger spy had been waiting for a long time to make his move as he regained his balance strangewayes fingers closed on graces slim wrist and he dragged her with him through the undergrowth she struggled to free herself tobias do not do this she cried out turning to look back at will with pleading eyes in that glance he could see she was torn between the man she loved though she knew he was a fool and her belief in will himself cursing will dashed after her the others close behind each moment increased their risk of being heard he will be the death of us not you launceston hissed through clenched teeth do not hurt him will ordered he is deluded and dangerous in his foolishness meg said her eyes narrowed her patience exhausted through the curtains of low branches will glimpsed strangewayes twisting and turning grace was now stifling her urge to call out so as not to attract attention but he could see she was struggling to break free as the younger man stumbled over a fallen tree carpenter launceston and meg circled him like a wolf pack drawing his rapier strangewayes levelled it at the other spies he clutched grace to him you waste precious time will cautioned unable to keep the crack out of his voice strangewayes took a step back his heel pressing against a mosscovered mound white eyes snapped open in the green a black mouth tore wide and the buried man screamed the call was picked up in an instant shrieks rang out from trees and grassy banks and bubbling streams as the lost inhabitants of the village summoned their masters the blood drained from strangewayes face as he realized that through his own naivety he had put graces life at more risk than will ever had cursing carpenter whirled looking for a way out before any decision could be made the screams stopped leaving an unnatural silence that was even more chilling what have you done carpenter croaked from the direction of the fortress the mournful sound of a single bell rang out the first alarm prepared them will growled trying to pierce the forest gloom now they are coming a tremor ran through the leaves above his head the branches began to sway after a moment a tremendous wind tore at the branches like a herd of wild beasts marauding through the forest the angle of the sunbeams shifted as if the sun had been hurled towards the horizon and a deep abiding gloom began to unfurl among the trees will grabbed graces wrist and wrenched her out of strangewayes grasp they took jenny they will not take you he snarled beaten the younger spy cried out in impotent fury but will was already picking a path away from the gathering dark a drumbeat began to roll out deep in the forest at his back the pounding growing louder by the moment it was the sound of pursuit will do not fear for me grace cried out i chose to come with you in the full knowledge of the dangers that awaited her breath caught as they scrambled up a steep bank i am not afraid to die she gasped death is the least of our fears will growled forcing aside what might lie ahead he thought back to the charts he had studied on the corneille noire the vast caroni rivers meanderings had been punctuated by falls and rapids fast water gushing by high banks there lay the one chance of escaping their pursuers crashing through the branches with one arm thrown across his face he yanked grace along so hard her feet barely touched the ground the drumming swelled behind them out of the corner of his eye will spied meg launceston and carpenter pushing through the undergrowth in the same direction but the young fool strangewayes was nowhere to be seen he glanced over his shoulder and instantly regretted it spectral cadaverous faces snarling like wild beasts were emerging from the gloom the pursuers thundered ever closer bounding like hounds on all fours or swinging off branches and springing from tree trunks some were shavenheaded and barechested with belts crossed over their torsos and axes or swords strapped to their backs others were ghosts in grey and silver doublets white hair streaming wickedlooking blades clenched in their fists will counted at least twenty of them the unseelie courts dreaded hunters never slowing never stopping until they had their quarry no more ruthless predators existed on the face of the earth he had confronted them before in the dark of an edinburgh night and on the rainlashed roof of notre dame cathedral in paris and it had taken all of his skill and experience and a dose of good fortune to survive twenty wills blood ran cold the glowing green world darkened as if storm clouds had swept across the sun the suffocating heat of the day gave way to an unnatural chill on the breeze rode the loamy stink of the grave the drumbeat turned to thunder and will knew their time must be near yet ahead the gloom looked a little brighter and he thought he could hear cascading water so near he thought grace was trying to hide her fear and in that moment he loved her more he raised his head showing his defiance on the edge of his vision a flash of movement carpenter sprawled across the forest floor one of the hunters clinging to his back like an ape clawed hands rose and fell there was blood realizing his friend had fallen launceston skidded to a halt whirling round he drew his rapier and ran towards his companion will ran on feeling the ground shake under his feet graces hand was it seemed his only link with life skirts held high meg danced through the undergrowth to his left her red hair flying with a frustrated cry she flung her back against a tree and waited will locked eyes with her and for one moment she smiled defiantly before her features hardened and her gaze flicked back to the approaching threat as one of the hunters leapt at her she slashed at the thing with her dagger will felt grim pleasure as the agonized cry rang out meg slipped from view the gloom closed all around until he could see only that small circle of bright light ahead drawing him on grace gasped and sobbed for breath trying to keep a brave face behind him more screams rang out man or woman he couldnt tell and the sound of rending and tearing like a pack of dogs fighting over a ham bone for graces sake he hid his growing despair through the thinning screen of leaves and branches the sunlight blazed brighter he could smell the dank aromas of the river and over the pounding of his own feet he could clearly hear the rush of water as he broke out of the gloom under the trees into the hot sun he felt a weight slam into his back losing hold of grace he pitched forward and hit the ground hard skidding across the sward he rolled over and then felt his legs swing out over a drop he kicked wildly and dug his fingers into the turf as he slid round and down the roar of the rushing river rose up from somewhere beneath his boots he forced himself not to look down saving grace was now all that mattered as he tried to haul himself up on shaking arms he caught sight of her terrorstricken face she lay sprawled two swordlengths away from him one desperate arm outstretched from the dark around her head ghastly faces appeared baleful eyes fixed upon will bony hands clawed out of the gloom snatching her hair pulling at her arms her kirtle grace screamed the sound drowning out wills cry his clutching fingers failing will felt leaves twigs slide under his nails as he scrabbled desperately to hold on he called again his voice cracking as those ghostly hands dragged grace back into the dark and then his fingers tore free and he felt himself falling graces expression of sheer terror branded on to his soul chapter fortyseven will plunged into the icy torrent the black water closed over his head muffled booms rumbled in his ears and then he kicked out grabbing one precious gulp of air before the flow wrenched him along the roar of the crashing river engulfed him spun round he slammed against a rock and another almost dashing his wits from his head his chest burned as he fought to savour his last breath snatches of the world around him flickered through the constant dunkings soaring banks of grey rock overhanging trees against blue sky spikes of sunlight punching into the water but no hideous white faces peering down at him after what felt like an eternity the flow eased the narrow gorge gave way to low treelined banks as the river broadened with the last of his strength will crawled towards the shallows stumbling out of the lapping black water to crash down on the muddy bank as he heaved in great lungfuls of air the thunder of his heart subsided and the realization of his grim situation settled on him he shook his head and tried to drive that last sight of graces dreadinfused face from his thoughts but it lingered haunting him the cries of his companions still rang in his ears too and he felt a deep guilt that he had brought them all to this terrible point but then he shook his head and sat up nothing would be gained from wallowing in selfpity rescue or revenge those were the twin paths that lay ahead of him now soaked to the skin he rose on shaking legs and checked he still had his dagger and his rapier and that the velvetwrapped mirror was still safe in his pouch once he had recovered he forged on into the trees the sun was slipping past its highest point by the time he had followed the course of the river back to where the unseelie court had mounted their attack he cocked his head listening for any sound of the others but heard no human voice stealth was the only way to proceed however long it took he would not make strangewayes mistake his eyes grew accustomed to the strange world of leaf and moss slanting sunbeams and whirling insects and whenever he encountered any misshapen tree or hummock that might hide one of the subsumed people he gave it a wide berth there in the glade he saw signs of struggle the odd spatter of blood but no worse that meant there was still hope he told himself though a part of him feared the opposite will ignored the growling of his stomach it had been almost a day since he had gnawed on the last of the ships biscuit he pushed and hacked his way through trailing vines and thorny bushes in the direction of the unseelie courts fortress crepuscule for the rest of the day he weaved through the thick forest occasionally pausing to clamber up the soaring trees to get his bearings the gold caps on the black basalt towers were like beacons drawing him inexorably towards them it was as shadow slid into dips and hollows and the bloated red sun settled down on the horizon that he reached his destination he felt a chill as he crept to the treeline and looked down the slope into a hollow where the massive fortress stood the unseelie courts dwelling place dwarfed any he had seen even the escorial of philip of spain towering black walls enclosed a lake of shimmering gold covering every roof and dome of the castle buildings in the ruddy light it glowed like fire along the battlements nothing moved will scanned the walls frowning when it came to the unseelie court human eyes could never be trusted and he suspected unseen sentinels would be looking out over the surrounding forest as will gathered his thoughts a low groan disturbed the eerie silence the main gate the height of six men ground slowly open and a column of figures moved out into the fading light at the front was a fay on a black stallion his head raised as he surveyed the darkening forest with slit eyes he wore a silver helm and armour with whorls etched on it in black filigree and in his right hand he held upright a silvertipped spear behind him marched a raiding party of around twenty armoured fay bristling with swords and axes flanked by four others holding sizzling torches aloft the column moved across the cobbles and on to the broad path leading into the forest the gate shuddered shut a search party could any of the others yet live however powerful the fay were they still could not see or know all perhaps one man could creep under their noses like a spider entering the queens bedchamber once darkness had fallen will left his hiding place and crawled down the incline among the thick spikyleaved bushes around the fortress perimeter he crept until the full moon cast long shadows over silvered ground the rear wall was cut off by a dense barrier of thorny bushes when he tossed a stone over the top but never heard it fall he guessed the fortress sat on the edge of a sheer drop his heart sank as he concluded there was no obvious way to steal inside no drainage tunnels no sluices no handholds on the soaring glasssmooth walls returning to the main entrance of the colossal fortress he sank into the shadows at the foot of the wall and pondered his options determination gripped him he would not be defeated barely had the thought crossed his mind when he caught sight of a lone figure stumbling along the road out of the forest dark no fay this will saw from the rolling gait but he still felt shocked when the moonlight revealed strangewayes the young spy looked broken shambling like a man in his cups his head bowed his shirt torn his face streaked with dirt and blood will wondered if the torment of what he had done had driven him mad why else would he be stumbling up to the gates of hell alone and unarmed will pressed himself against the wall which felt icy against his skin despite the heat ready to drag strangewayes off the path when he neared but a stones throw from the vast door the younger man shuffled to a halt and raised his head looking up at the dizzying height of the imposing edifice before will could move he shook his fist at the fortress and roared in a cracking voice give her back to me will stiffened it was too late now you cannot have her strangewayes raged spittle flew from his mouth take me instead i deserve to die but set her free i beg of you with a resonant rumble the gate began to grind open once more strangewayes you fool will thought you have ordered your own death or something far far worse if he tried to save the other man he knew his own life would be forfeit then what of jenny and what of revenge for whatever had happened to the others sickened by his powerlessness will could only watch as the younger spy peered into the black maw of the gates after a moment the blood drained from his face but he didnt run and will admired him for that two figures walked out their faces obscured by shadow despite the moonlight guards will guessed dressed in outoftime grey bucklers and breeches their toopale hands rested on the sculpted silver hilts of their swords i am not afraid of you strangewayes shouted his voice cracking with fear take me to grace wills hand hovered over the hilt of his own blade his every instinct told him to rush to strangewayes aid but he forced himself to hold back this was his moment sneaking along the wall while the guards were occupied he slipped round the door and darted into the dark interior yet as the shadows swallowed him for all strangewayes folly he couldnt help but feel guilt that he had turned his back on a companion and so consigned him to death chapter fortyeight blood dripped from wills nose as he stepped from the grim darkness of the gateway into a soft glow he felt shock at the stark transition as if he had stumbled into a halfremembered dream gold sheathed the walls of soaring halls gleamed off statues of slender figures with severe features and glittered in the swirls and knots of finely wrought screens and porticos along paved walkways running between the jumble of buildings torches hissed and spat bathing the entire scene in a rippling flickering light drifting from the windows and doorways came the delirious whirl of fiddle and pipe and when will inhaled the heady scent of sweet honeysuckle swaddled him he felt lightheaded at such a rush of sensations for a moment the spy marvelled at this magical world slowly though the brooding sense of menace that lay behind the glitter began to envelop him like an encroaching tide he must never forget that whatever charm and beauty danced before his eyes he was in hell and no man could survive here for long he shook himself and tensed every sense afire for a sign of threat drawing his sword he padded along the pathway to his left seeking out every pool of shadow as he slipped from doorway to doorway he looked up the vertiginous walls and wondered once more at the vastness of the unseelie courts home how could he expect to find jenny before the devils found him and tore him limb from limb yet he refused to be daunted he eased open the nearest door and slipped inside in the hallway of gold and stone the music throbbed so loudly that his ears rang now he heard a frenzied edge to the jig that spoke of madness buried behind it rumbled a low pulse that reminded him of the pounding of a blacksmiths hammers he traced his fingers down the cool wall and felt the vibrations running through the stone seemingly rising up from deep underneath the castle an oppressive heat seethed through the building as if mighty forges were being stoked under the floor crossing the entrance hall to the next door he opened it a crack taking care that he would not be seen he peered into a great hall lit only by the ruddy glow of a fire long tables creaked under platters of meats and pies and bread silver goblets and wooden flasks and tall jugs of drink around the trestles the fay were at play they whirled around to the wild music of the fiddler and pipe player or tore at meat and swigged down mouthfuls of wine the red liquid spilling down their chins others fornicated in full view the women sprawled on their backs on the tables or on all fours while the men thrust into them will pulled the door shut with great care his head swimming from the sights sounds and smells once back on the pathway he sucked in a deep breath feeling as if he had spent a night drinking in the mermaid he could now feel the dull deep rumble everywhere he went it ran up through his legs and into the pit of his stomach he forced himself to move further into the heart of the castle though every sense rebelled after a while he began to feel that all he saw was illusion created by his own wits to hide the true madness and rot that lay behind it was that a keep or a hellish pit where foul things writhed if the walls were really gold why did he keep smelling the reek of spoiled meat when he brushed by the world he remembered back in england receded into the depths of his mind and that sickening place became the only thing he knew as if he had always lived there and always would and the music roiled wherever he went until he could no longer trust his own thoughts in one chamber he found a strange creature like a shaven ape throwing dice on a long table when he entered it stared at him with golden eyes that contained an unsettling intelligence and then proceeded to mimic every movement he made as if it were his mirror image in another chamber ten pendulums as long as a ships mast swung from the high vaulted ceiling in the gloom will could just discern on each one a longbeaked figure seemingly asleep strapped upside down hands crossed on its chest as he moved deeper into the fortress the sense of being part of a troubling dream swallowed him whole and he had to fight to keep his hold on his purpose there how easy would it be to give himself up wholly to these wonders and mysteries again and again as he made his way through the fortress will had to duck into doorways to avoid the fay themselves as they moved silently through their realm the air of corruption heavy around them males and females walked side by side like courting couples heads bowed yet occasionally glancing at each other as if they communicated without words some fay passed on horseback their silvery cloaks and helms suggesting a higher status occasionally their heads would turn their eyes wide and staring as if they could see him in his hiding place but they rode on without a sound it was as if time had no meaning there it felt as if the walls the paths the vast hallways went on for ever will paused and leaned back against a golden wall though dees warning still rang in his mind he found himself reaching into the pouch that rested on his hip after a moment fighting with his conscience he pulled out the obsidian mirror even knowing all of the unseelie court could swoop down upon him in an instant he was so lost that he felt he had no choice but to use the looking glass if he were to find jenny as he hunched over the mirror the mist in the glass cleared and jenny appeared her face looked uncommonly pale in the gloom and though she gave a faint smile when she saw him her brow was furrowed despite the dangers will was overjoyed to see her he could scarcely believe he was so close now after so many years of wondering whether they would ever meet again where are you she asked squinting he knew she could see the gleaming gold on the halls around him will she exclaimed her eyes widening i told you not to come that conversation has long since sailed jenny he replied his eyes scanning his surroundings would he even hear a footstep when they came for him quickly now tell me where i can find you afore i feel a dagger at my neck she hesitated for an instant then said the highest hall is always lit by moonlight turn to the left once you enter and climb the steps on the third floor behind the third door you will find me she flashed the smile that he remembered so well and then whispered take care my love will felt his heart swell so close now so close he darted ahead looking up the towering walls every time he reached a courtyard at the centre of the fortress the highest hall was indeed silvery with moonlight the shadow of every grotesque carving stark on the upper reaches with each step it loomed ever closer his heart pounded fit to burst if the fay discovered him when he was so near to the prize he had desired for so long he thought his spirit would be broken for ever silently he prayed that his enemies would continue to search beyond the fortress walls but he knew the time must surely be near when they would turn their cruel eyes towards the dark streets of their home when he reached an arched doorway at the base of the highest hall he finally sucked in a deep draught of hot fragrant air his head was spinning with the rush of conflicting emotions all he wanted now was to feel jenny in his embrace steeling himself he eased open the heavy gold and jet door and stepped into searing heat the deep rumble of hammers rang through the walls louder still reverberating in the pit of his stomach his pulse racing the hand that held his sword now clammy with sweat englands greatest spy took the steps two at a time fiddle and pipe music swirled dimly from the chambers below but above him all seemed still at the top of the steps on the third floor he leaned against the throbbing wall and drew in a deep breath to steady himself ahead lay a corridor lit by a single torch with doors along the right wall will noticed his sword hand trembling as all the years of yearning for this moment rushed out of him and he knew he had to steady himself calm descended on him he was ready he crept along the corridor his senses alert to the slightest sign of danger at the third door he raised the latch and pushed gently with his shoulder it didnt move it was locked his heart beat faster he pressed his ear against the rough wood listening for any sound from within all was quiet visions of what horrors might lie on the other side of that door flashed through his mind he hesitated for a long moment his chest tightening dare he call out when he had weighed his choices he leaned closer until his lips were almost brushing the timber and whispered jenny its me silence followed and his heart grew heavy but then he heard movement on the other side of the door drawing closer he held his breath after a moment a womans voice hissed at last it was jenny the hairs on the nape of his neck tingled with anticipation how much richer her voice sounded in life than coming through the glass of the obsidian mirror a bolt was drawn the door swung open the only light came from the ruddy glow of a hissing brazier in one corner of the chamber wills eyes slowly adjusted to the gloom a figure loomed in the halflight tall much taller than he remembered he saw the silhouette of a staff pale fingers wrapped around it they looked unnaturally long the curved nails sharp like talons other details emerged as if a curtain were being drawn back robes seemingly too thick for the unbearable heat a faint gold filigree glinting in the braziers light yellowing skulls of birds and mice and trinkets all braided into gold and silver hair and finally the face appeared from the shadows holloweyed and sunkencheeked deortha sorcerer to the fay high family reached out his right hand palm up with a sly smile he murmured the looking glass if you will chapter fortynine the braziers acrid smoke drifted across deorthas cold features wills mind reeled as he watched the shadows play on the fays face in the incarnadine glow of the chamber you made a play of being jenny all along he croaked despair flooded him he remembered the first time he had ever cast eyes upon the unseelie courts sorcerer on that awful moonlit night on dartmoor six years gone it was after deortha had departed that he had found jennys locket upon the grass his first real evidence that she was still alive and a prisoner of the unseelie court or so hed thought at the time he should have questioned the coincidence but he had wanted to believe it so much it had clouded his wits there had been so much more the whispered words of christopher marlowes devil telling him jenny still lived in a hot land across the sea his loves face in that devils looking glass insisting he ignore her while encouraging him to do the opposite all of it luring him to this place this moment and all of it a play an illusion he was a fool to have believed so easily because he wanted to because he loved and the unseelie court were nothing if not expert in finding the flaws in every man time meant nothing to them they wove their schemes across the years not caring how long it took to achieve their aims and in his weakness he had delivered into their hands the one thing they wanted that terrible mirror deortha smiled as if he could read all his thoughts where is jenny will asked in a low voice yet he was afraid to hear the answer he raised his rapier until the point quivered over the sorcerers heart where is she he asked again this time raw anger flaring from the embers of his dismay you wish to know if she is alive or dead will sensed mockery in deorthas calm tone and felt his anger grow hotter still but the sorcerer only gave a low laugh will snatched the devils looking glass out of the leather pouch and held it high ready to dash it on the flags i will destroy this before i would ever let you use its power and you think that here in our home at the very heart of our authority you have any control over your own actions here you are a puppet no more than that and i hold your strings wills sword arm felt as heavy as stone he thrust his blade at the sorcerers chest but something unbidden stayed his hand however much he tried he was powerless to drive the point home he felt the chilly touch of despair caress his spine tell me now he said his voice low and hard what befell her and as the words left his lips he realized how afraid he was of the answer deortha eased the obsidian mirror from his fingers peering into the glass the sorcerer nodded and caressed the black rim she lives he said distracted she is here all thought of the mirror vanished wills breath left him in a rush but he hardly dared believe the sorcerer and you have not harmed her he demanded deortha raised his head and gave a strange smile she is safe she is an honoured guest of the unseelie court take me to her please that was always my intention the pale eyes glinted it was my intention from the moment we met upon the moor what trick are you playing devil wills voice was hoarse with grief anger and hope all life is illusion the sorcerer replied echoing the words dee had spoken shortly before the corneille noire departed the island for the new world and in the midst of that all appears trickery when the truth is hidden wills eyes narrowed there was no gain in showing the pain he felt he knew he might as well bare his throat to the cruel fay and so he forced himself to put on a grin and with a swagger that he didnt feel he sheathed his rapier then i can take from your words that it is not your intention to kill me yet he said i would see jenny now all in good time will nodded trying to seem unruffled what plans do you have for the mirror you have fought for for so long deortha turned over the mirror as if it were unimportant for those who know how to use it this mirror reveals all places all times no secret can ever be hidden whoever wields this mirror controls everything waving his right hand as if wafting away a foul smell he added but for now that is of no interest the spy frowned of no interest a weapon that can uncover the flaws in any enemys defence and divine future plans the world is now yours the world always was ours deortha stepped towards the door and beckoned for him to follow will swyfte i have work for you chapter fifty the torches sizzled at the bottom of the vast gulf of dark in the pool of light pale faces gleamed eyes frozen wide in terror captain sanburne showed a cold face to the ones who waited in the shadows but his men shook as the deep rumble of mighty hammers enveloped them high above the knot of frightened sailors will gripped the stone wall of the gallery whither deortha had brought him as he peered down the well of the great hall he wondered how the captain and his crew had been seized he felt relieved that they were all still alive but he feared for their future deep grinding echoed all around disoriented he felt as if the basalt and gold of the hall were revolving like a millstone crushing the husks of the men cowering below more torches hissed into life widening the circle of light the hidden figures flickered into view a neararmy of fay guards surrounding the men grey and indistinct their faces were cloaked by shadow silver breastplates and helms glinted in the dancing flames the guards bristled with cruel weapons spiketopped halberds doubleheaded axes and broadswords the circle of guards parted to allow four figures entry wills heart thundered with joy as he watched meg carpenter launceston and grace step forward he could scarcely believe they lived bloodied and bedraggled they still held their heads up defiantly he saw halberds levelled at their necks brought them to a halt and wills jubilation drained away he looked back at deortha but the brooding sorcerer gave no sign of what was to come a distant door slammed shut the echoes rippling through the hall a moment later he heard another door and then another the successive booms growing louder as they approached until the hall rang with the steady beat of a funeral drum the sailors heads turned in the direction of the sound the men fearful at the thought of what was approaching finally the unseelie court circle parted once again agleam in a silver winged headdress glistening robes and a white cloak that swept the flagstones a tall slender fay stepped forward will leaned over the stone wall squinting to get a better look here was a leader of sorts perhaps even a king he thought his eyes narrowing the architect of all their suffering the regal fay glided towards the englishmen beside him came a smaller figure and will gasped his memory reeled across the vast ocean of years to the day when jenny had been swept away into mystery her face as she had crossed the cornfield was burned into his minds eye every moment they had shared the depth of the emotion he had felt all wrapped up in that single sunlit image could this be another of the unseelie courts cruel tricks he thought as he peered down at the woman who stood beside the king cold breath chilled his ear yes deortha whispered it is she jenny his heart pounding his thoughts awhirl he drank in every familiar movement feeling a pang of bittersweet remembrance his gaze drifted to her white skirts edged in gold and the gold at her wrists and in the band snaking around her forehead and he saw that she walked at the kings side without any sign of defiance or resistance as far as he could tell she seemed to look on the englishmen without compassion or recognition no prisoner this will thought growing cold she accompanies the fay willingly you have spun your magics to seduce her to your side he snarled into the dark of the gallery for that you will pay a harsh price i vow there is no glamour she is what she seems the sorcerer replied you lie as your kind always lies will spat yet he knew there could be no other explanation his knuckles whitened round the hilt of his rapier as he fought the desperate urge to rush down to the floor and tear jenny his jenny away from those foul creatures until then grace had remained silent head bowed eyes fixed on the stone floor now as if waking from some deep slumber she twitched as if someone had called her name and looked up when her gaze alighted on jenny her mouth fell open and tears flooded her eyes arms outstretched she rushed to embrace her and would have fallen under the fay guards halberds had meg not lunged to stop her she staggered back with megs arms wrapped round her incomprehension turning to devastation when jenny turned her calm cold face towards her no sign of recognition flickered in the elder sisters hard features the fay king looked down on the tableau before him the group of confused and frightened humans caught in the small circle of light and said i am mandraxas highest of the high family in my sisters absence the golden throne is mine here in this place beyond places that your kind call manoa it is my word that rings out across this world across all worlds my design which shapes this war my judgement that hangs over all the heads of your people do you fear me men sanburne showed a defiant face but the other seamen cowered from a pouch mandraxas pulled out a black oval stone on a silver chain he let it swing in front of him like a pendulum we are the oldest beings in the great sweep of existence we are the silver of the moon and the cool mist of dawn and the dark shadow of night and we are the gold of the sun and the searing heat of the forge and we will no longer be defied he paused and looked around him still swinging the stone from side to side in that time before times we knew only beauty only wonder and then your infestation spread across the fields in which we played your urge for blood and power consumed you and corrupted all that had been made and then you sought to challenge us is there no end to your arrogance now though the age of man is passing launceston raised his head a fingers breadth from an axes blade a trickle of blood on his pale skin gleamed in the torchlight i know you he said fixing an eye on the fay king i know you as i know myself for we are much alike a pale shell hiding a monster for all your high words you are the parasites preying upon the flesh of the world creatures like us we cannot survive for ever for we are against nature the things i see in other men the small kindnesses and the great loves they cannot be crushed by the millstone of your midnight power they will survive you will not a hint of a smile ghosted on to mandraxass lips he allowed the pendulum to come to a halt and stared at the stone for a moment as if weighing his next words and yet for all your deceit and your cruelty and your brutality you are fools poor witless sheep he continued as if he had not heard the earl his voice so low it was almost lost beneath the deep rumble you dared to trespass on the province of the unseelie court you thought you could wander here in the borders of the far lands with impunity this is not your world mortals this is a land of madness and terror beyond imagining shadows raced across his face as he began to swing the stone on its length of glinting chain just above his head a low whistle echoed through the vast space growing louder the faster mandraxas whirled the sable stone will felt a corresponding queasiness in the pit of his stomach he watched the fay kings smile grow the spreebirds are coming mandraxas said deep in the shadows high overhead a shrieking rang out from all parts of the hall will was reminded of the haunting cries of hungry crows on a grey autumn morn a moment later the beating of wings filled the vault with thunder the spy looked up shocked by the thought of how many birds it would take to create such a roar wind rushed by his face the draught of that swooping flock as it passed and his ears rang with the piercing shrieking he clutched the wall and peered down the circle of light now hidden behind a swirl of black bodies torchlight flickered through the flapping wings when the shrill human screams soared up to the roof will tore out his rapier deortha grasped his shoulder to restrain him and whispered in his ear i have ensured your friends will be safe reveal yourself and they will surely die as will you his breath was icy will felt sickened by what he saw but he fought to contain himself after a moment he sheathed his blade and turned back to the carnage the spreebirds were feeding in the torchlight their black feathers gleamed but their heads were little more than skulls most of the flock wheeled around the hall above but many perched on the thrashing sailors their long bony beaks stabbing like daggers blood pooled across the flagstones amid the cacophony of birdcry and dying screams meg grace launceston and carpenter looked on in horror as one by one the hellish birds rose and flapped away white skulls stained red a picture of starkest horror revealed itself where sanburne and his crew had huddled now only bones clotted with chunks of meat remained as the last bird disappeared back to its hidden roost a sickened stillness fell over the surviving mortals his anger boiling will turned to deortha and whispered you have shown me this savagery so that i would know it hangs over the heads of my friends another way to bend me to your will he glanced down to that bloodied circle of light and saw jenny studying the scene without a trace of emotion how far the unseelie court had twisted her away from the innocent woman he had known come with me deortha demanded will followed the sorcerer down flight after flight of steps until he found himself in a small bare antechamber lit by a single torch the fay left him there alone for what seemed like a lifetime he paced and brooded and made silent vows until he heard the door creak open turning he stared into the sorcerers pale eyes deortha stepped aside with a sweep of his arm to reveal jenny her expression dark with suspicion will felt his heart leap his head spun with the thousand imagined speeches he had dreamed of making when they met again but he uttered none of them instead he found himself transfixed by the luminescence of her youth and beauty she had not changed in the fifteen years they had been apart her milky skin was smooth her brow unlined her cheeks full and her eyes bright unconsciously his fingers crept to his own unkempt unshaven face tracing the pattern of years the wrinkles round his eyes from long spells under a mediterranean sun the laughter lines bracketing his mouth from lush days in the mermaid with kit marlowe and spicy nights with the doxies in liz longshankss stew there was the true tragedy he had thought her only a prisoner but trapped in this timeless place she had drifted away from him in years and experience the commonality of their life and the bonds forged by being in the same place at the same time shattered for ever though she stood only a swords length from him she might as well have been a thousand miles away and yet it was still jenny he refused to allow sour thoughts to tarnish the moment and moved to embrace her sharper than a slap to his face was jennys cold look she half turned to the sorcerer and demanded who is this will recoiled in her eyes he could see no trace of the unseelie courts taint jenny truly did not recognize him his voice barely a whisper he said this dark place has swallowed your memories cast your mind back to england to warwickshire and the village of your birth remember the hours we walked in the woods together or dallied on the banks of the millstream he watched her brow knit but no recognition sparked in her features i am will he felt a lump rise in his throat she shook her head if we knew each other once it is long gone this place is all i remember how could it not be i have dwelled here now these past thousand years chapter fiftyone silence lay like a shroud across the antechamber in that emptiness will could hear his world crumble and fall away at the door deortha listened for any intruders dreams are elusive the sorcerer said without emotion and sometimes the most fervent wishes float out for long years and return like an arrow through the heart no will snapped i will not accept that and what will you do stab it with your dagger plunge your sword through its heart deortha turned back to him his pale eyes glowing in the gloom here is an enemy that is immune to all your vaunted martial skills reaching out one imploring hand will stepped towards jenny she nearleapt away from him stay back she said no stranger can approach the kings consort will felt his blood run cold and there lies the heart of this great tragedy deortha said with a sour undertone we are thrust together in a bitter struggle of monumental proportions many lives hang in the balance and power and the very shape of what has been and what will be and all that we fight to achieve has been placed at risk by this he waved a contemptuous hand towards will and jenny by the insignificant desires of three lovesick fools enough will said tell me some truths truths deortha glowered do you remember aught of how you came to us he asked jenny i have always been here she replied her chin raised defiantly you are not one of us you are a mortal and you have always despised me for it jenny snapped will was surprised to see anger in the sorcerers face if you have only contempt for humans why did you steal jenny away he asked we are strong and you are weak deortha replied pursing his lips but sometimes some of my kind are infected with a flaw of the spirit a black corruption that eats away at their hearts we keep our secrets well we lie to ourselves and pretend but our history is littered with the failures of those who have turned their affections towards your kind will watched jennys face a chill rising as he began to understand our king deortha formed the word as if he had a pebble in his mouth came across this woman while at play in your land it is in his nature to give himself to foolhardy pursuits day after day he watched her until he believed his heart held affection he waved a hand as if dispelling a stench love so he took her will said with quick anger he forced her to submit to his will we have nothing but time a cruel smile flickered on the sorcerers lips we can wait for the waves to turn the rocks to sand if we wish time does our work for us mandraxas only had to wait here in this place the years eroded her resolve which at the beginning was great indeed removed from the comforts of her own life it became like a halfremembered dream she saw only our home and the wonders it contained and slowly she fell into its embrace as she listened to the sorcerers words jenny hung her head a faraway look in her eyes as if something deep was stirring inside her how can it be will asked that only fifteen years passed in our world and a thousand here the rules of existence are not as simple as your wise men would have you believe will felt hollow he had always believed the solution to his suffering was simple to bring jenny home but this this seemed insurmountable and still you think us devils even though we show love for your kind deortha said let me reveal one more secret then perhaps you will see who are the true devils your own kind knew where this woman had been taken and why indeed they encouraged it the contempt was barely restrained why would they will snapped all his longheld suspicions turning to hot anger this must have been what grace overheard cecil and essex discussing as the court left nonsuch a good question yes why the sorcerer smiled but his eyes remained icy tell me will fought the compulsion to beat the answer out of the fay in good time deortha raised an index finger firstly nothing is ever lost you must know that this is true what was still stirs within her if you can but find it will saw jenny studying him when he smiled she did not look away perhaps there was hope yet he thought and you tell me this out of the goodness of your heart he said to the sorcerer sardonically what is it you require in exchange i wish you to take this woman away from here what gain is there for you in that he would not have me whispering in the kings ear jenny said acidly she has stolen what little steel mandraxas had deortha ignored jennys glare we cannot win this war while she sits beside the golden throne and we will never have our queen returned to us how so the king does not want the queen returned from her imprisonment at your hands deortha circled jenny like a carrion crow eyeing a wounded rabbit she stared at the torch through heavy lids pretending to ignore him he would lose both the golden throne and this woman he loves so much the queen would never allow such an abomination to continue if she knew a mortal sat as kings consort beside the golden throne her fury would be terrible indeed will paced beside the black basalt walls weighing the fays words his thoughts raced confused by the revelations and he fought to make sense of everything he had heard after a moment he smiled to himself mandraxas does not want to free the queen for he would lose what he cares for most he mused and so the plots of elizabeths court are reflected here you are more like us than you realize the king plays his games deortha nodded he shows the face of a determined ruler who will do all within his power to free our queen and yet he undermines every attempt and obfuscates and delays some would even say the sorcerer said with studied disinterest that he plots to have the queen his sister killed while she is in your hands and to blame us for the murder and thereby unleash an even greater fury among your people a greater desire to commit atrocities against us deortha shrugged perhaps i would not pretend to know the kings mind you speak of love between fay and man walsingham the longdead spymaster and cecil the present one and the grey faces of the privy council paraded across wills thoughts and his anger burned hotter still he felt that at last he was beginning to understand your king reached some agreement with my masters he said finally the sorcerer steepled his fingers in front of him mandraxas was allowed to wander your land with impunity to find a woman who met his desires and then he was permitted to spirit her away with no questions asked and no effort made to recover her will clenched his fist in anguish and she was not alone deortha continued we have been granted the right to take whom we wished from your people not many not near as many as we stole before you built your defences a child here a wife or husband there for the sake of love in the main the spy seethed all those years of lies and deceit all the pain he had suffered with the connivance of those he served and in return the king agreed to contain those of the high family who demanded slaughter on a grand scale to regain our queen his work has become more difficult in recent times his brothers and sister have grown impatient with his failures and so his attempts to undermine their best endeavours have grown more determined will bowed his head he felt devastated hearing the truth in the sorcerers words he now understood so much deortha had been right the epochshaking clash of high power between england and the unseelie court that had been rolling across the world with increasing brutality was little more than an illusion in truth the high drama of vast sweeping schemes and strategies came down to nothing more than raw emotions passion and yearning and two suitors aspiring to the hand of one woman he laughed bitterly at the irony of it though you keep your teeth hidden i suspect you have venom enough he said eyeing the sorcerer i would have thought if such an obstacle existed to the great plans of the unseelie court it could be solved with a dagger in the night and risk the terrible wrath of the king only a fool would follow such a course while the fay and jenny glared at each other will slipped his fingers into his boot and withdrew his dagger he hid it behind his back as he circled towards deortha yet he felt the sorcerers words lying heavily on him if i take jenny away from here the king will be forced to act to reclaim her you will find whatever it takes to win this war and bring about the destruction of humankind if you leave her you destroy yourself can you bring yourself to do that you cannot take me away jenny said her tone dismissive my king would never allow it she clasped her hands behind her back showing her face to each male in turn will studied her features seeing the fire he had admired so long ago you love this king he asked i am his consort jenny replied as if that explained everything will stepped in front of deortha the unseen dagger cold in his hand and there is the difference between our people your king steals jenny from her life because he sees something he must have with no more thought for her than a beast in the field and you expect me to take her back in the same way because i want her more than the world itself but she is no rag doll to be torn between warring children she commands her own life and she must decide her own path and you would allow her to choose life here in this fortress of madness and dark even after you have sacrificed the years of your youth to find her deortha asked uncomprehending all i want for her is joy and peace i would not see her heart broken to salve my own ache he watched jennys face soften at his words her gaze flickered across his features a question in her eyes will stifled his swirling feelings for her ready to plunge the dagger into the sorcerers chest if nothing else came of this dismal affair the death of the unseelie courts scheming adviser would strike at the heart of their aspirations before he could decide the door crashed open jenny cried out in shock her hand flying to her mouth in a flurry of snow white mandraxas swept into the antechamber eyes afire with three fay guards at his side the sorcerers eyes widened with fear and in an instant he had pressed something hard into wills hand the king hurried to jenny to see she was well as the spy slipped the object under his shirt and into the waist of his breeches deortha whispered an instruction he had barely finished when mandraxas turned his coruscating gaze upon them at the kings order the guards forced will and deortha against the stone wall with the cruel blades of their halberds will felt the tip of the spear dig into his neck one thrust and his head would be gone he cursed mandraxas fixed his attention on deortha and intoned take the traitor to the scalding rooms horror flitted across the sorcerers face but he fought to retain his composure he glared coldly at the king but reserved a more lingering glance for will urging perhaps that they had business in common he strode out with a halberd pressed against his back the king stepped to jennys side and placed one slender finger under her chin to raise her head he gazed into her eyes for a long moment and then brushed his lips against hers will felt a flare of fiery anger and jealousy too he could not deny that he struggled to reach the fay king only for the remaining guards to press their halberds harder still he felt sticky blood trickle down his neck and yet as jennys lips met her masters he swore he saw her eyes look towards his own leaving her at last mandraxas strode towards him with a triumphant grin i saw you once long ago in your terms he said with contempt a callow youth not fit to dally with this proud woman my consort though the king held the upper hand the two faced each other as equals in love their faces cold i have sailed across an ocean of years and half a world to find jenny will said i have sacrificed my youth my innocence my dreams my morals to get her back i have turned my skin to flint and my heart to steel there is nothing i would not do to free her from your cruelty he could feel jennys eyes upon him but he kept his gaze upon the king mandraxass face loomed a fingers width from will his eyes gleamed golden his pale skin almost translucent his breath icecold i always knew you would come for her he whispered i welcomed it i needed you here in my hands you were always the one who might waken her from this long peaceful sleep even after a thousand years but now i have you she will be mine for ever and you will suffer a thousand hells for your failure chapter fiftytwo the fire roared in the grand stone hearth like a blacksmiths forge golden sparks surged up the chimney as shadows fluttered across the whirling figures dresses of mildewed grey swirled around in furious dance to the delirious rhythm of fiddle and pipe their cloaks flying the fay males caught the hands of their partners and whipped them around faster still and with every spin the faces altered hauntingly beautiful one moment cadaverous the next with the music ringing up to the vaulted roof the fiddler and the piper danced along the twin tables running the length of the hall deftly avoiding the platters of meat and bread and cheese which seemed at once both bounteous and corrupted by rot on the golden throne mandraxas steepled his fingers and watched the unseelie court at play with the easy eye of a victor beside him on a smaller throne his consort folded her hands in her lap unable to bring herself to look upon the knot of prisoners who huddled at the heart of the madness meg held up her head defiantly refusing to reveal the terror she felt in that hell amid the choking heat she sucked in a deep draught of air the sicklysweet smell of honeysuckle and rose so strong she felt as if she was in her cups surely the end was not far away now it would not be pleasant she knew and there would be agonies aplenty for a time but it would at least be an end the irish spy saw grace kneading her hands as she watched her sister beside the fay king she lives and for now that is enough meg shouted above the din a little comfort in the final hour was no bad thing she is remembering can you not see grace replied the coldness has drained from her face soon she will know me and then she will save us all we are fortunate indeed meg lied she studied jenny with a sharp eye a country girl nothing more was this really the one who had filled will with such passion that he had travelled to deaths door to bring her home she shook her head unable to comprehend how swyfte could prefer that child when she herself offered passion and life and experience as the wild music reached a climax carpenter clutched at his head as if something squirmed in his skull meg had sensed that something was wrong with the spy ever since they had left the island but what it was she could not guess she saw that launceston was concerned for his friend too his raptor eyes rarely leaving the other man the fay swooped closer as they whirled white faces flashing past in a blur of mad staring eyes jagged fingernails caught in megs hair and raked across graces breast the two women pressed back to back against carpenter and launceston all of them determined to fight to the last when the ravenous pack fell upon them it was then just as the irish spy began to fear the worst that a bell rang its tone crystal clear the dancers swept to the perimeter of the hall where they continued to circle and the music quietened a little as the fiddler and pipe player retreated to the hearth when the door flew open two guards in winged helms dragged will in meg felt a rush of joy to see him still with the living and despite everything a flicker of hope warmed her heart blood caked the edge of his left eye and a bruise swelled on his cheek but he flashed a grin when he saw her even at the last he knew how to make a girls heart beat faster she thought with a quiet laugh the guards flung will on to the flagstones in front of mandraxas climbing to his feet the spy brushed the dust from his shirt with lazy strokes he paid no attention to the fay king yet when he was done he locked eyes with jenny in a gaze heavy with emotion in that look meg saw such depth of feeling that it touched her heart you are creatures of few days mandraxas said looking down upon will and they pass in a blink of an eye we however and he gestured to those around him we continue for ever you move slowly through a fog of ignorance we race across fields of wonder how high you raise yourselves up insisting you are not beasts of the field how pitiful you are in truth the king reached out his left hand for jenny to take no show of affection but one of ownership designed to wound shall we see how little you mean to us shall we have fine sport for now your days are truly at an end will drew himself up and spat a mouthful of blood on to the flagstones you think you have our necks upon the block but we are exactly where we wish to be he turned to the spies and flashed meg another grin she recognized the familiar heat in her belly could he really have a plan even here in the heart of hell friendless weaponless and surrounded by an army of enemies she would have mocked the suggestion if it were any other man but swyfte he was a schemer and a gambler perhaps the greatest one she knew englands greatest spy how the other rogues in cecils service laughed at the sobriquet concocted to assuage the fears of the good men and women of england and yet it was true it was true as if unsure of what he was hearing mandraxass eyes narrowed we are masters of torment and suffering we can pluck agony like the string of a lyre and sustain it for eternity do you doubt me he clapped his hands once and the musicians stepped in front of the throne the fiddle player began to increase the tempo until the music whirled into a frenzy his silver hair lashing the air with his passion the piper spun round and round atonal notes seemingly in opposition to his partners melody the din set megs teeth on edge at first but gradually she felt her heart begin to beat faster and her cheeks flush and euphoria begin to burn inside her under the clashing tunes she thought she could hear another song being played despite herself her feet and hands began to twitch to the rhythm and yet it was grace who seemed most affected by the music carpenter clutched for her but she danced away from his fingers spinning on light feet into the space in front of the musicians sweat glistened on her brow as she turned faster and faster still her brown hair flying yet meg saw none of the joy the girl would have exhibited at one of the court masques instead her eyes were wide with fear her expression fixed she cannot stop the irish spy murmured with dawning realization dance your hours away mandraxas called dance until your flesh withers and falls from your bones when meg heard the piper alter his tune once more she saw shadows cross the faces of carpenter and launceston their eyes gleamed and faint beatific smiles flickered on their lips it was as if they had forgotten all that transpired in that hall and were instead looking deep within themselves to some glorious time of their youth gradually meg noticed that it seemed as if a light was slowly going out in their features wills expression darkened but he held firm meg saw his hand reach behind his back where his shirt hung loose above the waist of his breeches do not harm them though the voice was quiet it rang out with such intensity that it cut through the raucous music mandraxas recoiled as if he had been slapped it was jenny who had spoken tears glimmered in the corners of her eyes but her expression was fierce and graces mad dance began to slow meg looked from the woman to will he was smiling in triumph and she knew that he had gambled on his loves awakening it seems your queen disagrees he said spite her and show we mortals mean nothing to you or accede to her request and accept that our kind in certain circumstances have power over you meg watched mandraxas wrestle with the net that seemingly snared him the dancing of the unseelie court slowed and all eyes turned towards their king they had the look of a hungry wolf pack ready to pounce the irish spy thought you have not forgotten will continued he swallowed nearly choking on his passion as his gaze locked upon jenny one thousand years may pass but still the heart calls out her cheeks flushed you remember your sister grace who whispers a prayer for you to return home every day and you remember me enough mandraxas snapped gone was the striking regal face replaced by a deaths head of sunken cheeks thin lips and hollow eyes meg brushed the hair from her face standing taller as she looked with hope to will a faint but familiar smile played on his lips it was the smile of a man who saw his carefully laid snare tightening around his preys neck there is one way to solve this knotty affair of pride and human emotions he said as if the notion had only just come to him a duel the king snorted with derision between you and me but a duel is a fight between equals before i left london i visited your queen will raised his voice so the other gauntfaced members of the unseelie court would focus upon his words the true ruler of this place and people she yearns to return to the city of gold and so she will mandraxas said too quickly she spoke to me of your people of the rules that bind you and the beliefs and she told me of honour will pushed on his voice louder you believe mortals are a dishonourable breed yes that our kind are filled with deceit shaped for betrayal honour is what separates your kind from ours that is what your queen said and she spoke true meg smiled as she watched the fay king move towards the trap step by step seemingly unable to look away from the dancing fire he appeared oblivious of what lay in the dark around him then we duel you and i will said his tone lazy and honour dictates the outcome if you win you will have your cruel sport with us and if i win we have safe passage to leave this place and return to the world of men my friends and i he paused for effect and jenny mandraxass eyes widened for a moment but then he settled back into his throne and folded his hands in his lap his smile was corpsecold but you cannot win i am faster stronger more skilful than even one of our hunters will you brag as much when you wriggle on the end of my cold steel he threw his arms wide looking around his court with a wolfish grin a duel then fine sport for all a duel conducted with honour will said you will use no magics or illusions to turn my head no music to make me dance like a fool no whispers that turn my bones to straw or whisk my wits away to bedlam rest assured all i need is my rapier i have your word mandraxas nodded slowly you have the word of the king of the unseelie court had will truly lost his mind meg was torn between apprehension and belief in the man she now realized she loved his plan remained hidden but with will swyfte that was always the case with a deep bow will said then let our dance begin and may the devil take the loser chapter fiftythree wild shadows danced across the stone walls beyond the crackle and spatter of the flames in the hearth silence lay heavily across the hall feeling bruised and battered but ready for a fight will weighed the rapier in his hand checking that it was indeed the one that had been taken from him when he and deortha had been captured he whisked the tip of the blade through the air making a play for the eyes of the enemy he felt upon him he glimpsed the fays cold haunted faces were they hungry for his death fired at the prospect of bloody entertainment filled with loathing for one of the men who had taken their queen from them of one thing he was certain none of them could countenance anything but his defeat mandraxas shrugged off his white cloak and pushed his shoulders back for a moment he watched will with undisguised contempt then drew his own rapier and flexed the tip against the flags will ignored him looking instead at jenny drawing strength from the concern he saw in her face she leaned forward on her throne and her eyes did not waver when they met his she remembered him now and what they shared he could see if he were to die there and then that would be reward enough for all the years of searching and striving and disappointment he bowed consider now what we fight for he said levelling his blade at the king this is not man against fay or two bitter enemies waging war for the good of their country no we are rivals of the heart about to clash swords for the hand of the woman we love no great affair this indeed tis a private matter mandraxas all but snarled like all your kind you are deluded that matter has already been decided i have my queen and you have nothing and soon less than nothing look in your queens face your highness and repeat your words with conviction will taunted enjoying the anger that sparked in mandraxass features in any sword fight such emotion was weakness let us be done with this the king said with a theatrical sigh he levelled his own rapier and gently tapped the end of wills blade and the storm broke the cold sea of predatory white faces seemed to fade away as wills vision closed in upon his opponent barely had their swords clashed before he found mandraxas as threatening as he had boasted will moved with the speed of a snake as the fay struck with quicksilver strokes the kings rapier glowed with the reflected flames from the hearth slashing high for wills throat then low to disable a thrust to the heart ripped open the spys shirt drawing blood on his chest unable to anticipate the rapid strokes will knew he must rely on instinct and yet when he looked past mandraxass lupine grin into those haunted eyes will thought he understood his foe the unseelie court always found the flaws in mens hearts but now he had discovered the fays weakness no monster of the night this the king was weighted with all the fear of any man afraid of losing the woman he loved as if he could sense wills probing of his vulnerability the fay snarled in fury and suddenly lunged at his opponents face the spy skipped back a step feeling his cheek bloom hot from the steels breath will knew he would not last much longer in the face of such an onslaught the time had come parrying another lightning thrust from the fay king will reached behind him with his left hand and withdrew the object that deortha had pressed on him earlier and hed hidden under his shirt in the firelight the devils looking glass burned like the sun mandraxas hesitated suddenly unsure will sensed the rest of the unseelie court bracing itself clawlike hands clutching barely resisting the urge to fall upon him and tear him apart he refused to acknowledge the threat and glanced into the smoky depths of the obsidian mirror the mist cleared and there was the hooded gaze of the sorcerer deorthas whispered words sizzled in his head fulfil our agreement slay the traitor as deorthas lips shaped some silent incantation his visage faded it was replaced by mandraxas as though the mirror was but a window on the scene in front of him yet the mirrorking thrust upwards a moment before the real king and as mandraxas struck the spy stepped aside will smiled as a flicker of surprise crossed his opponents face how the sorcerer must hate his king to give up such a prize so readily a mirror which could see across all time even if it were only one moment from now as will parried each of his foes strikes with ease so the triumph ebbed from the fay kings face balancing on the balls of his feet the spy danced around his foe making his opponent look a fool as the looking glass revealed the weaknesses in mandraxass defence so will jabbed and thrust with growing confidence and fervour he slit the kings doublet his breeches his silk sleeves then nicked his cheek and each strike could have been a killing blow the fay stumbled back under the relentless assault until he sprawled against his throne a murmur rippled through the unseelie court mandraxass features grew taut with shame herein lies a lesson will said the tip of his rapier hovering over the kings heart pride comes before a fall deceit and trickery the king snarled your nature remains true your kind are lower than snakes i would not wish to disappoint you your highness and yet in your arrogance you saw no need to define the rules of my engagement as i did of yours his face twisting with rage mandraxas flung himself forward almost lazily will stepped aside and tripped his opponent the fay king tumbled across the flagstones the spy could feel how close he was to being ripped limb from limb by the ghastly figures hovering close by and he spun away from the duel to the huddle of his friends be prepared he whispered when i give the signal we make our move you are as mad as always carpenter snapped nearly hysterical he frantically raked his fingers through his hair as though his head was fit to burst those pale bastards will be on us like wolves before we have taken a step john you must trust will grace implored though her hands trembled she kept a brave face will heard mandraxas scramble to his feet but before he could turn launceston caught his eye with his unsettling gaze what deal have you made to gain the advantage that mirror gives you i wonder the earl hissed i have agreed to kill the king will replied without emotion thus damning all mankind to immediate destruction at the hands of a vengeful fay army sweeping out one hand he added with a sardonic smile but at least we will be allowed to leave unharmed with jenny graces face drained of blood no will you cannot will felt a twinge of hurt when he saw megs face harden some would say that is too high a price even for the love of your life she said with fauxsweetness i would think again my darling the only choices worth making are the hard ones he replied turning back to mandraxas clearing all extraneous thoughts from his head he added and i would have an end to my suffering one way or another when will raised his rapier the king feinted and thrust though his attack lacked guile or power his confidence was ebbing the spy saw it was time to finish this play as mandraxas searched for an opening will wiped the sweat from his brow he had been delaying that moment of no return he knew the mirror glinted and once again he glimpsed deorthas cold watchful eyes urging him on to damnation he dealt a flurry of ferocious blows catching the king off guard and driving him back with a flick of his wrist he whipped his foes blade from his hand and thrust his rapier towards the fays throat jenny leapt from her throne do not kill him she cried will ignored her though his heart ached at her concern for his foe the unseelie court surged closer white faces contorted with bestial rage sword poised to strike the spy thundered stay back i will slay your king without a moments thought for my own safety hands hooked the fay slowed close enough for will to smell their loamy odour meg robert some help if you will launceston and the irish woman grabbed daggers from two of the nearest fay and held the blades against the kings neck stepping back will sheathed his sword and then held out his hand after a moments hesitation jenny took it he could feel the fury of mandraxass gaze upon him as carpenter and grace hurried to his side the fay surrounded them and will guessed countless more were gathering in the fortress beyond how can we ever escape grace whispered as if reading his thoughts deortha show me the way out will commanded into the looking glass the surface cleared and he heard the sorcerer speak first kill the king do you take me for a fool once we have our freedom you can have your monarchs life after a moments hesitation the sorcerer uttered the words will needed to hear he grinned at the others a reassuring show of bravado stay close at my back and if any here dare threaten you prick the king till he squeals our enemy will think twice before daring to lay a hand on you with launceston and meg guarding their prisoner will slid out his rapier and brandished it in front of him the wall of fay parted and he began to lead the way through them cadaverous faces loomed from the halflight on either side hungry eyes staring and jaws snapping a choking sense of dread enveloped him at the halls great door he turned back and looked across the unseelie court waving the tip of his rapier towards mandraxass face he announced your king has betrayed you he has conspired to leave your queen a prisoner of men so that the golden throne can be his alone lies mandraxas bellowed with a smile and an arched eyebrow meg dug her blade deeper into the kings neck and breathed into his ear quiet now my sweet i can cut out your tongue and still keep you alive for a while trust not my words will continued his voice clear and strong seek out your courts wise adviser deortha who is now incarcerated upon your kings orders free him from his cell where he has been locked away along with the truth and listen to what he has to say then you will learn that we are not so different fay and men will turned to jenny and drank in all the things he had missed the sparkle in her dark eyes and the way her brow knitted as if she was always questioning and the colour in her cheeks and her lips in case this was their last moment gently he cupped the back of her neck and pulled her to him she showed no resistance he closed his eyes their lips met and he felt a jolt run through him and all the lost years melted away once again he was in warwickshire with the sun on his shoulders and the future ahead of him blood throbbed through his head driving out all thoughts and when he opened his lids he watched a light appear in her face as if she were waking from that dream all is illusion and sometimes the truth is hidden he thought with a surge of pure joy the first he had felt in many a year but it is here now turning back to the ranks of glowering faces he called our time here is done he bowed deeply flinging out his left arm with a flourish and so i bid you farewell and with that he pushed open the doors and led the others out into the dark alleys of a fortress teeming with the enemy chapter fiftyfour torches hissed on the black basalt walls in and out of swooping shadows six figures ghosted along the narrow labyrinthine ways bundling a seventh darkness as thick and impenetrable as the grave shrouded the spaces in between the toosmall pools of light will ran a hand through his sweatsoaked hair wondering how long they had before their pursuers caught them at a crossing of the ways the fleeing figures pressed back into an archway as two grey sentries marched past once they had gone the spies slipped by but at every turn more fay drifted like ghosts emerging from churchyards at dusk wills chest tightened it was only a matter of time until their escape route was discovered can you not use the mirror to predict where these foul things lie in wait meg hissed as they huddled by a wall without deorthas guidance it is useless to me he replied but to keep it out of their control is victory in itself he squeezed jennys hand never wanting to let it go and she returned a wan smile but the light of recognition gleamed in her eyes with increasing brilliance you damn yourself with each step you take mandraxas snarled his head was pulled back his long hair held in launcestons fist his throat bared for a simple swift slash of a blade your agonies will be neverending keep a close eye on our guest will warned the earl given half a chance he will violate your wits with his whispered words and turn you upon yourself or he will use his magics to leave you nothing but a straw man ripe for the harvest bonfire it was then that he noticed carpenter the man was tearing and scratching at his face as if insects crawled there john are you sick he is well enough launceston cut in too quickly i will watch over him your task is to guide us safely through this hell or lead us to a quick death at worst barely had the words left his lips when the funereal tolling of a bell tore through the hot dark once again will felt the hairs prickle on the back of his neck the night unfolds and releases its terrors mandraxas whispered with a low laugh run run across the city of gold they could hear the wind rising in the high eaves and along the twisting alleyways it moaned doors crashed open feet pounded on stone a high keening of inhuman voices raised in anger tugged at their ears the sands have run out my love meg said with an edge to her voice this is no time for caution urging the others to follow will broke into a run following the directions deortha had whispered in his head but the alleyways twisted and turned in a confusing manner and the dark lay heavy around them running feet echoed on all sides will could feel the rising anxiety of his friends as the activity milled closer but just as he feared the worst he saw the landmark he had been searching for a golden globe spinning with no visible means of support at the centre of a small courtyard he ran forward only to be confronted by a high black featureless wall despairing glances darted among the others as they realized they were trapped footsteps and calls echoed all around the unseelie court were drawing near why do you tarry carpenter barked make haste before we are undone jenny squeezed wills hand as he scanned the length of the wall what is it you search for she asked a door deortha told me our path of escape would begin here at his chambers the sorcerer has betrayed us launceston snarled glancing back deortha keeps his secrets well jenny said with him nothing ever lies in plain sight will weighed her words after a moment he snatched a sizzling torch from the wall and reflected its ruddy light with the obsidian mirror lines of silver filigree glimmered on the basalt stars a moon a sun a host of magical symbols of the kind he had only ever seen before in dees shadowy chamber in the black gallery and there at the centre of them the faint outline of an arched door shimmered handing the mirror and torch to grace will pressed round the edge of the shape until he heard a click and the hidden door slid open the spies dragged their prisoner into the dark space it was not a moment too soon the tumult crashed against the edge of the courtyard as the door whispered shut behind them his hand trembling his face pale carpenter levelled his rapier ready to repel any who followed shrieks and cries rang through the stone wall but after a moment they began to pass by carpenter exhaled his shoulders sagging as his blade fell will took the torch and held it high to reveal a flight of stone steps disappearing down into the dark as they paused to catch their breath grace could contain herself no longer she threw her arms round jenny burying her face in her sisters shoulder awkward and unsure jennys hands wavered over the younger woman for a moment before she returned the embrace do you know me yet grace said between juddering sobs my heart will break if you remain a stranger so long have i yearned for your return jenny held her sisters tearstreaked face between her hands and gazed into the young girls eyes her brow cleared and she smiled i remember holding a little girls hand as we searched for wild flowers in the wood and telling stories under the covers when we were supposed to be asleep she stroked the centre of her forehead i thought it a dream insubstantial but now i see you here the visions grow clearer by the moment as she pulled back grace bit her lip i feared you dead oh i lost faith jenny only will she choked back the words will never lost his belief that you would return to us even in the darkest days he kept a candle in his heart and that in turn brought comfort to me jenny looked beyond her sisters shoulder to where will was beginning to descend the stone staircase while meg and launceston pricked mandraxas with their daggers to follow will sensed jenny hurrying to catch him up looking back he saw her glance at the fay and whisper i beg you not to hurt him he is our foe and i have reached agreement with deortha to take his life in exchange for our freedom your freedom will replied ignoring a pang of jealousy whatever you might think of him he has shown me many kindnesses during my long years in the city of gold he felt her breath on his ear as they descended into the dark you love him even though he stole you from all you knew he whispered his voice sounding too harsh in the stillness when i was first brought here i cried every day i cried for the man i had lost she swallowed and added quietly and you he nodded feeling the rawness of the memory even after all the time that had passed but over the days and years the life i had faded like a dream she continued soon this place and mandraxas was all i knew and he was gentle and caring and he showed me love they are not capable of love will interrupted his voice hard moisture now glistened on the walls they are she protested they are no different from us and did you love him will asked coldly he paused looking into her face from further up the steps he heard the shuffle of feet as grace the other spies and their prisoner descended cautiously you must understand it was all i knew will turned away and continued his descent his expression unreadable my plans for the kings future were made long ago nothing will alter them he increased his pace before she could protest the staircase opened out on to a long lowceilinged chamber barely lit by the glow of four candles arranged on the cardinal points of a circle inscribed on the dusty flagstones along the walls a multitude of giltframed mirrors each as big as a man glittered in the reflected light as will stepped into the room rapier drawn shadowy figures formed in several of the mirrors each one growing more distinct as if they were stepping out of a thick fog he recognized several members of the unseelie courts high family including malantha seductive and cruel the silverhaired lethe a grotesquely fat bald fay he had glimpsed in paris the previous year and others he did not know each seemed to be standing in a different chamber at courts across the world will guessed where they wove their manipulations of men and among them stood deortha his eyes ringed with shadow the bird and mice skulls braided into his hair trembling with each faint movement what is this carpenter muttered shuddering are we betrayed i am sure the high family care little for us at this moment will murmured in reply greater matters must now occupy their minds he nodded to meg and launceston and they forced mandraxas to his knees in front of the mirrors the earl pressed the tip of his dagger against the nape of the kings neck they are here to pass judgement will said to carpenter and to witness an execution he wondered how much deortha had told the other members of the high family he watched jenny look along the row of fay lords her face cold and knew there was no love lost there she took graces hand in her own perhaps an unconscious desire to protect her sister from these predators a faint click echoed from the shadows behind them but as will peered into the gloom mandraxas turned his face towards his siblings and uttered you will not judge me i am king king deortha shaped the word with cold precision you keep the golden throne safe for our queen at the pleasure of the high family it is a privilege mandraxass brow knitted as he looked along the row of emotionless faces silence swaddled the chamber after a moment will realized that the coldfaced fay were communicating in some manner beyond speech the kings features darkened and he flashed a threatening look at deortha before he glanced back at will i will not be your prisoner he said it was then that carpenter cried out stifling the sound with a trembling hand will turned to look at the man it was not in his nature to be scared of any fay will thought not even one with the power of a king yet tears now streamed down the mans face and his brow was beaded with sweat muttering under his breath he lurched out of sight behind will as the latter turned back to the mirrors deorthas pale eyes shone like the moon urging the spy to complete their agreement and take the kings life will felt jennys apprehensive gaze heavy upon him too with a hard smile mandraxas was saying nothing is left to chance as will struggled to understand the context of the kings words he glimpsed megs brows snapping together and heard graces startled gasp movement flashed on the edge of his vision dagger drawn carpenter lunged the blade shimmered as he thrust it towards wills right eye chapter fiftyfive the glinting steel filled wills vision and one thought seared carpenters great betrayal had doomed them all he jerked back in anticipation of the blades sinking into his skull just as he sensed a flurry of movement and a sudden impact his attacker spun away the deflected blade ripped through the flesh above his cheek and tore into his tangle of black hair blood dripped on to the flags in agony he stumbled back wiping at the burning wound with his sleeve his gaze fell upon carpenter who was sprawled across the stone floor pinned down by launceston kill me carpenter pleaded staring into the aristocrats pale impassive face do it now as you vowed when the earl didnt respond carpenter blinked away tears and wailed if you do not end my life i will betray you again and again until i have slain you all you will not leave this place will saw meg hovering over mandraxas with her dagger drawn grace and jenny beside her all of them gripped by carpenters plight blood trickled between his fingers he saw the truth in the treacherous spys words sooner or later carpenter would attack them again with a surge of bitter regret for the friend he once knew he drew his own dagger from his boot as he levelled the blade launceston caught his wrist to block the strike let him live the earl said his voice quiet but his eyes flashing a warning from his own mouth he has damned himself robert we will never escape with a traitor in our midst he is no traitor the aristocrat pointed a wavering arm at the ghastly figures watching from the mirrors they have infected him with their vile magics is this true john as he spoke will winced in pain from his wound some foul creature crawls inside my head carpenter replied his voice a ragged whine it rides me like a barbary mare forcing me to do its bidding and god help me i cannot resist whatever it demands i must do even murder my friends he screwed up his eyes to hide the tears of shame and regret it seems our king has long since set his own schemes in motion came deorthas voice the caraprix can only work its spell when it has been accepted freely they tricked me carpenter raged his voice caught and he choked i am too weak i wanted an escape from this life i should have resisted will sighed more than anyone he understood the manipulations of the unseelie court robert the outcome is still the same john cannot be trusted we cannot take him with us no the earl spat his face alight with a rare show of passion i will be his keeper that burden may be too great even for you robert i will watch him like a hawk and whenever that enchantment drives him to commit traitorous acts i will be there launceston said his grey blank eyes fixed on will take my life i implore you carpenter begged again his voice cracking i cannot bear to live this way with a life that is not my own the earl peered into his friends tearflecked eyes for a long moment will wondered what thoughts turned in that unreadable mind he could barely hear when launceston spoke you have saved me i will save you i can do no less turning back to will he added this is my burden now for all our days if necessary i am prepared you must trust me will watched carpenter in his torments and nodded you are a good man robert for all your weaknesses a sharp cry of pain echoed across the chamber will whirled round he was a fool he had allowed himself to be distracted for too long mandraxas had made his move and taken meg by surprise knocking the dagger from her grasp and now his long fingers were clamped around her wrist one touch no more but it was enough the irish womans face had drained of blood where the kings hand gripped her skin was marbling mandraxas smiled in triumph at will knowing he could never reach him before the graven transformation had spread to the point of death will drew his sword as the beautiful irish spy swooned yet he had barely moved when shock flared in the kings face meg tumbled from his grasp the fay king staggered back grasping at the dagger embedded in his thigh ashenfaced jenny stepped back her hand shaking mandraxas stared at her a look of such sadness and disbelief that it could only have come from a broken heart when will reached him the king had barely moved seemingly drained of all resistance by his loves blow one clout from the hilt of the spys rapier and he fell to his knees once more stay back will warned meg who had staggered to her feet shaking her head as she fought to gather her thoughts and rubbing furiously at the skin on her arm he is mine and mine alone yet the fays gaze remained fixed on jenny weighted with infinite grief will hated what he saw there he thought of mandraxas and jennys long years as consorts of caresses and shared moments of gentleness and intimacy and joy and love how much easier it had been when he had thought his love simply stolen what a stew of confused emotion this was how bitter it tasted his sword at the ready he circled the stricken king imagining what it would feel like to skewer the one who had torn the heart out of his life so long ago in his minds eye he saw the gout of blood and the deathrictus on mandraxass face hatred seared his chest he wanted vengeance around them the chamber had grown silent he could feel deorthas gaze upon him willing him to complete their pact execute the king who had betrayed his own people for power yes but for love too deortha once the deed is done i would not wish to tarry here which way will called his eyes not leaving the fay king on the far side of the chamber there is a door the sorcerer replied triumph creeping into his voice wills hand shook the tip of his rapier nicked the kings flesh for a moment simmering rage hardened his face and then he sucked in a deep breath and calmed himself jenny turned away sickened by what she feared was to come you can keep your worthless life will growled putting up his sword mandraxas twitched incomprehension crossed his pale refined features from the corner of his eye the spy glimpsed cold rage beginning to glow in deorthas face i am not you he continued a deep calm settled over him and his sombre words were tinged with sadness nor am i the man that others think me not englands greatest spy nor the rake driven solely by selfish urges the truth is harder to define even for me more than anything under heaven i want my revenge for what you did but that would sacrifice all men and women to the righteous fury of the unseelie court and even as coldhearted a knave as i could not plumb those depths and yet he waved his index finger in the air and yet i saw an opportunity here for a clever man or a reckless gambler one or tother and you were always both he heard meg whisper still clutching at the wound in his thigh mandraxas looked bemused will turned to jenny his voice growing more intense a slim chance to achieve the two ends to which i have dedicated my life to save you and to deal the unseelie court a crushing blow that might set them back years if not for ever he took a deep juddering breath and smiled at his love returning his attention to the fay he raised the tip of his sword and held it against the kings chest if you are allowed to live and return to your people the unseelie court will be riven by strife as factions battle for supremacy those who support you and those like deortha who wish to see the return of their true queen for how long he shrugged for those such as you for whom time is meaningless it may well be an eternity divided you would have little time for your war against men you are mistaken will heard launcestons hushed voice you are indeed englands greatest spy her eyes sparkling meg beamed you might well have ended this war we all thought would last for ever will held up a bloodstained hand hardly daring to believed it himself he looked round jenny and grace were both smiling in disbelief tears of relief glistening in their eyes jenny mouthed thank you he refused to consider why she was thanking him there would be time for that conversation later fury finally ignited in deorthas face lies and deceit i should have expected no better from a man true will replied with a shrug we are worse than beasts in the field have you no honour placing a finger on his chin will feigned a moment of reflection honour what is honour does it buy me good sack in the mermaid i have saved my love and ended a war i leave honour for better men than i i am happy to remain a bastard deorthas snarl echoed across the chamber until it was drowned by mandraxass laughter he stood pushing away the tip of wills rapier with a slender finger so you refuse to kill and yet on that hot night soon after i took from you the thing you valued most i saw you slay an innocent man will felt the eyes of all there fall upon him his breath caught in his chest as years of selfloathing bubbled up finally he nodded tis true though i have never spoken of it to anyone he glanced at grace noting the lines of worry in her face and sighed bowing his head he confessed when jenny disappeared that afternoon i barely held on to my wits i searched every byway around arden and in the depths of night came across a man struggling with jenny beside a hedgerow blinded by fury i leapt from my horse and beat him to death with my fists his head flooded with the sensations of bones breaking under his knuckles and blood flowing over his fingers he felt the weight in his heart that he had carried since that night but when he lay lifeless at my feet and i turned to embrace jenny i saw it was not her he continued it was one of the silly village girls known for her easy ways the man was a footpad so not a good man and the girl was grateful that i had saved her from the fate he had intended he swallowed but in truth yes i had killed an innocent man he looked to grace expecting accusation or disgust but he saw only pity that night when you came to me at the well i was washing the blood from my hands though i could never clean the stains from my mortal soul that night the course of my life changed i learned that i am not a good man and though i have tried to make amends for my crime i know i never will grace ran to his side it is not true you are a good man and you have proved it time and again mandraxas gave a cold laugh at the subtle blow he had struck but as his amusement drained away he pointed a threatening finger at will you think yourself clever but the schemes of mortals rarely turn out as planned and i have nothing but time to take the prize he glanced at jenny but turned away quickly so will could not see his expression then he grasped the hilt of the knife in his thigh and with a grimace slowly withdrew it tearing off a strip of cloth from the hem of his cloak he began to bind the wound jenny hesitated glancing at will and when he nodded she hurried to help the one who had been her consort for so long the fay king watched her as she tenderly tied the cloth round his thigh but if he felt anything it did not show on his face when she had finished mandraxas muttered something that will could not hear and then turned quickly and limped towards the stone steps leading out of the chamber of mirrors as if in a trance will watched him go still barely believing that he had plucked some kind of victory from the direst of situations once the king moved into the penumbra beyond the circle of candlelight he turned beckoning the others to follow him come my friends we must make haste he said yet barely had he taken a step when a sharp gasp brought him to a halt he spun round to see mandraxas staggering back down the steps one hand clutched at his chest as blood fountained between his fingers will gaped in shock the king half turned his yearning gaze finding jenny for one moment and then he fell to the flagstones dead jenny rushed to him with a cry of despair in his mirror deortha was smiling what is this treachery launceston said menace curdling his voice a figure stepped out of the shadows from the foot of the stairs holding a blade that dripped gore it was strangewayes the redheaded spy looked across at his companions with a cold face and said the only treachery here is yours and now there is an end to it chapter fiftysix oh tobias what have you done grace cried with a sob running to where jenny knelt by mandraxass lifeless body strangewayes stepped over the king and swaggered towards the guttering candles he pointed his rapier towards will you sirrah should not have ignored me when there was an opportunity to prevent this outcome he said in an icy voice too long have you placed graces life at risk with your reckless behaviour but no more he beckoned to grace to join him come i will take you away from here dismay spreading across her face the young woman shook her head slowly taking a step back come to me strangewayes snapped i am here to make you safe no tobias not safe she said in a small voice for you have doomed us all stung strangewayes glared at will she is still under your spell i see but soon she will learn you know not what you have done will began his voice hushed he shook his head appalled then let the words drain away we thought you dead you wished me so never tobias i have saved grace from you the young mans gaze skittered towards deortha and in the look that the two exchanged will glimpsed the truth it must have happened when strangewayes was taken prisoner at the fortress gates the scheming sorcerer had seen an opportunity to use the pitiful spy in case will should fail to kill mandraxas he cursed himself for a fool if only he had heeded the click of the door opening into that chamber before carpenters attack whatever the conjurer has promised you it is a lie he began quiet strangewayes roared he wiped the sweat from his brow with a trembling hand will saw only a boy reeling from events far beyond his ability to deal with them the king is dead the redheaded spy said to deortha i have done all you wished now let me take grace away from here in the strange mirror they saw the sorcerer steeple his fingers thin lips twitching ah but the terms of our agreement have been breached strangewayes gaped what is this trickery unless you reached another deal with this devil will said the agreement was free passage if i killed the king i did not you fool carpenter roared suddenly turning his hopelessness into rage pushing launceston to one side he snatched out his rapier we were free and now you you have doomed your girl as surely as if you wielded the dagger yourself no strangewayes croaked his face pale with disbelief i saved her he looked to grace for support for her to confirm that what he said was true but found only dismay and disillusion he sagged his rapier loose in his hand a last drop of the kings blood fell from the tip colouring the stone slab the traitor has been deposed in a triumphant tone deortha addressed the other fay in their ethereal mirrors though the passing of a brother is a time of sorrow for the high family now we may achieve what we have desired for so long the return of our true queen let our vengeance rain down on the world of men bring fire and blood cleanse this world of the corruption of man and bring our queen home one by one the mirrors misted as the fay of the high family departed until only deortha remained will felt chilled only horrors beyond imagining lay ahead realizing what he had done strangewayes dropped his rapier with a clatter he held graces gaze for a moment perhaps hoping for forgiveness and when he saw none he turned and ran into the shadows tobias come with us grace called after him but will caught her arm you cannot save him and you will only condemn yourself he said wincing at the hurt he saw in her face but she stifled her grief and nodded allowing herself one last glance into the gloom as she went to her quietly sobbing sister where she knelt beside mandraxass body from his mirror deortha levelled his gaze at will the spy saw no triumph there no contempt not even superiority only the icy satisfaction of a longgestating plan finally come to fruition breaking the stare will looked from meg to launceston and carpenter and nodded the silent communication was more than enough and his three colleagues went in search of the door out of the chamber will hurried to the two sisters jenny i am sorry truly i am he said his voice gentle she looked at him her face was unreadable pale tearstained and for you grace but we must all grieve later he swept his left arm out to direct them to the end of the chamber grace ran ahead but jenny turned back and pressed her lips close to wills ear i remember she breathed and paused i remember a kiss under the great oak on an autumn evening when the leaves were turning gold our first kiss and in her eyes he saw the jenny he knew she hurried after her sister before he could respond carpenter and launceston waited either side of a low arched door in a tunnel beyond meg had found and lit a torch and was beckoning to grace and jenny to join her will saw unease in the irish womans stare so close to victory they had been and now they could all feel the winter chill of impending doom enveloping them he thought bitterly he turned to carpenter but before he could speak the other man snapped no pity for now i have my own wits about me good then it is like old times john will touched his torn cheek before clapping a friendly hand on carpenters shoulder he flashed a searching glance at launceston who gave a curt nod of reassurance ahead the golden glow of megs torch washed across the glistening stone walls and the three men plunged into the gloom in pursuit as they scrambled along the lowceilinged tunnel they could hear the dull tolling of the alarm bell reverberating ever more clearly each throb seeming to match the beat of their hearts torchlight flickered across faces struggling to contain hopelessness and dread why run when those bastards know which path we take carpenter growled they will never let us leave we are already dead it is the only way out of here will replied and we died a long time ago the moment we set foot in this cursed place every breath we take now is a boon visions of unseelie court galleons sweeping out from the new world flooded his mind each one filled with more horror than any man could bear and if we escape carpenter continued bitterly as if he could read wills mind what do we escape to an england made hell better we die here will stopped suddenly catching the other mans arm as he turned is this the john carpenter who fought his way out of muscovy alone after i had abandoned him to a fate worse than death in all our time in service to the queen we have never given up though we faced overwhelming odds even if all the unseelie court and their nightterrors snap at our heels we fight on until the last drop of blood flows from our bodies and our rapiers fall from our dying hands at first carpenter would not meet wills eyes but then he nodded in apology aye will let us die as we have lived for the queen for england let those pale bastards come and we shall see how many i send to hell afore me will nodded in approval as he turned to continue along the cramped tunnel meg called back i see light ahead moments later they stepped out on to a wide stone balcony protruding from a sheer cliff face towering above their heads will saw it was a lush garden of some kind with creepers shrubs and blooms in sickeningly unnatural blues blacks and purples clustering around the low enclosing wall he forced his way through the vegetation to the edge and peered over a series of further gardens cascaded down the cliff into the mist far below in the distance he could just discern a black basalt tower thrusting up from the dense forest with a glowing orb on top of it it could only be the tower of the moon the beacon that kept open the way between worlds as he turned back he saw the others looking up to the sky it could have been on fire flames rolled out across the arc of the heavens the horizon burning a deep shade of crimson silhouetted against it manoa the unseelie courts city of gold seemed to transform will blinked attempting to comprehend what he was seeing for a moment the fortress appeared to be surrounded by massive circling grinding rings of iron was this the true form of that foul place he wondered as the fay hid their own ghastly appearance behind illusions of beauty all life is illusion dee had said if that was so what could they truly believe as the tolling of the bell boomed out into the burning sky shapes flooded out of the fortress and began to descend the cliff realization dawned on will and he yelled the hunters are coming we must flee now yet even as they raced to the edge of the balcony and searched for a way down another noise tore through the hot still air will frowned trying to place the origin of that teethjarring whistle and then he had it it was the sound made by the black stone mandraxas had whirled around his head in order to summon those flesheating predators the spreebirds barely had the thought come to him before a black cloud swept out of the fortress it circled for one moment and then swooped down the air was torn by the thunder of a multitude of wings and a shrieking as if hell had given up its lost souls chapter fiftyseven the seething roiling mass blotted out the fiery sky above manoa like a tropical storm the spreebirds swirled their shrill shrieks tearing across the treetops will glanced from the avian predators to the hunters swarming down the cliff face like angry ants spilling out of a disturbed nest he breathed in the acrid stink of burning and heard graces whispered prayer caught on the wind taut faces turned towards him only launceston seemed unruffled but then when all hope seemed to have departed he felt a surprising calm descend upon him he ran back to the dense vegetation edging the spacious stone balcony ignoring all the sounds of hell the cries of the bloodcrazed birds and the grim tolling of the bell and the grinding of revolving iron and studied the strange blooms and dry thorny bushes our steel will be of no use against those birds megs voice was ragged the others stood beside her and we cannot outrun them they will have the flesh from our bones in no time we could hide in the tunnel grace ventured of what use is that carpenter turned his back to them watching the skies as the black cloud wheeled above them they will come for us soon enough no better to make our stand here and die like men we are not finished yet john will said as he plunged into the vegetation and bounded on to the stone wall edging the balcony balancing on his precarious perch he snatched up a handful of trailing creeper and pulled hard testing its strength with a satisfied nod he said quick now take these and climb down to the garden below if fortune is with us we can make our way down to the ground they thought it a futile gesture he saw in their faces but they trusted him enough to comply grasping a vine carpenter went first seemingly uncaring if it snapped and he plunged to his death meg handed will her brand and blew him a kiss as she followed with launceston beside her grace and jenny looked down at the three spies suspended in the gulf above the next balcony and then exchanged a reassuring smile will bowed holding jennys gaze for one moment before the two sisters disappeared from view a shadow engulfed the balcony the shrieks of the spreebirds rang in his ears and he knew if he looked up he would see their skullheads and cruel beaks still stained with the blood of sanburne and his men will thrust the torch into the vegetation and the tinderdry bushes caught alight the thrashing of wings stirred his hair as the vermilion flames roared up he grabbed a vine and threw himself back over the low enclosure only then did he look up a wall of fire raced around the edge of the balcony black smoke billowed into the dense flock of birds so that it seemed like night as will had hoped the heat drove the vicious creatures back they screeched around in circles above the balcony frustrated that their prey had been denied them he squinted peering through the cloud at the hunters still far behind climbing down the sheer cliff some of the flock spotted will lowering himself down the creeper and swooped past the crackling bushes and shrubs coiling the vine round one arm he wrenched out his rapier and lashed the air a burst of black feathers and a spray of blood trailed in the sweep of his blade the skullheaded birds wheeled around him searching for an opening as he ripped through two more the other spreebirds swept in beaks like fine spanish steel stabbed into his flesh staining his undershirt brown with his blood pain seared through him but still he struck out the creeper jerked in his grasp and when he glanced up he saw flames licking at the top of it a moment later the vine snapped will hurtled down slamming into the hard dry soil of the garden below winded he watched the spreebirds circle before swooping down towards him flashing steel glinted in the ruddy light above him carpenter launceston and red meg hacked and slashed blood and feathers spraying across the vegetation will scrambled to his feet and looked up at the chaos overhead driven back by the heat and confused by the billowing black smoke most of the spreebirds had turned on the hunters tearing them apart as they crawled down the cliff face but it was only a momentary respite will knew there were too many of the fay stalkers and they were too relentless too brutal all around the dry vegetation was burning set alight by smouldering vines falling from above ordering the others over the side once more he followed them down swinging and falling to each new level of the hanging gardens until their joints burned and their chests were seared from the exertion and the flames leapt up the cascading balconies the pall of smoke obscuring the unseelie courts grim fortress a sea of grey mist washed over the treetops below the final garden the drop here was the longest will clambered down the vines first letting the last of them slip through his fingers long before he could see the ground branches battered his body as he fell he hit the softy loamy soil of the forest floor rolled and sprang to his feet every muscle burned the others rained down around him in a shower of shattered branch and twig and leaf once they were sure no bones had been broken they stopped and listened an eerie silence lay beneath the protective blanket of mist taking a deep draught of the hot humid air will advanced with slow careful steps blade at the ready a high stone wall stretching deep into the forest on either side appeared out of the folds of grey an arched opening loomed ahead of them this has to be the labyrinth that leads to the outside world jenny whispered at wills side i heard mandraxas tell of it many have been driven mad when they became lost in its depths as they sought to reach the riches of the city of gold or flee the horrors they found there as he looked around them will allowed himself a tight smile the message in the captains journal on the abandoned spanish galleon now made perfect sense he reached into the battered leather pouch at his side and pulled out the torn page reading again those scrawled words twice stare into the devils face then bow all heads to god thrice more the unholy must call again again again until the end two left turns then a right then three left turns count carefully this sequence must be repeated until we reach the other side the sound of crashing from above reached them through the mist he guessed the hunters were dropping from the cliff face into the treetops beckoning to the others he hurried through the arched door it was cooler in the deep shadow of the high stone walls and the six fugitives seemed to shudder as one the way was narrow barely more than a swordlength between the lichencrusted walls at least there is only space for those fiends to come at us one at a time carpenter growled as he ran stay close and watch your backs will called at each junction he mouthed the count to himself and so they twisted and turned deeper into the heart of the labyrinth soon the thump of feet on hardpacked earth rang off the walls their pursuers were closing fast will beckoned for meg to join him and slowed to whisper in her ear lead jenny and grace ahead and i beg of you do not stop whatever sounds you hear behind you i am as good with a blade as any man she replied her green eyes flashing better you know that i do which is why i entrust such valuable lives to your care the beautiful womans features softened very well but do not risk that handsome neck my love i still have plans to win your heart blowing him a silent kiss she waved the two other women ahead once they had disappeared along a branching path will said we take turns to hold the rear when we tire we make way for a fresh arm yes the other two spies nodded their faces grim the footsteps at their backs now echoed with the relentless rhythm of driving rain on wood steel scraped on stone will wiped a trickle of blood from his nose trying to imagine how many were in pursuit after a moment he pushed the thought aside it was not good to dwell upon such things left left right left left left the high stone walls sped by in a monotonous blur will found it impossible to tell if they were close to exiting the labyrinth or still meandering in the centre the feeling of iron nails rattling in his skull alerted him a moment before launcestons hissed warning glancing back he glimpsed a bloodless face floating in the gloom the unflinching gaze fell upon him out of the murk the hunter bounded like a wolf silver hair streaming behind him his hollow chest was bare with leather belts strapped across it his breeches grey and loamstained clutched in the long thin fingers of his right hand was a glinting sickle other shadowy figures loped behind wills chest burned as he stepped up his pace snatched looks caught flashes of steel and bared teeth and the ghastly figure looming closer with each step launceston held the rear seemingly oblivious of the thing drawing close to his back when the sickle swung towards his neck the aristocrat ducked at the last moment as the curved blade whistled over his head he half spun and plunged his sword into the hunters right eye socket the fay spun backwards in silence trailing a stream of bloody liquor his fallen corpse slowed the progress of the pursuers behind but it would not be for long will knew within moments launceston had slashed his blade across another face before allowing carpenter to drop back and impale a third hunter upon his rapier blood spattered from wounds on both spies when carpenter had despatched another will moved swiftly to the rear a wall of snarling faces hovered before him as the predators pressed forward sheer weight of numbers eliminating the advantage the three spies had maintained in the cramped space gritting his teeth he whirled his rapier back and forth peeling open white flesh in an arc bodies fell with each thrust but the hunters cared little about their own lives he saw for a moment his vision swam with those hideous faces as the stink of their meaty breath washed over him he knew his time was done determined that he would not go down to hell alone he snatched one final thrust with his blade then waited for the wave to break upon him instead he felt a hand grab his shirt and pull him back so hard his feet left the ground will lay sprawled across the hard earth shafts of sunlight punched through a canopy of leaves rustling high overhead lurching to his feet he saw it was carpenter who had dragged him from certain death for that moment at least he was out of the labyrinth in a clearing in the dense forest grace jenny and meg huddled together at the edge of the trees launceston waited nearby his rapier point dripping gore anger born of desperation surged inside him why were they not running but then he followed their gaze and turned to face a vast arc of hunters a grey army with more still flooding out from the labyrinth silently they waited a thunderstorm about to break all hope was gone now there was only time for dying chapter fiftyeight stay your ground i am your queen jennys voice rang out across the still clearing suddenly imperious commanding holding her head high she broke away from the others and strode out from the shadows to face the line of waiting hunters wills chest tightened he watched the fay wondering if they would heed her words or fall upon her first in their cruel white faces their eyes looked like chunks of coal after a moment he realized they were not going to attack but nor were they retreating jenny he whispered his voice hoarse take no risks i beg you when she turned her face towards him he almost cried out at the sadness he saw there she forced a smile there is no risk here my love they will not harm their queen as long as i remain their queen upon the soil they call their own will felt a chill run through him as the meaning of her words slowly settled on him no he whispered you cannot i will not allow it we were lost the moment your fellow slew mandraxas she said in a soft desolate voice still smiling in an attempt to soften his pain there is another way he protested there must be jenny his jenny shook her head glancing back at the cold ranks of the fay if i walk with you into the human world i abdicate the throne and they will destroy us in an instant all of us doomed if i return at least i can ensure you leave with your life all of you her voice rose and she looked at grace including my sister whom i treasure more than life itself adding so quietly he could barely hear it as i treasure you i will not allow this sacrifice will protested clenching a fist impotently ah but it is not for you to say she swallowed there is more at stake here than you and i we are as nothing compared to the devastation that would be wrought on all men by an unseelie court bent on avenging that which you we have meted out to their true queen and now their king then let all the world be damned he uttered his voice breaking if i could walk away with you i could live with the world burning around us no she interjected quietly you could not i would sacrifice anything for one more day with you no jenny repeated you would not though your heart were shattered into a thousand pieces i saw inside you on that very first day we walked together will swyfte i know your true worth perhaps more than any other person you call friend or lover i see how the suffering of your last few years has formed a callus around you but the good man within remains unchanged you cannot return will whispered his despair growing not now that i have found you again jenny took his bloodencrusted hand in her cool fingers and i have found you again she murmured i remember everything i feel all that i felt on that day i was stolen from you if there was some way we could be together i would seize it with both hands but mandraxass death could unleash a hell upon earth if i can prevent that i will you truly think the fay will obey a mortal they must i am their queen and how long before you meet the same fate as mandraxas a dagger in the night poison will felt his eyes sting with tears i am no weak child i will keep my wits about me at all times and watch the shadows and find allies and plot and scheme as befits a true monarch his lost love said narrowing her eyes when he saw the defiance in her face will recognized a steel he had not encountered before and i will keep heads spinning and encourage factions and machinations and ruses so that the unseelie court will have no time to look out into the world of men for they will be consumed by themselves how long jenny he felt hollow numb she blanched but kept a brave face as long as i can i will not allow this he cried snatching up his rapier from where it had fallen anger and despair roared through him he only had eyes for the cursed fay who still had their talons embedded in the one thing he valued as he lunged towards them launceston and carpenter grabbed his arms and struggled to hold him back would you rather we all died here and now the earl whispered what good would that do listen to her will carpenter added with surprising tenderness her heart is breaking but she does this for a greater good she shames us all with her strength still struggling will blinked away hot tears of anguish until grace stepped in front of him and held his face in her hands she leaned in filling his vision and holding his attention tears streamed down her cheeks too no one wants jenny home more than i she whispered not even you and it will destroy me by degrees to know she is a prisoner in this land of horrors though it is terrible to us both you know in your heart that what my sister suggests is the right course think of the lives that will be saved will jenny is right all of us mean nothing compared to that and you can live with that he snapped as i have for these last fifteen years but now i know that she still lives though we are separated by oceans by worlds by time itself i know and i will carry her in my heart for as long as i live and never lose hope that one day we will brave the terrors of this place once more and bring her back to where she is loved and cherished we will bring her home i promise she sucked in a deep breath to stifle a sob you must let her go will he steadied himself wondering how it could be that these two women were stronger than all of them running a hand through his hair he nodded and moved to stand in front of jenny it felt as if sadness must fill every part of her but still she smiled for his sake and that broke his heart it seems you have won this battle of wits he said grinning for her sake her eyes sparkled as she held his gaze for a long moment no words were necessary then slowly her face hardened with the weight of her responsibility she glanced up to the heavens you know what you must do his chest tightened he understood it was what he had long planned but with all of them free and sailing home to england never like this no he said i cannot leaving you behind is torment enough if we are meant to be together will swyfte we will find a way it felt too final as if he were consigning her to the cold earth but he knew she would never change her mind no ocean is too wide no walls too strong no danger too great i will be back for you jenny with trembling fingers he felt under his shirt for the locket he had worn against his skin since deortha had first dropped it in order to lure him here removing it he gently fastened it round her slim neck as he had done that day when they had sealed their love so long ago wear this as i wore it to remind you never to lose hope cradle it in your hands every night and know that i will be searching for a way back to you know that one day we will be together again her eyes glistened bowing he took her hand and kissed the back of it when he raised his head they held each others gaze as they struggled to suppress all the hurt and the yearning and then he took a step back and nodded soon he said soon she replied she closed her eyes for a moment and slowly her face transformed into that of a ruler a queen then she turned away from will from her sister from meg carpenter and launceston and walked back towards the labyrinth heads bowed in deference the hunters parted to let her through and then turned to follow her will watched until he could see her no more when grace reached out a hand to comfort him he shook his head we are done here he said each word rolling out like a pebble falling upon wood but this is not yet over taking his bearings he ignored the questioning gazes and moved to the trees looking up he caught a glimpse of their destination through a gap in the canopy and broke into a run by force of will he drove all his churning emotions deep inside him completing the task hed set himself was now his sole aim a memorial to jenny the tower of the moon soared up through the trees a cold sliver of grey stone with a bright white light burning at the summit at its base he halted to catch his breath and waited for the others meg was the first to arrive whatever plan has gripped you take care i fear for you her voice was warm with concern you worry needlessly he replied his face betraying no emotion stay here and ensure our enemy does not have a change of heart where do you go in reply he simply raised his hand and pointed to the top of the tower high overhead before the others had caught up and could question him further he began to circle the base of the structure as far as he could tell there was no entrance only a series of stone footholds barely a fingers length wide protruded from the walls spiralling up towards the top setting down his rapier he took off his boots to get a better grip and hauled himself on to the lowest step pressing himself tight against the wall he felt for small clefts that seemed to have been made as fingerholds the others called out urging him not to risk such a precarious climb but his head felt numb and their words faded away gingerly he shifted his weight from one step to the next and then the next as he clawed his way around the tower his nose wrinkled at the smell of the warm stone against his cheek and the wetwood aromas of the forest and the hint of brine on the breeze blowing in from the coast sweat slicked his body in the days heat he balanced on the precarious footholds clutching on to the wall until his finger joints screamed with pain when he sensed the quality of light change as he rose above the treetops the birdcries rang in his ears as the shadows swooped across him and higher still he climbed into a world of grey stone blue sky and golden sunlight he felt the suck of the dizzying drop as the wind tugged at his limbs and the queasy twist in the pit of his stomach but not for a moment did he look down his legs and arms shook the slightest misstep would send him plunging to his death but then a soft white glow enveloped him and he realized he was nearing the summit a moment later he hauled himself over the edge and rolled on to his back filling his tight chest with clear sweet and untainted air he blinked unable to see the sky any more for the moonlike luminescence yet it was not a harsh light he felt as though he was swathed in down something about this strange light reached inside him and plucked at his grief and for a moment he felt overwhelmed by the sense of loss and despair he shook himself gritted his teeth and clambered to his feet he would not give in the top of the tower was flat and fixed upon it was an iron plinth topped by a bluegreen copper bowl in it what seemed like a glass sphere the distance of fingertip to elbow in diameter floated an inch above the surface turning slowly it was from this that the white light washed out will leaned over it studying the gently pulsing light but as he reached a hand across the bowl the light wavered then dimmed now was the moment steeling himself he gripped the glass globe between his hands his skin tingled at its strange almost living fleshlike warmth one act to change the world he thought one act to save england one act to break his heart and he wrenched the sphere away from the bowl in a fizz of golden sparks and in a single movement hurled it over the edge of the tower the soothing pale light swept down in the globes wake and he was left with a view across that verdant corner of the new world and the shadowy world beyond a veil appeared to be hanging above the labyrinth from horizon to horizon through the shimmering haze he could just discern the black bulk of manoa still turning against a fiery sky but as he watched the mist slipped away and with it all sight of the unseelie courts strange twisted world the door upon the fay had been slammed shut in their crepuscular land cut off from the realm of man the unseelie court could scheme and fight among themselves until the stars fell from the heavens and what few of the damnable fey still moved among mortals would be lost here will heaved in a deep breath still peering towards the blue horizon as though he could pierce that veil by will alone and he blinked away the tears and somewhere the loneliest woman in all christendom sat upon a golden throne trapped in a world not her own and without end jenny had given up everything to save this world and beyond the few of them there no one would ever know of her courage her sacrifice shamed them all will shielded his eyes this would not be an end he vowed silently i am coming back to get you jenny he whispered though all the hordes of hell stand in my way though oceans swell and conflagrations rage i will find a way to reach you and i will finally bring you home for another moment he waited caught in the mournful cry of the gulls and then he began to make his way down to earth chapter fiftynine sapphire ghostlights shimmered around the masts of the galleon tossing on heavy seas towards england on the forecastle dr john dee alchemist scholar and spy stretched out his arms to the lowering sky and muttered his incantations the heavens crashed in response sheets of white lightning flickered along the western horizon the long night was coming to an end wind lashed his silver hair but he stood like an oak against the rising gale and fixed his stony gaze upon the greygreen smudge of land ahead if war was coming he would not turn away come hell or high water he would drive those devils out of england on the main deck bloody jack courtenay roared with laughter as the storm swirled around him and the crew bellowed their songs of death and blood and wine and women the tempest heaved across the turbulent waters towards home louder and louder still dee howled his invocation until his throat was raw and his ears rang but then shafts of sunlight punched through the thick bank of grey cloud to illuminate the green fields of england and for a moment he thought he saw a multitude of shadows take to the air like a murder of crows flee he thought with a grim smile flee and never return the wind dropped the thunder rolled away and the galleon sailed into calm waters on the quayside at greenwich sir walter raleigh waited the silver thread in his jerkin ashimmer in the morning sun doctor he boomed in greeting as dee strode down the plank on to dry land you have been sorely missed i have not missed you you preening popinjay the alchemist barked now let us away to london there is still desperate work to be done we are not out of deep water yet the two men climbed into the waiting carriage and as it trundled on to the rutted road leading west the adventurer recounted his tale cecil is a fool he muttered and a prideful one at that though it opened the door to disaster he refused all aid from the school of night and sent me away from the palace the price has been high many have died during the long siege her majesty she is safe for now but i fear cecil would sacrifice even her rather than give up his hold on power dee nodded he is a dangerous man and desperate with it he will never turn his back on his dark games of deceit and treachery though we now face a new age and a better one in all hope we must see what we can do he will not rest until the school of night is broken on his rack raleigh said we have a long fight upon our hands we always have had and always will the older man replied the adventurer leaned in close his face darkening we should all watch our backs i fear cecil will go to any lengths now he has already vowed to see swyfte dead should he set foot upon english soil again dees face hardened then let us make haste the carriage clattered through the gates of the palace of whitehall in the warmth of the afternoon sun as the alchemist clambered down he cast one eye to the top of the lantern tower all was still the faerie queen would enjoy her grim cell for a while yet once raleigh had departed dee strode through the dusty echoing halls sensing the wretched atmosphere that hung over all guards leaned on their pikes faces drawn the sour reek of sweat pervaded the silent galleries the court clustered together for safety in the halls surrounding the innermost ward where the queens own chambers lay the blackrobed privy councillors drifted around whispering and ashenfaced as they waited for yet another futile meeting to begin as the queens sorcerer entered the hall eyes looked up in shock and a slow murmuring begin to spread outwards growing louder until it broke into a resounding cheer dee glowered at them all fools he thought you are your own worst enemies he glimpsed cecil watching him through the throng as conflicted as ever relief and loathing struggled for supremacy in the spymasters features dee had a long night of incantations and spellcasting ahead of him in order to shore up englands beleaguered defences but first he had more pressing business he pushed through the pathetically grateful courtiers and strode towards a young man who had arrived to investigate the tumult dee saw in an instant the worry etched into the face of swyftes faithful assistant nathaniel colt sensing news the crowd fell silent in order to hear what the old man had to say kind words rarely came to the alchemists lips but he felt bound to summon them your master yet lives and if the gods are willing he will be home soon dees spindly hand clutched the young mans shoulder pray for his safe return the perils facing him are great indeed but albion has never had a sword like will swyfte and perhaps never will again this was a message that would reach far beyond the fellows ears he knew nathaniel smiled with relief stuttering his thanks dee glanced around and saw cecil glowering he bared his teeth at the spymaster then bellowed to the crowd clear the way i have important news for the queen alone chapter sixty london was aglow in the late autumn sun the elms and cherry trees shimmered with golds oranges and browns along the garden walks of the palace of whitehall the air was smoky from new fires stoked against the growing chill while the gardeners pruned the dead heads off the roses and cut back the woodbine ahead of the festivities to come will paused at the end of the avenue and raised his eyes to the lightningblasted spire of st pauls to the east it was where the beacon used to be lit whenever the realm came under threat from the unseelie court he allowed himself a brief smile of satisfaction near six months had passed since he had made his vow on the tower of the moon yet he found he could recall it in his mind as if it were yesterday a new door had opened that day on to a new world a new future he wore his best black and silver doublet and had bought a new velvet cap for the celebrations nathaniel too had dressed in the closest he had to finery a plain green doublet and brown cloak though will felt the young mans angry expression rather spoiled the effect they are a foul collection of disloyal untrustworthy claybrained joltheads the young assistant muttered kicking his way through the carpet of dry leaves why nat is that any way to speak of her majestys most senior advisers will replied with a wry smile you have risked life and limb in constant service to our queen and country and now they treat you with such ignominy dismissed no recognition for all you have achieved no pomp no ceremony sent back to warwickshire it is not the ends of the earth nat and my pension will ensure i want for nothing while i slip into a life of serenity i know you nathaniel grumbled the boredom will be the end of you you will be drunk or mad within days he eyed will more drunk more mad ah nat where would i be without your constant flattery in truth the decision to dispense with his services had not surprised him when he and the others had arrived back in england on the galleon despatched under dees direction he had served his purpose the realm was intent on looking to the future and he was only a reminder of unpleasant times cutting through the walkways between the palaces grand halls the two men arrived at the tiltyard as a fiddle player in doublet and galligaskin breeches of crimson satin tuned his instrument servants scurried here and there with platters of meat bread and cheese others suspended flags of red and yellow above the white tent that the queen would occupy none of them knew the true reason for the celebration will realized thinking it was little more than another diversion like the coming accession day tilt in november but the queen herself and all her privy councillors would be united in their private festivities and the belief that the dark days were finally over through the throng will glimpsed grace walking with the other ladiesinwaiting towards the monarchs chambers she was a picture of prettiness her hair was tied with a bow of eggshell blue that matched her skirts and will was pleased to see her laughing for a moment their eyes locked the bond between them was stronger than it ever had been forged by determination and hope not loss never loss in private they plotted and dreamed of ways of crossing a gulf greater than any ocean of breaking down the walls of hell then returning home in joy and triumph she never spoke of strangewayes and will suspected she never would once she had moved on will and nathaniel strolled to where carpenter and launceston were bickering in the shade of an oak tree while they swigged on flasks of sack wrapped in a scarlet hooded cloak red meg pretended to ignore them though they had all found some common ground in the hot days they had shared waiting to be rescued from the new world carpenter looked up as will and nathaniel arrived tell this beslubbering beetleheaded flapdragon i no longer need to be watched like a troublesome child now that the unseelie court are in no position to stir the foul thing that still resides within me launceston raised a single eyebrow eyeing those who milled around them i watch you because you are an accident waiting to happen with or without your foul passenger he breathed carpenter jabbed a finger at the other man you are just trying to pay me back for all the days i had to prevent you from slaughtering for sport are you the pot or the kettle i forget let them be married soon and be done with it meg sighed will bowed mistress oshee you have found better lodgings than the tower i hear your master feels i may have some knowledge which could aid him with his difficulties in my homeland shrugging she gave a sardonic smile why i may be able to spin this out for many a month before he discovers that although i am many things i am no traitor and then i may seek you out in warwickshire master swyfte for as you know i am not easily deterred your company will be welcome as always good meg nathaniel tugged at his masters sleeve and pointed towards a black carriage waiting at the end of the tiltyard standing beside its open door dr dee glared at them swaddled in his cloak of animal pelts we will make merry later my friends will said first i must take a draught of vinegar he strode over to the carriage a broad grin on his lips in the knowledge that it would irritate the queens brooding conjurer finally he said his voice brimming with cheer you are as elusive as marsh lights i have hunted you up hill and down dale since morning you find me when i choose to be found the alchemist growled i have been summoned back to manchester the queen insists i maintain the post of warden of christs college it appears i am an embarrassment in this fine new world a reminder of the terrible compromises we all made during the long struggle this world is changing will shrugged now the threat of the unseelie court has been driven back into the shadows a new dawn is breaking or new threats may appear with clawlike hands dee tugged his cloak tighter around him the fellows of the college wish to consult me on a troubling matter which they feel is a good fit for my area of expertise the demonic possession of seven children yes the unseelie court may be gone for now but there are devils and there are devils and do not forget it the alchemist glanced around him and when he was sure they could not be overheard he whispered you have it will nodded from under his cloak he pulled at a small object wrapped in a black velvet cloth he thought he could hear the obsidian mirror sing to him with stories of jenny appearing in the glass whispering words of love an illusion like so many things as promised he said offering the looking glass to the older man did cecil not insist this be delivered to his door so his wise men could endeavour to unlock its powers for the benefit of england one cannot trust governments or authorities of any kind the alchemist snorted that would be as foolish as trusting men this looking glass will be conveniently lost until i can find the time or the inclination to probe its secrets once more it is not too dangerous no secrets are too dangerous dee replied with a tight smile we risk all for knowledge it is the sunlit hill on which we build our dreams he allowed himself a brief smile before his features darkened and speaking of devils will glanced back in the direction of the alchemists glower and saw sir robert cecil coming towards them with his rolling gait two blackrobed advisers following at a safe distance nathaniel had noticed the new arrivals too and was hurrying over ready to defend his master should the need arise beware of him swyfte there is much poison in his fangs the alchemists tone was not unkind that is not news doctor will eyed the spymaster and felt the cold weight of all the lies and the betrayals that had cost him so many years of his life and jenny but he had long since decided not to let that wretched past taint his days to come this would be a fresh start for all of them then consider this the alchemist continued his hired blade was all but ready to slit your throat the moment you arrived in tilbury and yet that rogue was found floating in the thames with the butchers offal how strange will and dee exchanged a sly glance then i owe the school of night my life the spy said more than that as you will soon discover my friends in our society now have some influence with the queen herself but there has been a high price to pay then i thank you too doctor for all you have done for me i hope we will never meet again swyfte dee grumbled but i doubt the course of my life will ever run so smoothly as cecil approached he climbed into the carriage and shut the door knocking on the roof to urge the driver to move away when the spymaster arrived will bowed so deeply that it could only be considered a taunt sir robert how fares the queens eyesintheshadows keep your sharp tongue in your mouth master swyfte cecils eyes narrowed but only for a moment and then his gaze flickered elsewhere his expression a combination of embarrassment and annoyance it seems the decision to end your employment was rash i was of course preoccupied with the troubling business in the low countries and had no notice of this affair until the papers had already been issued but know that the offending secretary has been reprimanded most forcefully i must add and that the matter has now been resolved as nathaniel joined them will raised one eyebrow at the spymasters bluster and lies then your signature and seal was a forgery a conspiracy reaches to the very heart of englands security why tis good i am away from this intrigue sir robert for if we cannot trust those in highest office we are all at risk the queens little elf glared knowing he had no choice but to allow the other man his moment will held out his hands and yet i have those papers and my stipend and warwickshire has many comforts at this time of year damn you swyfte cecil flushed the queen herself has requested your continued service even you cannot refuse her majesty the queen you say will glanced in the direction of dees trundling carriage i have kept her majesty aware of your many successes the spymaster said attempting to flatter though his expression was sullen and she found your recent exploits in the new world of particular interest you tweaked the beard of the devil himself master swyfte and returned from hell to tell the tale any man who can achieve such a thing must surely be needed in the queens service he paused moistening his lips will thought he saw a flicker of unease in his eyes particularly in the turbulent times that lie ahead why perhaps my master is englands greatest spy after all nathaniel said his nose in the air cecil looked daggers at him but will cut in what are these turbulent times you speak of while we dwelt on our allconsuming struggle with the unseelie court other shadows were moving beyond our attention a strong wind blew whipping the dry leaves into gold and brown waves cecil shivered in venice across the course of this last month six of our agents have been found floating in the canals at dawn eviscerated as if set upon by a wild beast there is talk of an english spy turned traitor a young man with fiery red hair who has spoken widely of his hatred for one will swyfte strangewayes could it be that he had somehow escaped manoa before the way closed and now scarred by his failure was seeking revenge for all that he had lost in muscovy cecil continued oblivious of wills ruminations the court of the mad tsar is gripped with fear at tales that the dead have risen from the frozen earth mongols from the horde that swept across their land in times gone by and in the far orient in china comes word of something darker still a plague of devils the words caught in his throat as he eyed nathaniel but that is a discussion for another time he watched wills eyes for a long moment and then smiled tightly at what he saw there very well assemble your men swyfte and await further orders when the spymaster had departed nathaniel sighed i suppose this means i must unpack your boxes of doublets cloaks and shoes which only this hour i had finished packing no rest for you nat and none it seems for the swords of albion will replied with a grin as he watched the young man walk away his thoughts abandoned whitehall and london and journeyed across the world venice muscovy china one true road ran through all of them from every fiend he encountered he would prise the knowledge he required until he had found the key he needed to unlock that way between worlds and then jenny he whispered to the wind i will come to fetch you home and no man nor devil will stand in my way for a moment he waited there alone in the golden autumn light remembering and then he turned back towards the throng there would be blood he knew and strife and there would be an ending but not this day
