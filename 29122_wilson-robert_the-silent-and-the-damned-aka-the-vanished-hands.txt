robert wilson the silent and the damned aka the vanished hands javier falcon for jane and josé and mick ha ha what a fool honesty is and trust his sworn brother a very simple gentleman shakespeare the winters tale fear is the foundation of most governments john adams second president of the united states rafael blinking in the dark i am frightened i have no physical reason for fear lying here in bed next to lucia with my little mario yipping in his sleep next door but i am scared my dreams have scared me except they are not dreams any more they are more alive than that the dreams are of faces just faces i dont think i know them and yet i have strange moments when im on the brink of recognizing them but its as if they dont want that right now thats when i wake up because i am not being accurate again they are not exactly faces they are not flesh they are more ghostly than real but they do have features they have colour but it is not solid they just miss being human thats it they just miss being human is that a clue if i am frightened by these faces i should be reluctant to go to bed but sometimes i look forward to sleep and i realize its because i want to know the answer theres a key somewhere in my mind which will unlock the door and tell me why these faces why not any others what is it about them that my mind has marked out i have begun to see them quite clearly now during the day when my conscious mind is adrift in some way my subconscious moulds these faces on to living people so i see the phantom faces animated for a moment until the real people reassert themselves they leave me feeling foolish and shaken like an old man with names on the tip of my tongue but unable to articulate i am shivering thats what my mind can do to me im cracking up ive been sleepwalking lucia told me when i was in the shower she said i went down to my study at three in the morning later that day i found a blank pad on the desk i saw the indent of some handwriting i couldnt find the original i took it to the window and saw that it was something i had written the thin air chapter wednesday th july i want my mummy i want my mummy consuelo jiménez opened her eyes to a childs face only centimetres from her own which lay half buried in the pillow her eyelashes scratched the cotton slip the childs fingers grabbed at the flesh of her upper arm i want my mummy all right mario lets go and find mummy she said thinking this is too early for anybody you know shes only just across the street dont you you can stay here with matías have some breakfast play a little i want my mummy the childs fingers dug into her arm with some urgency and she stroked his hair and kissed him on the forehead she didnt want to cross the street in her night clothes like some workingclass woman needing something from the shops but the child was tugging at her wheedling she slipped on a white silk dressing gown over her cotton pyjamas and fitted her feet into some gold sandals she ran her hands through her hair while mario sheafed her dressing gown and started hauling her away like some stevedore down at the docks taking his hand she led him down the stairs one at a time they left the chill of the airconditioned house and the heat even this early in the morning was solid and unwavering with not even a lick of freshness from the dawn after another oppressive night she crossed the empty street palm trees hung limp and frazzled as if sleep had not come easily to this neighbourhood the only sound out on the tarmac came from the air conditioners fans blowing more hot unwanted air into the suffocating atmosphere of the exclusive neighbourhood of santa clara on the outskirts of seville water dripped from a split unit on a high balcony of the vegas house as she half dragged mario whod become suddenly cumbersome and difficult as if hed changed his mind about his mummy the drips clattered on the leaves of the abundant vegetation the sound thick as blood in the hideous heat sweat beaded on consuelos forehead she felt nauseous at the thought of the rest of the day the heat building on weeks of torrid weather she keyed in the code number on the pad by the outer gate and stepped into the driveway mario ran to the house and pushed against the front door bumping his head against the woodwork she rang the doorbell whose electronic chime sounded like a distant cathedral bell in the silent doubleglazed house no answer a trickle of sweat found its way between her breasts mario pounded the door with his small fist which made the sound of a dull ache persistent as chronic grief it was just after eight in the morning she licked at the sweat forming on her top lip the maid arrived at the gate she had no keys sra vega was normally awake early she said they heard the gardener an ukrainian called sergei digging at the side of the house they startled him and he gripped his mattock like a weapon until he saw the two women sweat careened down his pectorals and the ridges of muscle on his naked torso to his shorts he had been working since am and had heard nothing as far as he knew the car was still in the garage consuelo left mario with the maid and took sergei to the back of the house he climbed up on to the verandah outside the sitting room and peered through the sliding doors and blinds the doors were locked he climbed over the railing of the verandah and leaned across to look in the kitchen window which was raised above the garden his head started back with shock what is it asked consuelo i dont know he said sr vega lying on the floor he not moving consuelo took the maid and mario back across the street to her house the child knew that things were not right and started to cry the maid could not console him and he fought his way out of her arms consuelo made the call zeronineone she lit a cigarette and tried to concentrate while she looked at the helpless maid hovering over the child whod thrown a tantrum and was now a writhing thrashing animal on the floor howling himself to silence consuelo reported the incident to the telephone centre at the jefatura gave her name address and contact number she slammed the phone down and went to the child took his kicks and thumps and pulled him to her held him against her and whispered his name over and over in his ear until he went limp she put him in her bed upstairs got dressed and called the maid to come and keep an eye on him mario slept consuelo looked at him intently as she brushed her hair the maid sat on the corner of the bed unhappy at being caught up in somebody elses tragedy knowing that it would infect her own life a patrol car pulled up in the street outside the vegas house consuelo went out to meet the policeman and took him to the back of the house where he climbed up on to the verandah he asked her where the gardener had gone she walked down the lawn to a small building at the bottom where sergei had his quarters he wasnt there she went back to the house the policeman hammered on the kitchen window and then radioed information back to the jefatura he climbed down from the verandah do you know where sra vega is he asked she should be in there thats where she was last night when i called her to tell her that her son would stay the night with my boys said consuelo why were you knocking on the window no sense in smashing the door down if hes just drunk and fallen asleep on the floor drunk theres a bottle on the floor next to his body ive known him for years and ive never seen him incapable never maybe hes different when hes on his own so what have you done about it said consuelo the testy madrilena trying to keep her shrillness down in front of the more relaxed style of the local policeman an ambulance was dispatched as soon as you made your call and now the inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios has been notified one moment hes drunk and the next hes been murdered theres a body lying on the floor said the patrolman annoyed with her now hes not moving and hes not responding to noise i have dont you think you should try and get in there and see if hes still alive hes not moving or responding but he might still be breathing indecision flitted across the patrolmans face he was saved by the arrival of the ambulance between them the paramedics and the patrolman found that the house was completely sealed back and front more cars arrived outside the front of the house inspector jefe javier falcón had finished his breakfast and was sitting in his study in the centre of his enormous inherited eighteenthcentury house in sevilles old city he was finishing his coffee and looking at the manual to a digital camera hed bought a week ago the glass door of the study opened on to the patio the thick walls and traditional design of the house meant that air conditioning was rarely needed water trickled in the marble fountain without distracting him his powers of concentration had come back to him after a turbulent year in his personal life his mobile vibrated on the desk he sighed as he answered it this was the time for dead bodies to be discovered he walked out into the cloister around the patio and leant against one the pillars supporting the gallery above he listened to the blunt facts stripped of any tragedy and went back into his study he wrote down an address santa clara it didnt sound like a place where anything bad could happen he put the mobile in the pocket of his chinos picked up his car keys and went to open up the colossal wooden doors to his house he drove his seat out between the orange trees flanking the entrance and went back to close the doors the air conditioning blasted into his chest he set off down the narrow cobbled streets and broke out into the plaza del museo de bellas artes with its high trees surrounded by white and ochre facades and the terracotta brick of the museum he came out of the old city heading for the river and cut right on to avenida del torneo the vague outlines of calatravas harp bridge were visible in the distance through the mornings haze he swung away from it and into the new city grinding through the streets and buildings around the santa justa station he headed out past the endless highrise blocks of the avenida de kansas city thinking about the exclusive barrio where he was heading the garden city of santa clara had been planned by the americans to quarter their officers after the strategic air command base was established near seville following francos signing of the defense pact of some of the bungalows retained their s aspect others had been hispanicized and a few owned by the wealthy had been torn down and rebuilt from scratch into palatial mansions as far as falcón remembered none of these changes had quite managed to rid the area of a pervasive unreality it was to do with the houses being on their individual plots of land together but isolated which was not a spanish phenomenon but rather like a suburban american estate it was also unlike the rest of seville almost eerily quiet falcón parked in the shade of some overhanging greenery outside the modern house on calle frey francisco de pareja despite the terracotta brick facade and some ornate touches it had the solidity of a fortress he forced his foot not to falter at the first man he saw as he walked through the gate juez de guardia esteban calderón the duty judge he hadnt worked with calderón for over a year but that history was still fresh they shook hands clapped each other on the shoulder he was astonished to find that the woman standing next to the judge was consuelo jiménez who was a part of that same history she was different from the middleclass woman hed met the year before when hed investigated her husbands murder her hair was now loose and with a more modern cut and she wore less makeup and jewellery he couldnt understand what she was doing here the paramedics went back to their ambulance and pulled out a stretcher on a trolley falcón shook hands with the médico forense and the judges secretary while calderón asked the patrolman if there was any evidence of breaking and entering the patrolman gave his report consuelo jiménez was fascinated by the new javier falcón the inspector jefe was not wearing his trademark suit he wore chinos and a white shirt with the sleeves rolled up to just below the elbows he looked younger with his grey hair cut very short a uniform length all over perhaps it was his seasonal style but she didnt think so falcón was feeling the weight of her interest he disguised his unease by introducing another of his officers subinspector perez there was a moment of nervous confusion in which perez moved off youre wondering what im doing here she said i live across the street i discovered the i was with the gardener when he discovered sr vega lying on the kitchen floor but i thought you bought a house in heliopolis well technically it was raúl who bought the house in heliopolis before he died she said he wanted to be near his beloved bétis stadium and i have no interest in football and how long have you been living here nearly a year and you discovered the body the gardener did and we dont know that hes dead yet does anybody keep a spare set of keys i doubt it she said id better take a look at the body said falcón sr vega was lying on his back his dressing gown and pyjamas had come off his shoulders and were constricting his arms his chest was bare and there seemed to be abrasions on the pectorals and abdomen he had scratch marks at his throat the mans face was pale and looked hard the lips were grey and yellowish falcón went back to juez calderón and the médico forense he looks dead to me but perhaps youd like to take a look before we break down one of the doors he said do we know where his wife is consuelo explained the situation again i think we have to go in said falcón you might have a job on your hands said sra jiménez lucia had new windows put in before last winter theyre double glazed with bulletproof glass and that front door if its properly locked youd be better off going through solid wall you know this house a woman appeared in the driveway she was difficult to miss because she had red hair green eyes and skin so white it was painful to look at in the brutality of the sunlight hola consuelo she said homing in on her amongst all the official faces hola maddy said consuelo who introduced her to everybody as madeleine krugman sra vegas next door neighbour is there something wrong with lucia or rafael i saw the ambulance can i do anything all eyes were on madeleine krugman and not just because she spoke spanish with an american accent she was tall and slender with a full bust an unstarved bottom and the innate ability to give dull men extravagant imaginations only falcón and calderón had sufficient testosterone control to be able to look her in the eye and that required concentration consuelos nostrils flared with irritation we need to get into this house very urgently sra krugman said calderón do you have a set of keys i dont but whats the matter with rafael and lucia rafaels lying on the kitchen floor not moving said consuelo we dont know about lucia madeleine krugmans short intake of breath revealed a straight line of white teeth broken only by two sharp incisors for a fraction of a second the invisible plates in the lithosphere of her face seemed to spasm i have the telephone number of his lawyer he gave it to me in case there was a problem with the house while they were on holiday she said ill have to go back home she backed away and then turned to the gate all eyes fastened on to her rump which shivered slightly under the white linen of her flared trousers a thin red belt like a line of blood encircled her waist she disappeared behind the wall male noises which had been suspended under the bell jar of her glamour resumed shes very beautiful isnt she said consuelo jiménez annoyed at her own need to draw attention back to herself yes said falcón and quite different to the beauty were accustomed to around here white translucent yes said consuelo shes very white do we know where the gardener is he asked hes disappeared what do we know about him his name is sergei she said hes russian or ukrainian we share him the vegas the krugmans pablo ortega and me pablo ortega the actor asked calderón yes hes just moved here she said hes not very happy that doesnt surprise me of course it was you wasnt it juez calderón who put his son in jail for twelve years said consuelo terrible case that terrible but i didnt mean that when i said although im sure thats a contributing factor theres a problem with his house and he finds the area a bit dead after living in the centre of town why did he move asked falcón nobody in the barrio would talk to him any more because of what his son did said falcón i dont remember this case ortegas son kidnapped an eightyearold boy said calderón he tied him up and abused him over several days but didnt kill him asked falcón the boy escaped said calderón in fact it was stranger than that said consuelo ortegas son released him and then sat on the bed in the soundproofed room hed prepared for the kidnap and waited for the police to arrive he was lucky they got to him first they say hes having a hard time of it in prison said calderón i cant find any pity for people who destroy the innocence of children said consuelo savagely they deserve everything they get madeleine krugman returned with the telephone number she was now wearing sunglasses as if protecting herself from her own painful whiteness no name said falcón punching the number into his mobile my husband says his name is carlos vázquez and wheres your husband at home when did sr vega give you this number before he went to join lucia and mario on holiday last summer is mario the child who slept at your house last night sra jiménez yes do the vegas have any family in the seville area lucias parents falcón broke away from the group and asked to speak to the lawyer i am inspector jefe javier falcón he said your client sr rafael vega is lying on his kitchen floor incapacitated possibly dead we need to get into his house a long silence while vázquez digested this devastating news ill be there in ten minutes he said i advise you not to try to break in inspector jefe because it will certainly take you much longer falcón looked up at the impregnable house there were two security cameras on the corners he found two more at the back of the building it seems the vegas were very security conscious he said rejoining the group cameras bulletproof windows solid front door hes a wealthy man said consuelo and lucia is well neurotic to say the least said maddy krugman did you know sr vega before you moved here sra jiménez asked falcón of course he told me that the house i eventually bought was going to come up for sale before it appeared on the market were you friends or business associates both whats his business construction said madeleine thats why the house is built like a fort hes a client of mine at the restaurant in el porvenir said consuelo but i also knew him through raúl they were in the same business as you know they joined forces once on some developments in triana years ago did you know him just as a neighbour sra krugman my husband is an architect hes working on some projects for sr vega a large silver mercedes pulled up outside the house a short stocky man in a white longsleeve shirt dark tie and grey trousers got out he introduced himself as carlos vázquez and ran his fingers through his prematurely white hair he handed the keys to falcón who opened the door with a single turn it had not been double locked the house seemed bleak and freezing after the heat of the street falcón asked juez calderón if he and the forensics could take a quick look before the médico forense started his work he took felipe and jorge to the edge of the tiled floor of the kitchen they looked nodded to each other and backed away calderón had to prevent carlos vázquez from entering the kitchen and contaminating the crime scene the lawyer didnt look as if he was used to having a hand placed on his chest by anybody but his wife in bed the médico forense already gloved was ushered in while he checked for a pulse and took the temperature of the body falcón went outside and asked consuelo and madeleine if they would be available for interviews later he made a note that consuelo was still taking care of vegas son mario the médico forense murmured into his dictaphone as he checked the ears nose eyes and mouth of the victim he took a pair of tweezers and turned over the plastic bottle which lay close to the bodys outstretched hand it was a litre of drain cleaner falcón backed away down the corridor and checked the downstairs rooms the dining room was ultra modern the table was a thick single sheet of opaque green glass mounted on two stainless steel arches it was fully laid for ten people the chairs were white the floor was white the walls and light fixtures were also white in the chill of the air conditioning the dining experience must have been like the inside of a fridge without the clutter of butter trays and old food it did not seem to falcón that any entertaining had ever taken place in this room the living room by comparison was like the inside of a confused persons head every surface was covered in bricabrac souvenirs from around the world falcón saw holidays in which vega obsessively filmed with the latest technology while his wife devastated the tourist shops on the mid section of the sofa was a cordless phone a box of chocolates with half a tray uneaten and three remotes for satellite dvd and video on the floor was a pair of pink fluffy slippers the lights were off as was the television each of the stairs up to the bedrooms was made out of a slab of absolute black granite he checked the glass smooth surfaces as he moved slowly upwards nothing the floor at the top of the stairs was made of black granite inlaid with diamonds of white marble he was drawn to the door of the master bedroom the double bed was occupied a pillow lay over the face of the occupant whose arms lay outside the light duvet on the bed there was a slim band of a wristwatch on an arm flung out as if reaching for help a single visible foot had brightred toenails he went to the bedside and checked for a pulse while looking down on the two depressions in the pillow lucia vega was dead too there were three other rooms upstairs all with bathrooms one was empty another had a double bed and the last belonged to mario the ceiling of the boys room was painted with a night sky an old onearmed teddy bear lay face up on the bed falcón reported the second dead body to juez calderón the médico forense was kneeling by sr vegas side and working at prising his fingers apart there seems to be a note in sr vegas right hand said calderón the bodys cooled down quickly in the air con and i want him to get it out without tearing it any first thoughts inspector jefe on the face of it it looks like a suicide pact hes smothered his wife and then drunk some drain cleaner although thats a nasty lingering way to kill yourself pact what makes you think there was an agreement im just saying thats what it looks like said falcón the fact that the little boy was left out of it might indicate some collusion a mother wouldnt be able to bear the thought of the death of her own child and a father could it depends on the pressure if theres the possibility of financial or moral disgrace he might not want his male child to see that or live with the knowledge of it he would see killing him as a favour men have killed their entire families because they think they have failed them and that its better nobody survives bearing their name and its shame but you have your doubts said calderón suicide whether its a pact or not is rarely a spontaneous thing and there are some spontaneous elements to this crime scene first the door was not securely locked consuelo jiménez had called to say that mario had fallen asleep so they were sure he wasnt going to return but they didnt double lock the door the door was shut that was enough if youre about to do something unnatural you would put yourself behind locked doors to make absolutely certain there was no possibility of interruption its a psychological necessity serious suicides normally take full precautions what else the way everything has just been left here the phone the chocolates the slippers there seems to be a lack of premeditation well certainly on her part said calderón that is a point of course said falcón drain cleaner said calderón why would you take drain cleaner we may find there was something stronger than drain cleaner in the bottle said falcón the reason well he could be meting out punishment to himself you know cleaning himself of all his sins theres also the advantage of it being noiseless and depending on what else hes taken irrevocable too well that does sound premeditated inspector jefe so there are both spontaneous and planned elements to these deaths all right if they were lying on the bed together holding hands dead with a note pinned to his pyjamas then id be happy to treat it as suicide as it stands i would prefer to investigate the deaths as murder before deciding perhaps the note in his hand will said calderón but strange to get dressed for bed before you or is that another psychological necessity getting ready for the biggest sleep of all lets hope he was the sort who left his security cameras on and the recorders loaded with tapes said falcón returning to the pragmatic we should have a look in his study they crossed the entrance hall and went down a corridor by the stairs vegas study was on the right with a view of the street there was a leather chair tilted back behind a desk with a framed poster of this years bullfights held during the feria de abril hanging on the wall the desk was a large empty lightcoloured piece of wood with a laptop and a telephone three drawers on castors sat underneath behind the door were four black filing cabinets and at the end of the room the recording equipment for the security cameras there were no leds and the plugs were out of the wall sockets each recorder had an unused tape inside this doesnt look good said falcón the filing cabinets were all locked he pulled at the mobile set of drawers under the desk locked he went upstairs to the bedroom and found a walkin closet with his suits and shirts to the right and her dresses and a vast number of shoes some worryingly similar to the left a tall set of drawers had a wallet set of keys and some change on top one of the keys opened the drawers under the desk there was nothing unusual in the top two but as he pulled on the third drawer something at the back butted up against the ream of paper at the front it was a handgun i havent seen many of these said falcón this is a heckler koch mm you own one of these if youre expecting trouble if you had one of those said calderón would you drink a litre of drain cleaner or blow your brains out given the choice said falcón the lawyer appeared in the doorway his dark brown eyes set hard in his head you have no right he started this is a murder investigation sr vázquez said falcón sra vega is upstairs on the bed shes been suffocated with a pillow any idea why your client should have one of these in his study vázquez blinked at the gun seville is one of those curious cities where the wealthy and privileged people of santa clara are separated from the drugridden disadvantaged ones of the poligono san pablo by a small barrio the paper factory and the calle de tesalónica i imagine he had it for his own protection like the security cameras he didnt bother to switch on said falcón vázquez looked at the inert recorders his mobile went off playing the first few bars of carmen the lawmen grinned at each other vázquez went down the hall calderón closed the door and falcón knew what hed suspected as hed shaken the juezs hand that morning there was news and it was relevant to him i wanted you to hear this from me said calderón and not the rumour machine in the jefatura or the edificio de los juzgados falcón nodded his larynx suddenly paralysed inés and i are getting married at the end of the summer said calderón hed known this was coming but the news still rooted him to the floor it seemed like minutes before his feet moving at the pace of a divers on the ocean floor brought him close enough to shake calderóns hand he thought about gripping the judges shoulder in comradely fashion but the bitterness of his disappointment filled his mouth with the taint of a bad olive congratulations esteban he said we told our families last night said calderón youre the first outsider to know youll make each other very happy said falcón i know they nodded to each other and disengaged ill get back to the médico forense said the judge and left the room falcón went to the window took out his mobile and thumbed up alicia aguados number from the address book she was the clinical psychologist hed been seeing for more than a year his thumb stroked the call button and a flash of anger helped him to resist pressing it this could wait until their regular weekly appointment the following evening theyd covered his exwife inés a million times over and she would just chastise him again for not moving on javier and inés had settled their differences it had been a part of the rebuilding process after the francisco falcón scandal had broken fifteen months ago francisco was the worldfamous artist whom javier had always believed to be his father but who had been revealed as a fraud a murderer and not his real father after all inés had forgiven javier even before theyd arranged to meet some months after the media frenzy it had been his coldness captured by her terrible rhyming mantra tú no tienes corazón javier falcón you have no heart javier falcón that had finished their short marriage given his family history it was now clear to her why he should have been deficient in this fundamental human way over the last few months of his therapy thoughts of her had subsided but whenever her name came up there was an unmistakable leap in his stomach her terrible accusation still mangled his mind and in forgiving him shed become in his unstable state someone to whom he had to prove himself and now this still inés had been seeing the judge for nearly a year and a half they were the new golden couple not just of the seville legal system but of seville society as well their marriage was an inevitability which didnt made the news any easier to bear vázquez appeared on his shoulder in the reflection of the glass falcón switched back into professional mode how surprised are you to find your client dead under these strange circumstances sr vázquez he asked very he said wheres the licence for his gun by the way thats his private affair this is his house im only his lawyer but he entrusted you with the keys to his home he has no family here when they went away for the summer they often took lucias parents as well there is someone in my office all the time it seemed what about the americans next door theyve been here barely a year said vázquez he rents that house to them the husband works for him as an architect he didnt like people to get too involved in his life he gave them my telephone number in case of emergencies is vega construcciones his only company lets say hes in the property business he builds and rents out apartments and offices he constructs industrial property to order he buys and sells land he has a number of estate agencies falcón sat on the edge of the desk his foot swinging this gun sr vázquez is not for discouraging burglars its a gun for stopping a man dead even if you clipped a man on the shoulder with a mm bullet from a heckler koch youd probably kill him if you were a rich man who wanted to protect his family and home would you go out and buy a toy or a serious piece of weaponry so as far as you know sr vega is not involved in anything criminal or borderline illegal not that i know of and you can think of no reason why anybody would want to kill him look inspector jefe im involved with the legal aspects of my clients businesses i rarely get involved in their personal lives unless it has an impact on their business i know about his company if he was doing anything else then he was not employing me as his lawyer if he was having an affair with another mans wife which i doubt i wouldnt have known about it so what is your reading of this crime scene sr vázquez sra vega upstairs suffocated by a pillow sr vega downstairs dead with a litre of drain cleaner by his side while their son mario is in the hands of a neighbour for the night silence the brown eyes steadied on falcóns chest it looks like suicide at least one of those deaths has to be a murder it looks like rafael killed his wife and then himself did you ever see any evidence of that level of instability in your late client hows anybody supposed to know what goes on inside a mans head so he wasnt looking at business failure or financial ruin youd have to speak to the accountant about that although the accountant was not the finance director his knowledge would probably be confined who was the finance director rafael kept things close to his chest falcón gave him his notebook vázquez wrote down the accountants name francisco dourado and his details is there any scandal brewing that you know of involving sr vega or his company asked falcón now i know you said sr vázquez smiling for the first time with astonishingly perfect teeth falcón i didnt make the connection before well you re still here inspector jefe and my client hasnt gone through anything like you did but i didnt commit any crime sr vázquez i wasnt facing moral ruin or personal shame shame said the lawyer do you think shame still has that sort of power in our modern world it depends on the society in which you have built your life how important its opinion is to you said falcón by the way do you hold sr vegas will yes i do who is the next of kin as i said he has no family and his wife she has a sister in madrid her parents live here in seville well need someone to identify the bodies perez appeared in the doorway theyve pulled the note out of sr vegas hand he said they went to the kitchen squeezing past the forensics who were crowding the corridor with their cases waiting to get on to the crime scene the note was already in a plastic evidence bag calderón handed it over eyebrows raised falcón and vázquez frowned as they read it and not just because its ten words were written in english the thin air you breathe from until the end chapter wednesday th july do these words mean anything to you asked calderón nothing at all said vázquez does the handwriting look normal to you its definitely sr vegas thats all i can say it doesnt differ from his usual handwriting in any way im not an expert juez said vázquez it doesnt seem to have been written with a trembling hand but it is not exactly fluid either it seems careful rather than dashed off its not what i would call a suicide note said falcón what would you call it inspector jefe asked vázquez an enigma something thats demanding to be investigated interesting said calderón is it said vázquez we are always given the impression that detective work is very exciting this if you were a murderer you would normally not want to have your work investigated said falcón you would hope to get away with it you told me earlier that you thought this crime scene looked like a suicide a killer with a motive would usually try to give that notion authority with a straightforward suicide note and not with something that makes the investigating team think whats this all about unless he was a madman said vázquez one of those serial killers laying down a challenge well first of all theres no challenge a halfnote in sr vegas handwriting is not what i would call a psychotic attempt to communicate its too oblique secondly the crime scene does not contain any of the qualities we associate with a psychopathic killer they are the sort of people who think about body placement for instance they introduce elements of their obsessions into the picture they show that they have been here that an intricate mind has been at work theres nothing casual about a serial killers montage a bottle of drain cleaner is not left where it fell everything has importance so what normal person would kill a man and his wife and want to have it investigated asked vázquez a murderer who had good reason to hate sr vega and wanted him to be revealed for the man he was said falcón as you may know murder inquiries are very intrusive processes to find the motive we have to conduct a post mortem not just on the body but on the victims life we have to go into everything business social public private and as personal as we can get perhaps sr vega himself but inspector jefe you can never get inside a mans head can you said sr vázquez the other possibility is that sr vega himself is trying to communicate with us by balling this note in his fist he may be telling us to investigate the crime you didnt let me finish said vázquez the one thing my job has taught me is the three voices of man the public one to address the world the private one he keeps for his family and friends and the most troubling one of all the voice inside his own head the one he uses to talk to himself successful people like sr vega have very powerful inner voices and something ive noticed about that kind of person he never lets anybody have access to it not his parents not his wife not his firstborn child thats not the point said falcón the point is that we get insights said calderón cutting in a mans actions the way he behaves with people different people it all tells us something about him in my experience they tell you what he wants you to think said vázquez let me show you something about sr vega and you give me your insight can we walk across this kitchen floor yet felipe and jorge were brought in to check and clear a corridor across the kitchen floor falcón gave vázquez a pair of latex gloves they crossed the kitchen to a door on the other side which opened on to a room whose three walls were made up of floortoceiling stainless steel fridges hanging on the clear wall was an impressive array of knives choppers and saws the white tiles of the floor were pristine and gave off the faint smell of a pine detergent in the middle of the room was a wooden table with a top thirty centimetres thick its bleached surface was a crosshatching of cuts and notches with a declivity in the middle its edge furred from constant use falcón felt a strange sense of dread looking at that table and this is where he keeps the bodies is it sr vázquez asked calderón look in the fridges and freezers said the lawyer theyre full of bodies calderón opened a fridge door inside was a half carcass of beef with hooves removed the visible meat was a deep dark red almost black in parts where it wasnt pearled with membrane or covered in thick creamy yellow fat the fridges on either side contained several lambs and a pink pig the latters head had been removed and hung on a hook ears stiff eyes closed with long white lashes making it look at restful sleep the other doors opened on to freezers with cuts of frozen meat packaged and stored in baskets or just thrown into the dark frosty depths what do you make of that asked vázquez he wasnt a vegetarian said calderón he enjoyed butchering his own meat said falcón where did he get it from from specialized farms up in the sierra de aracena said vázquez he didnt think there was a single butcher in seville who had the first idea about handling meat neither hanging it nor cutting it up does that mean he used to be a butcher asked falcón do you know when and where that was all i know is that his father used to be a butcher before he was killed before he was killed what does that mean he was murdered or that was the expression he used to describe the death of his parents they were killed he never offered an explanation and i didnt ask for one how old was sr vega fiftyeight years old so born in five years after the civil war ended they didnt die in wartime said falcón you dont know when they were killed is this relevant inspector jefe asked vázquez were building a picture of the victims life it would have had a significant effect on sr vegas mental state if say they died in a car accident when he was still a boy if they were murdered that would be something else altogether that leaves unanswered questions and especially if there was no retribution it could breed a determination not necessarily to find out why which could be beyond his capabilities but to prove something to himself to find out who he was in this world my god inspector jefe said vázquez perhaps its your own experience thats made you so eloquent on the matter but im sorry i cant help you with that kind of information im sure there are records how long have you known him asked calderón since was that here in seville he wanted to buy a plot of land it was his first project and what had he been doing before that asked falcón butchery doesnt buy you very much land i didnt ask him he was my first client i was twentyeight years old i didnt want to do or ask anything that might lose me the work so his background didnt bother you the possibility that he might rip you off asked falcón how did you meet he came in off the street one day you probably dont know this about business inspector jefe but you have to take risks if you want to be sure about everything you dont set up your own practice you work for the state did he have an accent asked falcón ignoring the slight he spoke in andaluz but it didnt sound as if he was born to it hed been abroad i know he spoke american english for instance you didnt question him about any of that asked falcón i mean over lunch or a beer not in an interrogation room look inspector jefe i just wanted the mans business i didnt want to marry him the médico forense put his head round the door to say he was going upstairs to look at sra vegas body calderón went with him was sr vega married when you first met him asked falcón no said vázquez there were no divorce proceedings although i think he produced a death certificate of a previous spouse youll have to ask lucias parents when did they marry eight ten years ago something like that were you invited i was his testigo a trusted man in every respect said falcón what do you make of my clients hobby asked vázquez wanting to take back control of the interview his parents were killed his father was a butcher said falcón perhaps this is his way of keeping a memory alive i dont think he liked his father that much so he did give you some personal revelations over the last nearly twenty years ive gleaned some small pieces of information his father being hard on his only son was one of them a favourite punishment was to make his son work in the cold store in just a shirt rafael suffered from arthritis in his shoulders which he put down to that early treatment perhaps butchery gives him a sense of control i mean not just because hes good at it but because hes reducing something large and unmanageable down to comprehensible and usable pieces said falcón and thats the work of the constructor he takes the vast and complex architects plans and dismantles them into a series of jobs involving steel concrete bricks and mortar i think the few people who knew about his hobby found it more sinister the idea of the urbane businessman hacking his way down the spine of a dead beast said falcón i suppose there is a certain brutality to the work a lot of people who had dealings with sr vega thought they knew him said vázquez he understood what made people tick and he had learnt how to charm he had an instinct for a persons strengths and weaknesses he made men feel interesting and powerful and women mysterious and beautiful it was shocking to see how well it worked i realized some time ago that i didnt know him at all it meant that he trusted me but only with his business not with his private thoughts you were his testigo thats a little more than a business relationship you know there was a business element to his relationship with lucia or rather lucias family they had land asked falcón he made them very wealthy people said vázquez nodding and not very inquisitive about his mysterious past i only wanted to show you that being his testigo did not imply a more intimate relationship than he had with his wife youll be talking to lucias parents im sure said vázquez how was he with his son mario he loved his son the child was very important to him it seems odd that he should have waited until he was over fifty before starting a family silence while vázquez riffled through his lawyerly mind i cant help you there inspector jefe he said but im making you think i mentioned the death certificate i was just going over other conversations you met him when he was nearly forty years old he had money enough to buy land he had to borrow as well still someone of that generation with that sort of money would normally have a family you know he never talked about his life that part of it before he and i met apart from his fathers butchery business and that only came up because of the planning permission needed to build this room when he renovated the house i saw the drawings it needed an explanation when was that twelve years ago said vázquez but i didnt get the full family history he told you how he was punished by his father it was just fragments there was no major discussion felipe the older of the two forensics put his head round the door do you want to talk about this now inspector jefe falcón nodded vázquez gave him his card and the house keys and said hed be in seville for at least another week before the august holidays as he turned to leave he told falcón to open the door on the other side of the butchers room it gave on to the garage in which there was a brandnew silver jaguar he took delivery of that last week inspector jefe said vázquez hasta luego falcón joined the forensics in the kitchen felipe was watching jorge working his way around the foot of the kitchen units what have we got asked falcón nothing so far said felipe the floor has been recently cleaned the work surfaces no there are prints all over those its just the floor said felipe youd have thought with a litre of drain cleaner in his guts hed have gone into convulsions you ever had gallstone trouble inspector jefe fortunately not he said but he caught the glimmer of horror in felipes eye dont they say its the closest a male can get to the pain of childbirth i told my wife that and she reminded me both her babies were nearly four kilos each and that a gallstone is about nine grammes theres very little sympathy in the pain stakes said falcón i thrashed around on the bathroom floor like a lunatic there should be latent prints everywhere fingerprints on the bottle one set very strong and clear which is surprising too i wouldnt have thought sr vega would buy his own drain cleaner there should be others it must have been doctored with something stronger or with poison or he must have taken pills conventional drain cleaner would take some time wouldnt it strange way to do it if you ask me said jorge from the foot of the kitchen units well i think this points to what we all saw when we first took a look at the crime scene said falcón it didnt look right said felipe i thought it was off too said jorge nothing you can put your finger on said falcón its always the same with these scenes said felipe its whats missing that matters i took one look at the floor and thought no im getting nothing from that did you hear about the note weird said jorge the thin air you breathe whats that sounds pure said falcón and the stuff asked jorge were a long way from new york he was probably bankrolling alqaeda said felipe dont joke about it said jorge anything can happen these days all i know is that this is wrong said felipe not so wrong that im totally convinced that he was murdered but wrong enough to make me suspicious the position of the bottle asked falcón had it been me id have drunk it and flung it across the room said jorge there should be droplets everywhere and there arent any except at the point where the bottle lay just over a metre from the body but there are some drops yes theyve dripped from the neck of the bottle any between the body and the bottle no said felipe which again is odd but not impossible just as he could have thrashed around on the floor wiping away any latents and droplets with his dressing gown yeees said felipe unconvinced give me some conjecture felipe i know you hate it but just give me some we only deal in facts here said felipe because facts are the only things that stand up in court right inspector jefe come on felipe ill say it said jorge getting to his feet we all know whats missing from this crime scene and that is a person were not sure what they did or whether they were involved even we just know that somebody was here so we have a phantom said falcón any of you believe in ghosts now they really dont go down well in a court of law said felipe chapter wednesday th july consuelo jiménez opened the door to javier falcón and led him down the corridor to her lshaped sitting room overlooking a manicured lawn whose greenness was lurid in the bleaching sunlight the water in the blue pool with its necklace of white tiles trembled against its confinement pushing silky rhomboids towards the garden house whose walls and roof were blasted by purple bougainvillea falcón stood in front of the floortoceiling sliding doors with his hands clasped behind his back feeling selfconsciously official consuelo sat on the sofa dressed in a tight cream silk skirt and a matching blouse they were tense but oddly comfortable with each other do you like bougainvillea she asked yes he said without thinking it gives me hope im beginning to find it trite perhaps you see too much of it here in santa clara said falcón and framed by these windows it looks like a painting that says nothing i could have a man endlessly diving naked into the pool and call it my hockney vivant she said can i get you anything ive made some iced tea he nodded and looked at her figure as she went to the kitchen his blood stirred at the sight of the muscles in her calves he glanced around the room there was a single painting on the wall of a large cerise canvas with a dark blue widening stripe diagonally across it the surfaces of tables and a sideboard contained photographs of her children individuals and grouped apart from a dark blue sofa which turned a right angle with the lshaped room and an armchair there was little else he turned back to the facile garden thinking that shed mentioned hockney because this barrio in the incessant sunshine was much more like california than andalucía consuelo jiménez handed him an iced tea and pointed him into the armchair she lounged on the sofa nodding her foot at him her lowheeled sandal hanging from her toes it doesnt feel like spain out here said falcón you mean were not falling over each other like a basket of puppies its quiet they sat in silence for a moment no traffic no church bells ringing no whistling no handclapping down the streets doubleglazing she said and i live with noise all the time in the restaurants i live my spanish life three times over while im there so when im out here its like the afterlife id have thought youd be the same doing what you do i prefer to be in the midst of things these days said falcón ive done my time in limbo im sure in that massive house of your fathers you dont exactly feel in i mean not your father sorry i still refer to francisco falcón as my father its a fortysevenyear habit which i havent been able to break youve changed inspector jefe call me javier your style is different i cut my hair ive given up suits theres been a relaxation of standards youre not so intense she said oh i am ive just realized that people dont like it so i hide it ive learnt to keep smiling i had a friend whose mother gave her the advice keep moving keep smiling it works said consuelo we live in an age of glibness javier when was the last time you had a serious conversation i have them all the time with someone other than yourself ive been seeing a clinical psychologist of course you have after what youve been through she said but thats not conversation is it very little of it he said sometimes its like an absurd selfindulgence other times vomiting she snatched at the cigarettes on the table lit one up and sank back satisfied im annoyed with you she said pointing at him with the lit cigarette you never called me and we were supposed to have dinner remember you moved house does that mean you tried i havent had much time he said smiling smiling doesnt work with me she said i know what it means youll have to learn some new strategies things have been coming to a head he said in the therapy yes that and i have legal problems with my sister manuela my half sister shes the acquisitive one i seem to remember youve read all the scandal youd have to have been in a coma to avoid it she said so what does manuela want money she wanted me to write a book about my life with francisco including all the journals and my take on the murder case that brought it all to light or rather she wanted me to work with her journalist boyfriend who would ghost the book for me i refused she got angry now shes working on proving that im not the rightful heir to francisco falcóns house that i am not his son you see how it goes you have to fight her she has very different mental processes she thinks how francisco used to think which was probably why he never liked her said falcón shes a manipulator and a public relations expert which combined with her energy ambition and wallet is lethal ill buy the dinner its not that bad its just something that adds to the background pressure of life what you need is some foreground pleasure javier she said that brother of yours the bull breeder paco is he any help to you we get on well theres been no change there but this kind of thing is not his strength he needs manuela too shes his vet and one word to the authorities about any possible threat of bse in his herd and hed be finished you are remarkably sane thank you he said and decided not to tell her that it was probably the drugs but having disdained it i now think you are in need of some glibness and fun silence falcón tapped his notebook a sad inevitability compressed her lips she smoked it away bring on the questions inspector jefe she said beckoning him to her you can still call me javier well javier at least youve learnt a few things like what how to ease somebody or rather how to ease a suspect into an interrogation do you think youre a suspect he asked id like to be one so that we can relive the detectivesuspect dynamic she said drily and how do you know it was murder why are you here javier i investigate any death that is not by natural causes did rafael die of a heart attack falcón shook his head so its murder or a suicide pact pact she said stubbing out the cigarette what pact we found sra vega dead upstairs suffocated by her pillow oh my god she said looking over her shoulder mario sr vega had drunk a litre of drain cleaner which was probably either boosted or poisoned or hed taken pills beforehand well have to wait for the médico forenses report i cant believe it you mean you didnt think he was the suicidal type he appeared so connected to life his work the family especially mario hed just bought a new car they were going away on holiday was sr vega there when you called last night about mario i spoke to lucia i assumed he was there but i dont know where were they going on holiday asked falcón normally they go to el puerto de santa maria but this time they thought mario was old enough so theyd rented a house in la jolla near san diego and they were going to take him to sea world and disneyland florida would have been closer too humid for lucia she said lighting another cigarette and shaking her head staring at the ceiling weve got no idea what goes on in peoples heads his lawyer didnt mention any of this he might not have known about it rafael was the type who kept his life compartmentalized he didnt like overlaps one thing bleeding into another everything had to be separate and in its place i got all the holiday stuff from lucia so he was a control freak like a lot of successful businessmen you met him through raúl he was very supportive after raúl was murdered he let mario sleep over he liked my boys too was it a regular thing mario sleeping over at least once a week normally on a weekday night or over the weekend in the summer when i have more time she said the only thing he wouldnt allow was for mario to go in the pool surprising that sr vega didnt have a pool there was one there but hefilled it in and turfed it over he didnt like them did anybody else know about the arrangement with mario they might have if they were nosey enough she said dont you find all this incredibly tedious javier in my experience its through the minutiae of everyday life that you find out about how people really live the small details lead to bigger things he said some years ago i was beginning to find it dull but now strangely i find it quite riveting since you restarted your own life sorry i didnt mean to be so intrusive id nearly forgotten but thats your style isnt it dona consuelo you can dispense with the dona javier she said and im sorry it was a thought that should have remained a thought i come across a lot of people who think things about me he said because of my story ive become public property the only reason i dont get accosted more is that people have too many questions they dont know where to start all i meant was that from my own experience when the foundations of your life collapse its the everyday things that begin to matter they hold things together she said ive had a lot of rebuilding to do myself since we last met new life new home new lover he asked i deserved that she said its just my job but was that a personal inquiry or solely for the purposes of your investigation lets say both said falcón i have no lover and if this is where youre leading to rafael was not interested in me he played that back in his mind and found no nuances lets get back to the minutiae he said when did you last speak to the vegas i spoke to lucia at about eleven pm to tell her that mario had fallen asleep and id put him to bed there was some mothers talk and that was it was it any longer than usual consuelo blinked as her eyes filled her mouth crumpled around the cigarette she spat the smoke out swallowed hard it was the same as always she said she didnt ask to speak to the boy or consuelo leaned forward dug her elbows into her thighs and wept falcón got to his feet went to her and gave her a handkerchief he patted her between the shoulder blades im sorry he said the minutiae lead to bigger things he took the cigarette from her hand and crushed it out in the ashtray consuelo recovered falcón returned to his chair since raúls death i get very emotional about children all children it must have been hard for your boys it was but they showed remarkable resilience i think i felt more for their loss than they did its surprising the route that grief takes she said but now i find myself constantly pledging money to kids whove been orphaned by aids in africa to children whove been exploited in india and the far east to street children in mexico city and são paulo the rehabilitation of boy soldiers it just pours out of me and i have no idea why this should suddenly have happened didnt raúl leave some money to los niños de la calle the street children charity i think it was something deeper than that guilt money for arturo that son of his who was kidnapped and never seen dont start me off again she said i cant stop thinking about that ok something else he said lucia has a sister in madrid doesnt she she should be able to look after mario yes shes got two children one whos marios age ill miss him she said losing your father is bad enough but to lose a mother as well is a catastrophe especially at that age you adapt said falcón feeling the stab of his own experience the survival instinct hasnt been undermined you accept love from wherever it comes they stared at each other minds orbiting around the concept of the parental void until consuelo went to the bathroom as the taps ran falcón slumped back in his chair already exhausted he had to find the stamina for this work again or perhaps try to find new ways of keeping the worlds he pried into at a distance so what do you think happened in that house last night said consuelo face repaired it looks as if sr vega smothered his wife and then killed himself by drinking a bottle of drain cleaner said falcón official cause of death will be established later if the scenario is as it appears well expect to find pillow material under sr vegas fingernails that sort of thing which will give us and if you dont then well have to look deeper said falcón were already puzzled by the new car and the fact he was going on holiday suicides rarely advertise what theyre about to do they carry on as normal think how many times youve heard the relatives of victims say but he seemed so calm and normal said falcón its because theyve made up their minds and its given them some peace at last no were puzzled by the scenario and by the strange note he wrote a suicide note not exactly in his fist he had a piece of paper on which was written in english the thin air you breathe from until the end said falcón does that mean anything to you well its not explaining anything is it she said why one of the forensics said he was probably bankrolling alqaeda said falcón as a joke except arent we being led to believe that anything is possible these days did sr vega seem unstable to you in any way rafael seemed to be completely stable said consuelo lucia was the unstable one she was a depressive with occasional bouts of manic compulsive behaviour have you seen her wardrobe a lot of shoes many of them were the same design and colour as were her dresses if she liked something shed buy three straight off she was on medication so if he was in crisis given his nature he would be unlikely to turn to anyone outside the family and he wouldnt have been able to talk to his wife the restaurant business has taught me not to judge peoples lives from the outside couples even crazy ones have ways of communicating some of which are not attractive but they work what about their domestic situation you saw that too i did but a third party always changes the dynamics people start behaving is that a general or specific observation i meant it specifically but it can be applied generally she said and that felt like the second time youve tried to insinuate that i might have been having an affair with sr vega did it said falcón well i didnt mean to be specific i was just thinking that under those stressful circumstances a lover might have been a possibility and that would have changed mental and marital landscapes not rafael she said shaking her head hes not the type who is the type she tapped a cigarette on the box lit it and blew smoke at the glass your inspector ramírez is the type she said where is he by the way hes taken his daughter to have some medical tests not serious i hope they dont know said falcón but youre right about ramírez he was always a player combing his hair for the secretaries in the edificio de los juzgados maybe the work he did gave him an eye for the vulnerable she said thats another definition of the type but not apparently rafael vega the butcher you said it thats a pastime that really doesnt go with lovemaking do you want to see my latest cuts what did you make of all that i used him his beef always tasted better almost all the steaks served in my restaurants are cut by him and psychologically it ran in the family i dont think its any more than that if his father had been a carpenter of course some sparetime cabinet making but butchery it gave lucia the creeps but then she had her sensitivities she was squeamish as well squeamish nervous depressed unable to sleep she used to take two sleeping pills a night one to knock her out and then another when she woke up at three or four in the morning bulletproof windows said falcón she needed total silence to sleep the house was hermetically sealed once you were inside there was no sense of the outside world no wonder she was a little crazy sometimes when she opened the door i expected a rush of air as if the pressures were different inside in a world of glibness and fun she doesnt sound like much fun said falcón there you go again javier thats number three she said anyway she was glib she used the material and the trivial to hold her life together she found relationships complicated even mario could be too much for her at times which was why she was so happy for him to come over here but thats not to say he wasnt the focus of her life so how did sr vega fit into his family i dont think they were expecting a child i didnt see them much at that time but i seem to remember it was a shock she said anyway a marriage changes after a child perhaps youll find that out for yourself one day javier you pretend not to understand what im doing but you know i have to do this i have to look for the weaknesses and vulnerabilities in a situation said falcón sounding oversensitive even to himself my questions can be ugly but then its not so nice to have a double murderer out there leaving a crime scene to look like a suicide pact its ok javier i can take it said consuelo despite the attractions of the detectivesuspect dynamic id rather you eliminated me from your inquiries with whatever ugly questions you have to ask i have a good memory and i did not enjoy being accused of raúls murder well these are just the preliminaries im hoping for some harder facts on which to base my suspicions about the way in which the vegas died so youll be seeing me again i look forward to it how did you get into the grounds of the vegas house lucia gave me the code to open the gate did anybody else know that the maid probably sergei ive no idea but the krugmans garden butts on to the vegas and theres a gate at the bottom so they would have access as for pablo ortega i dont know sergei said falcón you said he was a russian or ukrainian thats a bit unusual even you must have noticed the number of eastern europeans around these days said consuelo i know its wrong but i think people prefer them to moroccans what do you know about madeleine krugman shes friendly in the way that americans are immediately you could say the same of the sevillanos perhaps thats why we get so many americans here every year said consuelo im not complaining by the way shes an attractive woman said falcón rafaels never had it so good in your eyes she said anyway all men think madeleine krugman is attractive even you javier i saw you looking falcón flushed like a fifteen year old grinned and ran through a range of displacement activity consuelo gave him a sad smile from the sofa maddy knows her power she said so shes the femme fatale of the barrio asked falcón im trying to edge her out said consuelo but shes got a few years on me no she just knows that men melt around her she does her best to ignore it whats a girl supposed to do when everybody from the gas man to the fishmonger to the juez de instruction and the inspector jefe de homicidios seem to have lost control of their lower jaws what about sr krugman theyve been married a long time hes older do you know what theyre doing here taking a break from living in america he works for rafael hes designing or has designed a couple of his projects were they taking a break after that happened while they were here she said they were living in connecticut he was working in new york and i think they just got bored children i dont think so have you been to any social occasions there yes rafael was there too but not lucia too much for her any observations im sure he was probably interested in the idea of having sex with her because thats what travels through every mans brain when they see maddy krugman but i dont think it happened there was a loud bellow from upstairs the terrible noise of an animal in pain it shot up consuelos spineand jerked her to her feet falcón scrambled out of his chair feet rumbled down the stairs mario in a pair of shorts and shirt came running down the corridor he had his arms held out from his puny body his head thrown back eyes closed mouth open in a silent scream the famous war photograph of the napalm attack on a vietnam village snapped into falcóns mind but not focused on the central figure of a naked vietnamese girl running down the road it was on the boy in front of her his black mouth stretched open crammed full of horror chapter wednesday th july in his passport photo martin krugman without his beard looked his age which was fiftyseven years old with the beard which was grey and had been allowed to grow untrimmed he looked beyond retirement age life had been kinder to madeleine krugman who was thirtyeight and looked no different from her passport photo taken when she was thirtyone they could have been father and daughter and many people would have preferred it that way marty krugman was tall and rangy some might say skinny with a prominent nose which face on was blade thin his eyes were set close together well back in his head and operated under eyebrows which his wife had given up trying to contain he did not look like a man who slept much he drank cup after cup of thick espresso coffee poured from a chrome coffee maker marty was not dressed for the office his shirt was nearly cheesecloth with a blue stripe which he wore like a smock outside his faded blue jeans he had outward bound sandals on his feet and sat with an ankle resting on his knee and his hands clinging on to his shin as if he was pulling on an oar he spoke perfect spanish with a mexican inflexion spent my youth in california he said berkeley doing engineering then i took some years out in new mexico painting in taos and taking trips down to central and south america my spanish is a mess was that in the late sixties asked falcón and seventies i was a hippy until i discovered architecture did you know sr vega before you came here no we met him through the estate agent who rented the house to us did you have any work not at that stage we were playing it fast and easy it was lucky that we met rafael in the first few weeks we got talking hed heard of some of my new york stuff and he offered me some project work it was very lucky said madeleine as if she might have flown the coop if it hadnt worked out so you came here on a whim maddy had changed out of the white linen trousers into a kneelength skirt which flared out over her cream leather chair she crossed and uncrossed her very white legs several times a minute and falcón who was sitting directly opposite her annoyed himself by looking every time her breasts trembled under her blue silk top with every movement hormonal sound waves seemed to pulse out into the room as her blue blood ticked under her white skin marty was impervious to it all he didnt look at her or react to anything she said when she spoke his gaze remained fixed on falcón who was having trouble finding a resting place for his own eyes with the whole room now an erogenous zone my mother died and i inherited some money said maddy we thought wed take a break and be in europe for a while visit our old honeymoon haunts paris florence prague but we went to provence and then marty had to see barcelona get his gaudi fix and one thing led to another we found ourselves here seville gets into your blood are you a sevillano inspector jefe not quite he said when did all this happen march last year were you taking a break from anything in particular just boredom said marty your mothers death sra krugman was that sudden she was diagnosed with cancer and died within ten weeks im sorry said falcón what was boring you in america sr krugman you can call us maddy and marty if you like she said we prefer to be relaxed her perfect white teeth appeared behind her chilli red lips in a two centimetre smile and were gone she spread her fingers out on the leather arms of the chair and switched her legs over again my job said marty i was bored with the work i was doing no you werent she said and their eyes met for the first time shes right said marty his head slowly coming back to falcón why would i be working here if i was bored with my job i was bored with being in america i just didnt think youd be interested in that its not a detail thats going to help you find out what happened to the vegas im interested in everything said falcón most murder has a motive murder said maddy the officer on the gate told me it was suicide selfmurder said falcón if thats what it was its all motivated which means im interested in everybodys motives for doing anything it is all indicative of what asked maddy a state of mind degrees of happiness and disappointment joy and anger love and hate you know the big emotions that make things happen and break things down this guy doesnt sound like a cop said marty in english throwing the line over his shoulder to his wife her eyes were on falcón digging deep excavating his cranium in a way that made him think that he must look like somebody she knew what was so wrong with america that you had to leave asked falcón i didnt say anything was wrong said marty bracing his shoulders as if he was at the start of the olympic sculls final i was just bored with the grind of daily life boredom is one of our strongest motivations said falcón what did you want to get away from what were you looking for sometimes the american way of life can be a rather enclosed world said marty there are a lot of sevillanos whove hardly been outside andalucfa let alone spain said falcón they dont see the need for it they dont think theres anything wrong with their enclosed world maybe they dont question it why should they when they live in the most beautiful place on earth have you ever been to america inspector jefe no why not asked marty indignant its the greatest nation on earth said maddy bright cheerful and ironical probably said falcón thinking it through as he spoke because what id be looking for there has gone marty slapped out a beat on his shin delighted what would that be asked maddy what had transfixed me as a boy which was all those blackandwhite noir movies of the forties and fifties they were the reason i became a detective youd be disappointed said marty those streets that life those values weve moved on from them youve made a big mistake here inspector jefe said maddy america is martys favourite topic we get out of there and suddenly thats all he wants to talk about he wakes me up at night because he has to tell me his latest theory what was it last night honey fear said marty his dark peepers flashing from deep in his head like tropical birds escaping into the jungle america is a society based on fear said maddy flatly thats the latest its sad that he thinks hes the first one to think them well now i suppose in the post september th world not just now said marty its always been fear forget the pioneering spirit said maddy hurling her hand over her shoulder there have always been pioneers said marty the strong and fearless men this is very interesting said falcón seeing his mistake now and it would be fascinating were it not for the fact that i have a double death to investigate you see hes not that interested in your motives said maddy and marty flicked a dismissive finger at her and by the way inspector jefe he still thinks its the greatest nation on earth despite when did you last speak to the vegas asked falcón i spoke to him yesterday evening about seven oclock in the office said marty it was a technical conversation nothing personal he was businesslike professional the usual were you aware of any financial difficulties that might have put pressure on sr vega he was always under pressure its the nature of construction theres a lot to think about the building the machinery materials and labour budgets and money and you falcón said turning to maddy me she replied coming out of some deep distracting thought the last time you spoke to sr vega i dont i cant think she said when would that have been honey dinner last week he said how were the vegas then rafael came on his own said marty as usual said maddy lucia always cancelled at the last minute the kid or something she didnt like these dinners of ours she was a traditionalist you only go to dinner at someone elses house if theyre family she found it awkward she had no conversation except about mario and ive never had children so she was neurotic said marty how did sr vega and his wife get along he was very loyal to her said maddy does that mean love no longer came into it love she said marty stared at her nodding his nose sawing through the chill air as if willing her to conclude what shed embarked on dont you think loyalty is a part of love inspector jefe i do said falcón but you seem to have separated loyalty from the whole as if that was all that remained dont you think thats the nature of a marriage or of love inspector jefe she said that time degrades it wears away at passion and ardour the thrill of sex for christs sake said marty in english the intensity of interest you have in what the other says or thinks the wild hilarity of the smallest jokes the deep unquestioning admiration of physical beauty intelligence moral certitude yes said falcón his insides starting to bind up as they did sometimes in therapy sessions with his psychologist alicia aguado thats true he sat back let his intestines have some room wrote some gibberish down in his notebook wanted to get out of there so are you saying sra krugman that the vegas marriage in your opinion was strong i only observed that he was loyal to her she was an unwell and at times an unhappy woman but she was the mother of his child and that had considerable weight with him the ground seemed to firm up under falcóns chair as the business at hand reasserted itself sr vega liked to control things said falcón he had firm ideas about how things should be done and he had a very disciplined mind said marty i never saw further into his corporation than was necessary for me to do my work he didnt attempt to involve me in anything outside my own project he would even ask me to leave his office if he was going to talk about other jobs on the phone he was very concerned about hierarchy the way things were reported to him who did what and the chain of command i dont have any direct experience of this but his style seemed military to me which is no bad thing on a construction site people can get killed very easily in life too said maddy what said marty he liked to control things in life too the gardener his family his meat she said chopping her hand down on to her knee its odd then that hed come over here for dinner said falcón if he was going to put himself in the hands of others id have thought hed prefer a restaurant he understood it as an american thing said marty he liked it said maddy shrugging her shoulders so that her loose breasts shifted under the silk her legs slipped to one side and she rubbed them together as if taming an itch i bet he did thought falcón a controlling man might kill himself if his carefully constructed world was about to fall apart due to financial ruin or a shaming scandal it could also collapse because of an emotional involvement that went wrong news of the first two scenarios if they existed will break soon enough do you know anything about the third possibility do you think he was the type to have affairs marty asked his wife affairs said maddy almost to herself he would have left a note said marty did he not a conventional one said falcón and gave them the text that seems almost a little too poetic for someone like rafael said maddy what about the reference said falcón you must have talked about that with him maddy rolled her eyes sure said marty we talked about it endlessly but as an item of current affairs i really dont understand its significance in this context why kill your wife asked maddy which relieved falcón who didnt want martys theories on at this stage of his inquiry i mean if youre suffering like that kill yourself by all means but dont leave your kid with no parents maybe he thought lucia would not be able to survive without him said marty that would be true she said do you always allow this much conjecture into your investigations inspector jefe asked marty no said falcón but the situation in the vegas house was sufficiently enigmatic that i have to keep an open mind until i get a full forensic report and the pathology of the bodies also the closest person to sr vega his wife is dead too i have to rely on people who knew him peripherally socially or in business lucias parents should be able to help you said marty they were around there almost every sunday for lunch did you ever meet them i met them once said maddy they werent er very sophisticated people i think he used to be a farmer how long have you been married asked falcón twelve years she said how did you meet he said a question hed found himself asking every couple hed met over the last year it was in new york said marty maddy was showing a collection of her photographs at a gallery which was owned by a friend of mine she introduced us and i never went back to my apartment said maddy are you still a photographer shes taken it up again since we left the states said marty steamrollering over maddys negative what do you photograph people she said portraits never she photographs people in their unconscious moments said marty he doesnt mean when theyre sleeping she said her eyes flashing with irritation when they dont know the camera is there asked falcón one step further than that said marty when they believe themselves to be completely alone that makes me sound like a snoop she said im not a yes you are said marty laughing no im not she said because that implies that im interested in what people are doing and thats not it what is it asked marty then turning to falcón he added she never shoots me its the internal struggle she said i hate it when you make me say these things its just not have you got any shots of sr vega said falcón they left marty on the sofa and went upstairs one of three bedrooms had been converted into a darkroom while maddy looked through her contact sheets falcón checked the books on the shelves and pulled out one with madeleine coren on the spine there was a photograph of her on the inside flap a creamy beauty with sparkling eyes challenging the camera to come closer she had the dazzle of youth then which had been skimmed down by lifes natural damage to its present translucence there was still something of the celebrity about her that quality that film producers look for not beauty but watchability she absorbed things from around her available light unused energy and anything anybody might want to give falcón opened the book tore himself away from her profile he could feel his bone marrow weakening her photographs at first seemed to be about loneliness old people sitting on park benches a young man standing at a rail overlooking a river a woman in a towelling robe on a roof terrace in manhattan gradually as the cameras eye moved closer other things became evident contentment on the old persons face possibility in the young mans eyes dreaminess in the womans face theyre facile those early ones said maddy the idea was just a gimmick i was only twentytwo i didnt know anything take a look at these she handed him six blackandwhite prints the first three showed rafael vega in a white shirt and dark trousers hands in pockets standing on his wellclipped lawn the camera was looking over his shoulder at his profile his jaw was tight falcón waited for the shot to tell him something then he saw what it was hes barefoot that was th january this year what was he doing thats not the point remember she said im not a snoop look at these theyre taken down by the river i go there a lot i can sit with a big zoom lens on a tripod and people will stop on calle bétis and the bridges i pick up a lot of contemplative looks people go to the river for a reason dont they the three shots she gave him were closeups of head and shoulders in the first rafael vega was wincing in the second he was gritting his teeth eyes screwed up and in the third his mouth had cracked open hes in pain said falcón he was crying said maddy theres saliva at the corners of his mouth he gave her back the photos they were intrusive and he didnt like them he returned her book to the shelf and you didnt think any of this was worth mentioning before this is my work she said this is how i express myself i wouldnt have shown you them if marty hadnt pushed me even though it could have a bearing on what happened in the vegas house last night i answered your questions the last time we spoke how the vegas got along whether he was having an affair i just didnt relate any of that to these shots because the point is that we should never know about them they were not taken for the purposes of investigating causes why were they taken these are shots of people suffering in intensely private moments but out in the open they have chosen not to hide in their homes but to walk it out of themselves in the presence of other human beings falcón remembered the hours hed spent walking the streets of seville in the past fifteen months the contemplation of the fundamentals of his existence were too unsettling for the confines even of his sprawling house on calle bailen hed walked it all out of himself stared it all into the sloeblack waters of the guadalquivir shaken it all off into the empty sugar sachets and cigarette ends on the floors of anonymous bars it was true he had not sat at home with his horrors piling up in his mind there was solace in the wordless company of strangers maddy was standing close to him he was aware of her smell the body under its thin sheath of silk the exquisite pressure the flimsiness of the barrier she hovered expectant confident of her ability her white throat trembled as she swallowed we should go back downstairs said falcón there was something else i wanted to show you she said and led him across the corridor to another bedroom which had a bare tiled floor and more of her photographs on the walls his attention was grabbed by a colour shot of a blue pool with a white necklace of tiles in a green lawn with a purple flame of bougainvillea in one corner and a white cushioned lounger in the other a woman sat on the lounger in a black bathing costume under a red hat thats consuelo jiménez he said i didnt know you knew her said maddy he went to the window across the road consuelos garden was visible i had to get up on the roof for the angle she said to his left he could see the vegas entrance and driveway through the trees do you know what time sr vega came back home last night no but it was rarely before midnight you wanted to show me something he said turning back in to the room on the back wall behind the door framed in black was a print cm by cm of a man staring down from a bridge under which it was clear his whole life was flowing the features of the man did not compute at first there was too much going on in the face it was a shock for him to discover that he was looking at himself a javier falcón hed never seen before chapter wednesday th july back at the crime scene next door everybody had moved upstairs into the vegas bedroom calderón had already signed off the levantamiento del cadáver for sr vega the body was in a bag on a trolley in the hallway waiting in the air conditioning to be loaded on to the ambulance and taken down to the instituto anatómico forense on avenida sánchez pizjuan the crime scene team were now congregated around the bed looking down at sra vega hands behind backs solemn as if in prayer the pillow was off her face and had been put in a plastic bag and leaned against the wall her mouth was open the top lip and teeth were set in a snarl as if shed left life bitterly her lower jaw was off centre shed been hit once with the right hand calderón explained to falcón the jaws dislocated probably knocked her unconscious the médico forense thinks it was done with the flat of the hand rather than a closed fist what was the time of death same time as the husband three three thirty he cant be more accurate than that sra jiménez said she used sleeping pills two a night to knock herself out she must have woken up and had to be subdued before being suffocated is there any link between this death and sr vegas yet not until i get them back to the instituto said the médico forense were hoping for some sweat or saliva on the upper side of the pillow said felipe this strengthens your case for an unknown murderer inspector jefe said calderón i cant see a husband dislocating his wifes jaw unless as i said she woke up perhaps got out of bed just as sr vega came in full of intent she might have seen something different in him become hysterical and he felt the need for violence said falcón im still keeping an open mind on this any ghosts in here ghosts asked calderón something that makes a crime scene look off not as it should be said falcón we all had the same feeling about sr vegas body in the kitchen somebody else had been there and here jorge shrugged she was murdered said felipe nobody was trying to make this scene look like anything else whether it was sr vega remains to be seen all weve got is the pillow what did the neighbours have to say asked calderón moving away from the others in the room we have some conflicting views said falcón sra jiménez has known sr vega for some time and did not consider him the suicidal type she also noted the new car and said he was about to go on holiday to san diego sra krugman however showed me these photographs taken recently of sr vega in private clearly distressed and possibly unstable she let me have this contact sheet calderón looked over the images frowning hes barefoot in his garden in january said falcón and theres another one of him crying down by the river whats she doing taking these photographs asked calderón its her work said falcón the way she expresses herself taking shots of peoples private distress said calderón raising an eyebrow is she weird she told me that she was interested in the private inner struggle said falcón you know that voice that sr vázquez talked about the one nobody ever hears but whats she doing with it asked calderón recording the face but not the voice i mean whats the point the voice is loud in the head but silent to the outside world said falcón shes interested in the distressed persons need to be out in the open amongst his fellow strangers walking his pain out of himself they exchanged a look left the room and went into marios bedroom calderón gave him back the contact sheet whats all that bullshit about said calderón im telling you what she said is she getting some vicarious experience from this shes got a photograph of me on her wall said falcón still seething a blowup of me staring down into the river from the puente de isabel ii for gods sake shes like some paparazzo of the emotions said calderón wincing photographers are strange people said falcón who was one himself their currency is perfect moments from real life they define their idea of perfection to themselves and then pursue it like prey if theyre lucky they find an image that intensifies their idea makes it more real but in the end theyre capturing ephemera ghosts internal struggles captured ephemera said calderón this is unusable stuff lets wait for the autopsy that should give us something tangible to work with in the meantime id like to find sergei the gardener who was physically the closest person to the crime scene and discovered the body theres another ghost said calderón we should search his rooms down at the bottom of the garden calderón nodded maybe ill go across and take a look at sra krugmans photographs while you search the gardeners rooms said calderón i want to see these shots full size falcón tracked the judge with his eyes back to the second crime scene calderón exchanged words with the médico forense rolling his mobile in his hand like a bar of soap he trotted down the stairs in a hurry falcón shrugged away the unsettling thought that calderón seemed oddly selfconscious and keen which was not part of his usual knowing style as he sweated his way down the unshaded lawn falcón noticed a pile of blackened paper in the grill on the paved barbecue area the uppermost paper had been crumpled and was thoroughly burned so that it disintegrated at the touch of his pen beneath it were pages that had not been so completely consumed by fire on which there was discernible handwriting he called felipe down to the garden with his forensic kit he looked it over wearing his custommade magnified goggles were not going to save much of this he said if anything they look like letters to me said falcón i can only make out partial words but the writing has that rounded look of a female hand ill take a shot of it before we wreck it give me the partial words you can see felipe called out some words which at least confirmed the language as spanish and he took a couple of shots with his digital camera the blackened paper collapsed as he dug in deeper with his pen he found a partial line en la escuela in the school but nothing else at the bottom of the pile he came across paper of a different quality felipe lifted some filigree remains from the blackened flakes this is a modern photograph he said theyre very flammable the chemicals blister as the paper underneath burns and all thats left is this older photographs dont burn so easily the paper is thicker and higher quality he teased out some paper which was glossy black and curled at the edges but still white in the middle he turned it over to reveal a blackandwhite shot of a girls head and shoulders she was standing in front of a woman whose presence had been reduced to a ringed hand resting on the girls clavicle can we date it this sort of stock hasnt been used commercially in spain for years but it could have been developed privately or come from abroad where they are still using that kind of stuff so tricky said felipe the girls hairstyle looks a bit oldfashioned sixties seventies asked falcón maybe she certainly doesnt look like a girl from the pueblo and the womans hand on her shoulder doesnt look as if its done any manual labour id have said they were welloff foreigners ive got some cousins out in bolivia who look a bit like this you know just not up to date they bagged the piece of photograph found some shade and cleaned themselves up you burn old letters and photographs if youre putting your house in order said felipe or your head said falcón maybe he did kill himself and were just imagining things why would you burn this sort of stuff said falcón painful memories a part of your life you dont want your wife to find out about or a part of your life you dont want your son to find out about said felipe when you die perhaps it could be dangerous material if it falls into the wrong hands whose hands im just saying you burn this sort of thing to get rid of it because its either painful embarrassing or dangerous it could just be a picture of his wife as a girl said felipe what would that mean have we tracked down sra vegas parents yet asked falcón they should really be looking after the boy rather than sra jiménez felipe told him that perez was working on it they went down to the gardeners house the door was not locked the two rooms were stuffy airless and stripped of all possessions the mattress was half off the bed as if he kept something under there or perhaps just slept on it outside the only other furniture in the bedroom was an upturned box used as a bedside table the kitchen had a gas ring and bottle of butane there was no fridge and only dried food out on a sideboard the staff didnt see much of the vega luxury said felipe better than living in tres mil viviendas said falcón why run allergic to police said felipe these guys get asthmatic when they see on the wall of the phone booth a dead body well you dont hang around waiting for the disaster to happen do you or he might have seen something or someone said falcón he must have been aware of sr vega burning his papers probably saw him standing out in the garden in his bare feet maybe he even saw what happened last night ill take some prints and run them through the computer said felipe falcón walked back up to the house his shirt sticking to his back he called perez on his mobile where are you asked falcón now im in the hospital inspector jefe i left you searching the garage and the outside of the house i did that what about all the burnt papers in the barbecue they were burnt i made a note of it did you hurt yourself no what are you doing in the hospital then sra jiménez sent the maid over saying she was having trouble with the boy mario she thought it would be good for him to see a familiar face get the grandparents over did you speak to juez calderón about this yes he didnt mention it to me he had other things on his mind like what hes not going to tell me is he said perez i could see he was preoccupied thats all just tell me why youre in the hospital said falcón who had never quite got used to perezs maddening style of working and reporting i arrived at the apartment of sr and sra cabello who are the parents of sra vega he said theyre both in their seventies they let me in i tell them whats happened and sra cabello collapses i thought it was shock but sr cabello says she has a weak heart i call an ambulance and give her first aid shes stopped breathing i have to give her heart massage and mouth to mouth inspector jefe the ambulance arrives and fortunately has a defibrillator on board shes now in intensive care and im sitting here with sr cabello ive called his other daughter and shes on her way down from madrid on the ave have you spoken to sra jiménez i dont have a number for her juez calderón his mobiles turned off me were talking now inspector jefe all right good work said falcón back in the cool of the house falcóns insides felt like smouldering wreckage everybody was standing around impatiently both bodies were bagged and lying on stretchers in the hallway what are you waiting for asked falcón we need juez calderón to sign off the levantamiento del cadáver said the médico forense we cant find him falcón called sra jiménez on his way over to the krugmans to tell her about sra vegas parents and the imminent arrival of lucias sister from madrid mario had collapsed with exhaustion and was now sleeping she asked him over for a drink in the heat ive still got things to do he said ill be here all day she said im not going to work marty krugman answered the door stretching as if hed been dozing on the sofa falcón asked after the judge marty pointed upstairs and dragged himself back to his sofa barefoot his jeans hanging off his backside falcón followed the sound of voices speaking english calderón was quite fluent and had the eagerness of a leaping puppy yes yes he said i can see that the sense of deracination is palpable falcón sighed art conversations he knocked on the door maddy tore it open with a sardonic smile on her face calderóns eyes behind her right shoulder were staring wild with dilated pupils it put falcón on the back foot for a moment inspector jefe she said juez calderón and i were having such an interesting conversation werent we falcón apologized for interrupting but the judge was needed to sign off the second body calderón pulled himself together piece by piece as if he was picking up his clothes in a strange womans bedroom your mobile was switched off said falcón maddy raised an eyebrow calderón looked around the room to make sure he was leaving nothing incriminating he gave an uncomfortably protracted goodbye speech whilst holding on to sra krugmans hand which he kissed at the end he shambled down the stairs like a schoolboy with a decent report in his satchel and stopped halfway youre not coming inspector jefe ive a question for sra krugman calderón made it clear he would wait you must go off and do your work juez said maddy giving him a dismissive little wave a herd of emotions ravaged calderóns face hope delight disappointment longing jealousy anger and resignation they left him trampled he stumbled down the remaining stairs unable to coordinate his feet your question inspector jefe she said her look as level as the seas horizon he asked to see the shots of sr vega in his garden again she went into the darkroom and laid the prints out on the table falcón pointed to the top corner of the shots smoke he said he was burning stuff she said he quite often burnt papers down there how often since the beginning of the year quite a lot and all your shots are from this year she said although he didnt become a regular down at the river until march you knew he was disturbed by something said falcón annoyed by her now i told you its not my business she said and you seem to be confused yourself as to whether its suicide or murder he turned without a word and headed for the door hes a very sensitive and intelligent man the juez she said hes a good man said falcón and hes a happy man too theyre a rarity once they get over thirty said maddy why do you say that i see more men down at the river than i do women women have a talent for remaining connected to the world said falcón they find it easier to talk theres no secret to it said maddy we just get on with it men like marty for instance get sidelined by trying to answer unanswerable questions they allow things to complicate in their minds falcón nodded and set off down the stairs she stood at the top folded her arms across her chest and leaned against the wall so why is the juez so happy hes getting married later this year said falcón without turning do you know her she asked is she nice yes said falcón and he turned to the door lighten up she said in english hasta luego inspector jefe chapter wednesday th july falcón understood those words perfectly and he strode back to the vegas house in a fury that was only broken by the sight of the maid walking off towards avenida de kansas city he caught up with her and asked her whether shed bought any drain cleaner recently she hadnt ever he asked her when was the last time shed cleaned the kitchen floor sra vega who was obsessed with the idea that mario would catch germs from a dirty floor had insisted that it was done three times a day mario had already gone across to consuelo jiménezs house before she cleaned the floor for the last time yesterday evening the ambulance containing the two bodies pulled away as he arrived back at the vegas house the front door was open calderón was smoking in the hallway felipe and jorge nodded to him as they left with their forensic kits and evidence bags falcón closed the door behind them against the heat what did you ask her said calderón pushing himself away from the wall i saw from the barbecue that vega had been burning papers i wanted to see if he was burning anything in the shots she had taken of him said falcón he was is that all said calderón both accusing and mocking falcóns anger came back to him did you get anywhere with her esteban what do you mean you were over there for half an hour with your mobile switched off i assumed you were talking about something with an important bearing on the investigation calderón dragged hard on his cigarette drew in the smoke with a rush of air did she say what we talked about i heard you talking about her photographs as i came up the stairs said falcón theyre very good said calderón nodding gravely shes a very talented woman youre the one who called her a paparazzo of the emotions that was before she talked to me about her work he said flicking his cigarette fingers at falcón its the thinking behind the photographs that makes them what they are so theyre not hola with feelings said falcón very good javier ill remember that one said calderón anything else well talk after the autopsy reports have come out said falcón ill meet sra vegas sister off the ave and take her to sra jiménez later this evening calderón nodded without knowing what falcón was talking about ill talk to sr ortega now hes the other neighbour said falcón unable to resist the sarcasm i know who sr ortega is said calderón falcón went to the front door by the time he turned back calderón was already lost in labyrinthine i thoughts i meant what i said this morning esteban what was that i think you and inés will be very happy together said falcón youre very well suited youre right he said we are thanks youd better come with me said falcón im going to lock up now they left the house and parted ways in the drive falcón shut the electric gates with a remote hed picked up from the kitchen the entrance to ortegas house was to the left of the vegas driveway and covered by a large creeper he watched calderón from its shade the man hovered by his car and appeared to be checking his mobile for messages he headed off in the direction of the krugmans house stopped paced about and gnawed on his thumbnail falcón shook his head rang ortegas bell and introduced himself over the intercom calderón threw his hands up and went back to his car thats the way esteban said falcón to himself dont even think about it the smell of raw sewage had already reached falcóns nostrils as he stood by the gate ortega buzzed him in to a stink gross enough to make him gag large bluebottles cruised the air as threatening as heavy bombers brown stains crept up the walls of the corner of the house where a large crack had appeared in the facade the air seethed with the busy richness of decay ortega appeared from around the side of the house which overlooked the lawn i dont use the front door said ortega whose hand grip was bonecracking as you can tell i have a problem with that side of the house pablo ortegas whole body expressed itself in that handshake he was compact unyielding and electric his hair was long thick and completely white and fell below the neck of his collarless shirt his moustache was equally impressive but had yellowed from smoking two creases ran from the entradas of his hairline to his eyebrows and had the effect of pulling falcón into his dark brown eyes youve only just moved in havent you asked falcón nine months ago and six weeks later this shit happens the house used to have two rooms built over a cesspit which holds the sewage for the four houses you can see around us then the previous owners built another two rooms on top of them and with the extra weight six fucking weeks after they sold me the house the roof of the cesspit cracked the wall subsided and now ive got the shit of four houses bubbling up through the floor expensive i have to take down that side of the house repair the cesspit strengthen it so it can take the additional weight and then rebuild said ortega my brother sent somebody round whos told me im looking at a bill for twenty million or whatever the fuck that is in euros insurance im an artist i didnt get round to signing the vital piece of paper until it was too late bad luck tin an expert in that particular commodity he said as i know you are weve met before we have i came to the house on calle bailén you were seventeen or eighteen most of sevilles artistic community passed through that house at some stage or other im sorry i dont remember bad business that said ortega putting a hand on falcóns shoulder id never have believed it youve been through the media mill ive read everything of course couldnt resist it drink pablo ortega was wearing blue kneelength shorts and black espadrilles he walked with his feet splayed and had immense bulbous calf muscles which looked as if they could support him through long stage runs they entered round the back of the house through the kitchen falcón sat in the living room while ortega fetched beer and casera the room was chill and odourless apart from the smell of old cigar butts it was stuffed full of furniture paintings books pottery glassware and rugs on the floor leaning against an oak chest was a francisco falcón landscape javier looked at it and felt nothing charisma said ortega returning with beer olives and capers and nodding at the painting is like a force field you dont see it and yet it has the power to suspend everybodys normal levels of perception now that the world has been told that the emperor has no clothes its easy and all those art historians that francisco so despised are endlessly writing about what an evident departure the four nudes were from his other work im with francisco theyre contemptible they delighted in his fall but do not see that now all theyre doing is writing about their own failures charisma we are kept in such an ordinary state of boredom that anybody who can light up our life in any way is treated like a god francisco used to substitute the word genius for charisma said falcón if you have mastered the art of charisma you dont even need genius he certainly knew that quite right said ortega guffawing back into the armchair we should get down to business said falcón yes well i knew something was going on when i saw that ratfaced bastard out there smug and comfortable in his expensive lightweight suit said ortega im always suspicious of people who dress well for their work they want to dazzle with their carapace while their emptiness seethes with all forms of dark life falcón scratched his neck at ortegas melodrama who are we talking about that that cabron juez calderón said ortega it even rhymes ah yes the court case with your son i didnt he was the cabron who made sure that sebastián went down for such a long time said ortega he was the cabron who pushed for the maximum sentence that man is just the letter of the law and nothing else he is all sword and no scales and in my humble opinion for justice to be justice you have to have both i was only told about your sons case this morning it was everywhere said ortega incredulous pablo ortegas son arrested pablo ortegas son accused pablo ortegas son blah blah blah always pablo ortegas son never sebastián ortega i was preoccupied at the time said falcón i had no mind for current affairs the media monster ate its fill said ortega snarling and scoffing at the end of his cigar do you see your son at all he wont see anybody hes shut himself off from the rest of the world and his mother his mother walked out on him walked out on us when he was only eight years old said ortega she ran off to america with some fool with a big dick and then she died when was that four years ago breast cancer it affected sebastián very badly so he knew her he spent every summer with her from the age of sixteen onwards said ortega stabbing the air with his cigar none of this was taken into consideration when that cabron he ran out of steam shifted in his chair his face crumpled in disgust it was a very serious crime said falcón i realize that said ortega loudly its just that the court refused to accept any mitigating circumstances sebastiáns state of mind for instance he was clearly mentally deranged how do you explain the behaviour of someone who kidnaps a boy abuses him lets him go and then gives himself up when his time came to defend himself in court he said nothing he refused to dispute any point of the boys statement he took it all none of that makes any sense to me i am not an expert but even i can see he needs treatment not prison violence and solitary confinement have you appealed it all takes time said ortega and money of course which has not been easy i had to move from my house why my life was made impossible they wouldnt serve me in the cafes or the shops people would cross the street if they saw me for my sons sins i was being ostracized it was intolerable i had to get out and now here i am alone with only the shit and stink of others for company do you know sr vega asked falcón seizing his opportunity i know him he introduced himself about a week after i moved in here i rather admired him for that he knew why id ended up here there were photographers in the street he walked straight past them welcomed me and offered me the use of his gardener i asked him over for a drink occasionally and when i had the trouble with the cesspit he gave his opinion sent round a surveyor and costed it all out for me for nothing what did you talk about over drinks nothing personal which was a relief i thought he might be you know when people come round to your door and want to be your friend i thought he might have a prurient interest in my sons misfortunes or want to associate himself with me in some way there are plenty of people out there whod like to add another dimension to their social standing but rafael despite his apparent charm was enclosed everything went in but not a lot came out on a personal level if you wanted to talk about politics that was a different matter we talked about america after september th for instance that was interesting because he was always very right wing i mean he thought jose maria aznar a little too communist for his liking but then the world trade centre came down and he maintained that the americans had that coming to them he didnt like americans asked falcón no no no que no he liked americans he was very friendly with that couple from next door marty is working for him and im sure rafael was interested in fucking his wife really no i was just being mischievous or perhaps giving you a more general truth wed all like to fuck maddy krugman have you seen her falcón nodded what do you think why did he think the americans had it coming to them he said they were always messing about in other peoples politics and when you do that things blow up in your face nothing specific then just bar talk but quite surprising given that he liked americans and he was going there on holiday this summer said ortega kissing the end of his cigar another thing he said about americans was that theyre your friends while youre useful to them and as soon as you stop making money for them or giving them help they drop you like a stone their loyalty is measured it has no faith in it i think those were his words what did you make of that judging by his vehemence it seemed to come from direct experience probably in business but i never found out what that was how often have you seen him this year two or three times mostly to do with the cesspit did you notice any difference in him since last year silence while ortega smoked with narrowing eyes has he killed himself thats what were trying to determine said falcón so far we have discovered that there was a change in him at the end of last year he became more preoccupied he was burning papers at the bottom of his garden i didnt notice anything but then our relationship was not intimate the only thing i remember was in the corte ingles in nervion one day i came across him picking over leather wallets or something as i approached to say hello he looked up at me and i could see he was completely spooked as if i was the ghost of a longlost relative i veered away and we didnt speak that was probably the last time i saw him a week ago have you noticed any regular visitors to the house or any unusual ones said falcón any nighttime visitors look i know im here all the time especially these days with the work not coming my way but i dont spend my days looking over the fence or squinting between the blinds what do you do with your time yes well i spend an uncomfortable amount of it inside my own head more than i should or want to what did you do last night i got drunk on my own a bad habit i know i fell asleep right here and woke up freezing cold from the air conditioning at five in the morning when i asked you about visitors to the vegas i didnt mean anything look the only regulars i saw were lucias parents and the tough bitch from across the road who used to take care of the kid occasionally the tough bitch consuelo jiménez you dont want to cross her javier shes the kind that only smiles when shes got a mans balls in a vice youve had some disagreements no no i just recognize the type what type is that asked falcón unable to resist the question the type that doesnt like men but is unfortunately not a lesbian and finds they have to go to men for their demeaning sexual needs this leaves them in a permanent state of resentment and anger falcón chewed the end of his pen to stop himself smiling it sounded as if the great pablo ortega had offered his outstanding services and been rebuffed she likes children that one said ortega she likes little boys running around her legs the more the better but as soon as they grow hair ortega grabbed a great tuft of his white chest hair and flicked his head up in disdain it was a perfect cameo in which male foolishness and female pride met in the same body falcón laughed ortega basked in the acclaim from his audience of one you know he said topping up his glass with cruzcampo offering it to falcón who refused the best way to meet women falcón shook his head dogs you have dogs i have two pugs a big burly male called pavarotti and a smaller darkerfaced female called callas do they sing no they crap all over the garden where do you keep them not in here with my collection all over the floor theyll cock their leg over a masterpiece and ill do something unforgivable your collection you dont think i live in this sort of mess all the time i had to move my collection in here when the cesspit cracked said ortega anyway let me finish with the dogs pugs are the perfect way to start talking to a lone woman theyre small unthreatening a little ugly and amusing perfect they always work with women and children the children cant resist them is that how you met consuelo jiménez and lucia vega he said winking perhaps you dont realize this i should have made it clear sra vega has been murdered murdered he said getting to his feet beer spilling into his lap she was suffocated with her pillow you mean he killed her and then himself what about the boy he was at sra jiménezs house at the time my god this is a tragedy he said going to the window thumping it with his fist and looking out into the garden for some reassurance what you were saying about sra vega you didnt have an affair with her did you an affair he said terrible things now occurring to him no no no que no i just met her on that little bit of park walking the dogs shes not really my type she was rather fascinated by my celebrity that was all what did you talk about i dont remember i think shed seen me in a play or what did we talk about when did this happen march some time you winked when you mentioned her name that was just some ridiculous braggadocio on my part falcóns pen hovered over his notebook he was running some memory footage of fifteen months ago through his mind the photographs that raúl jiménez had hanging on his wall behind his desk in the apartment in the edificio presidente celebrities whod dined at his restaurants but also the people from the town hall the policemen and the judiciary and that was where hed seen pablo ortegas face before you knew raúl jiménez said falcón well i occasionally ate at his restaurants said ortega relieved i remember you from one of his photographs he kept at home celebrities and important people i cant think how that happened raúl jiménez loathed the theatre unless of course thats it my brother ignacio he knew raúl my brothers company installs airconditioning systems ignacio would ask me to receptions when he wanted to impress people that must have been it so you knew consuelo jiménez before you moved here by sight said ortega have you ever managed to interest sra krugman in your dogs my god javier youre a different breed to the other policemen ive had to deal with were just people the ones ive spoken to are much more methodical said ortega thats an observation not a criticism murder is the greatest aberration of human nature it brings out some ingenious subterfuges said falcón methodical thinking does not survive well in that illusory world acting is the most ingenious subterfuge of all time said ortega sometimes its so ingenious we end up not knowing who the fuck we are any more you should meet some of the murderers ive put away said falcón some of them have perfected the art of denial to the degree of absolute truth ortega blinked at that a horror he hadnt considered before i have to go said falcón you asked me about sra krugman and the dogs he said a little desperately she doesnt look like a dog person to me youre right now if id had a leopard in a diamond collar they left via the sliding doors into the garden ortega walked falcón round to the front gate they stood in the quiet street away from the stink a large black car rolled slowly past before picking up speed heading in the direction of avenida de kansas city ortega followed it with his eyes you know you were asking me about unusual visitors to the vegas house he said that cars reminded me that was a bmw series and there was one of those parked outside their house on th january la noche de reyes which is why i remember the date said ortega but i also remember it because of the nationality of the occupants these guys were unusual one was huge fat powerful darkhaired and brutal looking the other one was still heavy and muscular but he looked a little more human than his friend and he was fairhaired they spoke and i dont know what was said but because id been to st petersburg last year i knew that they were russians consuelo jiménezs three children and mario were playing in the pool in the late afternoon the screaming shouting and indefatigable mutual bombardment arrived heavily muffled through the double glazing only the occasional patter of water on the glass reminded them of the severity of the child artillery barrage javier nursed another beer consuelo was halfway down a glass of tinto de verano a mix of red wine ice and casera she smoked clicking her thumbnail her foot as always when distracted was nodding i see youve let mario join in said falcón i thought it best to let him lose himself in play for a bit she said the swimming ban was rafaels obsession and there doesnt seem much point i cant remember when i had that kind of energy said falcón theres nothing more beautiful than a child eyes stung with chlorine lashes spiked body trembling under towel with hunger and tiredness it overwhelms me with happiness you dont mind me claiming my drink now said falcón when i come back with marios aunt i mean ill have to take her back to her parents house it wouldnt be the same as what as seeing you like this i have one major advantage over everyone else in this investigation of yours said consuelo i know how you work inspector jefe you did invite me for a drink were all part of your world now she said helpless under your merciless observation how did you get on with the others ive just spent the last hour or so with pablo ortega performing as ever said consuelo i could never marry an actor im a monogamist and they can make a bed feel very crowded i wouldnt know no actresses before you married that little truth seeker what was her name inés of course consuelo stopped sorry i should have remembered about juez calderón this is the first time ive worked with him since your husbands murder said falcón he told me today that he and inés were getting married doubly insensitive of me said consuelo but my god thats going to be quite a truthseeking union a juez and a fiscal their first born is going to have to become a priest falcón grunted out a laugh theres nothing you can do about it javier she said you might as well laugh lighten up said falcón thats what sra krugman told me to do shes not exactly a comedy show herself has she shown you her photographs so sad said consuelo making the face of the unhappy clown ive had all that bullshit up to here juez calderón was rather impressed by them said falcón by her ass you mean yes even all the many pablo ortegas stepped down off the pedestal of his ego to pant at her i knew you had it in you said consuelo im angry with maddy krugman he said and i dont like her when a man says that it normally means he fancies her ill be joining a long queue and juez calderón will be in front of you you noticed a spectacular bomb by one of the children drenched the window consuelo went outside and told them to calm down falcón was aware of mario looking at her as if she was a goddess she came back in by the time shed closed the door the madness had restarted its a pity that they have to become us she said looking back to the pool youre not so bad said falcón the crass words out of his mouth so fast he stared bugeyed at them like a disgrace on the carpet i mean when i said that i meant you were relax javier she said drink some more beer falcón gulped down the cruzcampo bit into a fat olive and put the stone in the tray did pablo ortega ever make a pass at you he asked was that what you were trying to do then no that was that was me thinking something and it coming out yes well youre not so bad she said quoting him back youll have to do a lot better than that to improve your sex life what did pablo ortega tell you how he used his dogs to chat up women you talked about him panting after maddy and chatting up women but ive always assumed he was a closet gay or maybe just not that interested in sex she said the kids love pavarotti and callas but hes never made a pass at me and i imagine you wouldnt miss a pass from pablo ortega when it happened why do you think hes gay its just a feeling that comes off him when hes with women he likes them but hes not interested in them sexually its not just me ive seen him with maddy as well hes not panting hes showing off hes reminding everybody that hes still potent but its got nothing to do with sex he referred to you as a tough bitch said falcón i thought it was because youd turned him down well i am a tough bitch but ive never been one with him in fact ive thought that we always got on very well she said since he moved out here hes been coming round for drinks playing football with the kids swimming it was unmistakably sexual he said you only smiled when you had a mans balls in a vice that sort of thing consuelo spurted laughter but she was annoyed too i can only think that he believes that this is manly talk and that it would never get back to me said consuelo hes underestimated your capacity for intimacy javier but then i suppose intimacy between a cop and a whatever he probably thought he was safe he knew raúl didnt he said falcón i remember seeing him in the photographs behind the desk in your old apartment but not in the celebrity section pablos brother was the connection she said ignacio had worked for raúl id like to see raúls photographs again if thats possible ill let them know at the office she said the commercial world of cars repsol firestone renault flashed past as he drove down avenida de kansas city while the buildings beyond the windscreen throbbed with expended energy falcón puzzled over his intimacy with consuelo jiménez he felt comfortable with her despite what she referred to as the detectivesuspect dynamic she was now integrated into his past he thought about her sitting on her sofa in the cool of her house nodding her foot at the glass laughing with the children as she rubbed them down with their towels leading them off to the kitchen for food while he drove into the writhing beast of the metropolis which beaten by heat lay panting in its pen a sign outside the estacion de santa justa at the end of avenida de kansas city told him it was c he parked and staggered through the torpid air into the station he called perez who told him that hed persuaded sr cabello to leave his wife in intensive care he was now in sr cabellos apartment in calle de felipe ii in el porvenir waiting for the first female member of the grupo de homicidios policía cristina ferrera to replace him falcón stood at the gates of the platform for the madrid ave with a handwritten piece of paper asking for carmen ortiz a woman with black hair and big brown eyes floating in a pale frightened face approached him she had two children with her and distraught seemed a mild adjective for her condition he drove back to santa clara carmen ortiz talked at full tilt all the way primarily about her husband who was on a business trip to barcelona and wouldnt be able to fly down until the following morning the children sat looking out of the windows as if they were being moved to a more secure prison falcón murmured encouragement while sra ortiz flooded out the silence consuelo came to the door with mario clamped to her like a chimpanzee the boy after the swim had retreated into a vulnerable silence he transferred himself to carmen with a swiftness that showed his need for human contact carmen amazed them with her limitless memory for all kinds of detail from her journey consuelo listened knowing carmen ortizs purpose which was not to allow one moments silence in which the calamity of the day could jam its wedge and lever time open to reveal marios future of despair and loneliness they went to the car the whole family sat in the back the children stroked mario as if he was a damaged kitten consuelo leant in and kissed him hard on the head falcón almost heard the physical wrench as she pulled back from the car he knew about the sickening sense of plummet that was forming in the boys stomach as he started his free fall into motherless chaos the routine of love was over the woman who made you has gone he was filled with pity for the boy he drove off with his bruised cargo back into the pulsating city he took them up to sr cabellos apartment carrying the luggage they arrived in the apartment like nomads sr cabello sat in a rocking chair with unblinking eyes his grandchildren animated his lips to a tremble mario kicked and fought to hold on to his aunt perez had gone falcón and ferrera withdrew and a whimpering sense of impending doom welled up in the destroyed family they went down in the lift ferrera sighed with her head to one side as if the pain of the exchange had found its way into her neck and cricked it for good they drove in silence into the centre of town where falcón was going to drop her off she shut the car door and walked back to a crossing falcón pulled out and drove around the plaza nueva he turned right into calle mendez nunez and waited by el corte ingles as he veered away from the plaza de la magdalena and prepared to turn down calle bailén his mobile went off i dont want to sound like an idiot in my first week said cristina ferrera but i think youre being followed it was a blue seat cordoba two cars behind you i got the plates phone them through to the jefatura and get them to give me a call said falcón ill check it out in the fading light he could still distinguish colour and he picked out the seat now only a single car behind him as he eased past the hotel colón he drove past the tile shop just before his house and turned up the short driveway and parked between the orange trees he got out the blue seat stopped in front of him it seemed to be a full car he walked towards it and the car in no hurry pulled slowly away he even had time to see the plates before it turned left past the hotel londres on the corner the jefatura called him on his mobile and told him that the registration number reported by cristina ferrera did not match a blue seat cordoba he told them to report it to the traffic police to see if they could get lucky he opened up the doors to his house parked the car and closed them he felt uneasy his flesh crawled he stood in the patio and looked around listening as if he might be being burgled the noise of distant traffic came to him he went to the kitchen encarnación his housekeeper had left him some fish stew in the fridge he boiled some rice warmed the stew and drank a glass of cold white wine he ate facing the door in a strange state of expectancy after eating he did something that he hadnt done for a long time he picked up a bottle of whisky and a tumbler of ice and went to his study hed installed a grey velvet chaise longue hed moved down from one of the upstairs rooms he lay down on it with a good measure of whisky in the glass which he rested on his chest he was exhausted by the days events but sleep for many reasons was a long way off falcón drank the whisky more methodically than he approached any of his investigations he knew what he was doing it takes some purpose to blot out damage by the bottom of the third glass hed worked over mario vegas new childhood and sebastián ortegas difficult life with a famous father now it was inéss turn but he was lucky his body wasnt used to this level of alcohol and he quietly passed out with his cheek on the soft grey pelt of the chaise longue chapter thursday th july the heat did not back off during the night by the time falcón arrived at the jefatura at am the street temperature was c and the atmosphere as oppressive as an old regime the short walk from his car to the office with a hangover like a hatchet buried in his head left him gasping with odd flashes of light going off behind his eyes at one of the desks in the outer office he was surprised to find inspector ramírez already at work two thick fingers poised over the computer keyboard falcón had always doubted that he and ramírez would ever be friends since hed taken the job that ramírez had thought should have been his but hed been getting on better with his number two in the last four months since hed started fulltime work again while falcón had been suspended from duty due to depressive illness ramírez had seized the opportunity for command with both hands only to find that he didnt like it its pressures did not suit his personality not only did he lack the necessary creative streak to launch a new investigation but he could be explosive and divisive in january falcón had returned to parttime work by march he had been reinstated as inspector jefe full time and ramírez had been grateful these developments had reduced the tension within the squad they now rarely used each others ranks in addressing each other in private my god said ramírez what happened to you buenos dias josé luis it was a bad day for children yesterday said falcón i got friendly with the whisky again how did it go at the hospital ramírez stared up from the desk and javier had the vertiginous experience of teetering over two dark empty lift shafts which led directly to this mans pain and intolerable uncertainty i havent slept said ramírez ive been to early morning mass for the first time in thirty years and ive confessed my sins ive prayed harder than ive ever done in my life but it doesnt work like that does it this is my penance i must watch the sufferings of the innocent he breathed in and covered his cheeks with his hands theyre keeping her in for four days to conduct a series of tests he said some of these tests are for very serious conditions like lymphatic cancer and leukaemia they have no idea what the problem is shes thirteen years old javier thirteen ramírez lit a cigarette and smoked with one arm across his chest as if he was holding himself together he talked about the tests as if hed already confirmed to himself that she had something serious and the terrible words of future treatment were creeping into his vocabulary chemotherapy nausea hair loss crashing immune system risk of infection footage came to falcóns lurid mind of hugeeyed children beneath the perfect domes of their fragile craniums his cigarette suddenly tasted foul to ramírez who crushed it out and spat the smoke into his lap as if it was responsible for his childs health falcón talked him down reminded him that these were just tests to stay calm and positive and that he could take any time off that he needed ramírez asked to be put to work to stop his endlessly revolving thoughts falcón brought him into his office took another two aspirin and briefed him on the vega deaths perez and ferrera turned up just after am the other two squad members baena and serrano were out doing a doortodoor falcón decided to move on two fronts he would conduct a house search at the vega property while ramírez made a start on rafael vegas place of business interviewing the project managers the accountant and visiting all the construction sites they would also have to work on finding the missing gardener sergei and getting more information on the russians seen by pablo ortega on la noche de reyes visiting the vegas house where do we look for sergei asked perez well you can find out if there are any russians or ukrainians working on vegas building sites and ask them for a start i doubt hes unique if we want to search vegas office from what youve said about vázquez were going to need a warrant and we wont get one from a judge unless we can prove suspicious circumstances for which well have to wait until we get the autopsies said falcón im going to have to take someone from lucias family down to the instituto to identify the bodies ill pick them up probably around midday and see if that scrap of photograph we found in the barbecue means anything to any of them so until then we rely on the kindness of sr vázquez said ramirez hes already told me to talk to the accountant and given me his details said falcón who turned to ferrera did you get anything more on those number plates what plates asked ramirez somebody followed me home last night in a blue seat cordoba any ideas asked ramirez while ferrera called the traffic police too early to say but they didnt seem too bothered by me or that i saw their plates they were reported stolen off a vw golf in marbella said ferrera nothing more falcón and ferrera picked up the crime scene photographs from felipe and jorge and went down to the car cristina ferrera always dressed as if she was about to disappear without trace she never used makeup and had one piece of jewellery a crucifix on a chain her face was wide and flat with a nose that calmed the traffic of freckles across it she had watchful brown eyes that moved slowly in her head she made no physical impact and yet she had a strong presence which had impressed falcón in her interview ramirez had passed over her photograph on the grounds of looks alone but falcóns curiosity was piqued why should an exnun want to become a member of a murder squad her prepared answer was that she wanted to be part of a group that was engaged on the side of good against evil ramirez had warned her that there was nothing theological about murder work that in fact it was illogical the result of breakdowns and short circuits in society and nothing to do with chariot battles in heaven the inspector jefe was asking for my reasons as someone whod been thinking of becoming a nun shed said coolly it was my naive belief then that the next best institution after the church where i could do some good was the police force my ten years on the streets of cadiz have taught me that that is possible only on rare occasions falcón had wanted to give her the job there and then but ramirez wasnt finished so why did you leave your vocation i met a man inspector i fell pregnant we got married and had two children in that order asked ramirez and ferrera had nodded without taking her brown eyes off him so a fallen angel too a bride of christ whod found herself more mortal boots falcón had made his decision the transfer from cadiz had been slow but the few days shed been with his squad had convinced him that hed made the right choice even ramirez had taken her out for a coffee but that was how things changed ramirez with his daughters mystery illness had found himself searching for spiritual sustenance rather than the corporeal version he usually hunted for amongst the courts secretaries the bar flirts shopgirls and even so falcón suspected some of the hookers that crossed his path ferrera drove falcón preferred to lose himself in vague thoughts that might lead to better ideas they drove to santa clara in silence falcón liked her for that resistance to the andaluz gene for talking nonstop his thoughts moved in a slow sickly loop how men were changed by crisis ramírez had gone to church falcón had never been attracted to it it made him feel fraudulent he like sr vega had gone to the river whose draw he had to admit was not always positive there had been times when it offered him an alternative solution and hed had to pull back and rush home to the comfort of whisky they pulled up outside the vegas house falcón used the remote to open the gates to the driveway the air conditioning was still on in the house he gave ferrera a guided tour of the two crime scenes the rest of the house and the garden with sergeis accommodation he profiled the two victims as they progressed they returned to the crime scenes and went through the police photographs falcón filled in what he knew about the lead up to the crisis but did not particularly emphasize murder or suicide he wanted ferrera to look at the crime scenes from the point of view of a woman to think herself into luda vegas mind by going through her effects and then relive her actions he went into vegas study and sat at the desk below the bullfight poster the laptop had been removed and was in the lab there was only the phone and the tape outline of the position of the laptop on the desk he looked down the list of preprogrammed numbers on the phone there were office numbers and vázquezs direct line as well as the krugmans and consuelos the last number was void he picked up the phone and pressed it da zdrastvutye vasili said a voice clearly expecting someone else on the line your telephone number has been selected in our grand draw said falcón im happy to inform you that you and your wife have won a prize all you have to do is give me your name and address and i will tell you where to go to pick up your wonderful prize who are you asked the voice in heavily accented spanish name and address first please a hand went over the receiver muffled voices came down the line whats the prize name and tell me the prize he said brutally its a watch for you and your ive got a watch he said and slammed down the phone falcón made a note to ask vázquez about these russians the desk drawers revealed nothing unusual the heckler koch had been removed for tests he opened up the filing cabinets with the keys hed found the day before he flicked through the files for telephone bank insurance they were catching on something underneath a leatherbound looseleaf diary and address book the diary was private the entries were minimal most of the time there was just an x marked next to the hour and they were mostly nighttime meetings falcón went back to noche de reyes and found that there was an x marked there too the first daytime meeting was in march with dr a in june there were meetings with dr a and another with dr d in the address section he found a list of doctors medicos alvarez diego and rodríguez he flicked through the diary and found that dr r was the last doctor to see vega he called and arranged to talk to him around midday he went through the address section of the book which contained only names and telephone numbers raúl jiménezs name was there but had been crossed out as he turned the pages names he knew leapt out at him a lot of them he vaguely recalled from the raúl jiménez murder investigation people from the town hall and public works there was one name though that really took him back to that turbulent time eduardo carvajal again it had been crossed out like raúl jiménez he was dead falcón had never found what linked the two men all hed discovered was that jiménez had rewarded carvajal via a fake consultancy company during expo and at the time of his death in a car crash in on the costa del sol carvajal was about to face trial on charges relating to a paedophile ring ortegas name was also in the book and the last name to stand out was one that had him pacing around the house reminding himself that there was no art on the walls of any significance ramon salgado who had been one of sevilles bestknown art dealers was also in the book crossed out maybe vega construcciones had invested in art or bought a piece for their headquarters but there was also that disturbing memory of the child pornography theyd discovered on salgados hard disk after his brutal murder in these circles everybody knew each other links in a golden chain of wealth and influence another question for vázquez there were no russian names in the book he put it back in the filing cabinet he moved on to another cabinet which contained box files full of blueprints and photographs of buildings in the bottom drawer of the third cabinet there was a box file with no reference number it said simply justicia in the file there were pages mostly in english and mostly from this year which had been extracted from the internet on a range of subjects but primarily concerned with an international system of justice there were also newspaper articles on the international criminal court the tribunal that it was designed to replace the crusading spanish judge baltasar garzón and also the intricacies and possibilities within the belgian legal system for bringing international war criminals to justice the doorbell sounded in the hall he locked up the cabinet and went to answer it sra krugman was wearing a black linen top and a skirt biascut with a scarlet silk sash hanging down the side on the end of her long white arm was a plastic thermos jug i thought you might like some coffee inspector jefe she said spanish strength none of your american sock water here i thought thered been a coffee revolution in america he said thinking other things the levels of penetration have been uneven she said it cannot be guaranteed he let her pass closed the door to the grotesque heat he didnt want this intrusion maddy fetched cups and saucers he shouted upstairs to ferrera but she didnt want any coffee they went into vegas office and sat at the desk maddy smoked and flicked ash into her saucer she made no attempt at conversation her physical or rather sexual presence filled the room falcón still felt nauseous and he had nothing to say to her his mind raced as he drank the coffee do you like bullfights she asked looking above his head just as the silence had reached screaming point i used to go a lot he said but i havent been since for well over a year now marty wouldnt take me she said so i asked rafael we went on several occasions i didnt understand it but i liked it a lot of foreigners dont said falcón i was surprised she said at how quickly the violence became tolerable when i saw the first picadors lance go in i didnt think id be able to take it but you know it sharpens your sight you dont realize how soft focus everyday life is until youve been to a bullfight everything stands out everything is defined its as if the sight of blood and the prospect of death wakes up in us something atavistic i found myself tuning into a different level of awareness or rather an old one that the boredom in our lives has gradually smothered by the third bull i was quite used to it the brilliance of the blood welling up from a particularly deep lance wound and cascading down the bulls foreleg wasnt just bearable but electrifying we must be hardwired for violence and death dont you think inspector jefe i remember a sort of ritualistic thrill on the faces of the moroccans in tangier when they killed a sheep for the festival of aid el kebir said falcón bullfighting must be an extension of that she said theres ritual theatre thrills but theres something else too passion for instance and of course sex sex he said the whisky lurching in his stomach those beautiful guys in their tight costumes performing so gracefully with every muscle in their bodies in the face of terrible danger possible death that is the ultimate in sexiness dont you think thats not the way i see it how do you see it i go to see the bulls said falcón the bull is always the central figure its his tragedy and the greater his nobility the finer his tragedy will be the torero is there to shape the performance to bring out the bulls noble qualities and in the end to dispatch him and give us the audience our catharsis you can tell im an american she said thats not how everybody sees it said falcón some toreros believe that they are there to dominate the bull even to humiliate it and showcase their masculine prowess in the process ive seen that she said when they thrust their genitals at the bull yees said falcón nervously quite often the spectacle is a travesty even in the best arenas there have been ladies only nights and other decadence said maddy filling in greek tragedy is quite rare these days said falcón whereas soap opera isnt so how are we supposed to keep ourselves noble in such a world you have to concentrate on the big things said falcón like love compassion honour that sort of stuff it sounds almost medieval now she said silence he heard ferrera leave the house she walked in front of the study window you said something to me yesterday in english he said wanting to get rid of her now i dont remember she said did it make you angry lighten up you told me to lighten up yes well todays a different day she said i read your story on the internet last night is that why youve come over this morning im not here to scavenge whatever you might think of my photographs i thought the stories of your subjects the causes of their internal struggle were not your concern this isnt about my work unfortunately this is about mine i have to get on sra krugman so if youll excuse me he said the front doorbell rang he went to open it i locked myself out inspector jefe said ferrera maddy krugman sauntered out between them ferrera followed falcón to the study where he sat back in the chair tell me he said staring out of the window wondering what maddy krugman was after sra vega was a manic depressive said ferrera we know she had trouble sleeping theres quite a range of drugs in his bedside table that was locked as i remember and the keys are here lithium for instance said ferrera he was probably handing the drugs out to her or so he thought i found a duplicate key in her wardrobe along with a secret stash of eighteen sleeping pills theres plenty of evidence of obsessivecompulsive behaviour in there too i also found a lot of chocolate in the fridge and more ice cream in the freezer than a small child could possibly eat what about her relationship with her husband i doubt they were having sex given her condition and the fact that he was handing out the drugs to her said ferrera he was probably getting his sex from elsewhere but that didnt stop her buying an extensive range of sexy underwear what about the child she had a picture of her and the child just after the birth on her bedside table she looks fantastic radiant beautiful and proud i think its a photograph she looked at a lot it reminded her of the woman she used to be postnatal depression could be said ferrera she didnt go out much theres stacks of mailorder catalogues under the bed she let the child sleep over at a neighbours house quite often difficult to cope when your life runs away from you like that said ferrera her eyes dropping to the lipsticksmeared coffee cup was she that neighbour no another one said falcón shaking his head she didnt look the mothering type so what do you think happened here asked falcón theres enough despair in this house to lead you to believe that having decided to kill himself he would have had to kill her to put her out of her misery why did he dislocate her jaw to knock her out doesnt that seem too violent she was probably groggy with sleep anyway perhaps he did it as a way of finding the violence in himself said ferrera or perhaps she heard the death agonies of her husband and surprised the murderer who then had to deal with her said falcón wheres the pad sr vega wrote his note on good question it hasnt been found but its possible that it was an old piece of paper he had in his dressing gown pocket who bought the drain cleaner not the maid said falcón do we know when it was bought not yet but if it was from a supermarket it wont be much help it looks as if sra vega was on her own that night indulging herself as usual said ferrera she spends a lot of time on her own and shes well prepared for it youre always on your own with mental illness said falcón she has a box of her favourite videos and dvds all romantic stuff theres a dvd still in the machine she gets the call from her neighbour so the child is taken care of she has no responsibilities when did her husband get home im told it was normally quite late around midnight that would fit put off coming home to the despair for as long as possible said ferrera sra vega probably didnt like seeing him anyway she heard the car or maybe not through these windows so she more likely heard him come into the house from the garage she turned off the dvd and ran upstairs leaving her slippers he eventually joined her in bed or at least how do you know he joined her his pillow was undented in the crime scene shots but the sheets and covers were pulled out so he might have been about to join her and then been distracted by something else do we know from the phone company if there were any more calls after the neighbour rang about the child not yet you can work on that when we get back the only other oddity ive come across is that in the crime scene photographs hes got his watch on with the face on the outside of his wrist but in the photos ive seen elsewhere in the house he always wore it with the face on the underside of his wrist what do you conclude from that it either worked its way round in his struggle with himself or an assailant said ferrera or the watch has come off and been put back on his wrist by somebody who doesnt know how he wears it why would someone want to do that well if it came off as a result of a struggle with an assailant whose ultimate aim was to make this look like a suicide it would be less indicative of another persons presence if the watch was on his wrist rather than on the floor what sort of a strap did his watch have it seems to be a metal bracelet type which can come off easily in a struggle or just as easily work its way round a wrist so whatever that was a good piece of observation said falcón it might not help us form a case for murder but it is indicative of the strange circumstances of the crime scene now all weve got to do is find the incontrovertible proof that will convince juez calderón that we have a case we know sr vega was burning things at the bottom of the garden what does that imply to you he was getting rid of things in preparation for something they were personal things letters and photographs and they caused him great distress so he didnt want them discovered he was hiding them and now if you were sr vega and you wanted to hide something where would you put it in my territory either here in my study or in the butchers room ive searched the study said falcón they went into the butchers room ferrera turned on the harsh neon lights and falcón walked around the wooden chopping block putting on latex gloves they opened up the first freezer cabinet and he started taking out the blocks of meat when all the meat was out of the cabinets ferrera crawled into the dark frozen holes with a pen torch in her mouth and a knife to scrape away at the frost on the sides of the freezers at the back in a corner of the second freezer she found what they were looking for a plastic package encrusted in ice she passed it out they returned the meat to the cabinets the package was a small freezer bag with a wire twist at its neck inside was an argentinian passport issued in buenos aires in may in the name of emilio cruz the photo was of rafael vega in a pair of oldfashioned heavyframed glasses there was also a single key with no label this was an escape route said falcón what are the implications of that well if he had an escape route into the life of emilio cruz said ferrera then hed probably already escaped into the life of rafael vega so we now check vegas id card right back to its original issuing office said falcón chapter thursday th july in consuelo jiménezs office they sorted through her husbands old photos finding ones that included pablo ortega andor rafael vega they headed out of the old city to dr rodríguezs surgery which was in a barrio next to nervión on the way the médico forense called falcón to say that the autopsies were complete and both bodies ready for identification ferrera called carmen ortiz and told her to prepare herself to go down to the institute anatómico forense dr rodríguez was running late and falcón sat down with el pais he skimmed past a photo of six drowned moroccans on the beach at tarifa victims of another failed attempt to get into europe his eye settled on an article about the trial of slobodan milosevic at the international criminal tribunal in the hague or rather a sidebar which was giving an update on a strange continuing phenomenon since the beginning of july when the rome statute of the permanent international criminal court had entered into force the americans for reasons that were not clear had been persuading governments who had signed the treaty to declare that they would not press or put up for trial any us citizen for prosecution by the icc they gave a list of the countries wavering under american pressure but no more information the nurse called him in to dr rodríguezs consulting room the doctor was in his late thirties he dried his hands on paper towels while inspecting falcóns credentials they sat falcón told him of sr vegas death the doctor pulled up vegas file on the computer on th july this year you had an appointment with sr vega said falcón as far as i can tell that was the only time you saw him this year it was the only time ever he was a new patient his records came to me from dr alvarez his diary showed that he had an appointment with a dr diego before he came to you the notes came from dr alvarez maybe he saw a dr diego and decided that he wasnt right for him was there any indication from the consultation or the notes sent to you by dr alvarez that sr vega was suicidal he had some hypertension but nothing catastrophic he was suffering from anxiety and he described a number of incidents which sounded like classic panic attacks he assumed the cause was from pressure of work according to dr alvarezs notes hed been suffering mild anxiety since the beginning of the year but it wasnt sufficiently serious to prescribe anything did dr alvarez mention that sr vegas wife had an advanced mental illness she was taking lithium he didnt which i presume means he didnt know about it said rodríguez that would certainly have contributed to sr vegas stress do you know why sr vega stopped seeing dr alvarez theres nothing specific in the notes but i noticed that dr alvarez had been recommending some psychological therapy when i put this to him myself he was very resistant to the idea so its possible they had a disagreement about that so the mild anxiety was probably developing into something more serious and he was hoping for a different approach from you my approach was to reduce his anxiety with a mild drug and then when he was feeling more in control persuade him into some form of therapy did he talk about any sleep problems he mentioned a sleepwalking incident his wife had woken up at three in the morning to see him leaving the bedroom when she questioned him about it the next day he had no recollection of it so he did talk about his wife when describing that incident yes but he also said his wife could not be relied upon because she took sleeping pills there was something else that had happened which had convinced him that the sleepwalking had occurred but he wouldnt be drawn on it said rodríguez it was the first consultation remember i thought there would be time to coax things out of him later did you think he was a danger to himself obviously i didnt mental disturbances of the sort he was suffering are not uncommon i have to make decisions on the basis of a snapshot of a mans life he was not extremely agitated nor was he preternaturally calm those two extremes being indicators of danger there was no history of depression he had come to me from someone else he seemed to be trying to tackle his problem he wanted something to reduce his level of anxiety and he didnt want another panic attack these are all positive signs it sounds as if he wanted a quick fix no therapy men are more resistant to the idea of discussing their private thoughts or shameful deeds with someone else said rodríguez if their problems can be solved with a pill so much the better there are plenty of doctors who believe we are bundles of chemicals and that psychopharmacology is the answer so in your opinion sr vega was troubled but not suicidal it would have been good to have known about his wife said rodríguez if you have pressure at work and no respite at home and possibly no love that is a situation that can tip a troubled mind into despair falcón sat wedged into the corner of the car ferrera driving he was already questioning his instincts on day two of the investigation so far there was no conclusive evidence to support a murder inquiry the suicide option was looking stronger with every interview even if there were no matching fibres from the pillow found under sr vegas fingernails that was still only an indicator that somebody else might have been there it wasnt positive proof ramírez called from the offices of vega construcciones to say that sergei was a legal immigrant and serrano and baena now had a photograph and were circulating with it around santa clara and the poligono san pablo the cabellos lived in the penthouse of a block built in the seventies in the upmarket barrio of el porvenir opposite the bingo hall on calle de felipe ii youre never too rich to play bingo said falcón as they went up to the apartment where carmen ortiz was having a hysterical attack she was in the bedroom with her husband who had arrived from barcelona that morning the ortiz children with mario between them were sitting on the sofa subdued it was the old man sr cabello whod answered the door he led them into the sitting room ferrera knelt down with the children and had them playing and giggling in a matter of moments sr cabello went to find his daughter but returned with his soninlaw they went into the kitchen she doesnt want to see the bodies said the son inlaw theyll be behind a glass panel said falcón theyll look as if theyre asleep ill go said sr cabello composed and determined how is your wife asked falcón stable but still in intensive care unconscious id appreciate it if you could take me to the hospital afterwards falcón sat in the back of the car with sr cabello while ferrera took on the prelunch traffic the old man rested his workers hands in his lap and stared straight into the intricacies of ferreras pinnedup plait when was the last time you saw lucia asked falcón we were there for sunday lunch with sr vega he came for lunch hed been out driving his new car how was your daughter i think you already know by now that she was not well she has not been well since mario was born he said it was never easy to see her in that state but there was nothing extraordinary about that particular lunch it was the same as always i am going to have to ask you some questions which might be painful said falcón you are the closest family and it is only through you that we can begin to understand the domestic situation between your daughter and sr vega did he kill her asked sr cabello turning his wounded eyes on falcón for the first time we dont know were hoping for clarification from the autopsy do you think he could have killed her that man was capable of anything said sr cabello with no drama mere fact falcón waited in silence he was a cold man said sr cabello a ruthless man a man that never allowed anyone too close he never talked about his dead parents or any member of his family he did not love my daughter even before her problems when she was a beautiful young woman when when she sr cabello closed his eyes to memories his jaw muscles worked over his grief were you aware of any difference in your sonin laws behaviour since the beginning of this year only that he was even more withdrawn than usual said sr cabello whole meals would pass in silence did you remark on it he said it was work that he was managing too many projects at once we didnt believe him my wife was sure he had a woman somewhere and it had all gone wrong why did she think that no reason shes a woman she sees things i dont see she sensed that the trouble was in the heart and not the head was there anything specific that led you to believe that he had a mistress he was not often at home with lucia she would go to bed before he arrived back from whatever he was doing and sometimes he would be gone by the time she woke up said sr cabello so there was that and the way he had always been with our daughter his neighbours said that mario appeared to be very important to him that is true he was very fond of the boy and lucia found it difficult to cope with his energy as that puta of a disease took hold of her mind said cabello no i dont say that he was all bad and certainly he would not have appeared bad to an outsider he understood the necessity for charm it was only by living close to him that you saw his true nature when did you spend time with him on holidays down at the coast he was supposed to be relaxed then but in many ways he was worse constant company made him uneasy i think the idea of family made him sick do you know what happened to his parents he said they were killed in a car accident when he was nineteen years old you know more than his lawyer he wouldnt tell carlos vázquez that sort of thing he told him that his father had been a butcher said falcón and how he used to punish him youve seen the room he has in his house said cabello he gave carlos vázquez an explanation he never told me what his father had done to him you see he is not a normal man he is at heart a suspicious man because he believes that people are like he is himself lucia didnt like the butchery that only started after mario was born before then she didnt mind were you surprised that she wanted to marry him it was a difficult time they were stopped at a traffic light an african boy walked between the cars hatless in the full sun selling newspapers sr cabello seemed to need movement to get himself talking the lights changed as i told you lucia was a beautiful woman said cabello embarking on a story that hed built inside himself over years there was no shortage of men who wanted to marry her and she married a man whose father had a large farm outside cordoba they went to live in a house on the farm and they were very happy until lucia did not conceive she went for tests they told her that there was nothing wrong with her and that perhaps they should consider ivf the husband refused lucia always thought that he was afraid to find that he had a problem things were said in the heat of the moment that could not be undone and the marriage was dissolved lucia came back to live with us she was twentyeight years old by now and had missed out on the best of her generation i still owned these pieces of agricultural land in and around seville they werent big pieces of land but some of them were strategic without them an area could not be successfully developed a lot of developers knocked on my door and one of the most persistent was a nameless person represented by carlos vázquez lucia had been working for the banco de bilbao they had a caseta at the feria de abril every year lucia was a beautiful dancer she lived for the feria de abril and went every night all night she looked forward to that time of year it was a week in which she could forget about all her problems and be herself thats where she met him he was an important client at the bank he was twenty years older than her said falcón shed missed out on her own generation all the eligible men were taken she had no interest in what was left then an important man took an interest in her her superiors at the bank were happy about it they started to take notice of her she was promoted he was already wealthy he had found his place in the world there was certainty with him all these things were very seductive to someone who thought theyd been left on the shelf what did you think we told her to make sure that a man of that age still wanted to have a family were you surprised that he hadnt been married before but he had been married before inspector jefe yes i forgot sr vázquez mentioned a death certificate that had to be supplied we know only that she came from mexico city she might have been mexican but were not sure as always with rafael we were told the minimum that was relevant to us were you concerned that his reticence was because of a criminal past well now inspector jefe you have uncovered my shame i was prepared to overlook his reticence my financial circumstances then were not like they are now i had land but no job capital but no income rafael vega solved those difficulties for me he made me a partner in a business that paid a large sum of money for several plots of my land we built apartments financed by the banco de bilbao and rented them out he made me wealthy and gave me an income thats how an old farmer like me lives in a penthouse in el porvenir what did sr vega get out of it apart from your daughters hand in marriage one of the other plots i sold to him separately was the key that unlocked a very large development for him in triana and there was a second plot which one of his competitors wanted very badly when that plot came into rafaels hands they had to sell out to him it meant that he could be more generous to me than any other developer so he didnt have to marry your daughter said falcón he was offering you a very sweet deal anyway i have the mentality of a farmer that land was only going to go to someone who would marry my eldest daughter i am oldfashioned and rafael is a traditionalist he knew the key to unlock the problem his meeting of lucia was no accident it is my shame that i allowed the business to cloud my judgement of the man i had no idea how cold a brute he would be to her was he violent never if he had beaten her that would have been the end of it said cabello he reduced her i mean he this is difficult he was reluctant to perform his marital duties he implied it was her fault that she was not making herself attractive to him one thing did the death certificate of his previous wife give a cause of death accidental he told us she drowned in a swimming pool did he have any children from this previous marriage he said not he said he wanted children so it was strange that he didnt want to do what was necessary to make them happen did you know of any previous relationships here before he met lucia no lucia hadnt heard of any either falcón took out the plastic sachet containing the partial photograph of the girl that vega had burnt at the bottom of the garden do you recognize this person cabello put on glasses shook his head she looks foreign to me he said they arrived at the instituto on avenida sánchez pizjuan and parked in the hospital grounds falcón found the médico forense who showed them into the room for the body identification and left them there for a few minutes sr cabello started to pace the room nervous at what hed let himself in for his daughter dead on the slab the médico forense returned and opened the curtains sr cabello stumbled forwards and had to put a hand up on the glass to steady himself with the fingers of his other hand he dug into his skull through his thinning hair as if he was trying to tear this unnatural image from his brain he nodded and coughed against the violence of the emotion falcón drew him away from the glass the médico forense supplied the paperwork and sr cabello put his signature to his daughters death they went outside into the fierce heat and light whose savagery had sucked all colour from everything so that the trees seemed vague buildings merged with the white sky and only dust looked as if it belonged in this place sr cabello had shrunk in his suit his thin neck loose in its collar jumped and gasped as he tried to swallow what hed just seen falcón shook his hand and eased him into the car cristina ferrera took the old man round to the hospital entrance falcón called calderón and arranged a meeting for seven oclock to discuss the autopsies he went back into the chill of the morgue he sat with the médico forense in his office the two autopsy reports open on the desk the doctor puffed on a ducados whose smoke was sucked up into the air conditioning unit and spat out into the crushing heat lets start with the easy one said the doctor sra vega was suffocated to death by the application of a pillow over her face she was probably unconscious while this was happening due to a severe slap across the face which dislocated her jaw its probable that the heel of the hand made contact with her chin the médico forense gave an unintentionally comical slowmotion replay of the blow his cheek jowl and lips shunting to one side into a slobbery air kiss very graphic doctor said falcón smiling sorry inspector jefe he said more selfconscious now you know how it is long days in the company of dead people the heat the holidays nearly nearly there the family already at the coast i forget who im with sometimes its all right carry on doctor youre helping me said falcón what about time of death its important for us to know if she died before or after sr vega im not going to be much help to you on that their deaths occurred within the same hour their body temperatures were nearly the same sra vega was only slightly warmer the ambient temperatures were the same in the kitchen and the bedroom but sr vega was lying bare chested on a tiled floor while his wife was in bed with her face under a pillow i wouldnt be able to stand up in court and say with any conviction that shed died after her husband all right what about sr vega he died directly as a result of the ingestion of a corrosive liquid cause of death was a combination of effects on his vital organs hed suffered renal failure liyer and lung damage it was a real mess in there the composition of what he ingested is interesting i seem to remember it was a regular brand of drain cleaner thats right harpic well normally those gels are a mixture of caustic soda and disinfectant the caustic element would be about a third of the contents of course that would do your system no good at all but it would take time for it to kill a grown man in good health this product killed him in less than quarter of an hour because it had been powerfully boosted with hydrochloric acid how easy is that to get hold of any hardware store would sell it to you under the name of muriatic acid its used for cleaning cement off paving stones for instance well check his garage said falcón making a note theres no going back once youve ingested something that strong irreparable damage would be done to the throat digestive tract and in this case the lungs as well how did it get into the lungs its very difficult to tell what damage was caused by force or violence and what was caused by the corrosiveness of the liquid i would say that he or someone else had rammed the bottle down his throat under those circumstances some of the liquid would inevitably find its way into the lungs theres evidence of corrosive action in the nasal passages so product was being coughed up with the mouth occupied by the bottle the only way out was via the nose you seem to think he could have accomplished this on his own i have to say thats doubtful but not impossible if you were going to kill yourself in this horrible way i imagine that you would try and put yourself beyond rescue by making sure you ingested as much of the product as possible in the first moments i think there would be a certain amount of nervousness involved too and that would cause you to ram the neck of the bottle down your throat that of course would also set off the gagging mechanism i think it would be a messy business unless there was someone holding the bottle in place and holding the victim steady as well the floor was clean apart from some droplets close to the neck of the bottle there was spotting on his chest and clothes but nothing like the quantities youd expect if he gagged and spurted it out all over any evidence of holding marks on arms wrist neck head nothing on the wrists there are burn marks on the arms in the crooks of his elbows but the dressing gown had slipped down and its possible that happened as he writhed in agony on the floor there are marks on the head and neck and claw marks on the throat i would say they are selfinflicted he had product on his hands but the marks could just as easily have been made by someone holding him in a kind of neck lock you know what im trying to do here doctor said falcón ive got to go back to juez calderón and show him conclusive proof that someone else was in the room with sr vega who was responsible for his death if i cant do that there may well be no murder inquiry now if im not mistaken you think like me and the forensics that it was probably murder but conclusive proof of another partys presence is more difficult said the médico forense is there anything that would link sr vega to the death of his wife i didnt find anything sr vega had only his own tissue under his fingernails from clawing at his throat anything else whats the psychological profile of the victims she was suffering from mental illness said falcón he doesnt seem to have been suicidal but there are questionable aspects to his mental state falcón gave a brief resume of what hed been told by dr rodríguez and how disturbed vega had been since the beginning of the year i see what you mean said the médico forense this could go either way to balance that the victim had a mm handgun a surveillance system he didnt use and bulletproof windows expecting trouble or just a nervous wealthy person close to the poligono san pablo and the unused surveillance system nerves again said falcón maybe his mentally ill wife was paranoid she showed off to her neighbours about the windows or possibly vega himself wanted to discourage outsiders but not leave a record of people who came to the house because hes involved in something criminal a neighbour saw some russian visitors who didnt look like theyd come from the bolshoi theres plenty of talk about the russian mafia these days especially down on the costa del sol but i didnt know theyd reached seville said the médico forense this is a nasty way to die isnt it doctor revenge or punishment maybe an example to others what about his sex life his fatherinlaw says he was reluctant to perform his marital duties ever even before his wife got depressed the motherinlaw reckoned he was having an affair which went wrong which was why hed been so withdrawn since the beginning of the year said falcón is there anything else i should know just one curious thing hes had some cosmetic surgery done to his eyes and neck nothing extraordinary just bags removed from under the eyes and skin removed from the neck to tighten up and reveal the jawline everybodys having cosmetic surgery these days thats true and this is the curious thing the work is pretty old difficult to say exactly how old but more than ten years chapter thursday th july on the way back to the jefatura falcón drove while ferrera read the autopsy reports it was lunch time the temperature had now reached c there was no one on the streets cars bulldozed the heat down the shimmering tarmac when they arrived at the jefatura he told ferrera to leave the reports on ramírezs desk and they would reconvene at pm the heat had broken falcóns appetite at home he managed a bowl of gazpacho of which encarnación made a daily supply he could not find the energy with the heat crammed into every corner of the house to look through the jiménez photographs hed brought in from the car he went upstairs stripped and showered and collapsed into the airconditioned cool of his bedroom his brain wavered and released images of the day he lurched into sleep and a recurring dream where he entered a public toilet which was pristine until he flushed it whereupon it started filling up with sickening quantities of shit until it overflowed he found himself trapped and had to climb the walls of the cubicle only to find all the other toilets were doing the same thing so that he felt a rush of nausea followed by a deep animal panic he woke up his hair full of sweat and his mind inexplicably latched on to pablo ortega until he remembered the actors cesspit problem it was pm the shower drilled the muck out of his hair and head his mind tripped forwards and backwards under the pummelling water he knew why he had dreamt the dream another investigation his own past and the past of others all rucked up by the tragedy what he was unprepared for was his minds next leap which told him that he should go and visit pablo ortegas son sebastián in prison this would be nothing to do with his investigation just a separate mission the idea made him feel good something creaked open in his chest he felt more able to breathe he took the jiménez photographs into the study and pulled out the shots of pablo ortega there was one of pablo smiling and talking to two men one of these men was obscured by people in the foreground and the other man he did not know he took the photo with him put it on the passenger seat ramírez was typing up his report on his interviews in vegas offices and the latest on the search for sergei falcón told him about the passport in the name of emilio cruz and the key ramírez took down the details ill email this to the argentinean embassy in madrid see what they make of it said ramírez and ill put a trace right back to the original issuing office on rafael vegas id can we get something on that before the weekend not in july but we can try any news on sergei he was seen some time in the last couple of weeks in a bar on calle alvar nunez caleza de vaca with a woman who was not spanish and talked the same language as him the woman had been seen there before and the barman thought she came from the poligono san pablo he also thought she was a hooker weve got a full description and serrano and baena are working with it now falcón listened to his messages staring at the photograph hed brought up from the car calderón had postponed their meeting until the following morning he put a call through to inspector jefe alberto montes from grume grupo de menores who was responsible for crimes against children and asked if he could pass by for an informal chat ferrera arrived as he was leaving and he told her to work on the phone numbers listed beside calls in and out of the vegas house and rafael vegas mobile and then join serrano and baena looking for the woman seen with sergei what about the key we found with the passport in vegas house sergei is more important at this stage we need a witness said falcón work on the key if you have time start with the banks on the way up to montess office he dropped in on felipe and jorge in the lab he talked them through the autopsies they looked dismal they had nothing to offer from the crime scene the pillow had been clean of any sweat or saliva the only curious thing theyd come across was to do with the note in vegas hand as his lawyer said its clearly his own handwriting but we thought it interesting that he should describe it as careful so i looked at it under the microscope said felipe its traced over what do you mean hed written it before which left an indent on the page beneath then hed gone back to the pad and traced over the indent as if he wanted to see what had been written but hed written it in the first place said falcón i can only tell you the facts said felipe alberto montes was in his early fifties overweight with bags under his eyes and a nose that had exploded from excessive drinking hed undergone a psychological assessment at the end of last year because of the drinking problem and had somehow got through it he was looking at early retirement now and seemed anxious to get there he had been with the grupo de libertad sexual which investigated adult sex crimes and grume for over fifteen years and held an encyclopaedic knowledge of names and the horrors attached to them he sat turned away from his desk looking out of his secondfloor window smoking and presumably thinking of future freedom he strained water from a plastic cup through his thick moustache as if he was wishing it was whisky as falcón reached his desk he swivelled in his chair and refilled the plastic cup kidney stones inspector jefe he said they get me every summer ive been told to drink six litres of water a day what can i do for you eduardo carvajal said falcón remember him hes burnt on my heart that guy he was going to make me famous said montes why has his name suddenly reappeared im investigating the deaths of rafael and lucia vega rafael vega the constructor said montes do you know him i dont get invited to his caseta in the feria but i know who he is said montes did somebody kill him thats what were trying to find out while i was going through his address book i came across carvajal and it was a name that rang bells from that case i investigated last year he was known to and a friend of raúl jiménez i didnt have time to dig him up then so i thought id try now said falcón how was he going to make you famous he said he was going to give me all the names of everybody whod been a part of his paedophile ring ever he promised me the biggest coup of my career politicians actors lawyers councillors businessmen he said he would bring me the golden key which would open up high society and reveal it for the rotten stinking egg it really was and i believed him i genuinely thought he was going to come through with the information but he died in a car crash before he could deliver well he came off the road said montes it was late at night there was alcohol in his system and it was a very tricky series of bends from ronda to san pedro de alcántara but well never know what does that mean all this is pretty well known inspector jefe by the time id been notified hed been buried and the car was a block in a breakers yard about that big said montes holding his hands fifty centimetres apart but some people were convicted werent they montes held up four fat fingers with a cigarette burning amongst them and they couldnt help you in the same way that carvajal could they only knew each other they were one cell in the ring said montes theyre careful these people its no different to a terrorist outfit or a resistance movement how did you get to them in the first place im ashamed to have to tell you it was through the fbi said montes we cant even crack our own paedophile rings so it was international thats the internet for you said montes the fbi were running a sting operation they found a couple in idaho who were managing a child porn site and they took it over they picked up addresses from all over the world and informed the local authorities in each country its good to know that there are a lot of scared paedophiles out there but i dont think well pull in any of the people that carvajal knew im sure thats all finished why carvajal was the key man he was procuring they knew him he knew them but they didnt know each other theres nothing to hold it together but what was carvajal doing out of custody on his own that was part of the deal negotiated with his lawyer he was going to pull all the different cells together and we were going to scoop the lot in a series of raids did you find out how he was procuring not that it did us much good said montes nodding it was something that was just starting then the russian mafia involvement in people trafficking prostitution became a big thing for them because they could control the supply to control the drugs trade they had to fight for territory because they didnt have homegrown heroin or cocaine but with prostitution they had the goods from the word go and whats more they found that it was less dangerous and just as lucrative there was a romanian girl in here last week whod been bought and sold seven times believe me inspector jefe weve come full circle and were back in the slavetrade era do you mind just giving me a little resume about that the exsoviet states are full of people a lot of them are able and intelligent university lecturers technical college instructors builders public servants but hardly any of them can make a living in the post soviet era theyre trying to live off fifteen to twenty euros a month we in europe and especially in countries like italy and spain dont have enough people ive read reports saying that spain needs an extra quarter of a million people a year just to keep the country functioning and pay taxes so that the state has money to give me a pension supplyanddemand economies are the easiest to understand and are immediately exploited you need a visa to get into europe ive heard a lot of ukrainians cross the border into poland and get their visas from the embassies in warsaw portugal offers visas quite easily spain because of our moroccan problem is more difficult but its easy enough to enrol in a language school or something like that of course you need help to do this this is where the mafia steps in they will facilitate your journey they will get you a visa they will arrange transport they will charge you a minimum of a thousand dollars per head i can see youre thinking inspector jefe fifty people on a bus less a few thousand in expenses said falcón its not difficult to see how well that works theyre taking at least fortyfive thousand dollars a busload said montes but it doesnt stop there because with a bit of intimidation these are people who can also be put to work for you when they reach their destination the mafia gangs pick them off the women and children go into prostitution and the men go into forced labour its happening everywhere london paris berlin prague a friend of mine was on holiday outside barcelona last month and on the road going into roses there was a line of beautiful girls waving him down and they werent hitchhikers what sort of work do the men get put into factory work sweatshops building sites warehouses driving jobs anything menial theyre even in the greenhouses in the flatlands out towards huelva there are girls out there too four or five years ago prostitution was something you came across only if you wanted to or if you took a wrong turn in the city the redlight districts were confined now you can go to a garage in the middle of nowhere and find a girl working montes lit another cigarette while crushing out the one hed been smoking now i know that im too old for this work its not a challenge any more its something thats become overwhelming something thats got the better of me said montes you said you had another question inspector jefe hurry up before i lose myself in despair and throw myself into the car park falcón faltered over that because he could see the mans weariness feel his ingrained fatigue and colossal disappointment just kidding inspector jefe said montes im too close to the end i feel sorry for the midcareer guys theyve got a long haul i was going to ask you about sebastián ortega but it can wait for another time no no its no problem really inspector jefe i just need my annual holiday said montes sebastián ortega what about him pablo ortega is rafael vegas nextdoor neighbour the juez de instrucción on the case is esteban calderón aha yes well i shouldnt bring those two together in the same room what happened it sounds like a strange case which version did you hear i see its that complicated said falcón i heard that he kidnapped the boy sexually abused him over a number of days and released him he then waited for the police to come and arrest him thats what they pinned on him in court abduction and sexual assault which was why juez calderón and the fiscal managed to get him put away for twelve years said montes i didnt work the case so this is only what i heard but i know its true having said that the only video statement youll see in the file is the official one used in court said montes first of all sebastián ortega did not make life easy for himself he said nothing about what hed done he never put his own version of events out there so when theres nothing to contradict people feel they have an imaginative licence question number one why did he abduct the boy question number two why did he have a specially prepared room in which to keep his prisoner question number three why did he tie the boy up and the answer to all those questions in the minds of the investigators and prosecutors was that sebastián ortega planned and carried out his action in order to give himself the opportunity to sexually abuse this boy at will except he didnt he didnt what he didnt sexually abuse him or rather there was no evidence of it and the boy also said that sebastián ortega didnt touch him in that way said montes then i think the judge had a word with the investigators who spoke to the boys parents and in the subsequent video the victims statement became more persuasive or imaginative whichever you prefer so what was the purpose of the abduction they knew each other they were from the same barrio i hesitate to call them friends because of the age difference but that is more or less what they were so sebastián ortega didnt exactly have to abduct him he invited him to his flat then things got a bit strange as far as i can make out he kept him in this closed off room he had already built and tied him up but in the initial interview the boy said that although he was frightened by ortegas strangeness he was not hurt or touched in a sexual manner i dont get it said falcón so what did sebastián do he read childrens stories to him he sang songs he wasnt a bad guitarist apparently he made him meals let him drink as much coca cola as he wanted why did he tie him up because the boy said he had to go home or his father would be angry and this went on for some days everybody outside was going crazy looking for the boy the parents even called sebastián who said he was sorry but he hadnt seen the boy manolo was his name i think then one day he just gave up he let the boy go sat on the bed and waited for retribution and none of this came out in court some of it did but obviously the prosecutions emphasis was not the same as mine they made sebastián out to be more aggressive and predatory what do you make of it i think sebastián ortega is a disturbed young man who should probably not be in prison he did something wrong but not twelve years worth of wrong and your investigators the real story was too strange if you were experienced you could possibly handle it in such a way as to bring the truth to light but it was summer the two investigators were young and they were uncertain and that made them malleable the media interest in the case because of pablo ortega introduced some pressure they didnt want to appear stupid and like juez calderón they were excited by a highprofile conviction what do you think of the juezs role in this case none of my business officially said montes but personally i think his vanity got the better of him he was riding high after your case the media coverage of that was incredible hes young goodlooking good family with all the right connections and yes well thats it what were you going to say i only just remembered in time about his new wife im sorry so thats got out already has it we knew it before he did do you think juez calderón knew the reality of the case i dont know what went through his mind there were lots of unofficial discussions about it between him and my men he said that he thought the whole thing was a ludicrous fantasy planted in the boys head by a manipulative brute the court would not believe a word of it he said it would be better for the boy to give a clearer and less ambiguous account of what had happened to him the investigators talked to the parents and the boy did what he was told where were you in all this off sick hernia operation it doesnt sound as if justice was done to be fair as i told you earlier sebastián ortega did not contest any of the facts that came out in the boys video interview shown in court he did not defend himself at all there should be the possibility of an appeal but as far as i know sebastián ortega does not want that i get the impression that for some reason sebastián is where he wants to be do you think he should get some psychological help yes but he wont im told he doesnt speak any more hes gone into solitary confinement and communicates the absolute minimum falcón stood up to leave tell me do you recognize any of the men in this photograph he said and laid down the ortega shot on montess desk my god there he is the hijo de puta thats eduardo carvajal and if im not mistaken hes talking to pablo ortega and somebody i cant see said montes i should get him out of my sight unless you want to see a grown man cry inspector jefe thanks for that said falcón picking up the photograph they shook hands and he headed for the door what work did eduardo carvajal do by the way he said reaching for the door handle he was a property consultant said montes whose face had turned haggard again after its relative calm during the ortega discussion he used to work for raúl jiménez here in seville in the construction business until the late seventies early eighties he was from a wealthy family who had a lot of property in the marbella area when he left raúl jiménez he developed that land and sold it off he made contacts he knew all the right people he started finding holiday companies plots of land to build hotels he had the town halls eating out of his hand so all the building permissions and the licences went through and he had the connections for the finance he made a fortune so his big promise to you was entirely believable completely falcón nodded opened the door on the ortega case said montes i dont attach any blame to my men which doesnt mean i havent spoken to them about how to handle it next time but you need to be strong to stand up to the sort of gilded personality that is juez calderón and its his job to put together a case that will give the fiscales the best chance of success in court said falcón thats where very tricky moral decisions have to be made and juez calderón is a very able man you like him inspector jefe said montes id never have thought it ive only worked with him once on the raúl jiménez case he handled it very well he handled me very well when i was not in a fit state to be running an investigation success changes a man said montes some people are destined for a very high form of it others like me have reached their level and have to be content with it or go mad juez calderón isnt even forty years old and yet hes achieved things that some judges never do in an entire career its a hard act to maintain to reach even greater heights sometimes things have to be forced a little so that the stars distinctive glow retains its brightness judgement is affected by ambition and mistakes get made people like that fall very hard and fast do you know why inspector jefe because people like to see them broken said falcón i think there are plenty of people out there waiting said montes chapter thursday th july on the way back downstairs he stopped off and picked up sebastián ortegas file to take back home with him in the office ramírez was still hammering out his report with his big intrusive forefingers cristina ferrera had spoken to the phone company and found that the last call received at the vegas house had been from consuelo jiménez at around pm shed typed up her report and left falcón sat opposite ramírez who glared at the screen like a critic inserting exquisitely savage remarks into a review anything i should know about rafael vegas business he employed russian and ukrainian labour said ramírez some legal like sergei some not how did you find out about the nonlegal labour they didnt turn up for work today or rather they were told to go away when they did and that left two projects with skeleton crews what about the offices vázquez wouldnt let us search without a warrant but he was quite accommodating about sergei did he have anything to say about the labour force not his concern he wasnt running vega construcciones day to day he was just the lawyer with a non executive role on the board which since vegas death has become executive did you see the accountant sr dourado the golden boy yes we saw him he explained the business to us and showed us the accounts did he explain how the illegal labour force was being dealt with in the numbers were not at the specifics stage of the investigation we were talking in more general terms about structure finding out if the company was solvent if there were any financial time bombs or if there was some nasty penalty clause from a project which was eating into profits talk me through the structure of the company vega construcciones is the holding company for a collection of separate projects each project is a company with its own board comprising a representative from vega construcciones someone from the investorsventure capitalists and someone from the financial institution providing the backing i suppose its to stop a fuckup in one project bringing down the whole company said ramírez anyway the holding company has shown a decent profit for the last three years and there didnt seem to be anything going badly wrong with any of the current projects there was no catastrophe pending if it was a business problem that resulted in his death its more likely to have been something to do with the partners in the projects did you see any names not yet said ramírez how did it go at the instituto take a look when youre finished theres nothing really meaty in there that would persuade a judge that it was definitely a murder were going to have to work hard to find a motive from vegas three closest neighbours who all seemed to be benefiting from their relationship with him and who were all at home last night asleep as youd expect thats why we have to find sergei he was closest to the crime scene if anybody saw anything he did i havent had a good look at that passport yet but someone whos totally innocent doesnt keep a false document in their freezer said ramírez youve already had people drifting past your front door with stolen plates and the smell of russians is very strong down at vega construcciones so we know theres something in this case thats not right were finding things out every day eventually one of those things will be a motive ive got to go said falcón looking at his watch oh yes shrink night tonight maybe ill have to start seeing her said ramírez grinning tapping his temple she can help me straighten out my noodles still no news on your daughter not until theyre completely finished falcón drove home he needed another shower and time to relax before he saw alicia aguado as he came into the house he had the same sense of unease hed had the night before he found himself listening again he dumped the ortega file in his study and went upstairs showered and changed into jeans and a black tshirt he came back down to the kitchen and drank water he went to his study and lay down on the chaise longue he did some breathing exercises and was beginning to feel quite calm when he was transfixed by something alien on the pinboard above his desk which he hadnt seen earlier he got up slowly as if stealth was important he walked in a crouch to his desk and leaned against it on the board was a photograph of inés it had been stuck there by a pin with a red plastic head which pierced her throat by pm he was sitting in the sshaped chair in alicia aguados consulting room she put her fingers to his wrist she needed this technique even more now that shed lost the last vestiges of her sight to retinitis pigmentosa youre tired she said im at the end of the second day of a new investigation he said a double death and lots of emotional upheaval youre anxious again i had another shit dream during my siesta said falcón they always come in the afternoons weve talked about them before she said so what are you anxious about the shit dream was different this time i woke up with a clear idea in my head and a sense of purpose he told her about the sebastián ortega case what he knew about it at the time of the dream including the state of pablo ortegas house and what he discovered subsequently from montes is that a common occurrence quite often evidence thats not admissible in court shows unquestionable proof of a defendants guilt said falcón defensively police and prosecutors will then use nuance and emphasis to secure the right conviction but thats not the case here is it said aguado a victim has been manipulated to give an exaggerated account of what happened to him who was the judge on the case the conviction was never in doubt what they wanted to secure was the maximum sentence but i dont want to get into specifics and personalities said falcón the point was that i didnt know about that before the dream and yet i woke up with a strong sense of wanting to help this young man who is not connected to me in any way thats good said aguado i think so too its the most boring thing about depression the time you have to spend with yourself said falcón im glad to be breaking out of my selfabsorption what drew you to sebastián ortegas predicament there are some interesting connections there pablo ortega knew francisco falcón he was a friend of his he had even met me before when i was eighteen but i didnt remember him like francisco hes charismatic and someone who can summon up tremendous fury he also said things which i subsequently found out were not true it was quite difficult to disentangle the truth from performance its possible that he is hiding things from himself in a later interview someone said that theyd always assumed that he was either homosexual or asexual my god we are talking about pablo ortega the actor arent we yes but dont go ringing the diario de sevilla said falcón hed kill himself if that broke i can see the comparisons with your own situation she said i think ive subconsciously identified with sebastián which is why i want to help him because because i want to help myself this is good javier said aguado i just want to go back to pablo ortega that stuff about him being homosexual theres no proof it was just something that this particular interviewee had always assumed to be the case thats not what concerns me she said why was pablo ortega so angry he was furious at juez calderón so he was the judge on sebastián ortegas case as well you found me out i thought there was something more complicated at work there if there is i dont know what it is i remember you saying while you were investigating the jiménez murder that you liked juez calderón you told me that he was one of the first people youd considered a possible friend since your training in barcelona that was before i knew he was seeing inés her fingers jumped off his pulse as he said her name has something happened with inés yesterday he told me they were getting married said falcón i nearly called you weve dealt with inés i thought we had you were expecting them to get married said alicia aguado and you told me that youd accepted it the concept yes and the reality was different i was surprised at how bitterly disappointed i was by the news youll get over it thats why i didnt call you said falcón but just before i came out to see you this evening i found a photograph of her stuck up on the noticeboard above my desk with a red pin through her throat silence falcón thought he felt alicia shiver did you stick it up there she asked thats what concerns me said falcón i dont know do you think you might have done it subconsciously asked aguado i dont even recognize the photograph what about the other prints i bought a digital camera last week work has been slack until yesterday and ive been out on the streets taking snaps getting used to the technology and then downloading stuff on to the computer erasing shots printing out others throwing some stuff away you know playing around with it so i i just cant be certain maybe i did snap her without realizing it we dont live that far from each other i see her occasionally in the street as you do in seville how else could it have got on to your noticeboard i dont know i did get very drunk last night and passed out you shouldnt let this worry you said aguado but what do you think it means said falcón i dont like the idea that my mind is operating independently of me this was what was happening to one of the victims in my investigation falcón explained vegas bizarre note how hed traced over it the positive side of this incident is that it seems to indicate that by pinning inés by her throat to your board youre releasing yourself from this hold you believe she has over you well thats one interpretation said falcón there could be some darker ones dont dwell on it youre on the move keep up the momentum all right lets talk about something else sebastián ortega what do you think about his behaviour psychologically why did he do what he did id need to know a lot more about him and the case before i ventured an opinion on that my theory is that he was reliving an ideal said falcón he was being to the boy what hed wanted his father to be to him i cant comment im not asking you for a serious professional opinion and i dont give amateur ones ok so what shall we talk about thats not inés talk to me some more about juez calderón i dont know what i think about him any more he said im confused initially i was attracted by his intelligence and sensitivity then i found out that he had a relationship with inés which i couldnt and cant talk about with him now theyre getting married ive watched his star consistently rising but then i hear from others that its vanity propelling this trajectory i think you missed something out i dont think so has juez calderón done something to you not to me said falcón i cant talk about it yet not even to your clinical psychologist who youve been seeing for over a year no not yet i cant be certain about it said falcón it could have just been a moments madness now forgotten or there could be clearer intent to do someone wrong not wrong exactly although it would be wrong said falcón all i can promise you is that it has nothing to do with me the appointment finished soon after before walking javier to the door she deviated to a cabinet fumbled around and took out a dictaphone i dont mind thinking about sebastián ortega for you she said my summer is quiet since my blindness has become complete ive been getting agoraphobic the idea of hundreds of people on the beach and me amongst them makes me feel nervous im staying in town despite the heat put everything you know down on tape and ill listen to it she gave him the dictaphone and some tapes javier shook her cool white hand their professional relationship never having got beyond this formality apart from some madness on his part in the early stages of treatment but this time she pulled him to her and kissed him on both cheeks good night javier she said as he walked down the stairs and remember the important thing is that youre a good man falcón left the coolness of her consulting room and stepped into the thick heat in the street he walked and did what alicia had told him not to do he dwelt on that photograph of inés pinned to his board without thinking he crossed a road and found himself in front of the old tobacco factory which had now been incorporated into the university hed overshot the edificio de los juzgados where hed parked the car he crossed avenida del cid and backtracked through the walkways of the palacio de justicia someone called his name the sound of the voice was like a womans hands coming up his chest from behind the skipping heels on the pavement told him before hed turned that he was going to see inés congratulations he said his lips fluffing the word she looked blank as they kissed hello esteban told me yesterday said falcón she put her hand to her mouth as if that would obscure her memory struggle and then rolled her eyes im sorry i wasnt thinking she said thank you javier im very happy for you he said isnt it a bit late for you to be working esteban told me to meet him here at have you seen him today she asked he postponed our meeting until tomorrow hes always here at this time of night i dont know what could what did the security guard say that he left at six and hasnt been back youve tried his mobile its switched off he switches it off all the time now too many people want to talk to him she said well can i give you a lift somewhere inés left a message with the security guard and they got into falcóns car they drove down cristobal colón and agreed to have a tapa in el cairo on reyes catolicos they sat at the bar and ordered beers and a tapa of piquillo peppers stuffed with hake he asked her about the wedding she spoke with her mind only half on the job looking at every face that walked by the window falcón sipped his beer and murmured encouragement until she turned on him and gripped his knee with her long white manicured nails has he been all right she asked you know in his work i dont know ive been working this case with him out in santa clara but only since yesterday santa clara at the end of avenida de kansas city i know where santa clara is she said annoyed but her irritation instantly broke and she was staring at him with her big brown eyes in the way that she did when she wanted something he said he said what inés nothing she said and released his knee he seems a little anxious recently only because hes made it official now the announcement what difference does that make she said hanging on falcóns every syllable desperate for insight into the male psyche you know total commitment no going back he was committed before its official confirmed to the world it can make a man nervous that sort of thing you know the end of youth no more playing around family adult responsibilities all that stuff i see she said not seeing it at all you mean theres doubt no no no que no said falcón theres no doubt just a nervousness at the prospect of change hes thirtyseven never been married before its just a reaction to the future physical and emotional upheaval physical she said sitting on the edge of her seat youre not going to stay in his apartment are you said falcón youll get a house start a family did esteban talk to you about this she said searching his face for the least sign of a tic im the last person wed always said that wed buy a place in the centre of town she said we wanted to be in the old city in a big house like yours maybe not so mad and enormous but in that classic style ive been looking for months mostly at old properties that need work and guess what esteban said last night that hes found somewhere said falcón unable to stop the thought flashing through his mind that inés had only married him for his house that he wants to live in santa clara falcón stared into those big frightened eyes and felt something like slowmotion wreckage forming in his mind consonants caught in his throat like fish bones exactly she said leaning back almost in triumph its the antithesis of what wed always talked about falcón drained his beer ordered more stuffed the pepper into his mouth messily what does it mean javier it means he said hurtling towards tragic revelations and veering off at the last moment it means that its part of the emotional upheaval when everything in your life changes at once you change with it but more slowly i know ive become an expert in these matters of change she nodded gulping the words down into her chest where she could treasure them until her eyes flickered and she shot off the bar stool and leapt at the door esteban she roared down the street better than any fishwife calderón stopped as if hed been knifed in the chest he turned and falcón expected to see the hilt jutting out of his ribs but instead he saw in the moments before calderón could compose his face fear loss contempt and a strange wildness as if the man had been lost for days in the mountains then the judge smiled and the radiance shone out of him she went to him he went to her they kissed madly in the street an old couple sitting in the window nodded their approval falcón blinked at the fraudulence on display inés hauled him into the bar calderóns step faltered as he saw falcón perched on his bar stool the three of them explained everything to each other twice without listening to a word beers shot down throats topics came and went inés and calderón left after minutes falcón studied the sinew standing out of inéss forearm as she gripped her fiancés shirt it was desperate she was never letting go of this one the bill came he paid it and drove home every light turned to red the cobbles jolted his insides despite his tiredness he had no patience for bed he went to his study and booted up the computer he went through all the shots hed taken since the weekend he kept looking at the snap of inés seeing if it fitted with any of the others seeing if he could remember it it didnt help he found the whisky poured himself a single glass and left the bottle in the kitchen he was about to shut the computer down when he remembered maddy krugman telling him that shed read his story on the internet he logged on and entered her name into a search engine there were several thousand hits mostly for a political commentator called john krugman and a journalist for the new york times called paul krugman falcón entered madeleine coren into the search engine there were only three hundred hits and he quite quickly started to find references to her photographic work they were mainly old articles and a few reviews of her exhibitions but they always featured a shot of the stunningly beautiful young madeleine coren who looked cool unapproachable and dressed exclusively in black he was butting up against his boredom when a small piece from the st louis times caught his eye fbi murder inquiry madeleine coren photographer has been helping the fbi with their inquiries into the murder of iranianborn carpet dealer reza sangari the article appeared under the local news section and was dated th october madeleine coren in fbi murder inquiry the new york photographer maddy coren has been helping the fbi with their murder inquiry following the discovery of reza sangaris bludgeoned body in his lower east side apartment the fbi could not reveal why they were talking to ms coren in connection with the iranian carpet dealers murder they have only stated that no charges have been brought against the thirtysixyearold photographer whose latest show minute lives has just moved from the st louis art museum john and martha coren who still live in belleville st clair would make no comment on their daughters fbi interview maddy coren currently lives in connecticut with her husband the architect martin krugman the journalists name was dan fineman and after reading it through a few times falcón began to pick up the slightly mischievous tone of the piece its news worthiness was hardly worth the column inches he entered minute lives into the search engine and a review came up with the headline short on content small in stature the byline was the same dan fineman a man with a grudge falcón typed reza sangari into the search engine his murder had been well covered at a local and national level and from these articles he was able to piece together the full story reza sangari was just thirty years old he was born in tehran his mother was from a banking family and his father originally ran his own carpet factory until they left prior to the iranian revolution in reza was brought up in switzerland but went to the usa to study art history at columbia university after graduation he bought a warehouse on the lower east side from which he developed his carpet import and sales business he converted the second floor into an apartment which was where his dead body was found on th october he had been murdered three days earlier he had taken two blows to the head with a blunt instrument which had not killed him but he had fallen sideways on to a brass bedstead which had the weapon that caused the first wounds was never found because of the wideranging nature of the investigation and sangaris international client list the fbi took over from the new york homicide cops and contacted all his clients and social acquaintances they found he was seeing a number of women but not one in particular there was no evidence of a breakin and nothing obvious had been stolen there was nothing missing from the inventory the fbi had been unable to develop any suspects in the case despite extensive interviews with the women he was seeing at the time of his death some of the names of these women had crept into the media because they were famous they were helena valankova dress designer françoise lascombs model and madeleine krugman the last two were married women chapter friday th july falcón woke up and reached for a pen and notebook which he kept by the bed to record his dreams this time he wrote she could have found out about the other women and done it he could have found out she was having an affair and done it or it could be nothing at all he allowed his brain the run of this circuit for a few minutes and then wrote he could have killed reza s and not told her she could have killed reza s and not told him or there could be some complicity or it could be nothing at all hed slept badly the ortega file was all over the bed along with alicia aguados dictaphone and tapes hed been up for hours too spooked to go to sleep and had recorded the ortega file as he read it before he got under the shower he checked the strip of paper hed stuck over the door it was unbroken at least he hadnt been sleepwalking he let the water pummel his head and some of his frustration left him as a new possibility about inéss photograph came to him the heat in the gallery outside his room smothered him he looked down on the trickling fountain he rippled past the pillars on his way to the kitchen he ate a round of fresh pineapple and some toast drizzled with olive oil he took his pills his mind roved around the loneliness of the house inés had called it mad and enormous which it was a sprawling illogical labyrinthine expression of the state of francisco falcóns bizarre mind it came to him with a clarity that must have been obvious to everyone except himself caught up in his months of selfabsorption why live here any more this is not your house and it will never be your home let manuela have it the only reason shes pursuing you through the courts is that shed have to sell everything and take on a huge mortgage to be able to afford it he felt free he started to punch out manuelas number on his mobile and stopped himself just in time hed go through his lawyer isabel cano no sense in presenting things to manuela on a plate when people did that she just demanded more the mobile rang we have a meeting here at am said calderón tense and businesslike id like you to come to that alone if you dont mind javier on the way to the jefatura he dropped off the tapes at alicia aguados consulting room in calle vidrio before going to his office he took the photograph of inés to the lab along with some blank stock that hed been using to print out his snaps he asked jorge to run a test to see if the paper was the same back in his office he read through the reports left on his desk he collected all the necessary papers for his meeting and put them in his briefcase separate from his internet findings about madeleine krugman nee coren he put the photograph of pablo ortega and carvajal in there as well he wanted to see the actors reaction to it he called isabel cano still no answer from her office ramírez and ferrera turned up as he was leaving he told ramírez that calderón wanted to see him alone and that he should keep trawling through vegas offices while the rest of the squad went doortodoor looking for sergei andor the mystery woman hed been seen talking to the edificio de los juzgados was building up for an active morning the stink of humanity sweating in hope and fear had reached an animal intensity and there was no airconditioning unit in the world that could cope falcón went up to calderóns firstfloor office which overlooked the car park and the el prado de san sebastián bus station the judge was smoking there were six butts already in the ashtray each one smoked down to the filter falcón closed the door calderóns eyes were smudged dark underneath he still had the intense look of someone returning to civilization after an experience in the wild falcón laid the autopsies and police reports in front of him and sat down calderón read fast his lawyers brain taking in the large quantities of detailed information he sat back with a freshly lit cigarette and sized up falcón he seemed on the brink of saying something personal but veered away from it as if this might be too confrontational too early what do you make of all this then javier he asked the foundations for the building of a murder case havent exactly been laid by these autopsies im surprised the médico forense wasnt prepared to commit himself more at this stage officially said falcón unofficially like all of us at the jefatura hes extremely doubtful that it was suicide which is why he doesnt want to release sr vegas body for burial just yet lets look at the mental states of the deceased said calderón sra vega had a serious enough condition that she was taking lithium her husband was not only behaving strangely as weve seen in madeleine krugmans photographs but had also been to see two possibly three doctors about his anxiety falcón knew that calderón had wanted to say her name had felt the need for its sweetness on his lips and tongue it decided him that the internet downloads in his briefcase should stay there the crime scene falcón started yes the crime scene said calderón that seems to be explicable in any number of ways suicide or murder with between one and three people involved in the deaths you have no suspects theres not even the vaguest mention of a motive in any report you have no witnesses sergei the gardener is still missing were working on that we have a photo id and we know he was seen talking to a woman in a bar near the vegas house quite recently were also going doortodoor in santa clara and the poligono san pablo said falcón as far as motive goes were going to have to work hard on the russian angle and lets not get too excited about the russians until we know who they are and weve seen the extent of their involvement from the accountants reports i know theres a lot of moneylaundering going on in marbella and places along the costa del sol but so far all weve had here in seville is a sighting by pablo ortega of a few russians making a social visit seven months ago i was followed home on wednesday night by a blue seat with plates stolen in marbella and theres russian and ukrainian illegal labour on vegas building sites said falcón there are enough questions over the state of the crime scene the state of the body the deceaseds relationship with his son and potentially harmful outside influences to justify further inquiry ok i take your point about the russians lets try and work that up into something said calderón sticking with the suicide angle for the moment what about the boy vegas domestic circumstances were not totally desperate even sr cabello who has no love for his soninlaw conceded that vega was very fond of the boy said falcón he drank acid rather than shoot himself with a gun which could indicate that he was punishing himself for unknown sins and protecting his son from possibly seeing a violent death maybe he killed himself precisely because there was something he couldnt bear his son to know about him said calderón if you had a son javier what could you not bear him to know about you if he knew that i was a war criminal id find it difficult to face him said falcón the difference between the war criminal and the murderer is that selfknowledge could be possible once history had moved on the war criminal might see that he had been persuaded through a combination of political thought national fervour and fear to have gone from being an ordinary man to becoming a merciless killer with a sense of duty to the regime and selfrighteousness later in life especially if he was being hunted down he might reflect on what hed done and feel a deep sense of shame i could not imagine looking into my sons eyes and have him know that i was capable of such mercilessness silence more smoking from the judge were doing what two law men should never do said calderón back to business said falcón we found a false passport in one of vegas freezers its argentinian in the name of emilio cruz were checking that out and rafael vegas id calderón nodded crushed out his cigarette lit another vázquez said that vegas parents were killed implying they did not die of natural causes said falcón who were they what happened to them that could be interesting for background yes said calderón and there something else thats not in the report i found a file in vegas study entitled justicia inside there were articles and downloads on criminal courts such as the icc theres your war crimes javier baltasar garzón and the belgian justice system said falcón this is very specific material for someone in the construction industry even if he did have an interest in current affairs put this together with the strange note in his hand at time of death and the false passport and maybe were looking at someone who had sensitive information which could do damage to people both the krugmans and ortega mentioned some antiamerican sentiment in their interviews said calderón it didnt seem to be as general as that i think vegas anger was more directed towards government marty krugman even said he was proamerica whatever i only mentioned that because the us administration are against the icc which is directly related to the post world and theres vegas weird note as you said i read something about that in el pais yesterday but i didnt understand why the bland reason is that the us government doesnt want any of its citizens unfairly prosecuted said calderón the more piquant reason is that the world after is in need of more policing the cops are the us military the americans want to reserve the right to decide whats fair they also dont want any member of the administration indicted for war crimes they are the most powerful nation on earth theyre exerting influence wherever they can plenty of people dont like their tactics if you dont support us well cut military aid but its a complex world just as one persons freedom fighter is anothers terrorist so one persons fair military target is anothers atrocity then dont you think an interesting line of inquiry could be to look at why vega had the remotest interest in the icc and other judicial systems i dont know what he was expecting from it because the icc only came into being on st july this year and it cant look at crimes committed before that date the belgian justice system and baltasar garzón just means youve got to steer clear of europe if youre worried about being indicted or arrested so dont narrow your vision too much javier said calderón keep concentrating on the details as well has any muriatic acid been found on the property not yet we havent been able to fully search the property my squad is spread all over the place trying to find sergei as well as looking into vegas business you know what im looking for motive suspect reliable witness said calderón what i dont want to hear about are things that werent there if you dont find any muriatic acid its only an indicator it doesnt mean anything no more ghosts calderón did a passable imitation of a man drowning at his desk this is why we dont like talking about our hunches in front of judges im being glib said calderón i know youre concentrated on the realities and the facts but at the moment all weve got is nuance and hint russian mafia involvement vegas obsession with international courts the carvajal paedophile ring we havent discussed that yet its just names in an address book some of them are crossed out theres no meat javier there arent even skeletons in here theyre just phantasms there you go again you know the meat im looking for and im not letting you launch a full murder investigation until i get it said calderón well reconvene for a case update early next week and if you still cant bring me anything that stands up in court then well have to move along calderón sat back lit another cigarette the man smoking more than javier could remember and became lost in his own thoughts you wanted to see me alone said javier just to nudge calderón out of his groove apart from not wanting inspector ramírez thumping me into submission hes more subdued these days said falcón his daughters undergoing tests in the hospital nothing serious i hope said calderón on automatic the news shooting past him while his mind wrestled with his own predicament i didnt know that you and inés were still in contact were not said falcón who then gave an absurdly elaborate explanation of how he came to be in el cairo with her inés seemed very nervous said calderón look what happened the last time she got married said falcón opening his hands opting to look ridiculous she seemed to be worried that you were having doubts i why would she think i was having doubts asked calderón and falcón felt the diamond bits of the judges drilling mind cut into him she thought you seemed nervous too and what did you say to that that it was quite natural for a man to feel nervous under these circumstances i myself had felt the same nervousness said falcón and nervousness is easily misinterpreted as doubt did you doubt asked calderón i never doubted her said falcón the sweat streaming down his back that wasnt the question javier i probably did doubt in retrospect i was probably afraid of change of my incapacity for what falcóns chair creaked as he writhed on the skewer of the judges questions i was a different man then more distant said falcón thats why i go to the shrink and now with that last light inquiry calderóns cycle was complete falcón was almost grateful to receive the implicit warning that he should keep his nose out of the judges private life its a long haul he said falcón sat at his desk replaying the dialogue he was relieved that he hadnt brought up the internet downloads about maddy krugman that might have turned calderón savage the judge knew that falcón had seen something but under their delicate personal circumstances falcón couldnt start talking about maddys involvement in the fbi inquiry until he was certain of the facts he pitied the two lives he saw on their way to destruction as he dialled his lawyer isabel cano she agreed to see him for a maximum of ten minutes he drove to her small office on calle julio cesar and made his way past the three law students in the outer office she greeted him in her bare feet he sat down and laid out his proposal to her for cutting a deal with manuela are you out of your mind javier not always he said you now want to give her everything weve been fighting over for the last six months youre prepared to take a loss of god knows half a million euros why dont we throw in the contents as well thats not a bad idea said falcón she leaned over the desk at him long black hair dark brown almost black eyes a beautiful fierce and haughty moorish look that could wither most of the fiscales in the courts at a hundred metres is that shrink still tinkering about in your head yes has there been a change in medication no youre still taking the drugs he nodded well i dont know whats going on in there but it must be very loud she said i dont want to live in that house any more i dont want to live with francisco falcón manuela does shes obsessed by the place but she doesnt have the money then she cant have it javier just think about it ive thought about it and rejected it instantly think some more thats your ten minutes said isabel putting on her shoes walk me to my car the law students fired questions at her as she strode through the office she ignored them all her heels cracked across the marble foyer ive got another question for you said falcón lets hope its cheaper than the last she said or you wont be able to afford me do you know juez calderón of course i do javier she said stopping dead in the street so falcón knocked into her ah now i get it youre emotionally distraught about him and inés lets forget this meeting ever happened and when youre calm well im not that emotionally distraught so what is it about juez calderón does he have a reputation as long as your arm longer than your leg longer than this street i mean with women falcón who was staring eagerly into her face saw all her fierceness disappear to be replaced by a vast hurt which surfaced like a harpooned whale and disappeared she turned away and pointed her keys at her car whose lights flashed back esteban has always been a hunter she said she got in the car and pulled away leaving falcón on the pavement thinking that isabel cano had been happily married for more than ten years chapter friday th july on the way to ortegas house he took a call from jorge who told him that the paper used for the inés print was of a different make and quality to the blank stock hed given him the news momentarily elated him until he realized that this proof of his sanity must also mean that someone had got into his home and planted the photo not only that they also knew about him and his particular vulnerability his blood felt sharp in his veins but he calmed his paranoia with the thought that everybody knew about him since the francisco falcón scandal his story was public property pablo ortega was coming back from walking his dogs falcón buzzed down his window as he drew alongside and asked if he could spare a few minutes ortega nodded grimly falcón pulled the photograph out of his briefcase ortega held the gate open for him the stink from the cesspit was as thick as a mud wall they went around the house and into the kitchen the dogs drank noisily ive had some good news about the cesspit said ortega unable to sound delighted by it one of my brothers contractors thinks he can rebuild without having to knock down all the rooms and he could do it for five million thats good said falcón im glad its going to work out for you they went into the living room and sat down i might have some more good news for you said falcón wanting to keep things positive id like to help with sebastiáns case its no use you helping from the outside if sebastián doesnt want to be helped from the inside i think i can help there too said falcón taking the risk that aguado would agree i have a clinical psychologist whos looking at his case and might be prepared to talk to him a clinical psychologist said ortega slowly and what would he talk to sebastián about she would try to find out why sebastián felt the need to incarcerate himself he didnt incarcerate himself said ortega leaping to his feet throwing out a big dramatic hand the state incarcerated him with the help of that cabron juez calderón but sebastián didnt defend himself he seems to have welcomed his punishment and failed to offer anything that might have reduced his sentence why ortega dug his fists into his expansive waist and drew in a massive breath as if he was about to blow the house down because he said very quietly he was guilty it was just his mental state at the time that was in question the court decided he was sane i dispute that she will find that out from him said falcón what will she talk to him about said ortega the boy has a fragile mind as it is i dont want her stirring up more trouble hes already in solitary confinement i dont want him feeling suicidal have there been any reports from the prison that he might be not yet shes very good at her work pablo i dont think this will do him any harm said falcón and while she helps him clarify things ill look at various elements of the case like what the boy he kidnapped manolo i should talk to his parents you wont get anywhere there the ortega name cannot be spoken in that house the father has suffered some sort of collapse he cant work any more they spread malicious gossip so that the whole barrio has turned against me i mean that is why i am here javier and not there i have to talk to them said falcón it was the seriousness of manolos testimony that resulted in such a heavy prison sentence for sebastián why should he change it said ortega its his testimony thats what i have to find out whether it was his testimony or something that he was encouraged to say by others whats that supposed to mean hes a very young boy at that age you do what youre told you know something javier dont you said ortega what do you know i know that i want to help well i dont like it said ortega and i dont want it to rebound on sebastián it cant get any worse for him pablo itll stir things up said ortega repeating his fear he started out angry but then softened can you just let me think about it for a bit javier i dont want to rush into these things its delicate the media has only just fallen silent i dont want them on my back again is that all right dont worry pablo take your time ortega blinked at the photograph whose corner javier was flicking anything else he asked i was confused said falcón throwing back the pages of his notebook as to your relationship with rafael vega you said i knew him he introduced himself about a week after i moved in here does that mean you did know him before you moved here or that youve only known him since youve lived in santa clara ortega was staring at the photograph face down on the table in front of falcón as if he was a poker player and it was a draw card whose suit and number he wouldnt mind knowing i did know him before he said i suppose i should have said he reintroduced himself i met him at some party or other i cant remember whose once twice three times its not so easy for me to remember i meet so many you knew consuelo jiménezs late husband said falcón yes yes raúl that would have been it they were in the same business i used to go to the restaurant in el porvenir thats what it was i thought the connection was your brother and his airconditioning systems yes yes yes now ive got it of course falcón gave him the photograph watching his face as he did so who are you talking to in that photograph asked falcón god knows said ortega the one you cant see is my brother i know that from his bald head this guy i dont know it was taken at one of raúl jiménezs parties that doesnt help i went to dozens of functions i met hundreds of all i can say is that he wasnt from my profession he must be in the construction industry raúl divided his friends up into celebrities and useful people for his businesses said falcón im surprised you didnt appear in his celebrity photographs raúl jiménez thought lorca was a brand of sherry hed never been near a theatre in his life hed like to think of himself as a friend of antonio banderas and ana rosa quintana but he wasnt it was all a publicity stunt i was a no lets be accurate i occasionally gave support to my brother by turning up at functions i knew raúl and id met rafael but i wasnt exactly a friend well thank you for explaining that said falcón im sorry to have taken up your time im not sure what youre investigating here javier one moment were talking about rafaels suicide the next you make it sound as if hes been murdered and now youre looking at sebastiáns case and that photograph that must have been taken years ago before i put on all this weight theres no date on it all i can tell you is that it was taken before and how do you know that because the man youre talking to died in that year so you already know who he is falcón nodded i feel as if im being accused of something here said ortega when its just that my memory has been shot to pieces since this business with sebastián ive never used a prompter in my life and then twice in the last year ive come to in front of the camera or on the stage wondering what the hell im doing there its ach you dont want to know its silly stuff nothing a cop would be interested in try me its as if reality keeps breaking through the illusion im trying to create that sounds plausible youve been through a difficult time its never happened before said ortega not even after gloria left me anyway forget about it not all the work i do is about putting criminals behind bars pablo were servants of the people too that means i also try to help but can you help me with whats going on in here he said tapping his forehead you have to tell me first do you know anything about dreams said ortega i have this one where im standing in a field with a cool wind blowing at the sweat on my face im in an incredible rage and my hands are hurting the palms are stinging and the backs of my fingers feel bruised theres the sound of traffic and i find that my hands are causing me not physical pain but great personal distress what do you make of that javier it sounds as if youve been hitting somebody ortega looked through him suddenly deep in thought falcón said hed let himself out but there was no reaction as falcón reached the gate he realized that hed forgotten to ask about sergei he went back but stopped at the corner of the house because ortega was standing on the lawn with his hands reaching up to the sky he sank to his knees the dogs came out and snuffled around his thighs he stroked them and held them to him he was sobbing falcón backed away the vegas garage with its brandnew jaguar was cleaner than sergeis accommodation and falcón knew that there wasnt going to be any muriatic acid anywhere near this cars paintwork he went down the garden to the barbecue thinking that sergei must have had a place where he kept his gardening tools there was nothing unplanned about this area of the garden it had been built by a man who understood how to grill meat behind the barbecue area there was thick almost tropical growth he went round the back of sergeis quarters and saw that there was a path into this jungle which obscured a brick shed he was furious that this hadnt appeared in perezs report on his search of the garden he found a key in the garage and waded back through the thickening heat the shed was full of sacks of charcoal and the usual barbecue paraphernalia sergei kept his tools at one end along with some small quantities of building materials on a shelf above there was paint and other liquids one of which was an opened plastic bottle of muriatic acid with a centimetre left in the bottom falcón went back to the car for an evidence bag and used a pen through the loop handle to lift the bottle into it as he worked the light dimmed in the shed youre on your own today inspector jefe said maddy krugman startling him she stood in the doorway backlit he could see every curve and crux of her figure through the diaphanous material of her dress he looked down at her zebra skin sandals she leaned against the door jamb arms folded i prefer it that way sra krugman he said you look like a loner to me she said thinking things out piecing things together building the picture in your head youre keeping a careful eye on me im bored she said i cant go out to take my photographs in this heat theres nobody around down at the river anyway is your husband still working for vega construcciones sr vázquez and the finance people called him last night and said that he should continue to manage his projects she said they dont seem to be pulling the plug just yet would you like some coffee inspector jefe they walked out into the sunlight she checked the contents of his evidence bag he locked the shed we can cut through here to our place she said leading him towards a break in the hedge by sergeis quarters falcón went back to the house put the evidence bag inside the garage and shut the door he followed her through the hedge and up the garden to her house thinking about how he was going to introduce reza sangari into the mix he sat on the sofa in the chill of the living room while she made the coffee her sandals had low heels on them which clicked softly on the marble floor even out of the room there was still this subliminal sexual presence she poured the coffee and lowered herself on to the other end of the sofa you know what it feels like out here when im all on my own day after day she said it feels like im in limbo its one of those weird incongruities of life that ive found my social life has improved one hundred per cent since rafael died he used to be just about our only guest but now you come around and yesterday i spent some time with esteban juez calderón yes she said hes a nice guy and very cultured too when did you see him i ran into him in town in the morning and we met up later and had an evening together she said he took me to some odd bars in the centre that i would never go into by myself you know those places with a thousand jamones hanging from the ceiling sweating into those conical plastic cups over the heads of fat guys with their black hair combed back in brilliant rails smoking cigars and adjusting their trousers every time a woman walks by what time was that you cant stop being a detective can you she said it was about six until ten oclock she crossed her legs her dress slipped back towards her lap she kicked the sandal off her foot i saw that you had a show called minute lives said falcón what was that about or minute lives she said rolling her eyes i never like that stupid title it was my agents idea they like things to be catchy and commercial ive got the book upstairs if youd like to see she stood and flipped the hem of her dress out with her fingertips its ok said falcón wanting to keep this on the ground floor i just wanted to know the subject matter she walked over to the sliding doors and put her hands up on the glass and looked out into the garden again the light streamed through her clothes falcón squirmed everything seemed to be calculated they were shots of very ordinary people taken at work or in their homes they were people in a big city with small lives and the shots were just clips of their life story your imagination was supposed to do the rest i read a review of the show said falcón it was by somebody called dan fineman he didnt seem to like it he watched the back of her head her neck and shoulders as his words crept into her mind she was as still as a night animal with a host of predators she turned suddenly and with an intake of breath came back for her coffee she lit a cigarette and thumped her back into the sofa dan fineman was an asshole i knew from high school he always wanted to fuck me but he made my flesh crawl he never aspired to anything greater than writing for the st louis times and when he got there he took his revenge he wrote another article about you said falcón you might not have seen it that was the only show i ever did in st louis first and last this wasnt to do with the arts it was a local news story i only went back to st louis to see my parents for thanksgiving and christmas when did you say your mother died i didnt she said but it was on december rd you know who you remind me of inspector jefe americans only seem to know one spaniard and i dont look anything like antonio banderas columbo she said not thinking this at all but wanting to get back at him a much betterlooking columbo you ask a load of questions that dont seem to have any bearing on the case and then bang you nail the culprit fictional police work is always more entertaining than the real thing marty said from the beginning that you werent like any cop hed ever seen and i suppose hed have come across quite a few in the months before you arrived here she rested her chin on her thumb and tapped her nose with her finger you never said what dan fineman wrote about inspector jefe how you were helping the fbi with their inquiries into the murder of your exlover reza sangari youre a very thorough person she said you looked me up on the internet said falcón i looked you up then you wont need to ask me anything she said and anyway none of its relevant to what happened to the vegas have you had any other affairs since youve been married to your husband he asked she narrowed her eyes pursed her lips and smoked about two centimetres in a single drag are you seriously trying to put me and rafael together inspector jefe she asked is that how your mind works you see a pathetically obvious pattern in things and your policemans brain snaps the two together falcón sat still his eyes fixed on her waiting for the cracks to appear instead something dawned in her face and she sat up on the edge of the sofa ive got it she said how stupid of me columbo disconnected questions this is about the judge isnt it you think im embarking on an affair with juez calderón and yes i read the story javier falcón his fiancé is your exwife is that what this is all about there was some colour in maddy krugmans cheeks she was angry falcón wouldnt have minded blocking out the glare coming from her green eyes the flames of her red hair he realized that the two of them were prepared to hurt each other and she didnt mind the idea of that now that ive discovered that your motive for leaving america was a little more complicated than youve led me to believe i have to look at things from a different perspective so what was all that stuff about esteban you mentioned him not me he said i was interested because he decided to postpone a meeting he had with me yesterday i now find out it was because he was with you do you still love your exwife inspector jefe thats got nothing to do with anything why are you so curious about esteban she asked it shouldnt be any of your business what he does with his private life and you shouldnt give a damn about your exwife but you do theyre getting married im under no illusions youve given yourself away inspector jefe she said youre under no illusions but you wouldnt mind the chance i bet youre like a defence lawyer putting words into the mouth of a prosecution witness and youve got nobody to object to she said looking sadly around the living room before fixing on him again any woman over the age of twenty would take one look at esteban calderón and know him for what he is which is a ladies man whos always looking she said you dont see it because youre not the type i hope your exwife isnt a romantic and what if she is shed be under the illusion that she could make that kind of man change she said but i can promise you one thing she knows what hes like no woman could miss it why do you think esteban was around here with his tail wagging on the first day of your investigation how does your husband take that sort of thing asked falcón martys got nothing to worry about she said he trusts me how did he take reza sangari silence while maddy stubbed out the cigarette with a dozen precise little stabs at the ashtray we nearly didnt make it through she said looking up with her eyes magnified by impending tears that was my first and last affair were you still seeing reza sangari when he was murdered she shook her head slowly did you contemplate leaving your husband for reza sangari she nodded and what happened that is private she said im sure you had to tell the fbi everything or did they respect your privacy it upsets me i dont want to talk about it did you find out about the other women asked falcón riding over her sensitivities yes she said they were younger than me they had more resilience and why when you see so clearly what sort of a man esteban calderón is did you not spot reza sangari i made the crucial mistake of falling completely and madly in love with him she paced the room her nerves getting the better of her i used to go into new york city twice a week she said i had work from a couple of magazines and i used a studio which happened to be close to rezas warehouse he came to the studio one day with a model i was using for a shoot the model was flying out to la straight afterwards reza asked me out to lunch by the end of that afternoon wed had food wine and hed made love to me on a pile of pure silk carpets from qom thats what it was like nothing was ordinary he was beautiful and i fell for him like ive never fallen for anybody in my life the model you were using that day was her name françoise lascombs yes she must have been around once she came back from la didnt you see her reza was very good at keeping all aspects of his love life separate and you know how it is with these men when you were with him you were the only person in the world who mattered i wasnt thinking of anybody else and certainly not the invisible competition but you did find out about them about six months after we started when i was so in love with him i didnt know what to do with myself i went into the city on an odd day i didnt intend to see him but inevitably i ended up at his warehouse as i went for his doorbell a woman came out and i recognized that happy spring in her step i didnt go up i went across the street and stood in a doorway i was shaking i dont know whether you know what that sort of betrayal is like a really appalling sense of breakage my organs felt lacerated it took me an hour to stop shaking then i decided i would go up and finish with him and as i crossed the street another woman converged on his door i couldnt believe it i didnt go up i somehow managed to get home and collapsed i never saw him again and then somebody killed him over a weekend and they took four days to find the body and they never found the murderer it was a long and painful investigation never was so much pressure put on so many relationships by the death of one man the media were on top of it too because françoise lascombs had just become estee lauders girl the fbi probably had about ten suspects but they couldnt pin it on any of them then they discovered his coke habit he had something like two hundred grammes in his apartment i never knew about it but i suppose he had to be on something just to maintain that lifestyle they thought that something must have gone wrong in a deal what do you think i think about a lot of things what the affair did to marty what it did to me and i think about reza and the madness of those months but i dont let myself think about his end who killed him or why because thats where insanity lies you never suspected marty youre kidding the weekend he was killed i was still struggling to be without reza i couldnt bear to be on my own marty and i were drunk and stoned and watching old movies then on the wednesday the fbi came calling and everything changed well it explains your fascination with the internal struggle it also explains why im disdainful of everything i did before i came here she said dan fineman was right i remember his headline it played on the title of the show short on content small in stature you said sr vega used to come here for dinner quite often on his own said falcón thats unusual for a spanish man with a family youre so transparent inspector jefe she said and youve insinuated that before these arent trick questions sra krugman he said nor do they necessarily imply any impropriety on your part im just asking if you think he was in love with you or infatuated with you as a lot of men seem to be but not you inspector jefe ive noticed that she said perhaps your lust is directed elsewhere maybe thats it yes maybe you just dont like me your friend consuelo doesnt like me either my friend or is she a little more passionate than a friend do you think sr vega was interested in you sexually asked falcón shouldering through her insinuations you went to see bullfights together rafael liked to be accompanied by a pretty woman thats it nothing happened in the same way that nothing ever happens with the gas man either did you know if you had an effect on sr vegas mind you think i was the cause of his disturbed state she said you think he was burning papers down the bottom of his garden because of me youre crazy he was a man trapped in difficult marital circumstances he had a wife who was severely depressed but they had a son together they both loved he wasnt going to break up his family but his relationship with his wife was limited by her condition its a plausible theory except i think i was a side attraction for rafael his main interest was talking things over with marty i mean marty would always meet us after the bullfight for tapas then wed have dinner and im telling you those two were still talking long after i went to bed about what their favourite topic the united states of america had sr vega lived in america he spoke american english and he talked about miami a lot but he didnt react well to direct questions so im not sure but martys convinced that hed lived there unlike most europeans he wasnt full of the usual cliches on the american way of life she said he enjoyed talking with marty because marty isnt that interested in personal details marty was happy to talk about theories thoughts and ideas without having to know where the guy lived or his favourite colour did they talk in spanish or english spanish until they got on the brandy and then english martys spanish fell apart with alcohol did sr vega ever get drunk i was in bed ask marty when was the last time sr vega and marty had one of these evenings the really long sessions happened during the feria theyd be up until dawn then falcón finished his coffee got to his feet i dont know whether ill invite you again if all youre going to do is interrogate me she said esteban doesnt interrogate me its not his job to interrogate you im the one who has to go digging in the dirt and you find out a few things about esteban on the way his private life is not my concern youre used to keeping yourself in tight arent you inspector jefe its best not to let my sort of job and social life bleed into each other very funny inspector jefe she said you do have a social life then most cops dont i understand their lives are full of broken relationships separations from their kids alcoholism and depression falcón couldnt help thinking that he scored two maybe three out of four thank you for your time he said we should try meeting socially just to see if we really get along without all this stuff getting in the way she said im interested in the cop with artistic vision or is your mind made up about me id hate you to think i was some stereotype like the femme fatale ill go back the way i came he said heading for the sliding doors out into the garden and he could tell hed annoyed her columbo always left his last question for the doorstep she said to the back of his head im not columbo he said and sealed her back in with the sliding door chapter friday th july on the way back to pick up the evidence bag containing the bottle of muriatic acid his mobile vibrated in his pocket digame josé luis he said theyve found a ukrainian hooker in the poligono san pablo who theyre pretty sure is sergeis mystery friend said ramírez she doesnt speak much spanish but she reacted to the photo of sergei when they showed it to her take her down to the jefatura and get a translator said falcón dont interrogate her until i get there its nearly lunchtime do what you can back in the jefatura nadia kouzmikheva dressed in a black miniskirt a white halterneck top and flat shoes with no stockings paced the floor of the interrogation room while policía carlos serrano watched her through the pane of glass in the door shed already gone through three of his cigarettes and he was hoping that the translator was a smoker and would arrive soon ramírez and falcón walked down the corridor with a female russian translator from the university serrano opened the door for them introductions were made the two women sat together on one side of the table the men on the other the translator lit a cigarette ramírez looked over his shoulder as if there might be a waiter serrano opened the door another ashtray carlos ramírez said falcón explained the purpose of the interview while looking at nadias passport and finding the visa which still had six months to run the ukrainian girls shoulders relaxed a couple of microns shes enrolled in a language school said ramírez were not here to make your life difficult said falcón to the girl we need your help in the passport photo her hair was dark brown the roots were still visible under the rough peroxide job shed presumably done herself she had green eyes under blue eye shadow which did not quite obscure the fact that her left eye was recovering from some damage her skin was white and blotchy as if she had not seen the sun for some months she had fresh bruises on her upper arms he smiled to encourage her she smiled back revealing a tooth missing from behind the incisor he positioned the photo of sergei in the middle of the table where do you come from in the ukraine he asked the translator repeated the question to the side of the girls head lvov she said playing with her cigarette in red chapped fingers what did you do in lvov i worked in a factory until it closed then i did nothing sergei came from lvov did you know him theres nearly a million people in lvov she said but you knew him said falcón silence more smoking through trembling lips i can see that you are afraid said falcón i can see that you have been beaten by the people you have been working for they are probably threatening your family too we wont interfere with any of that if you dont want us to we only want to know about sergei because he was working for someone who is now dead he is not a suspect we want to talk to him to see if he has any information for us i would like you to tell us how you know sergei when you last saw him and what he said to you nothing will leave this room you can return to your apartment when you want he didnt take his eyes off her shed learnt some ugly lessons about human beings and she was staring back at him to see if there were cracks in his nature any faltering any shift of gaze any telltale tic that might mean more pain for her she looked at her watch a cheap pink plastic thing with a big flower for a face i have thirtyeight minutes to get back to my apartment she said ill need a little money to keep people quiet about where ive been how much thirty euros will be enough falcón unfolded a twenty and a ten and laid them on the table sergei and i are friends we come from the same village outside lvov he used to work in a technical college teaching mechanics he earned twentyseven euros a month she said looking down on the money that falcón had given her so easily i was earning seventeen euros a month it wasnt so much a living as a slow death sergei came to see me one day very excited hed heard from friends that portugal was a good place to go to get into europe that in europe you could earn twentyseven euros a day we went to the embassy in warsaw to get our visas and thats where we met the mafia they got us our visas they arranged transport you paid in dollars eight hundred each we already knew about the rumours that the mafia were big in lisbon we had heard that they take you off the bus beat you and put the young women into prostitution and the men into slave labour until theyve paid off a neverending debt so we decided that we would not go to lisbon the bus stopped at a service station outside madrid i met a russian girl there in the toilets she told me not to go to lisbon and gave me a cigarette she introduced me to a spanish man who said he could get me work in a restaurant in madrid i asked if he could get sergei some work and he said that he could wash dishes no problem they pay six hundred euros a month we left the bus she shrugged stubbed out the cigarette and ramírez gave her another there was no restaurant we were taken to an apartment where we were told we could stay they left us there saying they would be back in the morning later there was a knock on the door and three big russians came in they beat us up very badly and took our passports all three men raped me sergei was taken away i was locked in the apartment every day men came to have sex with me and left without a word after three months the three russians came back with another russian he made me strip and inspected me as if i was an animal he nodded and left i had just been sold they brought me to seville and put me in a flat they treated me very badly for six months and then things got a little better i was allowed to leave the apartment to work in a club i served drinks and did other things they gave me my passport but dislocated my finger she said holding up her hand so that i would remember they neednt have bothered i was scared anyway too scared to run and where would i go with no money and looking like this they told me my familys address and what they would do to them they also told me that they had sergei here and what would happen to him if i ran she asked for water serrano brought in a chilled bottle she smoked hard the translator didnt look as if shed be able to bear much more of nadias story i am allowed a little money for food and cigarettes i am trusted but one mistake and im beaten and locked up in the apartment she said pointing at her eye this was from my last mistake they saw me in a bar talking to sergei it was the second time id seen him we met by accident one night and he told me where he worked how long ago was that six weeks she said i was beaten and locked up for two weeks but you saw him again twice two weeks after i got out i found the house where he worked we just talked he told me what had happened to him the work hed had to do on the building sites dangerous work where men died how much he hated europe and wanted to get back to lvov did he tell you who he worked for yes i dont remember the name it wasnt important he was the owner of the construction sites where sergei had worked when was the second time wednesday morning he came to the apartment and told me to get my things that we were leaving he said that the man he worked for was dead on the floor of his kitchen and that he had to run why did he have to run he said he didnt want to go back to the building sites he said we had to be quick that the police were going to come and he had to move very fast did he have money he said he had enough money i dont know how much that was she blinked tried to swallow but couldnt she sipped the water ramírez gave her another cigarette you didnt go said falcón i couldnt i was too scared he said goodbye and that was it can you remember exactly what he said when he told you his employer was dead she put her face in her hands pressed the fingertips into her forehead he just said he was dead did he say hed been murdered no he was dead thats all and since then has anybody been to see you about sergei asked falcón she pointed at the bruises on her arms they knew sergei would come to see me she said they held me down and did some things to me but i couldnt tell them anything all i knew was that he had gone she looked up at the clock nervous what did they ask you they wanted to know why sergei had run and what hed seen and i told them that hed only seen a dead man lying on the floor that was it she said now i have to go falcón called serrano in but hed already left and been replaced by ferrera he told her to get the girl back to the bar on calle alvar nunez caleza de vaca in twentythree minutes ramírez gave her his cigarettes she grabbed the money stuffed it down the front of her skirt and left the translator struggled to fill in the receipt as if the last quarter of an hour had removed some of the purpose from her life ramírez reminded her of the confidentiality agreement shed signed she left ramírez smoked in silence his legs braced on either side of his chair its our job to listen to that he said and do nothing thats what were paid for go and take a look at alberto montes said falcón hes had those stories up to here i dont know how your meeting went with calderón this morning said ramírez but that has clarified one thing we definitely have russian mafia involvement in this case he stubbed out his cigarette in the cheap tin ashtray they walked back up to the office ramírez jangled his car keys ill put some men on the bus stations this afternoon check the airport send sergeis photograph down to the ports and email the policía judiciária in lisbon said ramírez and left for lunch falcón stood at the window ramírez appeared below him and walked the length of the main block of the jefatura to his car in the adjoining block of offices falcón could see another man standing at his window looking down at the same dull scene inspector jefe alberto montes falcóns mobile vibrated isabel cano wanted to talk to him in her office sometime before pm he said he would do his best and shut the phone down montes opened his window and looked down the two floors into the car park falcón took another call consuelo jiménez asked him to dinner that night at her house in santa clara he agreed without thinking because he was so fascinated by montes who was now leaning out of the window both elbows on the ledge nobody opened their window to c heat in an air conditioned office montess head turned he backed away and closed the window falcón went home for lunch the heat and nadias story had ruined his appetite but he managed two bowls of chilled gazpacho and a chorizo sandwich he spoke to encarnación to find out if shed let anybody in the house yesterday she said she hadnt but that she had left the front doors open for an hour in the morning to try and circulate some air he went up to bed and drifted off into a doze in which his mind played back disturbing versions of the days interviews which culminated with a view into a cell whose walls bore the faint bloody prints of human hands he dragged himself to the shower to wash away the appalling sense of dread that had accompanied the last image the water poured through his hair and over his lips and the thought came to him that it was time to stop being the detective monk and to immerse himself in life on the way to the jefatura he took a call from alicia aguado whod already listened to the sebastián ortega tapes she was interested in talking to him if pablo ortega was happy and the prison authorities amenable falcón told her about the discussion hed had with pablo ortega that morning how the actor had been reluctant to allow something that might result in the deterioration of sebastiáns already fragile state of mind well theres bound to be some history between those two she said just as there was between sebastián and his mother who abandoned him twice in divorce and death im sure pablo ortega knows that if his son is willing to talk to us theyll both end up on the couch the expression he used stirring things up wont just be in his sons mind and that will be making him uncomfortable perhaps i should meet him hes probably got some fame paranoia and wont like it if just anybody starts rummaging about in his private thoughts im going out that way this evening ill drop in and see him again said falcón im free tomorrow morning if he wants to have an informal meeting from the car park of the jefatura he could see that the offices of the grupo de homicidios were full everybody was reporting back after a long week on the hot streets as he headed for the rear entrance he glanced up at montess office and found the man standing there at his window his stomach was straining against his white shirt his tie was down his chest falcón gave him a short wave he did not react the noise coming from his office had the excitement of the impending weekend august and the holiday season about it the squad was about to lose perez baena and serrano for two weeks which was going to mean a lot more footwork for the three left behind he expected to find them all in shorts with cold beers in their hands in full readiness but they were sitting on desk corners smoking and chatting falcón stood at the door smiling and nodding inspector jefe shouted baena as if he was three beers ahead of the game perez and serrano gave extravagant salutes he was going to have to wait until perez came back from holiday before he tore a strip off him about failing to search the vegas garden properly so the holidays have started said falcón we filed our reports said perez we spent the whole afternoon out at the bus stations and santa justa carlos even went out to the airport for you as a going away present no sergei the girl was as close as we got said serrano that guys just going to disappear said baena i would if i had the russian mafia chasing my ass did you have any luck with the other residents of santa clara hardly anybody was around said perez cristina called all the private security companies and most of the people are away those we did interview had seen nothing did you manage to start work on the key we found in vegas freezer not yet by the time id dropped nadia off the banks were all shut ok start work on that on monday morning said falcón what about the id trace on rafael vega nothing yet but cristina and i had an interesting talk down at vega construcciones this afternoon said ramírez with golden boy the accountant he was responsible for getting the computer system installed and hes been having a closer look at some of the projects what is golden boy in vega construcciones said falcón is he just francisco dourado accountant or is he something more he thinks he should have been made the finance director by now but he hasnt said ramírez rafael vega was not prepared to let go of the money or rather he was not happy for someone to know that much about his business so hes the bookkeeper exactly but since vegas death hes had freedom of access he had it before but he was too scared about getting caught as i said he knows the computer system inside out and vázquez isnt it savvy enough to stop him so what are we looking at said falcón do we have any names for a start vladimir ivanov and mikhail zelenov said ferrera handing over two photos and profiles of the russians these came through just now from interpol vladimir ivanov vlado had a tattoo on his left shoulder was fairhaired blueeyed with a scar under his jawline on the right side of his face mikhail zelenov mikhas was dark and heavy kg with green eyes that were just slits in the fat of his face their illegal activities covered the full spectrum of mafia activity prostitution peopletrafficking gaming internet fraud and moneylaundering they both belonged to one of the main mafia gangs solntsevskaya which had more than five thousand members their sphere of operation was the iberian peninsula on the two projects which those guys are involved in there are two sets of books said ramírez the first ones have been prepared by dourado based on figures given to him by vega the second set have been kept by vega himself and they show how the projects are really being run moneylaundering has arrived in the seville construction industry said falcón the russians are pretty well financing the whole thing they supply all labour and materials vega construcciones supplies the architect the engineers and the supervising site workers so who owns the building and what did rafael vega get out of it the ownership details are with vázquez said ramírez all property deeds and deals are handled by him we havent moved on him yet i thought we should talk first all we know at the moment is that its a joint project with all the cash coming from the russians and the expertise from vega there has to be some balancing out somewhere vega is providing the shell through which the whole thing can work said falcón so thats significant but well have to fix up a meeting with vázquez tomorrow the two of us what about me asked ferrera i was involved in this part of the investigation too i know you were and im sure youve done good work said falcón but vázquez needs to feel the full weight of seniority in this case we might even have enough to apply for a search warrant ill call juez calderón so what am i going to be doing said ferrera were losing three men as from tonight said falcón by tomorrow morning well all be foot soldiers but ill be the only one actually on my feet we have to find sergei hes sixty hours ahead of us now which means weve probably lost him but he at the moment is our only possible witness theres got to be one last push at his possible escape routes ill ask juez calderón if we can put his photo in the press falcón dismissed them told them all to go to the bar la jota and hed buy them a beer they filed out he held ferrera back ive just had another thought he said you got on well with sr cabello i want you to go back to him and its going to have to be tonight because josé luis and i need to go into vázquez with the information tomorrow morning i want you to find out from him which properties he sold to rafael vega and in the case of the strategically placed ones which developments they opened up falcón drove her to the bar la jota and bought his round of beers he called calderón no answer he left the squad in the bar and on the way to isabel canos office dropped in on edificio de los juzgados it was silent the security guard said that calderón had left at pm and that he hadnt seen inés falcón called pablo ortega and asked if he could stop by his house to show him some photographs you and your photographs said ortega irritably as long as you make it quick isabel canos office was open but empty he knocked on the desktop and she shouted from her office for him to come in she was sitting at her desk with her heels off smoking her head was thrown back and her hair spilled down the black leather chair she smiled at him out of the corner of her face thank god for the weekend she said have you recovered your marbles yet if anything the idea has consolidated in my mind cops she said wincing at their mental incapacity we lead very sheltered lives but it doesnt mean youve got to be stupid said isabel please dont make me capitulate when ive only just started on manuela its bad for my image can i sit down she waved vaguely at a chair with her cigarette fingers falcón liked isabel cano but sometimes she could be abrasive there was no subject too delicate not to be slapped on the table and filleted like so much fish you know what ive been through isabel he said actually i dont she said surprising him i can only imagine what youve been through well thatll do said falcón the fact is i feel like a man whos lost everything all the things that made me human were brought into question people need a living structure to give themselves a sense of belonging all i have is memory which is unreliable but what i do have is a brother and a sister paco is a good man who will always do the right thing manuela is complicated for a whole bunch of reasons but which all boil down to the fact that she didnt get the love she wanted from francisco i dont feel sorry for her and nor should you said isabel but despite what i know about manuela her avarice possessiveness and covetousness i need her to be my sister i need to hear her call me her hermanito her little brother its sentimental illogical and offensive to your legal mind but its the way it is isabels leather chair creaked the air conditioning breathed the city slumped in silence and you think youll get it by giving her the house by coming to an agreement on the house which i no longer want to live in i will open up the possibility if i dont i will have to bear the brunt of her hate you might think you need her but she knows she doesnt need you you have become dispensable because you are no longer a fullblood relative you are just a barrier said isabel when you give people like manuela something all they want is more they are incapable of love your gift will not give what you crave but it will create resentment lending her hate more purpose each sentence was like a slap across his face as if she was bringing a hysteric back to reality youre probably right he said shaken by her verbal brutality but my nature dictates that i have to take a risk and hope youre proved wrong she threw up her hands and said shed draft a letter for him to read he offered to take her for a drink and a tapa in el cairo but she declined id offer you a drink here but i dont keep any in the office she said lets go to el cairo then said falcón i dont want what were going to talk about now to have any chance of local broadcast have we got anything else to talk about what you mentioned to me this morning esteban calderón said falcón sitting back down did you ask me about him now because hes going to get married to inés they announced it on wednesday he said do you remember who handled your divorce with inés you did so why is estebans history any business of yours im concerned for inés do you think that inés is some kind of innocent little sweetie who needs to be protected said isabel because i can tell you shes not this house youre so keen to give away to manuela i had to fight tooth and nail to stop inés from claiming half of it you dont have to worry about her she knows everything there is to know about esteban calderón i can assure you falcón nodded as small worlds previously closed to him opened up you called esteban a hunter this morning whats he hunting difference he doesnt know that yet said isabel but thats what hes always been looking for and what is this difference someone whose face he cannot read and whose mind he doesnt understand said isabel women have always thrown themselves at esteban theyve tended to be women from his professional life they all have legal minds he knows their architecture from the moment they walk into the room he plays with them in the hope that they will not be as they seem then he finds that theyre the same as all the others and he gets bored the hunt starts again hes doomed to the relentless movement of a shark that man falcón drove out of the darkening city the real world brutalized by the heat seemed very distant as his hands shifted automatically from gear stick to steering wheel within the cool cockpit of the car the street lights sliced shadows across the window as he drove down the banks of oleander on avenida de kansas city neon made promises out of the darkness and high palms held up the tent of the night sky nothing reached him apart from the red and green of the traffic lights he lived in his head while his automaton drove him to santa clara isabels words about calderón and inés ran through his mind like a news bar in lights falcón knew hed been through a patch of madness but now he was confronting the extraordinary lunacy of the perfectly sane people around him the only thing they had not discussed was the brief glimpse shed given falcón that morning of the hurt that had come to the surface at the mention of calderóns name he now realized that it had nothing to do with calderón himself the judge had become insignificant in isabels mind what had surfaced was the memory of her betrayal as a wife and mother who had been prepared to jeopardize her husband and family what shed shown him was the savage regret which had been lashed to that memory he had to pull off the avenida de kansas city beneath the red hovering neon of la casera to take a call from cristina ferrera whod spoken to sr cabello falcón opened up his city map and marked off the plots of land cabello had sold to vega and the two major developments that were opened up by their sale before he hung up he told her to keep an eye on nadia it was only after this call that he began to wonder what he was doing going for dinner with consuelo chapter friday th july as he pulled up outside pablo ortegas house he remembered montes standing at his window he should have asked him about the russians he called the jefatura and got a mobile number for montes montes answered the call from the background noise he was clearly in a bar and in their first exchange revealed himself to be very drunk this is javier falcón from the grupo de homicidios he said we spoke yesterday did we in your office we spoke about eduardo carvajal and sebastián ortega i cant hear you said montes music and voices blared shut the fuck up montes roared to total indifferencemomentito traffic noise a car horn can you hear me inspector jefe said falcón who are you falcón started again montes apologized elaborately now he remembered perfectly we also talked about the russian mafia i dont think so you explained the peopletrafficking business ah yes yes the people business i have a question there are two russians who are connected to my investigation into the death of sr vega the constructor you remember silence he shouted montess name im waiting for the question montes said do the names vladimir ivanov and mikhail zelenov mean anything to you concentrated nasal breathing came over the ether did you hear me asked falcón i heard you they dont mean anything to me but my memory is not what it should be ive had a couple of beers you see and im not at my best tonight well talk monday then said falcón and hung up falcón had a strong sense of circling as if he was a bird of prey high up in the thermals and there were things going on down in the terrestrial world that could be of interest he leaned against the roof of his car tapping his forehead with his mobile it was unusual for montes a married man to be drunk early on a friday evening in a crowded bar probably alone was that an evasive reaction to the two names had he seemed drunker at the end of the conversation than he was at the beginning ortega buzzed him into his stinking flyblown courtyard he wasnt as edgy as hed been on the phone because hed reached the affable stage of drunkenness he was wearing a voluminous white shirt untucked over blue shorts he offered falcón a drink he himself was sipping from a massive glass of red wine torre muga he said very good would you like some just a beer said falcón a few prawns with your beer he asked some jamon iberico de bellota i bought it today in the corte ingles ortega went to the kitchen and came back fully supplied im sorry i was sharp with you on the phone he said i shouldnt be bothering you with these things on a friday night i only go out at the weekend if im working said ortega who had been completely smoothed out by the excellence of the torre muga im a very bad member of the audience i see all the techniques i never lose myself in the play i prefer reading books im sorry if im rambling this is my second glass and as you can see they are quite some glasses i must find a cigar have you read a book by itll come to me he found the cigar box amongst the clutter cohibas he said i have a friend who goes to cuba regularly no thank you said falcón i dont give away my cohibas easily i dont smoke take one for a friend said ortega im sure even cops have friends as long as you dont give it to that cabron juez calderón hes not a friend said falcón ortega slipped the cigar into falcóns top pocket glad to hear it he said moving off a heart so white that was the book javier marias is the author have you read that some time ago i dont know how i could forget the title its from macbeth of course said ortega after macbeth has killed the king he returns with the bloody daggers which he is supposed to have left in the servants quarters his wife is furious and tells him he has to go back he refuses and she has to go when she returns she says my hands are of your colour but i shame to wear a heart so white her guilt at this stage is only a colour and not yet a stain she is ashamed of her innocence in the matter she wants a share in his guilt its a wonderful moment because of course by act v its out damned spot and all the perfumes of arabia will not sweeten this little hand why am i telling you this javier i have no idea pablo ortega took two huge gulps of red wine which leaked out of the corners of his mouth drops of red appeared on his white shirt hah he said looking down at himself you know what that is that is a filmic moment this only happens in the movies never in real life like oh come on there must be hundreds i cant think now the deer hunter the deer hunter a couple get married before the guy goes off to be a soldier in vietnam they drink out of a double cup and the wine spills on her bridal dress it prefigures yes yes yes it prefigures something terrible said ortega an embarrassment at dinner extra bleach in the washing awful awful things can i show you these photographs before i lose all visualoral linkage you mean er yes said falcón ortega roared with exaggerated laughter i like you javier i like you very much i dont like many people he said and stared out into the dark lawn the unlit swimming pool i dont like anybody in fact ive found the people ive dealt with in my life lacking do you think thats something that happens to celebrities fame attracts a certain type of person fawning obsequious deferential flattering sycophants francisco falcón hated them they reminded him of his fraudulence they reminded him that the only thing he wanted more than fame was real talent we want people to love us for what we are not for what we pretend to be or in my case all those people ive pretended to be said ortega who was becoming more dramatic by the moment im wondering if at my death ill drop to the floor and like a mad touretter all the characters ive ever portrayed will pour out of me in a compressed babble to silence leaving only a husk to be blown here and there in the wind i dont think so pablo said falcón youve got a lot to lose to become a husk im just layers he said not listening i remember francisco said the truth about an onion pablo is nothing you tease open that last bit of onion skin and thats what you find nothing well francisco was a man who knew his onions said falcón human beings are a little more complicated you tease them open and what do you find said ortega looming over falcón anxious with anticipation that were defined by what we hide from the world my god javier said ortega sucking in a vast quantity of muga you should try some of this wine you know its really very very good the photographs pablo lets get that out of the way when you told me you saw two russians going into sr vegas house on noche de reyes were these the men ortega took the shots and went to hunt down his spectacles i havent seen your dogs tonight said falcón oh theyre asleep those two all curled up in their pug fug its a good life the canine one said ortega i never showed you my collection did i another time i am not defined by what i hide but what i show to the world said ortega his arm sweeping slowly around the room where his collection lay on tabletops and up against the walls you know the worst thing you can say to a collector that you dont like a piece no that you do like one particular piece said ortega i have a picasso drawing its nothing special but you cant mistake it i divide the people i show my collection into two groups the ones who gravitate to the picasso with the words now i do like that and the ones who realize that a collection is about the whole there javier ive saved you some embarrassment ill make a point of telling you how much i love the picasso ortega held up his spectacles with a roar as if hed won the european cup he put his face into them almost warily as if it might be some hairtrigger trap hed set for himself the ones who gravitate to the picasso are the ones who are attracted to celebrity they see nothing else have you ever shown your collection to someone whos looked at the whole and found it lacking said ortega nobody has ever had the nerve to say that to my face but i know there have been some perhaps that means youve had the nerve to express everything through your collection the good and the bad weve all got something were ashamed of you must see it javier he said urgently the actors collection ortega confirmed that the two men in the shots were the russians hed seen going into vegas house back in january he hurled the photographs back to falcón and refilled his glass he sucked on his cohiba which he still hadnt lit the wine spots on his shirt had burgeoned with the sweat from his chest he tore off his glasses you remember our talk about sebastián this morning said falcón have you thought any more about that i have thought about it the clinical psychologist i told you about a woman called alicia aguado shes unusual how first of all shes blind said falcón and told ortega about her chinese pulsetaking technique i told her about your concerns for sebastián she thought it would be a good idea to meet she realizes that famous people dont like intruders bring her over said ortega charming and amenable the more the merrier how about tomorrow coffee he said eleven oclock and perhaps when youve taken her home youd like to come back and ill show you everything you need to know in the clear light of day consuelo jiménez was wearing a long blue crepe dress and gold sandals her bare arms were brown and muscular she was keeping up the gym and not just at a social level she sat him in the living room overlooking the sloppy blue ingot of the lit pool and gave him a chilled glass of manzanilla she put a tray of olives pickled garlic and capers out on the table and kicked off her sandals the ice in her tinto de verano clicked on the sides of the glass guess who came to see me this morning full of wheedling charm and flattery pablo ortega for one of the great actors of yesterday hes a little too easy to encapsulate she said it must mean hes got a limited range ive never seen him on the stage said falcón did you let him in i let him suffer in the heat for a bit i was interested to hear what he had to say for himself he didnt bring his two stage props along pavarotti and callas so i knew he hadnt come to entertain the boys where are your boys theyre with my sister shes taking them off to the coast tomorrow and theyre too riotous for dinner theyd want to see your gun and what did pablo ortega want to talk about rafaels death and your investigation of course i hope you didnt reveal my indiscretion i used it she said lighting up a cigarette but not in an overt way i just made him feel as if he was sitting on a bad sofa he left more uncomfortable than when he arrived im taking a look at his sons court case said falcón personally i think the sentences for child abuse are too lenient said consuelo once a childs been damaged in that way they can never recover their innocence has been taken away and i think thats not so different to murder he told her what montes had explained to him about the manipulation of the boys statement and sebastián ortegas refusal to defend himself well that doesnt exactly renew my faith in the justice system she said but i saw that glimmer of vanity in juez calderón when he was working on raúls case did you see anything else in him like what what we were talking about before like say ramírez you mean on the lookout for opportunities she said well i spotted him as unmarried and therefore a free agent yes i suppose thats different oh i see youre asking me why since hes announced his engagement to your little truthseeker is he sniffing around maddy krugman is there such a thing as premarital infidelity he was there this afternoon she said as you know i dont keep regular hours im here when most people are at work or in the case of juez calderón when he should be at work was marty there i assumed it was to do with the investigation into rafaels death she said shaking her head that would not be normal procedure he doesnt seem the sort to give a shit about normal procedure said consuelo anyway why should it bother you youre not still interested in inés no im not he said as if to emphasize it to himself liar dont make the same mistake twice javier she said i know its a deeply ingrained human trait but it should be resisted because all the pain that was there the first time round will be present and correct the second time round and then doubled i keep hearing from women with the powerful voice of experience listen to them she said standing up and slipping on her sandals im going to give you some food now and i dont want any more talk about these fools in love or your investigation she served jamon on toast with salmorejo crostini of grilled red peppers with an anchovy fillet gambas al ajillo octopus salad and piquillo peppers stuffed with saffron rice and chicken they drank a cold red basque rioja consuelo ate as if shed starved herself all day and falcón found the appetite that the summer heat had previously suppressed you are allowed that shameful final piquillo pepper she said lighting a cigarette there will now be a pause before the main course i read in a magazine review that you knew how to do everything in your restaurants he said its all simple stuff done well she said i dont understand those restaurants with a menu the size of a novel but which cant cook any of the dishes properly never spread yourself too thinly neither in life nor in love ill drink to that he said and they clinked glasses a question she said not about your investigation but it is connected to what happened before its something i think about every day since raúls past came out i know what youre going to ask you do ive thought about it myself go on then what happened to arturo said falcón is that it what happened to raúls little boy consuelo came round the table and took his face in both her hands and kissed him hard on the lips the voltage slammed through his spine and earthed itself down the chair legs i knew it she said and let him go running her fingertips across his cheeks so that nerves flashed all over his body falcón wondered if this physical invasion had changed him he saw himself hair frizzed and clothes smoking he had the taste of her on his mouth things started up inside him small bits of machinery which turned cogs and ran belts setting bigger wheels in motion thrusting drive shafts forward which were geared to pull back some vast unused piston rusted into its chamber are you all right javier she asked as she reached her end of the table ill get the main course while you decide how were going to find out what happened to arturo jiménez he gulped down half a glass of wine which nearly choked him stay calm consuelo returned with two grilled pieces of steak an inch thick blood oozed from the meat into a potato confection and a salad more basque rioja was put in his hand and a corkscrew he pulled the cork poured the wine he wanted to get her down on the floor amongst the chair legs find out what was under the blue crepe stay calm he watched her waist hips buttocks move around the table his eyeballs felt hot his cooling system was shot she sat back down he drank he was drunk how are we going to find arturo she asked unaware of the turmoil on the other side of the table ive never even been to morocco we should go he said the words out of his mouth before he could stop them what are you doing this summer im free in september then in september we shall go she said the estate of raúl jiménez can pay the expenses this steak is fantastic hand cut by rafael vega she said my god he knew what he was doing youre not concentrating she said theres too much happening to me at once he said slugging down more wine i think im reaching critical mass dont go off in here she said ive just had the decorators in he laughed poured more wine we should start a charity he said which specifically looks for missing children there must be one already well use retired policemen i know just the man hes the inspector jefe of the grupo de menores and hes coming up for retirement slow down javier she said youre talking too much youre eating too quickly youre drinking like a fish more wine he asked we need more wine youll be drunk and incapable if their eyes met across the table and stuff that was far too complicated to be talked about was instantly understood falcón dropped his knife and fork consuelo stood up they kissed she pushed her hands up under his shirt all sorts of personal hygiene matters tore through his brain he eased the zipper down her back ran his finger along the furrow of her spine and encountered no underwear his thighs shuddered her hands found his back adrenalin careered around his system steady on he thought or i wont have even got out of my trousers she saved him not here she said i dont want la puta americana nosing around with her camera she led him upstairs holding him by the wrist you know i havent done this for a long time he said following the two dimples in her lower back nor have i she said perhaps we should turn up the air conditioning chapter saturday th july in bed consuelo jiménez was as he had expected her to be exciting demanding and unrelenting in one of the several cigarette breaks shed revealed that this had been her first sex since shed been with basilio lucena on the night her husband raúl had been murdered since then shed been concentrated on the children i had an aids test too she said when i found out about basilios promiscuity you know i havent had much luck falcón turned his head on the pillow to find her dark eyes close to him it was negative she said this was how theyd talked which had fascinated falcón he couldnt remember lying in bed with a woman and talking about anything and everything even in the two big relationships in his life lying in bed had never been a time for honesty but for some acting role whose lines he wasnt sure of and a part he was not suited to they woke up early and stickily in the morning consuelo took him off for a shower and soaped him up with her body so that he had to support himself on the glass doors she took advantage of his arousal thrusting down on him so that the whole structure shuddered they dressed looking at each other he stood in her kitchen with a coffee and toast drizzled with olive oil his legs felt brand new straight out of the factory he didnt have even the scintilla of a hangover and yet three bottles of basque rioja stood empty by the bin still he looked at her wordlessly with big risky things going through his head id like to see you again he said im glad weve got that out of the way she said since the invention of the mobile phone women havent had to spend the day waiting but now we know for certain that he didnt call youll have to tell me how i can fit into your life he said yours is more complicated than mine you have children theyre going away youll follow them later in august i have no control over my time at the moment he said something happens and i have to react then call me when you have some time to spare she said unless its all taken up talking to your lawyers about manuela so that you cant have dinner with me he smiled he was falling in love with her humour her directness he told her his idea about selling the house to manuela and what isabel cano had advised take her advice said consuelo the best you can expect from manuela is respect and you get that by driving a hard bargain ill say this once javier and then its finished you can listen or ignore get a valuation on the house offer her a private sale less the agents commission and give her a week to respond before you put it on the open market he nodded this was what he needed in his life simplification he pulled her to him kissed her through the smell of coffee and toast it was am he called ramírez on his mobile have you made an appointment to see carlos vázquez this morning asked falcón what about the search warrant from juez calderón i couldnt get hold of him said falcón and i checked his office last night then well just have to try and talk it out of vázquez said ramírez ill call you when ive set up the meeting with him ive just put sergeis face up on the computer national and international falcón called alicia aguado to ask her if he could pick her up and bring her out to santa clara to meet pablo ortega later that morning on the way back into town ramírez told him that vázquez would be in his office until midday falcón took down the address and said hed meet him there in fifteen minutes he took a call from cristina ferrera nadias gone she said two guys came round last night and picked her up and they didnt bring her back has that happened before shes always back in the apartment by five or six in the morning said ferrera what do i do unless theres someone whos prepared to give you a detailed description of the two guys which i doubt theres nothing you can do said falcón carlos vázquezs offices were in the edificio viapol in a soulless part of the city on the edge of san bernardo ramírez was waiting for him at the entrance they went up in the lift ramírez stared into the side of his face what are you looking at josé luis you he said grinning i heard it in your voice now ive seen you in the same clothes you were wearing yesterday its confirmed what exactly he said thinking hed be able to brazen this out i am the expert said ramírez holding his huge fingers to his chest nearly offended by his bosss effrontery i can tell even over the phone that youve finally come to the end of a drought what drought is it true or am i a liar said ramírez laughing who is it i dont know what youre talking about ramírezs big dark mahogany face took up falcóns vision the individual rails of the inspectors black pomaded hair stood out pin sharp it wasnt la americana was it ive heard about her from felipe and jorge they said shed leave a man as hollow as a spare suit i think we should concentrate on what were going to say to carlos vázquez josé luis no no no shes not the one la americana is juez calderóns latest squeeze who did you hear that from said falcón the guys just announced his engagement for gods sake ramírez laughed a mirthless guffaw the lift stopped they went into vázquezs offices to be confronted by a large painting of an abstract cityscape vague lights and building outlines coming through fog it struck falcón that this was the sort of piece that ramon salgado might have sold ill lead this discussion said falcón i dont want you to instigate anything because i know things you dont josé luis its important and i know things youve never even thought about said ramírez falcón wanted to know what those things were but one of vázquezs junior lawyers was already on top of them they were shown into vázquezs office which had a view of the back of the buildings on calle balbino marron vázquez asked them to sit down while he continued to read through a document there was a large map of seville behind him on which the locations of various projects were shown in different coloured squares vázquez threw the papers in an outtray and sat back falcón introduced ramírez and vázquez took an instant dislike to him so im getting the full weight of the homicide squad he said that painting in your reception area said falcón whos it by thats an interesting question said vázquez lost for a moment he likes to get warmed up first said ramírez smiling its by a german called kristian lutze i understand its an abstract of berlin hes done another one of cologne which hangs in the foyer of vega construcciones how did you and sr vega acquire them through an art dealer here in seville called ramon salgado he of course you know he was murdered how did sr vega know ramon salgado ramírez slumped in his chair bored i dont know said vázquez not through you i have to confess that its not really my interest it was a gift from rafael said vázquez i like cars what sort of cars asked ramírez they looked at him he shrugged can i smoke he asked vázquez nodded ramírez lit up sat back hands behind his head is this social asked vázquez annoyed or something else sr vega was running two projects with russian partners said falcón vladimir ivanov and mikhail zelenov they arent strictly partnerships said vázquez vega construcciones was contracted by two russian clients to provide technical help they were being paid for architectural plans site engineers gang supervisors and some equipment on completion of the structure vega construcciones were also to be involved in the interior planning air conditioning electrics lift installation plumbing that kind of thing these are unusual projects for vega construcciones said falcón normally they do all the physical work while the partners supply the necessary finance and in recent times as far as i know theyve always retained a controlling percentage in the projects thats true who owned the land on which the two russian projects were being built the russians themselves they came to rafael with the proposal said vázquez they are not sevillebased sr zelenov has had some projects in marbella and sr ivanov is in vilamoura in the algarve it was easier for them to contract the work out than start up their own companies are they linked these russians asked falcón do they know each other i i dont know so you dealt with them separately said falcón two unusual deals with different russians out of the blue said ramírez interested now whats the point youre making all youve got to do is answer the questions said ramírez could you show us on that map behind you where the two russian projects are located asked falcón vázquez pointed out two green squares which were amongst a mass of orange falcón flipped through his notebook and went up close to the map and what is unique about those two locations asked falcón vázquez looked at the map like a schoolboy who knows the right answer but whose confidence has been shattered by a brutal teacher even i can see it said ramírez i dont see what this has got to do with rafael vegas death said vázquez angry now just answer the question said ramírez putting a big meaty elbow on the desk they are both in locations where all the other projects are being developed by vega construcciones said falcón so what said vázquez weve spoken to sr cabello he pointed out that of the properties he brought to vega construcciones on the back of his daughters marriage to rafael vega two held the key to the development of whole areas one area owned by vega construcciones and the other by another developer who without sr cabellos plot would be unable to develop it when sr vega came into ownership that developer had to sell out to sr vega or friends of sr vega thats what those two russian plots have got in common silence apart from some flamboyant smoking by ramírez who was enjoying his bosss magic show this is admirable footwork on your part inspector jefe said vázquez but are we any closer to understanding what happened to sr vega sr vegas russian friends were known mafiosi we think they were using these projects to clean up cash theyd been making from peopletrafficking and prostitution why was sr vega involved with these people and why was he giving them extremely advantageous deals you cant possibly prove any of this perhaps your office was involved in the property deals possibly you have the deeds here and a record of payments made said falcón you could remind yourself now said ramírez the only documents i have are the contracts for the building of the projects which are in the archives and the person who runs that is on holiday so the property deals were done direct between the original owner of the land and the russians said falcón did sr vega ask the original owner to give the russians a sweet deal which he would make up to them elsewhere i really dont know inspector jefe but we could have a look at the sale details of the other plots which i assume as sr vegas lawyer you were involved in and make a comparison of the prices paid said falcón you do have those details here dont you sr vázquez i told you the person who runs the archives is it doesnt matter we can of course talk to the original owners of the plots thats just the fine detail that the court will require said falcón what wed like to know is why sr vega was involved with these russians and expediting their moneylaundering operations i dont know how you can justify that remark said vázquez there are two projects with these russians there are two contracts there are two clear sets of books which show the financial involvement of both parties weve been around to see these projects said ramírez they were looking a little bare of people without the illegal labour thats the russians problem not vega construcciones in that case said ramírez maybe you can tell us why sr vega kept another set of books for these two projects the official version for tax purposes and his private version which was the reality you might also venture an opinion on why sergei the gardener has disappeared since the discovery of the body said falcón and why sr vega was getting social visits from his russian clients at his home on noche de reyes for instance doesnt that sound a little more intimate than the usual business partner all right all right youve proved your point said vázquez youve discovered a russian connection but that is all if you want to know things about that relationship then i cant help you because i dont know anything all i can say is ask the russians if you can find them how do you contact them i dont i drew up the contracts they were returned to me by vega construcciones signed and stamped said vázquez and you wont find anybody in their offices whos spoken to them either they must have phone numbers addresses bank accounts said ramírez you think theyre the moscow mafia we know they are well maybe they are and maybe they had good reason to kill a man who was facilitating their business needs but i cant think what that reason would be said vázquez and i doubt youll ever find out if there was a reason and that they did kill him these people keep themselves well removed from the situation as i said ive never met them so inspector jefe inspector its all in your hands now you know as much as i do now i think that concludes our business for this morning so please excuse me on the way down in the lift ramírez jangled the change in his pocket falcón told him to get cristina ferrera to find the names of the original owners of the two plots sold to the russians thats police work for you said ramírez punching ferreras number into his mobile one moment you think youve got them nailed and the next theyve disappeared over the horizon what things do you know that ive never even thought about asked falcón remembering ramírezs earlier comment even if we do find sergei and he has seen something whats he going to tell us said ramírez regretting his loose talk now we were talking about juez calderón on the way up in the lift and you said that you knew things that id never even thought about josé luis it was nothing just something to say it didnt sound like that said falcón it sounded as if it was something about juez calderón that was personal to me its nothing forget it said ramírez ferrera came on the line and ramírez relayed falcóns message about the plots of land tell me josé luis just tell me said falcón im not mad any more im not going to throw myself into the traffic if you all right all right said ramírez as the lift reached the ground floor ill ask you a question and you see if you can tell me the answer they left the building and stood facing each other in the sweltering street when did juez calderón and inés start seeing each other said ramírez chapter saturday th july back at home in the cool of his bedroom falcón stripped off the clothes that had marked him out to ramírez as an amateur he stood under the shower and stared out through the fogged glass doors and thought about the way isabel cano had spoken to him about inés an innocent little sweetie she knew those words that inspector jefe montes had used about calderón you like him inspector jefe id never have thought it he knew felipe and jorge perez serrano and baena the whole of the edificio de los juzgados and the palacio de justicia they all knew thats what happens to you when youre buried in your own life you dont see anything you dont even see that someone else is fucking your wife under your nose he shook his head as he remembered that horrible algebra that the police psychologist had made him use when did you split up with your wife when did you last have sex with her if we separated in july then it must have been may that was may he dressed and left the house he needed another coffee before he went to pick up alicia aguado he bought el pais and went to the cafe san bernardo and ordered a cafe solo at the bar cristina ferrera called from the vega construcciones offices giving him the details of the original owner of the plots whod sold out to the russians unfortunately the man was on holiday in south america and would not be back until september she also mentioned that the accountant had hacked into vegas address book and had found a number for the russians a single number for both russians and it was in vilamoura in the algarve portugal he closed down the phone and tried to read his newspaper but this time rather than the humiliation of learning about a tawdry affair running through his mind he found memories of last night surfacing the sight of consuelo astride him the small strip of her pubic hair hovering over him her unswerving stare as she eased him into her her words i want to see you inside me christ his throat was too tight for him to swallow the newsprint blurred he had to shake himself back into real life the cafe people sitting around sex mattered to consuelo she was good at it when her orgasm was coming she let out a kind of low feline growl and when she came it was with a massive grunt of effort like a sprinter hitting the finishing line she liked to be on top and when it was over she knelt above him hair hanging down some of it plastered to her face panting unconscious to the world her breasts shuddering with each breath he thought sex with inés had been good he thought they had hit it off in bed but now he realized there had been something withdrawn about her something held back it was as if she couldnt let herself go to the animal edge of her being something in her head told her that this was not quite how she should behave was that true is this what the mind does when youve been drawn to another partner persuade you that the last one wasnt up to much maybe that was what calderón had seen as well that with inés there is none of that difference that isabel cano spoke about inés is beautiful intelligent and attractive but he knows how its all going to unfold and it was at that moment just as his mobile had started to vibrate in his pocket that he realized it was over it was none of his business it didnt matter to him any more he didnt give a shit about inés or calderón or what the hell happened to them in their miserable lives something gave way inside him he had a physical sensation of release of tension breaking of ropes flying off and whipping back into the night he grinned and looked around himself at the whole cafes magnificent unconcern and then took the call from alicia aguado asking him where the hell he was because this wasnt a consultation they kissed hello and she immediately noticed a difference in him youre happy she said a few things have fallen into place youve had some sex i dont believe you can tell that he said and anyway this isnt an appointment they drove out to santa clara for the meeting with pablo ortega there was no answer when falcón rang the bell by the gate but he noticed that the wooden door had been left open they coughed at the stench from the cesspit which falcón had warned her about aguado held on to falcóns elbow as they made their way to the kitchen on the other side of the house there was no sign of ortega and it was past eleven oclock hes probably walking the dogs said falcón well take a seat in the shade by the pool and wait for him i dont know how he can live with that stink dont worry you dont notice it inside hes had that part of the house sealed off walking into that everyday would make me suicidal well pablo ortega is not a happy man he sat her down at the table by the pool and walked along the edge towards the deep end he stood on the small diving board and looked down there seemed to be a sack sitting on the bottom he found a pole lying by the side of the pool it had a net at one end and a hook at the other what are you doing javier asked alicia concerned by his silent activity theres a sack in the bottom of the pool something like an old fertilizer bag the sack was heavy he had to push it along the bottom to the edge of the pool and then drag it down to the shallow end where he pulled it out it must have weighed thirty kilos he undid the twine at the neck of the sack and gasped at its horrific contents what is it said alicia on her feet disorientated by the sounds he was making panicked its pavarotti and callas said falcón ortegas dogs this doesnt look good someone has drowned his dogs she said no he said i think hes drowned his own dogs falcón told her to stay sitting by the pool he went to the kitchen door which was shut but not locked he opened it and the horrific stink of the cesspit was thick in the room there were two empty bottles of torre muga on the table he went into the sitting room where there was another empty bottle of wine and the box of cohibas ortega had offered him last night no glass the smell of raw sewage was more powerful and he realized that the seal to the other part of the house had been broken the door to the hallway was open and across the corridor the door to the room with the cracked cesspit was ajar on the floor in the corridor was an empty bottle of nembutal with no top he pushed the door open there were wooden boards and plastic sheeting thrown against the wall which had a large subsidence crack in it a hole in the floor had been opened up by workmen so that they could inspect the damage fragments of ortegas shattered wine glass were all over the bare concrete and tiles there was a burnt out cigar stub as well in the hole just below the surface of the sewage was the white and yellow sole of pablo ortegas right foot falcón called the jefatura on his mobile he specifically asked that juez calderón be notified as the death might be relevant to the vega case he also asked for cristina ferrera but instructed that ramírez should be left alone he backed out of the room and went up the corridor to the master bedroom on the smooth untouched burgundy cover of the bed were two letters one addressed to javier falcón and the other to sebastián ortega he left them where they were and went back to alicia aguado who was still sitting by the pool very frightened he told her that pablo ortega appeared to have committed suicide i cant believe this said falcón i saw him last night and he was on his way to becoming very drunk but he was affable charming generous he even said that after our meeting today he was going to show me his collection his mind was made up said alicia who was holding on to herself as if she was freezing cold in c damn said falcón to himself i cant help feeling responsible for this ive stirred things up and its nobody is responsible for another person killing themselves said alicia firmly he has a whole history that wont have been changed or even particularly stirred up by talking to javier falcón for a couple of hours of course i know that i suppose what i mean is that ive precipitated it by pushing him too hard you mean you werent just talking to him about sebastián i thought he had information that might help my investigation was he a suspect not exactly a suspect i could just see that i was making him nervous the questions i was asking him whether they were about his son or the rafael vega case for some reason disturbed him just out of interest from the psychological point of view she said how did he kill himself he got drunk took some sleeping pills and drowned himself in the cracked cesspit hes planned it out pretty carefully hasnt he she said drowning the dogs i asked after his dogs last night said falcón he said they were sleeping hed probably already killed them any suicide note two letters one to me and the other to his son ive left them until the juez de guardia gets here he knew you were going to be the first person in here this morning she said no nasty surprises for anybody but the professional the gate and doors conveniently left open he thought it all out down to the last detail of throwing himself in the cesspit what do you mean i thought you said that part of the house was sealed off i did so he went to the trouble of breaking the seal because it was psychologically important for him to drown himself in shit his own shit she said im sure the pills and alcohol would have done the job on their own alcohol can induce vomiting all right so he was making sure of it as well but he could have used the pool less private but it was good enough for his dogs assuage my guilt alicia give me a theory he said as you know theres been a buildup of events even before you started coming to see him about rafael vega she said his son has been jailed in a highprofile case for a nasty crime he himself was ostracized by his community so that he had to leave his apartment and theres a story behind that which you still dont know hes moved here to a place which on the face of it suits him a garden city a wealthy community peace and quiet but it didnt turn out like that he felt dislocated and craved the involvement of the barrio the house he bought developed an unpleasant and antisocial problem to us that would seem an irritating and expensive inconvenience but to pablo ortega it probably achieved some sort of significance in his mind then his neighbour died he wanted to know if sr vega had committed suicide so it was already on his mind said alicia ive left out the fact that his son didnt want to see him either another isolating factor then javier falcón arrived on the scene perceiving an injustice in sebastiáns case and wanting to help as you know from your own experience you cant help without stirring things up and what came to the surface of pablo ortegas mind whatever it was he didnt want to know about it he didnt think it worth staying alive to face it so not only does he not bring the difficult things to the surface he actually submerges himself he drowns his memories in his own ordure his sweet and innocent dogs did not get that treatment falcón shook his head in dismay you were asking him about his son javier and you said you were putting pressure on him through your investigation what did you suspect him of having done i dont want to talk about that just yet it would help if you came to this with an open mind he said that is if you want to be involved it doesnt have to be any of your business im involved she said id like to know what the letters say and it might be interesting to know what he had in his collection a patrol car pulled up outside the house weve got to do our work first he said but i dont think this will take very long an ambulance parked up behind the patrol car felipe and jorge turned up a few minutes later along with the juez de guardia juan romero there was a quick conference about the relevance of this suicide to the vega case calderón called romero who gave him falcóns verbal report it was decided to treat them separately cristina ferrera arrived in time to hear the decision falcón gave them a tour of the crime scene via the dead dogs by the pool and the interior of the house felipe took the crime scene shots while jorge inspected the dogs and scraped meat from between their teeth ferrera checked the telephone for messages and asked the phone company for a breakdown of calls in and out she searched for a mobile the ambulancemen came in and decided that ortegas body had been weighted to keep it submerged and would have to be winched out via a pulley in the ceiling they went to get a block and tackle felipe and jorge moved in and bagged all the evidence before moving on to the bedroom the médico forense arrived and sat chatting with alicia aguado by the pool while he waited for the body to be lifted out felipe handed over the letters to falcón unopened in evidence bags the ambulancemen chipped away at the ceiling until they found a reinforced concrete beam and started drilling falcón took the letters into the sitting room to read ferrera hadnt found the mobile he sent her out to speak to the neighbours to see what ortegas movements had been in the last twentyfour hours private and confidential th july dear javier i think you must have realized now that i chose you and i am sorry if this has upset you you are the professional and as i said i like you and i want this the last scene of my final act to pass safely into your hands just in case there is some doubt or some opportunistic burglar has happened on the scene and messed up my tragedy i would like to declare unequivocally that i have taken my own life this was not a snap decision it was certainly not provoked by any recent developments but is a culmination of events i have come to the end of my road and found it a cul desac with no possibility of retracing my steps and doing all the things that i should have done it was a dead end with only one exit and i chose it with clear eyes if not a clear conscience my reasons for having taken my own life are the only reasons a suicide can have i am weak and i am selfish i have neglected my son this has been the stamp of all my family and personal relationships and has happened probably because i am consumed by vanity the reward for this is my loneliness my son is in prison my family have grown tired of me my community has thrown me out my profession has shunned me vanity in case you do not know this requires an audience life inside my bubble has become intolerable i have no one to perform to and therefore i am no one it probably seems absurd that someone of my fame and in my comfortable circumstances should have chosen this end i can feel myself on the brink of a long and rambling explanation but it would only be the torre muga speaking my apologies for the inconvenience javier please give the other letter to my son sebastián i hope you succeed in helping him where i have so singularly failed con un abrazo pablo ortega ps i never showed you my collection please enjoy it at your leisure pps please inform my brother ignacio his number is in the address book on the kitchen table falcón read the letter through several times until his thoughts were interrupted by the sound of an electric winch he stood at the door as ortegas stained and bloated body emerged from under the floor the masked ambulancemen pulled him away from over the hole and lowered him on to the concrete he had a large flat rock taped to his chest and another one shoved down his blue shorts falcón called in the médico forense and asked felipe to take more shots he went to sit with alicia aguado and read her ortegas letter i dont think hes as drunk as he makes out there were three empty bottles of muga in there they werent inside him when he wrote this letter she said hes stated his guilt but hes been very careful not to admit to anything the denial that his suicide has anything to do with recent developments seems to be important he is in denial he cannot face up to whatever it is that he believes will be revealed by these recent developments the only recent developments i know about are rafael vegas death and me volunteering to help his son cristina ferrera came back from talking to the few neighbours she could find ortega had walked his dogs yesterday morning hed been out in his car twice at about am and pm both trips were for about an hour and a half each would you bother to walk your dogs if you were going to kill them asked falcón it seems to have been a routine said ferrera his neighbour walked his dog at the same time and even condemned men get fed and exercised killing them is to do with his admitted selfishness and vanity they were a part of him only he knew how to love them said alicia aguado you saw him yesterday morning before he went out javier what did you talk about then i was interested in his relationship with rafael vega how he knew him whether hed met him through raúl jiménez and whether he knew any of the people around those men i had a photograph of him with some people at a party which seemed to unnerve him i also talked to him about his sons case then left but no thats not quite right he told me about a recurring dream then i left but i came back to ask him about something id forgotten and i saw him sink to his knees in the garden weeping alicia aguado asked about the dream and he described ortegas vision of himself in a field with his hurting hands i read your report of your first meeting said ferrera he was very different then yes he was much more the actor most of that interview was performance said falcón he was more serious in subsequent talks the pressure was building what were you being accusatory about javier asked aguado i dont want to talk about it until ive got it clear in my mind he said ive got a lot more work to do on that jorge called falcón over for a crime scene conference they were convinced it was suicide they had found nothing to lead them to believe it happened any other way ortegas fingerprints were over everything juan romero asked the médico forense for his opinion time of death was about am cause was drowning there was a single mark on his forehead which probably happened as he fell into the hole my prelab inspection verdict is that he committed suicide juez romero signed off the levantamiento del cadáver falcón told him that he would inform the next of kin as the dead man had requested the paramedics removed the body and those of the two dogs felipe and jorge left falcón told ferrera to follow up on the phone numbers on monday and let her go he went to the kitchen found the address book and called ignacio ortega on his mobile which was turned off he told romero they would delay telling the press about ortegas death until his brother had been informed the ambulance and cars moved off towards avenida de kansas city a patrol car remained with an officer to keep an eye on the house the news announcement of ortegas death might arouse public interest falcón offered to take alicia aguado home but she was keen to hear a description of the ortega collection mentioned in the suicide letter the collection which ortega had moved into the living room when the cesspit cracked was distributed around one end of the room the small pieces on tables the bigger carvings on the floor and the paintings leaning up against the walls there was a sheet of paper taped to an antique table in the living room listing all the pieces in the collection with their purchase dates and prices falcón ran his eye down the eighteen pieces on the list to the francisco falcón painting hed seen on his first visit this is interesting he said ortega bought the francisco falcón painting on th may that was after hed been revealed as a fraud and he picked it up for a quarter of a million pesetas what did they used to sell for hed have had to pay around two million said falcón it was a good buy because theyve come back up again now the oldfashioned collectors wanted to get rid of everything they had by francisco falcón when the news first broke but now theres a different market for the work theyre a sort of postmodern crowd who have a new take on what is real art between them and the infamy hunters and the celebrity criminal ghouls theyve rebuilt the price so he knew francisco but only bought one of his paintings once hed been exposed said aguado thats telling us something he told her about the picasso drawing of a centaur and how ortega used it as a test talk me down the list she said ill stop you if i need more information two carved african ebony figures of boys holding spears ivory coast one mask zaire describe the mask javier she said actors are experts on masks its sixty centimetres long twenty wide it has red hair two slit eyes and a long nose theres pieces of bone and shards of mirror stuck in the mouth like teeth its a pretty terrifying thing but beautifully shaped bought in new york in for nine hundred and fifty dollars it sounds like a witch doctors mask carry on the next four are meissen figurines all male i hate figurines she said one mirror full length with a rococo gilt frame paris nine thousand francs something to look at himself in with a halo of gold a roman glass bottle opaque with the colours of the rainbow a set of eight silver coins also roman one gilt chair louis xv london for which he paid nine thousand pounds thats expensive enough to be his throne one horse bronze at full gallop roman one bulls head greek one shard of pottery of a boy running greek a piece by manuel rivera called anatomia en el espejo anatomy through a mirror whats that metal fabrics on wood mirror image difficult to describe said falcón theres also a painting here by zobel called dry garden and an indian erotic painting what sort of eroticism a pretty graphic depiction of a man with an oversized penis having sex with a woman said falcón and thats it a very complicated man with his figures masks and mirrors she said is there any indication as to how the collection was originally set out falcón looked through the drawers of the antique desk and found a series of photographs of the collection each one dated on the back in all of them pablo ortega was seated on the louis xv chair he found the most recent shot which included all the pieces except the indian erotic painting and the zobel then he realized that the zobel was positioned so that ortega was looking at it and the indian painting was such a recent acquisition it hadnt been included he described the layout to alicia aguado he seems to be showing us the beauty and the beast the mask from zaire is both all the pieces on one side seem to be the stuff of beauty nobility and magnificence picassos centaur the bulls head the galloping horse the running boy im simplifying it because there are complications centaurs are monsters too whats the boy running away from there are the coins and the beautiful but empty roman bottle also the rivera painting reflected in the gilt mirror i dont understand that and the other side the fraudulent francisco falcón ortega spent his life pretending the beautiful figurines locked in porcelain the actor in his roles and the inference of i am as hollow as they are the mirror is a hard reflective thing that gilds his narcissism and the black ebony boys i dont know guarding his secrets or keeping them and why is he always looking at the dry garden thats probably his vision of death beautiful but desiccated she said you know you cant use any of this in court javier no he said laughing at the absurdity im just hoping for an insight pablo told me he had everything on show in this collection he had nothing to hide whats your overall impression its a very male collection the only female figure is in the indian erotic painting even the nonhuman pieces are masculine horses bulls and centaurs what happened to his wife sebastiáns mother she died of cancer but this is interesting not before shed run off and ill quote pablo directly on this not before shed run off to america with a guy with a big dick oh dear said alicia in mock dismay trouble in the bedroom now im wondering with all these mirrors masks and figures whether the biggest role he ever played was himself in his own life pretending to be a strong powerful sexually potent male when in fact he wasnt maybe its time for us to speak to his son said falcón chapter saturday th july on the way to the prison which was outside seville in alcalá falcón called the director whom he knew well and explained the situation the director was at home but said that he would make all the necessary calls the prisoner would be made available to him on his arrival and there was no problem about bringing alicia aguado in with him he made it clear that a prison psychologist would also have to be present and a nurse in case sebastián ortega had to be sedated the prison out on a burnt piece of landscape on the road to antequera oscillated so violently in the waves of heat shimmering off the ground that at times it completely disappeared to the eye they drove through the outer gates between two chainlink fences topped by razor wire and up to the prison walls where they parked after the brutality of the heat outside the security checks in the cool institutional corridors were a relief as they came closer to where the prisoners were kept the stink of incarcerated men became more powerful the air ticked with bored minds bent on compressing time while they rebreathed the strong hormonal brew of bottled frustrations they were taken to a room with a single high window which was barred on the outside there was a table and four chairs they sat ten minutes later the prison psychologist on duty came and introduced himself the psychologist knew sebastián ortega and believed him to be harmless he explained that the prisoner was not totally silent but rarely said any more than the bare minimum a nurse would be along in a moment and they were prepared for all eventualities including violence although he didnt think it would come to that two guards brought sebastián ortega in and sat him down at the table falcón had not seen a photograph of him before this meeting and so was unprepared for the mans beauty he had none of the physical traits of his father he was slim metres with blond hair and tobacco coloured eyes he had high fragile cheekbones which didnt look as if they could survive much prison violence he moved with a slow grace and sat with his longfingered artistic hands resting on the table in front of him he used the fingers of one hand to polish each individual nail of the other the prison psychologist made the introductions sebastián ortega did not take his eyes off alicia aguado for one moment and when the psychologist had finished he leaned forward slightly excuse me he said in a high almost girlish voice but are you blind yes i am she replied thats an affliction i wouldnt mind he said why we believe too much in what our eyes tell us he said they draw us into enormous disappointments the prison psychologist who was standing at the side of the table explained to him that falcón had come here to give him some news ortega did not acknowledge him but sat back nodded and left his fidgeting hands on the table im sorry to have to tell you sebastián that your father died at three oclock this morning said falcón he took his own life there was no reaction more than a minute passed while the goodlooking face remained unmoved did you hear the inspector jefe asked the psychologist a single nod and a lowering of the eyelids the prison officials looked at each other do you have any questions for the inspector jefe asked the psychologist sebastián breathed in and shook his head he wrote this letter to you said falcón laying it down on the table sebastiáns hand snapped out of its small unconscious task to bat the letter to the floor as it skittered over the tiles tension grew in his body tendons and sinew stood out in his wrists and forearms he gripped the edge of the table as if he was trying not to fall backwards and the table shook with a muscular spasm his face started to break up and with a terrible sob he shunted the chair out from under him and fell to his knees his features were contorted with pain eyes squeezed shut teeth bared alicia aguado put her hands out feeling the air in front of her sebastiáns body convulsed once more and he fell to the floor only at this moment did any of the men in the room react the chairs and table were pulled out of the way and they all stood over sebastián who had now gone foetal holding himself his head writhed against the polished floor and he coughed up great dry sobs of emotion as if chunks of pumice were lodged in his chest the nurse knelt opened his bag and took out a syringe the guards hovered alicia felt her way around the table and reached out for sebastiáns trembling frame dont touch him said one of the guards she put a hand out which found the back of sebastiáns neck she stroked him whispered his name the convulsions smoothed out he relaxed his grip on his shins the sobbing up until that moment had been dry but now he wept like falcón had never seen anybody weep before tears and saliva poured out of him he tried to get his hands to his face to hide this awful outpouring but he seemed to be too weak the guards stepped back no longer disturbed just slightly embarrassed the nurse replaced the syringe in the bag the psychologist weighed the situation and decided to let it continue after ten minutes of sustained weeping sebastián rolled on to his knees and buried his face in his arms on the floor his back shuddered the psychologist decided that he should be taken back to his cell and given a sedative the guards tried to get him to stand but he had no strength in his legs he was unmanageable in this state and they put him down on the floor and went to get a wheelchair falcón retrieved the letter and gave it to the psychologist the guard returned with a trolley from the prison hospital sebastián was wheeled away the psychologist decided hed better read the letter to see if the contents would disturb sebastián any more falcón could see that there were very few words on the page dear sebastián i am more sorry than i can ever possibly say please forgive me your loving father pablo falcón and alicia drove out of the bleached landscape of the prison and back into the crushing heat of the city alicia aguado stared out of the window the lifeless terrain flickered past her unseeing eyes questions came to falcón but he didnt ask them after that emotional display everything seemed banal even after all these years said alicia im still astonished by the terrifying power of the mind we have this organism sitting in our heads which if we allow it can completely destroy us to the point where we will never be the same again and yet its ours it belongs to us we have no idea what weve got sitting on our shoulders falcón said nothing she wasnt looking for a reply you witness something like that she said flapping her hand in the vague direction of the prison and you cannot imagine what has gone on in that mans mind what has passed between him and his father it was as if the news of his fathers death went straight to the core of his being and ripped him open and out came all these incredibly powerful uncontainable polarized emotions he was probably barely alive just existing on automatic hed put himself in prison in solitary confinement his personal contact is almost zero hes ceased to function as a human being and yet the mind still has to find a way out why do you think hes relieved to be there as your friend was saying i suppose hed got to the point where he was afraid of what his uncontrollable mind might do do you think you can talk to him well im here at sebastiáns moment of crisis his fathers suicide and i think weve formed a bond if the prison authorities let me im sure i can help him i know the prison director said falcón ill tell him your work could be valuable to my investigation into vegas death but you do think that theres a connection she said this whole thing with pablo i can hear your brain chewing it over i know but im just not sure what it is he dropped alicia aguado off at her house and had another go at contacting ignacio ortega whose mobile was still switched off consuelo called him and asked if he wanted to meet for lunch at casa ricardo a bar halfway between her restaurant and falcóns home he decided to drop the car at home and walk he parked between the orange trees and went to open the doors as he reached for his keys a woman called to him from across the street maddy krugman had just come out of a shop which specialized in handpainted tiles her casual behaviour did not persuade him that this was an accidental meeting so this is your house she said as they stood between the two files of orange trees that led up to the wooden doors the famous house the infamous house he said thats my favourite shop in seville she said i think im going to take their entire stock back to new york with me are you leaving no not immediately she said but in the end you know we all go back to where we started he wasnt sure what she meant or that she knew either he toyed with the possibility of wishing her well on her shopping trip and disappearing into his house but he couldnt quite find the rudeness to do it would you like to see inside the infamous house he said i could offer you a drink thats very nice of you inspector jefe she said ive been out shopping im exhausted they went in he sat her down under the arches of the patio in front of the trickling fountain and went to fetch a bottle of la guita and some olives when he came back she was across the patio looking through the glass doors at some of francisco falcóns paintings of seville are these theyre his real work he said giving her a glass of manzanilla he didnt have to cheat to do these he was better than that though this was his subconscious mind belittling him if hed kept at it hed have painted barebreasted gypsies and doeeyed children piddling into fountains what about your work i dont have any i read that you were a photographer i was interested in the concept of photography as memory he said i had no talent for the art what about you how do you see it what do you see as the point of photographing disturbed and anguished people what bullshit did i give you before i dont remember probably something about capturing the moment said falcón remembering that in fact that had been his bullshit they walked back to the table he leaned against a pillar she sat crossed her legs and sipped the manzanilla im empathizing she said and falcón knew he wasnt going to hear anything that would make any difference to him when i see people like that i remember the prison of my own anguish and the pain i caused marty theres an emotional response i was surprised once i started looking how many of us there were out there the shots are of individuals but once you assemble them in a room they become like a tribe they are an expression of the reality of the human condition shit it doesnt matter how hard i try it always sounds like gallery talk dont you find that words have a way of flattening things out he nodded bored by her already he wondered what calderón saw in her apart from the blue veins under the white skin cold as marble this one was living life out as a project falcón stifled a yawn youre not listening to me she said he came round to find her standing quite close to him close enough for him to see the red blood spots in the green of her iris she licked her lips applying some natural gloss her sexuality in which she was so confident shimmered beneath the silk of her loose blouse she moved her head a slight tilt to tell him that he could kiss her now while her eyes said that this could turn into something frantic on the marble flags of the patio if he wanted he turned his head away he was slightly revolted by her i was half listening he said but ive got a lot on my mind and im meeting someone for lunch so i should really be getting on i must go too she said i have to get back her hands trembled with rage as she picked up her bag of handpainted tiles he thought she might throw them at his head one by one there was something destructive in her nature she was like a spoilt child who would break things just so that others couldnt enjoy them the walk to the front door was punctuated by the anger of her heels on the marble she kept ahead of him so that he couldnt see her humiliation while she gathered up the fragments of the face she had lost and rearranged them into disdain he opened the door she shook his hand and headed off towards the hotel colón the casa ricardo was on hernan cortes at the meeting of three streets it was a bar that could only exist in seville where the religious and the secular constantly rub shoulders every centimetre of the walls in the bar and small restaurant at the back was covered in framed photographs of the virgin the brotherhoods and all the paraphernalia of semana santa the sound system played processional marches from holy week while people leaned against the bar drinking beers eating olives and jamon consuelo was waiting for him at a table in the back with a chilled halfbottle of manzanilla they kissed each other on the mouth as if theyd been lovers for months you look tense she said he tried to think of something other than pablo ortega which he couldnt talk about its just developments we keep finding things out about rafael vega that make him more of a mystery man well we all knew he was a secretive guy said consuelo i once saw him leave his house in his car the mercedes he had before he bought the jaguar and an hour later i was in town at a traffic light and this old dusty citroen or peugeot estate pulls up alongside me and in the drivers seat was rafael if it had been anybody else id have knocked on the window and said hello but with rafael i dont know you just didnt intrude on rafael did you ever ask him about it first of all he never responded to direct questioning and anyway so what if hes in a different car i just assumed it was an office car he used for going out to building sites youre probably right its nothing you get to the point where every little thing has meaning they ordered a revuelto de bacalao some clams and langoustines a bright orange bowl of salmorejo and grilled red peppers spiked with garlic consuelo filled their glasses falcón calmed down ive just had a confrontation with maddy krugman that puta americana didnt come to your house on your day off asked consuelo she ambushed me in the street he said thats the third time shes come round twice when ive been to the vegas house offering coffee wanting to talk joder javier shes stalking you theres something of the vampire about her except she doesnt feed on blood my god you let her get that close i think she feeds on what she doesnt have herself said falcón her talk is full of arty phraseology about empathizing and emotional response and the prison of her anguish but she has no idea what they mean so when she sees people who are really suffering she photographs it captures it to try and make it hers when i lived in tangier the moroccans believed that photographers were stealing their souls and thats what maddy krugman does shes sinister youre making her sound like your prime suspect maybe ill send her to the prison of her anguish consuelo pulled him to her and kissed him hard on the mouth what was that for you dont have to know everything im an inspector jefe its in my nature the food arrived consuelo released him and poured more manzanilla before they started eating he beckoned her forward across the table so that they were cheek to cheek i cant say this too loudly in here said falcón his lips just brushing her ear but theres another reason why im looking a bit tense its just that im falling in love with you she kissed his cheek held his hand how do you know because when i came in here and saw you waiting for me ive never felt so happy to know that the empty chair was mine youre all right she said you can stay he sat back held his glass up to her and drank they chose a bottle of white wine to drink with the sea bass theyd ordered after the starters im sorry i forgot she said going through her handbag somebody from your office my office i assumed he was from the jefatura he told me to give you this she handed over an envelope nobody knows im here said falcón except you tell me what he said again he said i understand youre meeting inspector jefe falcón here could you please make sure he gets this and he gave me that envelope he was spanish sevillano falcón turned the white envelope over in his hands it was very thin he held it up to the light and could see that it had a single item in it he knew it was another threat and shouldnt be opened in front of consuelo he nodded and put it in his pocket he took a taxi home and went straight to his study where he kept latex gloves he used a paper knife to open the envelope and shook out a photograph which had been folded into a single sheet of paper nadia kouzmikhevas naked body was very white with the flash from the camera she was blindfolded and tied to a chair with her arms painfully stretched over the back on the grimy wall behind her was a single handprint the colour of rust and in black was written el precio de la came es barato the price of meat is cheap chapter saturday th july the sunlight was still bright in the cracks of the wooden shutters as he lay on his bed with the thought of nadia blind and vulnerable sharp in his mind hed overcome his initial reaction of horror and brought the analytical part of his brain to bear on the meaning of this latest message these threats each one worse than the last each one digging deeper into his private life and now entangling consuelo what was their purpose the car following him at the end of the first day and the photograph of inés pinned to his board were designed to unsettle him they were bold we can follow you and we dont care if you see us we can enter your house and we know things about you the implicit physical threat to nadia and the inclusion of consuelo raised the stakes but what was actually happening here he gave up on any possibility of sleep and dragged himself to the shower and let the water pummel his head clear of the lunchtime wine each threat had only the appearance of boldness there had been no followup to any of them so far they were trying to distract him but from what he started thinking about rafael vega and the russians the phrase that vázquez had used facilitating their business needs had snagged in his brain it was a natural process of the mind to think that a man whod had questionable dealings with russian mafiosi and subsequently been found dead would probably have been murdered as a result of some disagreement in this case though it seemed illogical the russians were reaping enormous advantages from their dealings with vega why kill him there was no reason why falcón shouldnt believe vázquez when he said that he had not been involved in the property deals and had no way of contacting the russians directly this would fit with vegas compartmentalizing style of management pablo ortegas sighting of the russians in santa clara seemed to indicate that ivanov and zelenov only visited vega at home the telephone number programmed into his study phone seemed to confirm that they were not part of any office procedure that would also explain why the surveillance system had been switched off both he and they would not want any record of these visits falcón dressed and went down to his study where hed put both the envelope and photograph of nadia in an evidence bag he leaned back in his chair while fury and frustration did their work on his insides there was nothing he could do about this to refocus his investigation on the abduction of nadia would be futile he began to think that the russians wanted to distract him from his inquiries into vegas death because they were anxious to hide a crime far darker than the possible murder of the constructor he remembered his failed call to ignacio ortega and made another attempt ortegas mobile was still turned off and there was no answer from any of the other numbers hed taken from pablos book he went to his notebook and looked down the list of things hed planned to do this morning before hed been sidetracked by pablo ortegas suicide interview marty krugman marty krugman was in the vega construcciones offices on avenida de la republica de argentina he was finishing off some drawings on the more powerful computer he had there he said hed be quite happy to talk as soon as falcón could get there hed make sure the conserje would let him in as he spoke falcón jotted down three topics for marty krugman russians wife the entrance to the vega construcciones building was between two large estate agencies which advertised the vega projects in their windows the conserje let him in and sent him straight up to marty krugmans office marty had his feet up on the desk he was wearing red basketball pumps they shook hands maddy told me you had a conversation about reza sangari yesterday said marty thats right said falcón realizing that the reason why marty had been so amenable about seeing him on a saturday evening was that he was angry with him she said you were also implying that she might have been having an affair with rafael these questions have to be asked said falcón i was only wondering whether she had had an effect on the stability of sr vegas mind it was a ridiculous question and i resent that you asked it said marty youve got no idea what we went through over reza sangari thats true which was why i had to ask the question said falcón i know nothing about you i have to find out and you are understandably reticent about certain dramatic events in your lives are you satisfied he asked backing off slightly for the moment yes marty nodded him into a seat on the other side of the desk your wife told me you had quite a developed relationship with sr vega said falcón intellectually yes said marty you know what its like theres no fun in talking to somebody who agrees with everything you say she said that you were surprised by how much you did agree i never expected to find myself agreeing about anything with the kind of person who thought that franco had the right idea about communists that they should all be rounded up and shot so what did you agree on we shared the same views about the american empire i didnt know there was one its called the world said marty we dont go through all that timeconsuming expensive crap of actually colonizing we just globalize this note sr vega had in his hand referring to said falcón cutting in hard before marty ran away with the ball pablo ortega told me sr vega was of the opinion that america deserved what happened on september th we had some violent disagreements about that said marty its one of the few things i get emotional about two friends of mine worked for cantor fitzgerald and like a lot of americans and especially multicultural new yorkers i didnt see why they or the other three thousand people had to die but why do you think he believed that the american empire is no different to any other we believe that the reason we have become so powerful isnt just that we commanded the necessary resources at the right time in history to defeat the only other contender but also because we are right we broke an entire ideology not with an atom bomb but by the sheer brutality of numbers we forced the soviet union to play our game and bankrupted it and thats the great thing about our tool of empire we can invade without physically going in we can dictate whilst appearing to be a force for the good capitalism brings a population under control by giving them the illusion of freedom and choice whilst forcing them to adhere to a rigid principle which can be resisted only at the cost of personal ruin theres no gestapo no torture chambers its perfect we call it empire lite falcón started to break in on the krugman theory but marty held up his hand paciencia inspector jefe im getting to it he said those are the basic ingredients of the american empire and as youve realized ive just used what rafael thought was the americans greatest talent the art of presentation truth fact and reality are playdoh in the hands of a great presenter for example how can we be aggressive if we dont invade look at our history as defenders of the right against the forces of evil we saved europe from the nazis kuwait from saddam rafael saw that as arrogance which when combined with christian fundamentalism and outright support of the israelis by the present administration became too much for the islamic diehards he thought this was the holy war that both parties had been waiting for we were going back centuries to the crusades except that the arena was now larger and the techniques available more devastating when alqaeda hit our symbol of the american empire and rafael reckoned that to wake up million people from a state of somnolent comfort you needed a very loud bang he thought that the truly terrible thing for us was to discover that alqaeda knew us better than we did ourselves they had understood what makes our society tick our demand for outstanding presentation and our need to make an impact he attached a lot of importance to the time lag between the first plane hitting and the second it meant that the world media would be there im surprised there wasnt an exchange of blows between you said falcón that was a summary of his beliefs about not our discussions said marty i did a lot of storming out and he talked me back in there were days when diplomatic relations were cut completely he was surprised by my anger he hadnt realized how much anger there was pent up in america can you relate any of that to the note that was discovered in sr vegas hand ive been trying to and i cant see it your wife says that youre certain hed lived in america and that he liked it said falcón and yet he held these views which would annoy plenty of americans theyre not so different to what most europeans secretly think inspector jefe thats why a lot of my fellow countrymen now see europeans as treacherous and envious envious yes something else rafael had an opinion on he said europeans dont envy the american way its society is too aggressive for them to be envious of it and anyway envy does not inspire hate what they are he said is afraid of americans and fear does inspire hate what do europeans fear that with all our economic might and political strength we have the power to make their efforts irrelevant you know the kyoto agreement trade tariffs the icc and yet sr vega was relentlessly proamerican if youre as anticommunist as he was you have to be said marty the point was he didnt think emotionally he certainly didnt approve of alqaeda he just saw it as the way things go playground bullies eventually get punched on the nose and it always comes from the least expected direction he also believed that once the rest saw blood theyd dive in afterwards as far as rafael was concerned this was the beginning of the end for the american empire im surprised you were prepared to put up with his talk said falcón your wife kept reminding me that you think its the greatest nation on earth it didnt make me want to kill him if thats what youre implying inspector jefe said marty looking out from under his eyebrows all youve got to do is look at history rafael said that america like the empires before them would lash out theyd have to but it would either be a wild flailing against something too small to be seen or they would crush with excessive force and expensive might the wrong enemy thered be a gradual weakening followed by economic meltdown this was where i think he was wrong because the one thing that america would always pay attention to was the dollar they would never allow anything to jeopardize that these discussions went on for a long time your wife said until dawn and as the brandy bottle got emptier and the end of rafaels cigar got soggier his ideas got wilder said marty he believed that the american empire would end not in our lifetime but before the end of the century and that one of two things would happen either the chinese would take over and stamp an even more rapacious form of capitalism on the world or there would be a reaction against capitalisms decadence in which case there would be a religious empire which would come from the most populous nations on earth rather than our dying nations of retirees and that it would be islamic my god said falcón allah is great you mean inspector jefe said marty weve seen from your wifes photographs that sr vega was in some sort of crisis that dated from the end of last year this was confirmed by his doctor was there any difference in the way your talks developed around that time he drank more said marty sometimes he would pass out for a few minutes i remember once going over to cover him with a blanket and just as i reached him his eyes opened and i could see he was very frightened he started to plead with me as if he was a prisoner begging not to be taken away for torture until he remembered who i was and where we were sr ortega mentioned that he seemed very disappointed by the american concept of loyalty said falcón that they were your friends until they no longer had any use for you do you know where that came from in business i imagine he never spoke about specifics he took honour very seriously he seemed to operate on a strict code which seemed quite old fashioned by modern standards he was dismayed by the more practical american belief honours fine until you start losing money then it all goes out the window it sounded more personal than that he wouldnt be such a successful businessman if he didnt have a more relaxed code of morality as far as money was concerned there was a business aspect to his marriage arrangement his code was such that having given his word he wouldnt leave his wife because of her mental state but it was loose enough that he would marry to get his hands on the property in the first place so you tell me said marty falcón flipped through his notes pablo ortega reported him as saying as soon as you stop making money for them or giving them information they drop you like a stone well that sounds weird like some sort of corporate espionage money information if he was into that i dont know where hed expect to find honour in that world or was it politics said falcón your conversations were primarily political i cant think that politics would have any bearing on his death here in seville do you know anything about the russian investors in sr vegas projects i know that there are some but thats all im just the architect i do the drawings i manage the practicalities but i dont meet the investors that happens at a higher level a business level these russians are known mafiosi and were pretty sure theyre laundering money through sr vegas projects its possible thats the nature of the construction industry but i dont know anything about it im on the creative side can you think of any reason why the russians should want to kill sr vega he was cheating on them thats normally why you get killed by the mafia but that will be difficult to prove weve had threats said falcón have you been threatened not yet if marty krugman was nervous he wasnt showing it to falcón the basketball pumps stayed up on the desk he was relaxed why did you leave america sr krugman asked falcón moving into the third phase of his interview youve asked me that before your answers going to be different now that reza sangari is out in the open then you already know the answer i want to hear you tell it we decided that if our relationship was going to survive we had to get away from the environment in which it started we both love europe we thought a simple life together would bring us closer but this isnt a simple life big city job house in santa clara we tried a small house in provence to start with it didnt work and how has it been working here this is very personal inspector jefe said marty but if you must know its been going fine youre nearly twenty years older than your wife has that ever presented any problems marty shifted in his seat the first sign hed shown of any discomfort in the whole interview maddy has an effect on men a predictable and boring effect the first connection i made with maddy was up here he said tapping his forehead i surprised her and i still do now you can call this syndrome whatever you like fatherdaughter teacherpupil but all i know is that it works and it will continue to work because unlike all the other guys im not and never have been focused solely on her pussy so what happened with reza sangari was unpredictable said falcón feeling the tension build in the room marty krugman sat back in his chair with his long artistic hands folded over his lean stomach he fixed falcón with his dark embedded eyes and nodded are you a jealous man sr krugman silence does it annoy you to see your wife talking to other men laughing with them being interested in them more silence was there something that surprised you after you discovered your wifes betrayal with reza sangari marty frowned searched his head leaned forward what is this something that youre talking about that you the intellectual the political animal the man of ideas and thoughts could be passionate what happened between maddy and reza sangari was what the french call un coup de foudre a lightning strike that set something on fire and which burnt itself out by the time somebody killed reza sangari whatever happened between him and maddy was just smoke ash and embers thats the nature of passion inspector jefe it burns hard and fast and consumes too greedily for mere sex to keep it satisfied so once the sex has run its course the passion flames out and if youre lucky you survive the fall thats true if it was just sex said falcón but if it was something more what are you trying to do here inspector jefe said marty your probes are in i can feel them theyre hurting theyre stirring up memories that id rather let lie but what are you getting out of it sr vega used to take your wife to bullfights said falcón determined to drive his point home how did you feel about that if two intelligent people want to watch such a disgusting spectacle as the torment of a dumb animal that is their business and they can do it without me your wife told me that she was surprised at how quickly she became accustomed to the sight of blood and the violence said falcón she perceived a sexual aspect to the drama marty shook his head in disbelief would you describe your marriage as quite open sr krugman by that i mean you dont appear to see the necessity of establishing yourself as a couple in society youre quite happy for your wife to spend time with sr vega or other men she was independent in connecticut she had her own work and freedom what other men said marty opening his hands welcoming the exchange juez calderón for instance said falcón marty blinked at the information as the name slid cleanly into krugmans mind falcón realized that this was news to him maddy has different energies and pursuits to mine she can sit by the river for hours taking photographs thats her world she also likes the street and bar life of seville i dont have time for that she likes the animation and constant sense of theatre about the people i am not someone who can bring that alive for her rafael was happy to show it to her as im sure is the judge i have no desire to stop her enjoying herself to try would be destructive the words came out like a preprepared statement from an administration under pressure chapter sunday th july in the morning falcón was woken by a call from ignacio ortega who hed finally managed to contact late the previous night and who had now arrived in seville he wanted to visit his brothers house they arranged to meet at midday falcón and consuelo had a breakfast of huevos rancheros she was still stunned after hearing about pablo ortegas death the local news on the radio featured ortegas suicide and an item about a massive forest fire which had started last night and was now burning out of control near a town called almonaster la real in the sierra de aracena consuelo turned it off she didnt need her sunday ruined any more than it was at midday falcón crossed the road let himself in to pablo ortegas garden and opened up the house he turned on the air conditioning shut the door to the room where pablo had died and jammed a damp towel at its base in an attempt to reduce the terrible stink he checked the fridge for beer ignacio arrived and knocked at the sliding doors they shook hands he looked younger than pablo but not by much he was bald but hadnt made the drastic error of trying to plaster his still dark hair from one side over to the other although the idea had possibly occurred to him he was slimmer and fitter than his brother but had no presence whatsoever this was a man who would disappear in a room and falcón understood why hed asked his brother to come to his business functions he badly needed to borrow some charisma ortega apologized for ruining his sunday but hed felt a need to see the place where his brother had died falcón said he was going to be busy the following day and mentioned the identification of the body and where that would take place they agreed a time falcón offered him a drink and they opened up a litre bottle of cruzcampo from the fridge the beer seemed to make ignacio emotional he had to wipe away tears and stare at the floor you were close said falcón he was my only brother said ignacio but i didnt see much of him he was a famous man travelling the world while i sold and installed airconditioning systems our paths didnt cross that often you must have seen him more often since sebastiáns trial he hasnt been working so much and theres been this problem with the house thats true said ortega pulling out a pack of ducados and lighting one hed been going through a rough time but i tried to help him with this problem i sent someone round the other day i cant believe it just seems so strange that hes not here i went to see sebastián in prison yesterday said falcón ignacio looked up with watery eyes as if he was going to get more information that was a difficult relationship he said father and son any reason for that our own father he was a very difficult man in what way hed had a hard life said ignacio we dont know what happened to him exactly there was nobody left to tell us except him and he never talked about anything our mother only told us that his village was caught up in the nationalist advance during the civil war and that the moors did terrible things to people as far as pablo and i were concerned the worst thing they did was to let him survive pablo was the eldest our parents married the year the war ended and pablo was born the year after that and you i was born in he said those were hard times in this part of the country we had nothing like everybody else had nothing so it was hard but nobody was alone in their poverty that wouldnt explain why our father was so brutal with us pablo always bore the brunt of it he said that it was those years dealing with our father that made him into an actor it wasnt a great childhood pablo said it was why he never wanted kids but he did said falcón and you ive got two theyre grown up now he said do they live in seville my daughter is married and lives in california my son my son is still here does he work with you no said ignacio his mouth snapping shut dismissing the notion what does he do asked falcón more to be polite than to intrude he buys and sells things im not really sure what you mean you dont see so much of him he has his own life his own friends i think i represent something that he wants to rebel against respectability or i dont know so what about pablos relationship with sebastián was that coloured by the fact that he didnt want children in the first place is there a problem here asked ignacio squinting up from his glass of beer a problem said falcón all these questions very personal family questions said ignacio is there some doubt about what happened here not what but why it happened said falcón were interested in what triggered your brothers suicide it might have a bearing on another case which case is that his nextdoor neighbours i heard about that there was a piece about it in the diario de sevilla you knew him of course i i did know him said ignacio faltering as if this was not something he immediately wanted to admit and i read there was some doubt about what had happened in his case but i dont really see how pablos death could possibly be linked pablo knew him as well through you yes thats right pablo would occasionally come with me to functions in the years when i was trying to get the business off the ground said ortega so why do you think pablos suicide was connected to rafael and lucia vegas death im looking at it more from the point of view of strange coincidence at this stage said falcón three people dead within days of each other in a small barrio like this thats odd did one trigger the other what were the pressures on pablo in the lead up to his death for a start i can tell you that pablo couldnt kill a chicken it was one of our fathers abuses that he used to force him to do it rafael vega drank or was forced to drink a bottle of acid pablo was a completely nonviolent person said ignacio so what do you think could have triggered your brothers fatal decision there must have been a letter surely said ignacio the way it happened was that he and i arranged to meet here yesterday morning he wanted me as a professional to find the body there was a letter to me explaining that and a short note to sebastián but nothing written to me said ignacio puzzled what did he write to sebastián he said he was sorry and asked for his forgiveness said falcón do you know why he should write something like that ignacio coughed against some involuntary sobbing he pressed the beer glass to his forehead as if trying to cram it into his brain he broke out of it and hung his head staring at the floor as if he was thinking of something plausible to say he was probably sorry that he hadnt been able to show his son enough love said ignacio its all tied up with our father i think the same happened between me and my son i failed him too pablo used to say that damage was passed from generation to generation and it was difficult to break the cycle pablo had theories about this did he because he read all these books and plays he had intellectual ideas about it he said that it was an atavistic trait of fathers to make themselves unknowable to their sons in order to retain power in the family or tribe showing love weakened that position so mens instincts were for aggression interesting said falcón but it avoids the issue which is much more personal suicide is a personal matter too and most of the time in my job it doesnt matter why it happened but in this case i want to find out so do i said ignacio we all feel blame when something like this happens thats why my questions have to be personal said falcón what can you tell me about pablos relationship with his wife sebastiáns mother he wasnt married before was he no gloria was his only wife when did they marry in he was thirtyfive i told him he was leaving it too late said ignacio but he had a career there were actresses it was a lifestyle there were lots of girlfriends before gloria then ignacios hand rasped against his face as he rubbed the nascent bristles he glanced at falcón a quick shift of the eye whites it lasted only a fraction of a second but it added to falcóns unease about this man he began to think that the reason ignacio had come round here was not so much to mourn his brother or to help falcón but to find out how much was known it nagged at falcóns mind that pablo hadnt written a note to his only brother there were a few said ignacio as i said our paths didnt cross much i was just an electrician and he was a famous actor how did gloria persuade him to have a child she didnt she just got pregnant do you know why she left pablo she was a little puta said ignacio some vicious ness on his thin lips she fucked around and then left the country with someone who would give her the fucking she wanted are those your own observations mine my wifes pablos anybody who met gloria knew her for what she was my wife saw it from day one this was a woman who should not be married and she proved it by leaving everybody including sebastián and pablo brought up his son on his own well he went away a lot so a fair amount of the time sebastián joined our family were your kids the same age i got married young our kids were eight and ten years older said ignacio so after gloria left you were sebastiáns father a fair amount of the time ignacio nodded drank some beer and lit another cigarette that was all twenty years ago said falcón what about pablos relationships in that time i used to see him in hola magazine with women but we never met any of them after gloria we only ever saw him on his own said ignacio youre asking a lot of questions about relationships inspector jefe failed relationships can make people suicidal as can for instance the possibility of public shame or financial ruin said ignacio pointing at the room with the cracked cesspit or the end of a great career or the accumulation of all these things in a man about to face retirement maybe illness and certainly death are you surprised he killed himself yes i am hed suffered a lot recently with his sons trial moving house the building problem here his fading career but he was dealing with it all he was a mentally resilient person he wouldnt have survived my fathers beatings without having reserves i cant think what would have made him take such drastic action this is a difficult question said falcón but did you have any reason to question your brothers sexual orientation no i didnt he said flat and hard you seem very certain as certain as i can be said ignacio and remember he was a public figure with photographers on his back theyd have loved to tell the world that pablo ortega was a maricdn but if something like that was about to be revealed do you think he could have taken it would that have been enough to tip him over the edge given his other problems you still havent told me how he did it falcón gave him the gruesome details ignacios body shook with emotion he became ugly with grief he buried his face in his hands the cigarette burning out of the back of his fingers did pablo ever show you his art collection asked falcón to ease him out of his distress he showed it to me but i didnt take much notice of that arty stuff he was into did you ever see this piece asked falcón drawing the indian erotic painting out from behind the francisco falcón landscape oof said ignacio admiring chance would be a fine thing but doesnt that prove something to you inspector jefe its the only painting to feature a woman said falcón thinking that hed gone off on the wrong tack here this was not going to work with ignacio ortega the painting in front of it said ignacio looking around his legs thats got your name on it falcón something lit up in ignacios mind and falcón realized with dismay that hed possibly ruined the whole interrogation nobody had missed the story of francisco falcón now pablo did tell me about that business said ignacio he knew francisco falcón personally and the thing about him was that he did turn out to be a maricon and youre the inspector jefe who if i remember rightly was his son no he wasnt my father now i understand thats why you think pablos a maricon isnt it because your father was one too you think theyre he wasnt my father and i dont think that at all its a theory its rubbish the next thing youll be telling me is that rafael was one too and they were having a relationship and he couldnt bear are you surprised that pablo didnt leave you a letter asked falcón trying to retrieve the situation wanting to needle ignacio at the same time i am yes i am when was the last time you talked just before i went away on holiday he said i wanted to know if hed made any progress on the cesspit and i had someone in mind who might have a different approach to the problem when we gave sebastián the letter from his father he batted it off the table as if he didnt want to know then he broke down very badly and had to be wheeled back to his cell said falcón you were a father to him as youve said can you explain any of that he seems to despise pablo and yet he was devastated by his death i cant tell you any more than i have already said ignacio all i can say is that sebastián was a very complicated boy it didnt help that his mother left him it probably wasnt good for his father to have been away so much im not qualified to explain that sort of reaction have you been to see him in jail pablo said he wasnt seeing anybody i sent my wife out to the prison in the hope she could talk to him but he refused to see her as well what about before he was sent to prison he was a young man who didnt need looking after any more when pablo was away did you see him then we saw him he came for lunch sometimes when he was at the bellas artes before he dropped out why did he drop out it was a pity pablo said he was very good there was no apparent reason he just lost interest in it when did gloria die some time around or was that when sebastián finished with his art course hed have been about twenty thats true id forgotten that hed been seeing her every year since he was about sixteen hed go to the usa every summer he looked like her didnt he more like her than pablo ignacio shrugged a sharp jerk as if a fly was irritating him falcón could see the questions building up in the mans head in the letter he wrote to you inspector jefe did pablo mention me he put a note at the bottom asking that you be informed said falcón he might have posted something to you if he did wed be very interested to see it ignacio having sat on the edge of his seat the whole interview eased back into his chair i suppose he could have posted something to his lawyer as well said falcón do you know which lawyer is holding the will ignacio hunched forward again at this question ranz costa he said his mind elsewhere ranz costa did the deed on this property so im sure hes got the will i suppose hes on holiday hes my lawyer too he doesnt go on holiday until august said ignacio standing up putting his beer down crushing out the cigarette do you mind if i take a quick look around just to see my brothers place and things the room where he died is still officially a crime scene so youd better not go in there said falcón ignacio went off into the house falcón waited and went to the corridor ignacio was in the bedroom the door was open a crack ignacio was madly searching the room he went under the bed he lifted the mattress he surveyed the room mouth set eyes penetrating he went through the clothes in the wardrobe checked the pockets falcón backed down the hall and resumed his seat they left the house soon after falcón locked up and watched ignacios silver mercedes disappear into the heat he went back to consuelo who opened the door with the el mundo sunday magazine hanging from her fingers they went into the living room where they both collapsed on the sofa hows ignacio taking it she asked do you know ignacio ortega ive met him at raúls construction industry functions i spent more time with his wife than i did with him hes a rather uninteresting selfmade man with not a grain of culture in him given pablos talent and intellectual capacity you can barely believe theyre brothers do you know anything about his son i know his name is salvador and that hes a heroin addict he lives somewhere in seville ah well thats a little more than ignacio was prepared to admit thats what you find out when you talk to the wife how is he with his wife hes not what youd call a new man hes of the macho generation the wife does what shes told said consuelo she was scared of him if we were talking and he joined us shed shut up anyway its sunday said falcón waving it all away lets try and forget about it for the rest of the day well im glad you came back she said i was about to fall into a sunday depression you stopped me reading about russia no thats not quite true i turned on the news to try to stop thinking about russia and i found myself looking at the forest fire which didnt help the noise of it ive never heard fire before javier it was like a beast crashing through the woods the fire in the sierra de aracena its destroyed hectares and the wind is still blowing up there she said the firefighters say it was arson you wonder what the matter is with people tell me about russia im interested in russia its more about statistics theyre the worst thing about the news said falcón i think editors have a dictum if you havent got a story give them a statistic they know that our imagination will do the rest these are the russian statistics she said reading the number of illegitimate births doubled between and this meant that by twentyfive per cent of all births were illegitimate most of the illegitimate children were born to single mothers who couldnt keep themselves alive and look after a child at the same time so they abandoned them in december the orthodox church reckoned that there were between two and five million vagabond children in russia ah right your obsession with children said falcón two to five million now for the only good statistic the fertility rate in russia is nearly the lowest in the world nearly and it was then that i realized why this article has been written in a spanish newspaper because the only country with a fertility rate lower than russia is spain said falcón thats why your timing was perfect said consuelo id just started on that sunday thinking that the whole world has gone wrong i have a temporary solution to the world crisis tell me manzanilla a swim paella rosado and a long siesta that goes right through to monday he woke up in the night disturbed by a vivid dream he was walking down a path in a dense wood coming towards him were two children a boy and a girl of around twelve years old who he knew were brother and sister walking between them was a totemic bird wearing a frightening mask as they met the bird explained i need these two lives the look on the childrens faces was one of unbearable dread and he felt himself powerless to help he thought it had woken him up until as he lay there he realized that the television was on downstairs voices were speaking in americanenglish consuelo was still asleep next to him the light from the tv pulsated in the dark as he entered the living room he turned it off with the remote it felt warm and he noticed that the sliding door to the pool was open about half a metre he turned on the light consuelo came down the stairs still half asleep whats going on the tv was on said falcón did we leave that door open consuelo was suddenly awake her eyes wide open she pointed and let out a shout as if there was something bad in the room he followed her finger lying on the coffee table was a group photograph of her children someone had drawn a large red cross on the glass chapter monday th july the news told him that the fire was still burning outside almonaster la real as falcón made his way to the jefatura fifty kilometre per hour winds were not making the firefighters task any easier and they were having to let it burn rather than actively save the forest he went straight up to the office of his immediate boss comisario elvira whose secretary sent him in elvira sat at his desk he was a small neat man with a pencil moustache and black hair which he kept in a side parting made with the same laser precision as the prime ministers he was a completely different animal to his predecessor andres lobo who seemed to have a greater understanding of the primordial mire from which men came elvira was a man who kept his pencils straight falcón gave a verbal report of his weekends work and put in a request for some discreet police protection for consuelo jiménezs children who were down at the coast near marbella with her sister were you staying with sra jiménez last night asked elvira falcón faltered nothing was sacred in the jefatura this has not been the first threat since the beginning of the vega investigation said falcón evasive on that point i met her for lunch on saturday and she told me someone from the jefatura had given her an envelope for me this photograph was inside elvira drew the evidence bag towards him and inspected nadia tied to the chair this ukrainian woman disappeared after helping us with our inquiries said falcón anything else day one a car with stolen plates followed me to my house day two i found a photograph of my exwife stuck on the board above my desk at home with a pin through her throat these russians are people who seem to know your situation inspector jefe said elvira what are you doing about these threats i think the design of the threats is to put pressure on me directly said falcón if there had been an initial threat which had been developed i would be more concerned but each one has been different and specific to my situation they are trying to distract me from my purpose and get me to refocus my attention away from the vega inquiry so youre not tempted to reassign any of your resources if by that you mean will i take responsibility for maintaining the small resource at my disposal on the vega case then yes i will just out of interest have you eliminated sra jiménez from your inquiries we have no suspect no witness and no motive and another thing pablo ortega i understand you took a psychologist there with the intention of trying to help his son she also accompanied you to the prison is there any connection between this case and the vegas deaths silence falcón shifted in his chair inspector jefe i dont know but you think there is something it needs more work said falcón which means more time we have confidence in your abilities and we support you in your endeavours said elvira as long as you do nothing to discredit the force ill call the jefatura in malaga and arrange for an officer to keep an eye on sra jiménezs sister and the children falcón went back down to his office with one of elviras comments niggling in his mind these russians know your situation they do how do they know it did you find pablo ortegas mobile falcón asked cristina ferrera as he passed through to his office im working on the numbers now she said he seemed to have used his fixed line for incoming calls only the mobile was his first choice for making calls i want to know who he spoke to in the hours before he died he said what about the key found in vegas freezer asked ramírez she can work on that afterwards said falcón what about vegas id its taking time theyve gone as far back as they can with the computer now theyre working through manually kept ledgers and the argentinians asked falcón as he dialled carlos vázquezs number theyre shortstaffed because of the holidays said ramírez coming into falcóns office theyve sent the details back to buenos aires falcón showed him the photograph of nadia kouzmikheva ramírez beat the wall with the side of his fist somebody handed that in an envelope to consuelo jiménez in a bar they asked her to give it to me falcón said and then held up a silencing finger ive got a question about company cars in vega construcciones he said into the phone there werent any said vázquez rafael had a policy of no company cars everybody used their own and claimed back their expenses but presumably there were some pool cars that the company personnel could use for jobs no vega construcciones used to own lots of vehicles and equipment but in the end they became too expensive to run so from a few years ago rafael cut everything back to just the basic equipment required got rid of all the vehicles and started hiring whatever was needed site engineers architects everybody uses their own vehicles did sr vega keep an old car himself for knocking around on the building sites not that i know of falcón hung up consuelo jiménez said ramírez grinning dont start josé luis said falcón putting a call through to vega construcciones why is cristina working on pablo ortega when we know what happened to him said ramírez call it instinct said falcón what i want you to tell me is who in the jefatura could be talking to the russians about me he asked for the building supervisor who confirmed that no cars were kept in the car park other than those personally owned by employees and that sr vega had only one car which used to be a mercedes but was now a jaguar he hung up and told ramírez of the threats made to him so far in the investigation and elviras comment why does it have to be someone from the jefatura youve been followed from day one anybody could be tapping into your mobile calls everybody in seville knows your story falcón and ramírez started calling around the car parks in seville asking if rafael vega or emilio cruz held an account with any of them half an hour later the car park under the hotel plaza de armas on calle marqués de paradas confirmed that rafael vega had an annual account which he paid for in cash he set off with ramírez who retuned the radio away from the news and a series of interviews with locals talking about the forest fire burning outside almonaster la real alejandro sanzs plaintive voice filled the car any news on your daughter josé luis asked falcón its going to take longer than they thought he said and switched the subject this car park is perfect for getting out of town quickly and nobody would see you said falcón unless you got caught at the traffic lights on el torneo so how did you find out about the car consuelo saw him driving it once in town said falcón do you know a lawyer called ranz costa hes not one of the regular criminal lawyers see if you can get a meeting with him for later this morning said falcón hes pablo ortegas lawyer ramírez punched the numbers into his mobile ranz costa had an office back across the river in triana he said he could fit them in for five or ten minutes any time this morning they parked in calle marqués de paradas picked up some latex gloves and a sheaf of evidence bags and walked down the ramp into the basement car park the supervisor took them to the car which was an old blue peugeot diesel estate the rear number plate was nearly invisible because of dust he was using this off road said ramírez snapping on his gloves felipe can analyse this dust cant he do you keep a key for this falcón asked the supervisor who shook his head chewing on a toothpick you want to get in the car he asked no said ramírez he wants to unlock your brain to see what that fluttering noise is he doesnt bite said falcón unless you move suddenly the supervisor removed his very unimpressed face from ramírez and whistled two boys appeared in shorts and trainers and nothing else the supervisor told them to open the car one produced a screwdriver and the other unbent a length of wire from his pocket the kid with the screwdriver jammed it in the door and levered the corner open the kid with the wire flipped the lock it took two seconds i like a bit of finesse said ramírez flexing his gloved hands none of that skeletonkey shit did sr vega ever ask you to wash the car the supervisor an expert in the small talents of life flipped the toothpick from one side of his mouth to the other for an answer the cars interior was covered with a thin film of dust even the passenger and rear seats indicating that vega always travelled alone when he used this car there were documents in the glove compartment two door keys on a ring with no tag in the ashtray and a single card for a hostal residencia in a village called fuenteheridos in the district of aracena they closed the car told the supervisor not to touch it and that theyd send a truck to pick it up ramírez brushed some dust off the bumper into an evidence bag on the way back to falcóns car cristina ferrera called to say that pablo ortega had made four outgoing calls on the friday evening before his suicide the two earliest calls had lasted thirty seconds each and were to a builder and someone called marciano ruiz the third call was a twelve minute one to ignacio ortega the last call was to ranz costa and had lasted two minutes ramírez called the builder who said that ortega had called to cancel their meeting falcón knew the theatre director marciano ruiz so he called him as they went up to ranz costas offices ortega had left an obscene message on his answering machine so whats the link between pablo ortegas suicide and vegas death asked ramírez on paper nothing other than that they knew each other and were immediate neighbours but your guts are telling you something different they were shown in to ranz costas office he was a big bear of a man who even in severe air conditioning sweated heavily you had a call from pablo ortega on friday evening said falcón what was that about he thanked me for redrafting his will and for the copy id sent him by courier that afternoon when did he instruct you to redraft the will thursday morning said ranz costa i now understand the urgency for the document have you spoken to ignacio ortega this morning in fact he called me last night he wanted to know if his brother had written a letter to me i said that all communication had been over the phone or in person did he ask you about the contents of the will i started to tell him that his brother had changed the will but he seemed to know that already that didnt seem to be his concern did the changes benefit him in any way no said ranz costa shifting his weight to the other buttock as client confidentiality began to be infringed you know the next question said ramírez the property in the will was changed to the new house in santa clara and ignacio was no longer to be one of the beneficiaries who are the beneficiaries primarily sebastián who is now to receive everything except for two cash sums to be paid to ignacios children what do you know about ignacios son salvador asked falcón apart from the fact that hes a heroin addict living in seville hes thirtyfour years old the last address i have for him is in the poligono san pablo ive had to arrange a defence for him twice on drugdealing charges he survived the first and i got him a reduced sentence on the second for which he served four years he was released two years ago and i havent heard from him since do ignacio and salvador speak no but pablo and salvador did a last question on the will and well leave you alone said falcón ignacio was a wealthy man i doubt he was expecting any money from his brother hed always wanted the louis xv chair from pablos collection falcón grunted as he remembered ignacios professed lack of interest in the collection so why had the brothers fallen out asked ramírez i just do the legal documents said ranz costa i never involve myself he didnt finish the two lawmen had already left his office on the way down from ranz costas office falcón called ignacio to remind him about the body identification he also called inspector jefe montes and said that hed like to drop by later on that morning and talk about the two russian names hed mentioned to him on friday evening montes said he could drop in any time he wasnt going anywhere falcón took ramírez back to the jefatura he wanted felipe to analyse the dust sample while ramírez followed up on the hostal residencia in fuenteheridos falcón drove to the instituto anatómico forense ignacio ortega and falcón stood in the room with the curtain drawn over the glass panel they waited in silence while the body was brought up from the morgue and the médico forense prepared the paperwork when did you say was the last time you spoke to pablo asked falcón the night before i went away he said pablos mobile telephone company has informed us that you had a twelveminute call with him on the evening before he died can you explain that to me sr ortega silence while ignacio looked at the unopened curtain ranz costa told us that pablo changed his will before he died do you know what those changes were ignacio nodded was that what was discussed in the phone call he made to you on friday evening ignacios head stayed still i was surprised at how you seemed more concerned about whether your brother had written to you and what he had written to sebastián than you were by the fact of his suicide said falcón thinking this was a man who needed to be riled up that turned ignacio whose two eyes punched into falcóns face like industrial riveters you have no right to talk to me like that he said i am not one of your suspects i have not been accused of anything my brother killed himself i am dealing with that in my own private way which is no business of yours youre as curious to know why he killed himself as i am but you have no right to poke your nose into my family affairs unless you can prove that i was in some way responsible for my brothers death when i was on the coast at the time you lied to me about the last time you spoke to your brother said falcón detectives never like being lied to we get suspicious and think you have something to hide i have nothing to hide my conscience is clear what family matters passed between pablo and me are private you know were thinking of reopening sebastiáns case as well as giving him some psychological help you can do what you like inspector jefe the médico forense informed them that the body was now ready ignacio turned to the curtains which opened he confirmed his brothers identity signed the papers and left without another word or glance in falcóns direction falcón drove back to the jefatura with three thoughts knocking around in his head why did ignacio ortega bother him so much it was clear he hadnt killed his brother but there was something locked up in the mans head that made falcón think that he had some responsibility how do you crack a hard nut like ignacio ortega and how do you find out what the dead men have locked away in their heads police work might be easier if it were possible to download the minds contents on to screen the software of life what would that look like fact distorted by emotion reality transformed by illusion truth painted over by denial that would take some program to disentangle his mobile rang diga he said are you on your way back asked ramírez im on the plaza de cuba good because inspector jefe montes has just jumped out of his secondfloor window and landed on his head in the car park falcón accelerated down the avenida de argentina his tyres squealed on the hot tarmac as he turned into the jefatura car park there was a crowd gathered beneath the window from which hed seen montes looking out only last week thinking thinking has the moment come the ambulance lights flashed almost invisibly in the glare of the brutally bleaching light that beat down on the scene in the car park womens faces stared out from the dark groundfloor office windows mouths covered men stood at firstfloor windows heads viced in their hands squeezing out this unnatural image falcón pushed through the crowd in time to see the paramedics officially give up on the inert montes his shoulder and head looked as if they were buried in dark bloody tarmac soft enough to take this terrible indentation but falcón knew from the look of it what that body would reveal on the slab shattered shoulder compound fracture of the collarbone broken neck vertebrae severed spinal cord smashed skull catastrophic brain haemorrhage members of montess squad were in the crowd they were crying comisario elvira came out of the jefatura and made a carefully designed speech to disperse the crowd his eyes fell on falcón he told him to have photographs taken the body removed and to make an initial verbal report within the hour the juez de guardia arrived with the médico forense as the crowd dispersed ferrera took three of them off to make witness statements falcón told ramírez to seal off montess office felipe took the necessary shots the paramedics removed the body under instruction from the juez de guardia the crime scene cleaners moved in and washed away the blood which was already congealing in the sun as falcón went up to his office to get a fresh notebook he had a terrible sense of convergence vega ortega and now montes the homicide squad three men short because of the holiday season each death not apparently connected and yet somehow being the precursor of the next he found ferrera gave her salvador ortegas details and told her to speak to someone in the narcotics squad a current address was all he wanted he also told her to check all post offices in the seville area to see if either rafael vega or an argentinean called emilio cruz held a postbox for receiving mail is this more important than rafael vegas key did you get anywhere with that he doesnt have a safedeposit box in the banco de bilbao that was as far as i got work on the key later he said itll take time he picked up his notebook and walked slowly up the stairs to the second floor where ramírez stood with a master key for montess office the members of grume were lined up in the corridor waiting felipe came up from the car park sweating with his camera ramírez opened the door felipe took his shots and left falcón shut the window they looked around sweating while the air conditioning reasserted itself on montess desk was a sheet of notepaper covered in his handwriting and a sealed envelope addressed to his wife falcón and ramírez moved round to read the writing on the notepaper which was addressed to my fellow officers it probably seems ridiculous to you that i should have taken my own life so close to retirement i should have been able to bear the pressure of my job for a little longer but i could not this is no reflection on the men and women with whom it has been my honour to work i joined the police force with the belief that i could do some good i had a strong sense of the value of the policeman in society i have not been able to do the good that i intended i have felt increasingly powerless to act against the new waves of depravity and corruption which are now sweeping through my country and the rest of europe i have been drinking hoping that it would dull my senses to what was happening around me i did not succeed a growing oppression has weighed down on my shoulders until at times i have felt unable to rise from my chair i have felt trapped and unable to speak to anyone i only ask that you my friends protect my family and forgive me for this last disastrous act of mine falcón read the letter out to the squad members crowding the door the women cried openeyed staring in disbelief he asked if someone who knew sra montes would accompany ramírez to give her the letter and break the news to her personally montess number two stepped forward and he and ramírez left there was nothing of interest in the office and the interviews with the various members of the squad who were all shaken were monosyllabic by the time hed finished ramírez was back having left the inspector of grume with sra montes they sealed montess office and went back down to their own where cristina ferrera was on the phone falcón told her to check for postboxes in the name of alberto montes as well she nodded and scribbled down the name ramírez followed him into his office and they stood at the window overlooking the car park which was already clean and dry you think montes was on the take asked ramírez some of the words he used in his letter were interesting said falcón like i have not been able to do the good i intended powerless against corruption growing oppression trapped and finally the phrase that really drew my attention protect my family why should anybody say anything like that look after maybe but protect this was a guy whose subconscious was leaking into his everyday life and he couldnt bear it ramírez nodded and stared into the car park imagining himself crumpled corrupted damaged beyond repair the man discarded from life you didnt get the idea that he was on the take from that letter said ramírez so what else do you know i dont know what i know dont start with that shit i mean it i think montes thought i knew something said falcón well if he was on the take hes looking like the source for any information the russians have on you montes thought i was putting pressure on him which i wasnt i was just asking him about these russians to see if hed heard of them nothing more than that his mind did the rest said ramírez and now i feel like an archaeologist whos found a few unusual shards of pottery and been asked to rebuild a civilization from them tell me the shards said ramírez im good at gluing things back together im almost too embarrassed to tell you said falcón theyre hints revived from the old raúl jiménez case some names from rafael vegas address book the russian mafia involvement in the two vega construcciones projects their threats the timing of ortegas death the timing of this suicide today theyre not even solid enough to be called shards and if they are they might not be from the same pot but just dislocated fragments lets get some things straight in our heads about vega said ramírez first of all hes security conscious the handgun which i checked and it wasnt licensed the bulletproof windows the surveillance system even if he didnt use it the front door the front door which is normally fully locked at night but which we discovered only shut on the morning of his death as was the back door into his garden meaning possibly indicating said falcón correcting him that vega let someone into the house late at night whom he knew all his immediate neighbours knew him socially said ramírez but nobody called first to say they were coming round if indeed they did we know from pablo ortega that the russians used to visit him at home said falcón but as vázquez said vega was facilitating their business needs so their motive for wanting him removed is not clear marty krugman put up the possibility that vega was in some way cheating the russians was that based on anything speculation i asked him why the mafia might want vega dead said falcón we should compare the two sets of books on the russian projects dourado told you about the russians and were pretty sure it is them are rattled enough to make threats against you and consuelo jiménez said ramírez its heavyhanded stuff if theyre worried about a bit of moneylaundering money makes the mafia tick said ramírez or is there something worse in the vega scenario which might come to light in the course of an intrusive murder investigation i took a closer look at the argentinian passport he had in the name of emilio cruz this morning said ramírez it also had a valid moroccan visa in it in fact there were five moroccan visas in there four had expired without being used the fifth was valid until november that means he could have been in tangier in five hours by car and ferry even less by air somebody who keeps themselves in that state of readiness is used to it you mean hes trained said falcón the only question is whether its crime terrorism or government thats trained him the compartmentalizing style of management said falcón nobody knows what anybody else is doing krugman talked about the importance of hierarchy the discipline on the sites he said he had no experience of it but that it felt like a military style of working maybe hes been militarily trained by a government and is using it for the purposes of crime or terrorism the only reason were thinking about terrorism is because of the reference in the note he had in his hand said falcón i dont know how much importance we can attach to a note that was traced over from an indentation in his own hand and written in english marty krugman talked to him endlessly about and he couldnt make any sense of it cristina ferrera knocked on the door theres a postbox in the name of emilio cruz in the post office in san bernardo she said but dont get too excited its empty and theres been nothing in it since last year what sort of mail used to arrive there for him he remembers there being a letter every month with us stamps on it anything on alberto montes nothing yet she said closing the door the two men turned back to the window what did the letter to his wife say im sorry forgive me ive failed the usual shit said ramírez anything about being protected or looked after at the end he said dont worry youll be well looked after said ramírez are we being paranoid here and his second in command his inspector did he have anything to say nothing shocked by the whole thing just like the rest of the squad said falcón if he was on the take he was doing it on his own and if he was on the take hes got to keep it somewhere hes also got to let his wife know where it is and shes got to go and collect it or do something with it im going to make my verbal report to comisario elvira now said falcón find out who montes used as a lawyer before falcón could make his verbal report elvira had a photocopy of the letter made and went through it with one of his pencils as if it was a piece of homework falcón stuck to the facts in his report and offered no conjecture im going to ask you to venture an opinion inspector jefe said elvira when hed finished this is the first suicide weve ever had at the jefatura there will be media interest the diario de sevilla has already called i only knew montes by sight until last week said falcón i went to ask him about a man called eduardo carvajal whose name appeared in rafael vegas address book and whose name i knew from my investigation into the raúl jiménez case last year i know that name said elvira i was working in malaga when he was killed in that socalled car crash he was a key prosecution witness in a paedophile case there was a coverup as you probably know the car was destroyed before it could be investigated and there seemed to be some doubt as to the nature of his head injuries montes said that carvajal was going to make him famous hed promised him names then he died and in the end only four members of the paedophile ring were convicted ill tell you something that should not go out of this room said elvira word came down from politicians to top office here that the carvajal car accident was not something that should be picked over under any media spotlight as you can imagine there were some unpleasant memories for inspector jefe montes at the mention of carvajals name said falcón montes explained that carvajal was the procurer for the rings and that the source for the children being used was the russian mafia theres a link between rafael vega and two russians who are investing in an unusual way in two projects under the umbrella of vega construcciones interpol subsequently told us that the russians were known mafiosi i called montes to run the names by him on friday evening he was drunk i called him again this morning and he said he was happy to talk about it then he jumped out of his office window according to his psychological assessment carried out last year hes had a drink problem since which was the year of the car crash involving eduardo carvajal said elvira he has also not been well in the last eight months he mentioned kidney stones and a hernia there was a liver problem as well which was making him very sick at times that adds to the pressure said falcón what do you make of this letter to his squad i wanted to say one more thing about montes and carvajal which relates to the letter said falcón montes told me about the russian mafia connection he gave me an insight into the mafia peopletrafficking business if he has been corrupted and fears being discovered which if im not mistaken is what were talking about here why should he be giving me that information when i read the letter i got the feeling that the pressure of not telling had become so great that it was coming out anyway he hasnt been able to do the good he intended which could mean that he has done bad the corruption is possibly whats happened to him the oppression is his guilt he feels trapped and unable to speak because hes working against everything he believed in and the last line about protect my family implies some kind of danger to them i think inspector jefe montes was a good man who made or was forced to make a very bad choice and he deeply regretted it ive asked for your opinion and youve given it to me said elvira its unusable of course now i want your proof you realize that this will be unpleasant inspector jefe you might want to talk to comisario lobo about the political implications within the jefatura of what i would propose said falcón which is that we should look closely at sra montess movements in the next few days chapter monday th july now that alicia aguados involvement in sebastián ortegas case was out in the open falcón decided to speak to elvira about his intentions it had occurred to him that his case for using her was weak and the prison director would obviously prefer to use his own psychologists for the work he pushed elvira into speaking to the director on his behalf citing alicia aguados rapport with the prisoner and her belief in her ability to draw information out elvira looked at him steadily throughout as if he barely believed a word he was saying he acquiesced silently falcón also asked that due to the shortage of manpower in his squad somebody else should be used to watch sra montes elvira said he had his own ideas on that point the outer office of the homicide squad was empty ramírez was standing at the window wheres cristina gone asked falcón shes found a narcotics guy who thinks he knows how to locate salvador ortega he said are you going to tell me about that what about the postboxes just the emilio cruz one none for montes or vega said ramírez ive been calling the banks trying to find a safedeposit box to fit this key theres one in the name of emilio cruz at the banco banesto thats good said falcón any news on montess lawyer i spoke to him he hadnt heard from alberto montes in three years the last time they spoke was to make an adjustment to the will said ramírez and held up his hand now youve got to tell me about salvador ortega i know who he is just tell me why we want to talk to him because pablo used to see him and he might know what the problem was between the brothers said falcón is that going to help us find vegas killer said ramírez think for a moment about how vega was killed it was nasty vindictive they wanted him to suffer mafiosi are like that they do it to set an example to others who might be thinking of cheating them thats right which is why we need to work on clarifying their motive because at the moment all i can see is that vega was important to their plans said falcón now listen to these names and let me tell you that they all knew each other raúl jiménez ramon salgado eduardo carvajal rafael vega pablo and ignacio ortega you think theres a paedophile connection said ramírez how do you know the ortegas knew carvajal they were in a shot together on raúl jiménezs study wall said falcón and all those names were in vegas falcón stopped ive just had a thought ill have to check it tell me what adjustment montes made to his will he added a property to his assets said ramírez a small finca worth less than three million pesetas i bet that made your heart leap for a moment i dont think i would have got the information so easily if it had been a millionpeseta villa in marbella did he say where it was he couldnt remember hes going to look it up in the copy of the will and call me back was there a mortgage on it he didnt know he wasnt involved in the purchase of it when youve got an address for it check out the deed and see if he ever talked about it to the people in his squad the phone rang in the outer office ramírez took it hunched over and scribbled furiously for a few minutes he slammed the phone down triumphant weve got a result on rafael vegas id trace he said the first rafael vega died back in at the age of thirtynine in a shipping accident in the port of la coruna the second one died from drinking acid last week how did he manage that the first time he died was just at the point when they were changing records from manual to computer according to the computer records he was still alive only by going back to the old paper records did they find the death certificate he was the right age he was the right age physically similar and he had no family the original rafael vega was an orphan who became a merchant seaman he never married so not only was our rafael vega trained but he was well connected in the clandestine world as well said falcón finally we get the break josé luis but yes i know said ramírez he isnt who he says he is but who the fuck is he theres an american connection krugman was sure hed lived there and now we know he was getting mail sent to him from there said falcón and theres possibly a mexican one the mexican wife might just be another fake said ramírez it would be more plausible for a man of that age to have been married before hes looking to me as if hes central or south american origin now if you were originally argentinian would you use a fake passport from your country of origin maybe not but that still leaves the rest of the subcontinent said falcón perhaps we need to have a meeting with juez calderón were due one early this week i think this classifies as a development he put a call through to calderóns secretary the judge was just finishing a meeting she would talk to him and see if there was a chance before lunch after lunch was out of the question falcón hung up and sat back in his chair what sort of people need the level of secrecy at which rafael vega was operating he asked someone who was a covert intelligence operative for a government or a terrorist organization said ramírez someone involved in the drugs trade what about an arms dealer said falcón the russian connection wheres the easiest place to get military hardware russia via the mafia said ramírez and the money is coming from the building projects those land deals were done directly between the original owners and the russians no money trail to vega plausible but that just gives us more questions who is he supplying and before we let our imagination run completely wild said falcón why kill him a terrorist organization that doesnt want a lead to their door said ramírez calderóns secretary called back and said that he could see them in half an hour they drove to the edificio de los juzgados and went straight up to calderóns office he was facing away from his desk looking through the slats of the blinds smoking he heard them come in he told them to sit case or no case he asked without turning around complications said falcón and talked him through the secret life of rafael vega as falcón spoke calderón turned in his chair if the last time falcón had seen him hed looked as though hed come back to the city after being lost in the mountains now he looked as stricken as a man whod had to eat his comrades in order to survive he was haggard the smudges beneath his eyes were now grapedark and his forehead was stepped with furrows he seemed to have lost weight his neck did not fill his collar falcón finished calderón nodded he seemed pensive but distracted the new information did not galvanize his ambition well youve got a bit more background information on vega now he said but you still havent given me any real development in the case no witness no motive what exactly do you want we could start with a search warrant for the safe deposit box in the banco banesto said ramírez cutting in exchanging a look with falcón whose box is it asked calderón its vegas of course said ramírez puzzled by the judges lack of comprehension but in the name of emilio cruz ill work on it said calderón what else we have theories we want more time said falcón and gave him the examples of the russian mafia connection to military hardware and the names of the men who all appeared to know each other from vegas address book and raúl jiménezs photographs thats all conjecture said calderón wheres the evidence vega has been running a successful construction business in seville for nearly twenty years hes built it more or less from scratch so he happens to run his business in a certain way and you seem to be forgetting that hes a man with perfect fake spanish documents and an argentinian alias with moroccan visas for a quick getaway said ramírez i hardly think that level of secrecy would classify him as say a married man embarking on illicit affairs calderón shot him a look that whistled past his ear i can see that said the judge obviously the man had a past hes escaped from something and rebuilt his life maybe his past has caught up with him in some way but that doesnt help you determine which direction youre going to take youre talking about arms dealing drug running peopletrafficking and terrorism but you havent shown me a lead that would indicate a direction youve just got theories the russian land deals look odd agreed their connection to vega is unhealthy to say the least but we have no access to the original owner of the plots you can look up the sale price on the deed but that wont tell you much because everybody puts a low value on land sales for tax purposes there has to be a chain of logic that the juez decano can see if public money is to be spent chasing these notions you dont see any connection between sr vegas death and the suicide of his neighbour said ramírez you havent told me of one apart from names in an address book and people appearing together in photographs said calderón stifling a yawn juez romero said he couldnt see any either the two deaths seem to be a coincidence with the difference that theres no doubt in one case and some uncertainty in the other an uncertainty which is in our minds and not in any evidence youve brought before me what about the note referring to a famous terrorist act said ramírez that is a slice of information as relevant to the court as his files on war crimes tribunals or the fact that he kept a battered old car in a garage or that he wasnt who he says he was its all information but like the anonymous threats its not connected to anything said calderón he turned to falcón youre not saying anything inspector jefe are we wasting our time with this said falcón weary of it all now that calderóns listlessness had seeped into his own bloodstream we might find more bits of fascinating information which supply neither witness nor motive were down to three people because of the holidays we have a serious situation in the jefatura i heard about that said calderón staring into his desk hands clasped between his knees our chances of finding the only witness sergei grow slimmer by the day do we finish with it or carry on if we carry on which direction should we take ok youre annoyed i can see youve done good work and found interesting information said calderón catching falcóns tone and trying to get some enthusiasm into his voice at the moment in my mind given the psychological profile of the victim of which we have clear evidence from a doctor and maddy krugmans photographs and even taking your new findings into consideration i am still more inclined to believe that vega killed his wife and then himself if you can accept that i will return a verdict of suicide if youre still curious enough to carry on ill give you fortyeight hours to go in which direction asked ramírez whichever you like said calderón do you have any chance of talking to the russians face to face theyre in portugal said falcón its possible theyll come over to look at their investments who would they contact probably carlos vázquez theres a man with something to hide said ramírez what about finding out who vega really is said falcón how asked calderón half turning back to the window the american connection said falcón lets say he was living there twenty years ago and that he had escaped from something and rebuilt his life ive just remembered that detail in the autopsy report about the old plastic surgery it seems a likely scenario maybe he had a criminal record or was known in some way to the fbi do you have contact with the fbi asked calderón of course so youre going to take my offer of fortyeight hours on the way down from calderóns office falcón took a call from elvira who had just spoken to his boss comisario lobo and between them theyd decided that falcón should run the investigation into montess suicide falcón asked elvira if he could supply a good and responsive fbi contact who would help with the identification of rafael vega and reminded him about the prison director in the car he called carlos vázquez and after being kept waiting for some minutes was told that he was out the lawyers offices were just up the road from the edificio de los juzgados they decided to make an unscheduled visit whats up with juez calderón asked ramírez as they got into the car were not going to see a search warrant with his mind in that state i think he might have met his match said falcón la americanas fucked his brains out said ramírez it might be a bit more serious than that shes done that to him said ramírez incredulous i thought juez calderón was more experienced than that than what to fall down on rule number one said ramírez and to fall down on it before hes even got married whats rule number one dont get involved said ramírez thats the way to fuck up your entire life well hes involved and all we can do is sit and watch said ramírez clapping his hands as if he was about to watch his favourite soap opera montes told me there were plenty of people who wanted to see juez calderón fall from grace who said ramírez face bland with innocence fingers to his chest me they went up in the lift ramírez staring at the numbers of the floors as they lit up his shoulders were humped up like the neck muscles of a wild bull this time javier i lead you follow he said and they stormed out of the lift straight past the receptionist who held up a single purple talon in an attempt to stop them they did the same to vázquezs secretary who followed them into her bosss office vázquez was drinking water from a plastic cup and standing by the dispenser looking out of the window in a murder investigation said ramírez in a voice full of pentup rage you never refuse to talk to the inspector jefe unless you want all kinds of shit to come down on your head vázquez looked pugnacious enough to square off against ramírez but even he could see that the inspector was up for anything including violence he waved the secretary out what do you want first question said ramírez look into my eyes and tell me what you know about emilio cruz vázquez looked blank the name meant nothing to him they sat down what provision did sr vega make for the running of his company in the event of his death asked falcón as you know each project had sr vega a company representative and an investor on the board in the event of his death the projects would be managed by the remaining company representative with the proviso that all financial and legal decisions be referred to a temporary board in the holding company consisting of myself sr dourado and sr nieves who is the senior architect how long would this temporary state of affairs last until a suitable director for the company was found whose job is it to find such a person the temporary board who do the clients refer to the temporary board and who would get the initial phone call me so when did the russians contact you asked ramírez they havent look sr vázquez its been nearly a week since sr vega died said ramírez conspiratorial friendly theres a lot of money in those russian projects which are unmanaged do you really expect us to believe theyre not unmanaged theyve still got the company representative looking after them who is sr krugman the architect thats a good choice said falcón the outsider who does sr krugman get his instructions from he hasnt received any from me because i havent heard from the client he is just carrying on with the project so after sr vegas death who told the illegal labour not to show asked ramírez what illegal labour we can physically wring this stuff out of you if youd prefer said ramírez or you could talk to us like a normal lawabiding human being are you scared sr vázquez asked falcón scared said vázquez asking himself hands clasped knuckles blanching especially around the gold signet ring on his third finger why should i be scared have you been told not to talk to us on pain of something nasty happening to you or your family no all right well go to the town hall and file a report on these two projects said ramírez the fact that illegal labour has been used should be enough theres no illegal labour that sounds as if youre in touch with these projects i am said vázquez you told me about illegal labour being used last week i made my inquiries there is no illegal labour being used and the two sets of books for each project that we saw in vega construcciones offices last week theres only one set of books not according to sr dourado said ramírez thats not what he told me said vázquez the russians have been busy on the way back to the jefatura they stopped off in vega construcciones offices and asked sr dourado about the two sets of books he had no recollection of the discovery of an alternative set of books in vegas computer system even when ramírez threatened him with a warrant his smile didnt waver he welcomed the search falcón and ramírez drifted down the office corridors in silence all purpose gone from this aspect of their investigation we played this very badly said falcón we trusted these people too much dourado was going to help us i know it i was there i saw the printouts he talked me through them i should have taken a fucking copy he didnt look scared to me said falcón vázquez seemed scared but dourado looked cheerful they know what theyre doing these russians said ramírez vázquez thinks hes in charge so they get him by the balls and squeeze hard with golden boy they need his knowledge of the computer system so they tickle his falcón tried not to allow these images to infect his imagination he said hed go and talk to krugman while ramírez went back to the jefatura and pushed elvira to make fbi contact krugman was standing at his office window looking out through a pair of binoculars falcón knocked krugman beckoned him in the man seemed strangely energized his eyes were bright pupils dilated and sparkling youre still running your russian projects said falcón thats right have they contacted you by any chance of course they have theyve got a twenty million euro investment there you dont let that sort of money run around on its own thats interesting said falcón were you aware of any financial irregularities thats business im an architect were you aware of illegal labour on the sites yes theres illegal labour on all building sites are you prepared to sign dont be a crazy fool inspector jefe im trying to help when did you speak to the russians yesterday what did you discuss they told me to carry on running the projects but said that i shouldnt talk to the police i told them that i would have to speak to the police because they were coming to my house and office all the time they said that i shouldnt talk about the projects what language were you speaking english they dont speak spanish do you know who youre dealing with sr krugman not personally but i used to work in new york city and ive come across the russian mafia before in my own back yard theyre powerful people who with a few exceptions are quite reasonable as long as you see things their way you could try taking them on if you thought it would serve a very important purpose but in the end youre looking for sr vegas murderer or the reason he committed suicide and i doubt theyre going to be able to help you because im pretty sure that the very last thing they wanted was for sr vega to die falcón nodded krugman sat back in his chair what were you looking at with the binoculars just keeping an eye on things inspector jefe he said very seriously then he laughed only kidding i bought them today im just seeing what i can see falcón stood up to leave he was disturbed by krugmans evangelical look have you seen my wife recently asked marty as falcón held out his hand i saw her in the street on saturday said falcón where was that in a tile shop in calle bailén near my house you know shes really very fascinated by you inspector jefe only because she has some rather strange specialist interests said falcón personally i dont like her intrusions i thought it was just a few snaps of you on the bridge said krugman or was it more than that that was enough said falcón to make me feel as if she was trying to take something from me well thats maddys unique problem said krugman as your friend the judge will find out krugman turned to the window and put the binoculars to his face chapter monday th july back at the jefatura ramírez sat smoking in the outer office he said that cristina ferrera was on her way back with salvador ortega whod been found in a shooting gallery in the poligono san pablo he also informed him that virgilio guzmán the crime editor for the diario de sevilla was being patient in his office this was unnerving because virgilio guzmán did not do stories any more virgilio guzmán was a few years younger than falcón but his life and work had aged him considerably before coming down to seville he had been in bilbao and madrid covering eta terrorist activity his ambition and tenacity had cost him his marriage the constant tension had left him with high blood pressure and heart arrhythmia and he believed not seeing his sixyearold son had given him colon cancer from which hed made a full recovery at the cost of a length of his guts hed had to leave the fear of his work to live in fear of his anatomy it had changed him his wife had left him before the cancer diagnosis because he was too hard a man now he had softened not to mush just to flesh and blood but it had not dulled any of his journalistic sharpness he had the vital journalists tool an infallible nose for when things were not right and he knew that the first suicide by a senior officer in the jefatura meant that something somewhere was rotten he was polite he asked if he could put the dictaphone on the desk between them he clicked it on and sat back with his notebook falcón did not say a word he made an instant decision about guzmán this was a man he could trust and not just by reputation alone he also thought and he sniffed at his own naivety on this matter that with only fortyeight hours left to make a case for vegas murder guzmán with his extensive experience might be able to bring different information to the game which could develop into different leads and directions all this might cost him something from the montes inquiry but then the exposure of corruption and its cutting out should be a good thing shouldnt it so inspector jefe i understand that you are conducting the investigation into the death of your colleague inspector jefe alberto montes falcón said nothing for two long minutes during which guzmán looked up blinking like a subterranean animal im sorry inspector jefe he said shrugging into the flak jacket of his journalistic hardness but thats the easiest opening question i can think of falcón leaned over and turned off the dictaphone you know with that machine on i can only tell you the facts of the case well thats a start said guzmán and then it will be up to me to extract the rest thats how it goes where i come from you know the facts already said falcón they are the newsworthy event of a police officers fall to his death its the why that contains the human story and what makes you think im looking for a human story and not say a catalogue of corruption that reaches to the heart of regional government story its possible that youll end up with that sort of story but you have to start with the human story to get there you have to understand the thoughts that led a respected officer whod never shown any suicidal tendency to take such drastic action do i said guzmán normally we journalists or rather journalists of my reputation deal in facts we report facts we build on facts we create a greater fact from the smaller facts we discover then turn on your machine and i will give you the fully corroborated facts of the death of a fellow officer who was much admired by his squad and superiors guzmán laid down his notebook and pen on the desk and sat back assessing falcón he sensed that there were possibilities for him here if he could find the right words and that the possibilities might not be only work related he had arrived in seville alone admired and he thought respected by his fellow journalists but alone he could use a friend and that was the possibility he saw on the other side of the desk ive always worked alone he said after a minutes thought ive had to because working with somebody and their unpredictability in threatening situations was too dangerous i only ever wanted to be responsible for my own thoughts and actions and not the victim of others ive spent too long in the company of men of violence to be thoughtless in a human story such as this theres always tragedy said falcón people feel hurt and betrayed while others suffer loss and grief if you remember inspector jefe i worked on the story of the guardia civil death squads sent out by the government to remove eta terrorist cells i understand the tragedy of a betrayal of values on the large and the human scale the repercussions were felt everywhere conjecture is something that police officers have to indulge in to find a direction for their investigation but it is not something thats allowable in court said falcón i told you about my belief in facts said guzmán but you didnt seem to like it so much then information is a twoway street said falcón smiling for the first time agreed if you discover something inflammatory you will always tell me before it appears in your newspaper ill tell you but i wont change it the facts i didnt know montes until i went to see him last week i was and still am investigating the death of rafael vega the suspicious suicide out at santa clara said guzmán picking up his notebook and pointing the pen at falcón pablo ortegas neighbour crisis in the garden city thats not a headline by the way i came across a couple of names in an address book one of whom was eduardo carvajal said falcón the paedophile ring leader who died in a car crash said guzmán i always remember things that stink is your inquiry going to crack open that cesspit as well falcón held up a hand already nervous that hed made some pact with the devil i knew the name from a previous investigation so i went to see montes and asked him about carvajal he was the investigating officer on the carvajal paedophile ring right i get it very interesting said guzmán terrifying falcón with the rapacity of his brain falcón tried to slow his own brain down as he detailed his conversation with montes about carvajal procuring from the russian mafia the peopletrafficking business and its influence on the sex industry he told him about the two projects owned by ivanov and zelenov and managed by vega construcciones and how hed twice spoken to montes about the russians once when montes had been very drunk to see if the names meant anything to him i was due to talk to him this morning said falcón but i didnt make it in time do you think hed been corrupted asked guzmán i have no evidence for it apart from his sense of timing and his suicide note which in my opinion has some ugly subtext said falcón handing him the letter for your eyes only guzmán read the letter tilting his head from side to side as if his factual brain wasnt inclined to agree with falcóns more creative interpretation he gave it back what was the other name in vegas address book that caught your attention asked guzmán the late ramon salgado said falcón it could be completely innocent because salgado had supplied a painting for vegas office building but after salgados murder last year we found some very distressing child pornography on his computer there are some big gaps to fill here said guzmán what are your theories falcón stayed him with his hand again there were complications he said and gave him the secret life of rafael vega were hoping that he has a record with the fbi and that they might be able to help us identify him said falcón so you think he might have had a past thats caught up with him said guzmán which would be a separate theory to some kind of link to the carvajal paedophile ring the situation has been complicated with each new development in vegas secret life said falcón my original theory came when those names jumped out at me from his address book after id talked to montes the first time and then found a connection between vega and the russians i began to think that vega had possibly replaced carvajal as the procurer for the paedophile rings but the major problem with that theory is that i have no proof of vegas interest in paedophilia only his connection to people who were and the extremely advantageous nature of the deals he was giving the russians what made the vega suicide look suspicious to you asked guzmán the method the cleanliness of the crime scene and although there was a note it was not what i would call a suicide note first of all it was in english secondly it was only a partial sentence and later we found that he had traced over the indentations of his own handwriting as if he was trying to find out what he himself had written what were the words in the thin air you breathe from until said guzmán were assuming that hed taken up the american way of writing the date when you were talking me through his secret life you mentioned the american connection which made you think that he was probably of central or south american origin well you know most people forget this since the events of last year in new york but there were two s where do you think i come from inspector jefe youve got a madrid accent ive lived in madrid nearly all my life he said so most people forget that im actually chilean the first the one that nobody now will ever remember was th september that was the day that they bombed the moneda palace killed salvador allende and general augusto pinochet took power falcón held on to the arms of his chair looked into guzmáns eyes and knew as his organs seemed to realign out of their planetary chaos that he was right i was fifteen years old said guzmán whose face for a moment looked like that of a drowning man with his life flashing before him it was also the last day that i saw my parents i heard later that they were last seen in the football stadium if you know what that means falcón nodded hed read about the horrors of the santiago football stadium a week later id been taken out of santiago and was living in madrid with my aunt i only found out later what happened in the football stadium he said so people say to me and i never think of the twin towers and new york city i think of the day a bunch of ussponsored ciabacked terrorists murdered democracy in my own country wait one moment said falcón he went next door ramírez was hunched over the keyboard has elvira come back with the fbi contact im just pasting vegas photograph into the email said ramírez you can now add that we believe him to have been a chilean national falcón went back into his office and apologized to guzmán who was standing at the window hands behind his back im getting old inspector jefe he said since i arrived in seville my brain seems to have changed i cant seem to remember anything of my day to day life i see movies which i cant tell you anything about i read books by writers i cant recall and yet those days in santiago before i left are pinsharp in my mind and they come at me like a film in the dark i dont know why maybe its because im at the end of my career and all that stuff you know it was the whole reason i became the kind of journalist i was and you still are said falcón although i was surprised to see you here i didnt think you did stories any more i thought you were the editor when the news came through about montes i could have sent anybody down here said guzmán but then i heard that you were going to run the inquiry and for no good reason i decided it was time to meet javier falcón well youve given me a break so im glad its a strange line that in vegas note it seems almost poetic theres emotion in there its like a spirit threatening said guzmán why do you think im so right about it apart from the south american connection said falcón weve also heard about discussions vega had with his american neighbour marty krugman and a few things hed mentioned to pablo ortega between them they built a picture of a man with very rightwing views anticommunist procapitalism and largely pro american in terms of the spirit of enterprise but he also held some negative views about the way in which us governments interfered with other countries how they were your friends until you were no longer useful to them that kind of thing i also found files in his study on international courts of justice and the work of baltasar garzón look at all that in the context of his secretive nature the fact that he seems to have been a trained connected hispanic with a knowledge of american society and this guy begins to look like a politically motivated disappointed man who died with what he considered to be an important date in his hand and why do you think he did that personally i think it was because he was being murdered that he wanted to make sure that his death was investigated as murder and that whatever secrets he held would be discovered and told to the world so now where is your theory about carvajal the russians and montes what do you mean you seem to think that montes was responding to pressure that you were unconsciously applying the mention of carvajal and the russians ivanov and zelenov would that have been enough to push him over the edge or was he looking at those names in the context of the vega investigation and it was that which made him certain that you were on to something lets wait until we get a response from the fbi if he did have a criminal record that might be indicative of something thats relevant here if hes chilean he sounds like a disaffected pro pinochet man to me said guzmán and there were plenty of them about in the ranks of patria y libertad the extreme rightwing organization who were bent on destabilizing allende from the moment he won the election a lot of their members did some very nasty things before during and after the coup the kidnappings and assassinations abroad within operation condor the killings and torture at home the washington car bomb and they thought they deserved better theyd stopped the rampage of communism up to americas back door and they felt they should be properly rewarded for it but you said he was keeping these files on the justice systems and garzón that sounds as if he was heading for the confessional i think he was looking for something a bit bigger than the confessional said falcón more like the witness stand in a major court something seems to have happened to him at the end of last year something personal which might have changed him he was suffering from anxiety attacks well maybe that clouded his judgement people who were involved always think theyre more important than they actually were said guzmán colonel manuel contreras the exchief of dina the secret police is now in jail beautifully betrayed by pinochet and whats happened documents were released by the clinton administration in and whats happened more material was released by the cia themselves in and whats happened have we had any justice have the perpetrators been punished no nothing has happened its the way of the world but what could have happened whos left whos accountable there are some cia men who should still be sweating in the dark and theres my old friend the prince of darkness dr k himself he was nixons national security adviser and secretary of state over that whole period nothing happened in chile without him knowing about it if anybody should be held to account he should well if you could finger him youd go down in history said falcón and if vega was about to do that there must be plenty of people whod want to kill him in my experience if the cia had decided he was dangerous for their public relations profile theyd want to make it look like suicide and then make a complete mess of it said guzmán these american neighbours of his whats their background hes an architect working for vega shes a photographer it was her photographs of him that gave us an insight into his personal crisis thats her speciality well thats pretty good cover if you wanted information on somebody said guzmán theyve both got totally genuine backgrounds said falcón they were even suspects in a murder inquiry into the death of the womans lover back in the usa no charges were brought they dont smell so sweet even if they are real enough said guzmán but then thats the nature of perfect cover i suppose we all have something ugly hidden away falcón got to his feet and started pacing the room the complications were building by the hour and he had no time never any time if this is some sort of intelligence operation he said and the krugmans have been pressurized into service then there must be collusion between the cia and the fbi and were now asking the fbi for information on rafael vega for a start you cant do anything else said guzmán and anyway these are not perfect organizations i imagine very few people will know about this theyve got their hands full with the war on terror this is a side game a small issue possibly private falcón went to the phone and started dialling im going to talk to marty krugman again he said ill come at him from a different angle but you dont know anything yet i realize that but i have no time i have to start now falcón was saved by the fact that krugman was not in his office or at home and his mobile was turned off he slammed the phone down krugman has a weakness said falcón his wife is a beautiful woman who is much younger than him and hes a jealous man its his weak point said falcón a way to lever him open all this will go up in smoke if you dont get a positive id from the fbi said guzmán so dont do anything until then in the meantime if you think it will help ill put that line he was holding in his hand out into the chilean expatriate communities here and in england see what they make of it and if you do get a positive id and he was chilean and military or dina i am in contact with people who could help build a profile ill also write an article about montes and the first suicide of a senior officer at the jefatura it will be a kind of obituary with the big moments of his career including the carvajal scandal pointed up ill emphasize your indepth investigation into montess career and what will we get out of that youll see itll smoke people out therell be plenty of anxiety around especially from the ones who turned a blind eye to carvajals accident said guzmán itll be interesting to see the pressure that comes down on you from upstairs if comisario lobo doesnt call you into his office first thing in the morning after the diario de sevilla has hit the streets ill buy you lunch only the facts said falcón a wave of anxiety ripping through him thats the beauty of it everything ill write about montes will already be in the public domain there wont be any need for conjecture its just the way in which i put it all together that will frighten people to death chapter monday th july it was past three oclock falcón was hungry ramírez left for lunch telling him that ferrera was in interrogation room number with salvador ortega and that elvira had called to say that hed cleared alicia aguado with the prison director to give sebastián ortega a full psychological assessment i called juez calderón too he said i thought we should remind him about the search warrant for the safedeposit box hes gone nowhere to be seen not expected back and hes done fuck all about the warrant buen provecho on the way down to the interrogation rooms he called the prison director to arrange a liaison person and a time his secretary told him they could begin straight away and that the best time was between and pm he called alicia aguado while looking through the doors glass panel at salvador ortegas shattered face they agreed on and he called the prison to confirm a appointment this was going to be a long day cristina ferrera came out and told him that while the narcotics agent had been looking for salvador shed done some questioning around nadias apartment building nobody had seen a thing even the people who had seen her taken away now couldnt remember anything about it he went to get three coffees from the machine salvador ortega smoked while looking at the backs of his yellow fingers he made darting eye contact with cristina ferrera who was sitting next to him and partially succeeding in engaging him his hair was explosive and he had a wispy beard and moustache which disguised his good looks his tshirt was so faded that only the vaguest colours and the word megadeth were discernible he wore long shorts and his lower legs were scabbed with sores he smoked intensely while they sipped their coffees when was the last time you spoke to your father asked falcón i dont speak to my father he said he doesnt speak to me have you seen a newspaper recently news has no importance for me in my circumstances did you have any relationship with your uncle pablo he was always very entertaining when i was a child said salvador which was a relief a relief from what salvador smoked hard and exhaled to the ceiling uncle pablo was fun he said i only spent any time with him as a child you were still at home when he brought sebastián round to stay while he went on theatre tours and film shoots how old were you at the time salvadors mouth operated but no words came out he seemed to be biting off air in small chunks ferrera patted him on the shoulder this is not a test salvador she said i told you on the way here that there will be no repercussions you are not a suspect we just want to talk to you to see if we can help your cousin i was sixteen he said and nobody can help my cousin did you follow what happened to sebastián salvadors cigarette hand trembled he nodded and breathed down whatever was rising in him youre a heroin user said falcón to move on to more certain ground yes i am for how long since i was fifteen and before that i smoked hashish from about the age of ten until it didnt work any more then i moved on to the stuff that does work how does it work it takes me away from myself to a place where my mind and body feel at home and wheres that he blinked and flashed a look at falcón unprepared for these sorts of questions where i feel free he said which is nowhere you were already using heroin when sebastián first came to stay with you yes i remember it was all right what do you remember of sebastián he was a sweet kid is that all said falcón didnt you talk to him or play with him i mean his mother had left him and his father had gone away he must have thought of you as an elder brother it takes time to get the money together if youre a sixteenyearold heroin user said salvador i was too busy stealing handbags from tourists and running from the police why did you start smoking hashish so young everybody smoked it you could buy it in the bars with a coca cola in those days ten years old is still very young i was probably unhappy he said smiling with no conviction was that because of problems at home my father was very strict said salvador he beat us who do you mean by us you and your sister not my sister he wasnt interested in her he wasnt interested in her said falcón salvador crushed out the cigarette and jammed his hands between his thighs look he said i dont like to be hassled i just want to be clear about what youre saying thats all said falcón she could do what she liked is what i meant so who is us when you say he beat us my friends said salvador shrugging with a jerk thats how it was in those days what did your friends parents say about their children being beaten by your father he always said he wouldnt tell how naughty theyd been so they didnt talk to their parents falcón glanced at ferrera who shrugged her eyebrows and looked at salvador sweat stood out on his forehead even in the high air conditioning when did you have your last fix asked falcón im ok he said i have some distressing news for you said falcón im already distressed said salvador you cant distress me any further your uncle pablo died on saturday morning he took his own life cristina ferrera lit a cigarette and offered it to him salvador hunched over and rested his forehead on the edge of the table his back shook after a minute he sat back tears streamed silently down his face he wiped them away ferrera gave him the cigarette he puffed on it took the smoke down im going to ask you again did you have a good relationship with your uncle pablo this time salvador nodded how often did you see him a few times a month we had a deal he would give me money for heroin if i controlled my habit he didnt want me to steal and end up in jail again how long had that being going on the last three years since i got out and before they put me away you were done for dealing werent you i was but i wasnt dealing i was just caught with too much on me that was why i only got four years was pablo disappointed in you the only time he got angry with me was when i stole something from his collection said salvador it was a just a drawing some smudges on paper i sold it for twenty thousand pesetas worth of gear pablo said it was worth three hundred thousand he wasnt angry he was furious but you know he never hit me and by my fathers standards he was well within his rights to flay me alive and after that you did the deal once hed calmed down and got the drawing back how much did you see of sebastián in that time a fair amount when sebastián started at the bellas artes then i didnt see him for a bit until i heard pablo had bought him a small apartment on jesus del gran poder i used to go there to get off the street to shoot up when pablo found out he built another clause into our deal i had to promise not to see sebastián until i was clean pablo said he was in a fragile state and he didnt want to add drugs to the problem did you keep to that sebastián was never interested in drugs he had other strategies for blocking out the world like what he called it a retreat into beauty and innocence he had a room in his apartment which hed soundproofed and blocked out the light i used to shoot up in there he painted luminous points on the ceiling it was like being wrapped in a velvet night he used to lie in there and listen to his music and the tapes hed made of himself reading poetry when did he make this room as soon as pablo bought the apartment five or six years ago why did he buy him the apartment they were finding it difficult to live together they used to fight verbally then they stopped talking to each other did pablo ever beat sebastián not that i saw or heard about what about your father silence i mean when he was living with your family said falcón salvador seemed to be having trouble with his breathing he began to hyperventilate ferrera got behind him and calmed him down with her hands on his shoulders would you like to help sebastián asked falcón salvador nodded theres nothing to be ashamed of in here said falcón anything you say will only be used to help sebastián but there is something to be ashamed of in here he said suddenly livid thumping himself in the chest were not here to judge you this isnt a trial of morality said ferrera things happen to us when were young and we have no way of what happened to you said salvador viciously pulling himself away from her touch what the fuck has ever happened to you youre a fucking policewoman nothing has happened to you you dont know anything that happens out there you come from the safe world i can smell it on you your soap you leave the safe world and just ruffle the surface of things where we live catching people doing their little wrongs you have no idea what its like on the other side she moved back from him falcón thought she was shocked at first but she was just asserting her presence she was telling salvador something with her silence and he couldnt look at her the atmosphere in the interrogation room was more dramatic than if shed stripped naked you think because of the way i look and the job i do that nothing has ever happened to me go on then said salvador goading her tell me whats happened to you little policewoman silence as ferrera weighed things in her mind i dont have to tell you this she said and its not something i particularly want my superior officer to know about me but i am going to tell you because you need to know that shameful things happen to others even little policewomen and they can be talked about and people will not judge are you listening to me salvador they made eye contact and he nodded before i became a policewoman i was training to be a nun the inspector jefe knows that much about me he also knows i met a man and that i became pregnant it meant that i stopped my training and got married but theres something else he doesnt know which i am very ashamed of and it will cost me a lot to say it in front of him salvador didnt respond the silence was ringing in the room ferrera breathed in falcón wasnt sure he wanted to hear this but it was too late she was determined i come from cadiz its a port town with some rough people i was staying with my mother who did not know that id met this man id reached the point where i was going to have to tell the nuns what had happened in my life and i decided i would go and see the man i loved and talk to him first i was still a virgin because i believed in the sanctity of marriage and that i should come whole to it on the way to my lovers apartment that night i was attacked by two men who raped me it was very quick i didnt resist i was pathetically small and weak in their hands in a matter of ten minutes they did what they wanted with me and left me totally defiled i staggered back to my mothers apartment she was already asleep i showered and got into bed shaking and shattered i woke up hoping it had been a bad dream but i was aching all over and full of shame a week later when the bruising had died down i went to bed with my lover the day after that i told the nuns i was leaving i am still not completely sure who is the father of my first child she eased her leg back until she felt the seat of the chair and dropped down into it so that it rocked she seemed exhausted salvadors eyes fell away from hers to the cigarette in his hand which trembled the reason i dont see my father any more is that i hate him he said i hate him with a hate so massive that if i saw him id commit an act of serious violence i hate him because he is a betrayer of trust and not just any trust he is the betrayer of the greatest trust available to human beings the trust between parent and child he beat me to keep me scared to stop me from even thinking about telling anyone what he was doing to me he beat me because he knew the legend of his beatings would be passed around the neighbourhood and all the kids would be scared of him too and when they came to the house he was so sweet to them they let him do whatever he wanted but they never dared talk those men ruined you my own father ruined me until i was twelve years old then it stopped i thought i could deal with it i thought i could smoke it away smoke away my childhood and get clear of him and start my own life it might have been possible but then uncle pablo brought sebastián to the house and that is my shame that is why i am like this because i said nothing while my father did to sebastián what hed done to me i should i should have protected him i should as you say have been his elder brother but i wasnt i was a coward and i saw him ruined after some minutes real life creaked back into the room one of the lights buzzed the tape machine tickered when did you last see your uncle pablo asked falcón i saw him on friday morning just for half an hour he gave me some money we talked he asked me whether i knew why sebastián had done the things that hed done i knew what he was getting at what he wanted from me but i couldnt tell him what ive just told you i couldnt admit how id failed to sebastiáns father my uncle who had helped me so much i think hed already worked it out or hed known it all along and hadnt been able to believe it of his own brother he was looking to me for the final corroboration of the facts i should have been able to tell him but i didnt at the end of our talk he hugged me and kissed my head he hadnt done that since i was a small boy i cried into his shirt we walked to the door of the apartment and he patted the side of my face with one of his massive hands and he said dont judge your father too harshly he had a hard life he took all the beatings for us when we were children all of them he was a tough little bastard he took it all in silence do you know why sebastián did what he did asked falcón i hadnt seen him for some time before that the agreement remember i didnt want to break that part of it once youve found trust you try not to blow it were you surprised by sebastiáns crime i couldnt believe it i couldnt think what could possibly have happened in his mind in the years i hadnt seen him it went against everything i knew about him two more questions said falcón turning the tape machine off and then thats it ive asked a clinical psychologist to talk to sebastián to see if we can unblock his mind it would help if i could play this tape of what youve just told me shell be the only one to hear it and she might want to talk to you or get you to help sebastián in some way no problem he said the next question is more difficult said falcón your father has done some very bad things no said salvador his face hardening to wood you cant make me do that on the way back to the poligono san pablo falcón sat in the back with salvador and worked out a way to contact him in case alicia needed his help he also mentioned that pablo had left him something in his will and told him to get in touch with ranz costa they dropped him on the outskirts of the barrio ferrera kissed him on both cheeks falcón sat up front they watched salvadors jittery walk an undone j shoelace from his busted trainers lashing his thin scabby i calves you didnt have to do that said falcón as ferrera i turned the car round kiss him she said that was the least he deserved i meant you didnt have to tell your story to make him tell his he said becoming a nun answering that vocation is i imagine a process revealing and cleansing yourself before god police work is a vocation too but theres no god that you have to reveal yourself to inspector jefes are quite high up she said smiling and anyway it was a practice run for the real thing i still have to tell my husband chapter monday th july falcón woke up from his siesta and slapped the alarm dead he lay in the darkened room arms flung out panting as if hed surfaced lungs bursting from a deep lake something had hardened in his mind what before had been a vague dislike of ignacio ortega had taken shape and become a determined mass that was going to put the child molester away for as long as possible he was enjoying the anger just as ferrera had when shed first become a policewoman roaming the streets of cadiz hoping to find those two brutes whod raped her he showered thinking about ignacio ortega there was cunning in him all those easy lies hed told in their first meeting the learned presentation of half truths he wondered if this had all started from envy i was just an electrician and he was a famous actor two men coming from the same brutal childhood one becomes a famous actor who escapes into roles while the other anonymous and filled with hate desecrates the innocence of children was there some strange balancing out going on in ignacios head as he dressed he remembered the point that had occurred to him whilst talking to ramírez about the names in vegas address book there had been only one ortega in it and no initial he drove to the jefatura brought the address book up from the evidence room he was right no initial and the number which was for a mobile belonged to ignacio another thought he called carlos vázquez who does vega construcciones use to install the airconditioning systems in their buildings its put out to tender said vázquez there are four or five companies who compete with each other for the business does any one company win more tenders than the others id say that seventy per cent of the work is done by aac aire acondicionado central de sevilla its run by a man called ignacio ortega who only ever overprices himself if he cant do the work he called vega construcciones and asked for marty krugman still not there krugman answered his mobile he seemed to be in heavy traffic from the noise the signal was bad im not supposed to be talking to you inspector jefe remember he said cheerfully i havent spoken to our cold eastern friends yet just one question about the russian projects who did you get to tender for the airconditioning systems i didnt said krugman rafael told me to use a company called aac you didnt get a competitive quote he said the client had already authorized it how do you understand that it normally means that aac is owed a favour probably because theyve done another job very cheaply for them do you know ignacio ortega of aac sure ive met him he does a lot of work for the company hes hardnosed said krugman is he related to pablo theyre brothers they dont look it what can you tell me about ignacio and sr vega their relationship nothing were they close i told you inspector jefe said krugman and falcón missed the end of the sentence as the signal started to break up can we talk face to face about this asked falcón thinking now more about what guzmán had been saying it wont make any difference said krugman and anyway im busy now where are you ill come to you well have a beer before dinner now you love me inspector jefe what have i done i just want to talk said falcón shouting through the fracturing signal i told you the russians havent contacted me yet this isnt about the russians what is it about then i cant say i mean its more about the americans im getting nostalgic for those cold war days said krugman you know its an interesting thing the russians are a much more effective force as the mob than they ever were as communists the signal collapsed falcón redialled not available ramírez put his head in the office falcón briefed him on salvador and ignacio ortega while he sat listening with his face all pushed up by his hand mouth open intelligentlooking before he could ask any questions falcón briefed him about the conversation with guzmán which left him with his eyelids at half mast joder he said after some time the sevillano not particularly impressed by the developments have you talked to krugman about this ive just lost the signal to his mobile and anyway i need to sit in front of him if im going to talk to him about extracurricular activity for the cia i dont believe it said ramírez i think virgilio guzmán lives in a fantasy world of conspiracy theories were in seville here not bilbao hes had his head turned by all that spying on eta and the guardia civil come on josé luis hes a respected professional so was alberto montes said ramírez what do you think guzmáns doing down here something with less pressure than when he was in madrid said falcón in my opinion said ramírez winding his finger around his temple the guys lost it is this based on any empirical research or just your gut feeling asked falcón what about guzmáns theory on the piece of paper in vegas hand is that bullshit as well no that sounds right i like that it doesnt help us but i like it said ramírez it does help us it narrows the search down for the fbi said falcón have you heard from them yet ramírez shook his head i want to find krugman said falcón youre beginning to think that he killed vega i have an open mind he had the opportunity given i hat vega would have let him into his house at that time in the morning and now weve got a possible motive even if you do think its guzmáns fantasy said falcón im also worried about krugman when i went to see him after wed been to talk to dourado he seemed unstable he was looking out of the window using a pair of binoculars probably trying to see if his wife is fucking juez calderón which is why were not getting our search warrant so you do think that vega was operating in some way said falcón and you do think that what he has in his safedeposit box is going to be important for us you just dont think that krugman well i wouldnt use krugman for fucking anything let alone an operation said ramírez hes too unpredictable theres too much going on in his brain but if you let me have his mobile number ill get the boys in the telephone centre to keep trying it and if he answers well track it is anything happening with the montes inquiry were still waiting for elvira to give us another pair of hands did the lawyer come back on the property he added to the list of assets in montess will yes im getting the aracena town hall to check out if there was a building project on the property its up in the sierra is it the phone rang ramírez picked it up listened said that falcón was on his way and put it down alicia aguado he said id like you to check where exactly ignacio ortega was on the night that rafael vega was murdered i thought he was at the beach he didnt come into the frame until his brother died i contacted him via his mobile weve never checked him out properly he drove to calle vidrio and sat at traffic lights with his hands pattering nervously on the steering wheel a sense of doom stacked up inside him while outside the relentless heat bore down on the straining city he played the tape of salvador ortegas interview to alicia aguado as they drove out to the prison it took the whole journey they sat in the car park listening to the end and some silence until the tape clicked off i asked him if hed testify against his father said falcón he refused people like ignacio ortega retain tremendous power over their victims and the victims never lose their fear of the molester said aguado as they got out of the car they walked up to the prison she held his arm i spoke to a friend of mine who works at the prison she said he assesses disturbed prisoners but he wasnt on sebastiáns case when he applied for solitary confinement although he did hear about it there was no sign of any disturbing behaviour sebastián was intelligent friendly and completely benign which i realize doesnt necessarily mean anything but he did say something interesting they all thought that sebastián was not only happy to be where he was he was also relieved to be away from the other inmates he couldnt say he just said he was relieved she said and by the way id like to talk to sebastián alone but if theres a room where you could observe from the outside id be interested in you seeing the session the director met them and arranged for the interview to be held in one of the safe cells where prisoners who were considered a possible danger to themselves were put for observation there was cctv and audio tape available two chairs were brought into the cell and placed side by side in opposite directions to resemble the sshaped chair in alicia aguados consulting room she sat facing the door sebastián was brought in and sat facing the wall the door was shut but it had a large reinforced observation panel falcón sat outside alicia aguado started off by explaining her method sebastián looked into the side of her face valuing her words with the intensity of a lover he bared his wrist to her and she laid her fingers on his pulse he stroked her two fingernails with the tip of his finger im glad you came back he said but im not sure what youre doing here its not unusual for prisoners whove suffered distressing news to be given a psychological assessment i didnt think id given them any cause to be concerned i was upset thats true but now im calm it was a very strong reaction and you are a prisoner in solitary confinement the authorities are concerned about the effects of distress reactions to it and the possible reverberations in the prisoners mind how did you go blind he asked i dont think youve always been blind have you no i have a condition called retinitis pigmentosa i knew a girl at the bellas artes who had that he said she was painting painting painting like mad to get all the colours down before she went blind because afterwards shed have to stick to monochrome i like that idea cramming all the colour into the early years before simplifying it in later life youre still interested in art not to do it i like to look at it i heard you were very good who from your uncle she said and frowned adjusted her fingers on his wrist my uncle knows nothing about art he has zero aesthetic sense if he thought my work had been good i would be worried hes the sort of person who has concrete lions mounted on his gate posts he hangs lurid tinted landscapes on his walls he likes to spend his money on very expensive sound systems but he has no taste in music he thinks that julio iglesias should be sanctified and that placido domingo should learn some decent songs he has an ear so finely tuned that it can perceive the slightest defect in his hifi speakers output but he cant hear a single note said sebastián who hadnt stopped looking at alicia aguado for a moment id like to know your first name dra aguado alicia she said whats it like being in the dark all the time alicia he said i like being in the dark i had a room where i could shut out all light and noise and i used to lie on the bed with a sleeping mask on it was velvet on the inside it sat over my eyes soft and warm as a cat but whats it like having no choice being in the dark but with no escape into the light i think i should like it why asked alicia it makes life very difficult no no alicia i disagree it simplifies things we are bombarded by too many images and ideas and words and thoughts and tastes and textures take away one of the major senses and think how much time that frees up you can concentrate on sound touch will be so exciting because your fingers will never be bored by what the mind is telling them to expect taste will be an adventure the only giveaway is smell the delicious smell of your food i envy you because you will rediscover life in all its richness how can you envy me that she said after what you have done to yourself what have i done to myself youve closed yourself off from the world youve decided that you want nothing of life in all its richness are they really concerned for me after my fathers death he asked im worried about you yes you are i can tell he said and thats the thing if i was blind i would know your beauty and the ability to see you would only interfere with the purity of that you were very upset by your fathers death and yet you ignored the letter hed written to you its not that unusual to hold two conflicting emotions in your mind at the same time i loved him and i hated him why did you love him because he needed it he had plenty of adoration but almost no love he was addicted to the adoration which he mistook for love when there was no adoration he felt unloved so i loved him because he needed to be loved and why did you hate him because he couldnt love me back he hugged and kissed me and then put me to one side like a doll to go and find what he thought was the real love he did it because it was less complicated thats why he had the dogs pavarotti and callas he liked that uncomplicated giving and receiving of love we talked to your cousin salvador salvador he said the saviour who cannot be saved or the saviour who was unable to save i dont know what you mean by that do you ever think about your mother every day and what do you think about her i think about how she was misunderstood but you dont think of maternal love i do think of that yes but in remembering it i always find that the next thought was how she was misunderstood it sticks in a sons mind to hear his mother referred to as a whore she wasnt a whore she loved my father and admired him he never reciprocated he went off to claim his fame in spain and around the world and she found other people to love you didnt think that shed abandoned you yes i did i was only eight years old but i found out later that she couldnt stay with my father and she couldnt take me with her because he would not consent to it her life was on the move her boyfriend was a film director i didnt hear that from my family from them i heard she was a whore how did you fit in with your new family after shed gone my new family your uncle and aunt you spent a lot of time with them i spent more time with my father than i did with them but what was it like living with them falcóns mobile vibrated on his thigh he went up the corridor to take the call from ramírez the fbi have come back with a perfect match on vega he said size age eye colour blood group all fit and hes a chilean national they sent a picture back of him with more hair and a full beard the shot was taken in when he was thirtysix years old hes exchilean military exdina and he was last seen in september when he absconded from a witness protection programme why was he being protected it says that he testified in a drugtrafficking case thats all do they give a name his original name that is prior to the witness protection programme was miguel velasco send those details to virgilio guzmán at the diario de sevilla he said hed got contacts who can give a profile on any chilean military or dina personnel said falcón any news on krugman nothing yet said ramírez expect a call from elvira hes looking for you falcón didnt make it back to the session before elvira called he told him that after a discussion with comisario lobo they had decided that nobody from within the jefatura was going to be used to monitor sra montess movements an agent from internal affairs was being sent down from madrid and he would report directly to elvira on the matter falcón was relieved alicia aguado hadnt managed to draw the interview back to ignacio since hed taken ramírezs call they were talking about sebastiáns mothers death and its effect on him and the lack of effect on his father it had resulted in him leaving home and moving into an apartment his father had bought nearby were you still seeing your uncle at that stage asked aguado wasnt he someone i would never have spoken to him about my mother he was not sympathetic to her he would have derived satisfaction from hearing of her death you dont think very much of your uncle we have different sensibilities what was your uncle like as a father ask salvador he was a surrogate father to you i was scared of him he believed in discipline and total obedience from any child that came into his orbit he could get angry like you would not believe the veins stood out on the side of his neck he had a lump that would come up on his forehead thats when we knew to hide did you talk to your father about your uncles violent behaviour yes he said hed had a hard childhood and that it had marked him was your uncle ever violent with you no alicia aguado finished the session at that point sebastián was reluctant to let her go falcón called the guard and picked up the audio tape of the session they went back to the car in silence she said she would sleep on the way back she didnt wake up until they arrived at calle vidrio they went upstairs she was groggy he tired you out said falcón sometimes its like that the psychologist feels under more pressure than the patient you seemed perplexed by his pulse at the beginning to start with he didnt react when i was certain he should have been hitting emotional blips he seemed to be able to divorce the mental from the physical i thought he was drugged at first itll get better im sure i can open him up he likes me enough to want to do it he gave her the tape and went back down to the car as he was about to move off inés called him she was jittery i know i shouldnt be calling you about this she said but i know you saw esteban today we had a meeting on the rafael vega case this morning did he seem all right to you she asked its none of my business i know but he looked tired and seemed distracted did you talk about anything else apart from the case i was with inspector ramírez said falcón is something wrong i havent seen him since early saturday morning he hasnt been back to the apartment hes turned his mobile off i know juez romero spoke to him on saturday morning from the crime scene at pablo ortegas house said falcón what did he say she said urgently where was he i dont know we were supposed to be having sunday lunch with my parents but he cancelled too much work you know how it is if hes got a busy monday morning said falcón his secretary says he hasnt been back to his office since lunch time thats not so strange it is for him i dont know what i can say inés im sure hes ok its probably nothing she said youre right she hung up he drove back to calle bailén and showered and changed consuelo asked him over for supper he left in the dark listening to the news the winds had dropped in the sierra de aracena and the fire around almonaster la real had been brought under control three thousand hectares had been burnt and four isolated homes destroyed arson was suspected a shepherd had been arrested there was to be a full inquiry starting tomorrow he parked outside consuelos house the krugmans house was in darkness on the way to the front door his mobile rang ramírez i dont know if this is relevant but ive just had a call from the jefatura they know were looking for sr krugman a woman has called in from an apartment building in tabladilla as she came into her building she noticed a tall foreigner in the foyer he was sweating and nervous and looking at his watch he followed her upstairs and stopped on the second floor while she continued to the top floor he was standing outside an apartment which she knew was empty because the woman was away on holiday twenty minutes later she heard a gun shot from the apartment below hers which was the same one the foreigner was looking at theyve sent a patrol car round there do we know the name of the owner of the apartment where the shot came from wait a second falcón sweated standing in the street i think this is relevant said ramírez the apartment belongs to one rosario calderón chapter monday th july falcón explained the problem to consuelo she listened to him as if he was diagnosing a disease comprehending without taking it in he asked if shed heard from her sister and the children she said a police officer had turned up to look after them late morning he kissed her and got back in the car she closed her front door before he pulled away the jefatura informed him that three more cars had been sent to the incident which was in an apartment block on calle tabladilla at the intersection with calle del cardenal ilundain i dont want any cars parked in view of the incident and no crowds said falcón all exits should be manned including the underground garage if there is one no member of the public should be allowed into the building put two men on the roof and two in the stairwell above and below the incident evacuate everybody in the apartments above below and opposite all the occupants of the other apartments should be told to stay put and get someone with binoculars into an apartment in the block opposite with a clear view of the incident they confirmed his orders back to him and told him that the apartment did belong to juez calderóns sister and that she was currently away on holiday in ibiza the advertising on avenida de kansas city flashed past as he headed back into the city he had to get right across to the other side of town but there was little traffic and in twenty minutes hed been allowed through a police cordon and was parked on calle tabladilla opposite a government building about fifty metres down from the incident the street was empty apart from patrolmen sticking close to the shops underneath the long stretch of the development one of the men told him that it was all quiet he radioed through to his partner in the apartment block opposite looking for a view point he was in apartment overlooking calle tabladilla it was an oppressive night and the sweat gathered in falcóns hair as he crossed the street to the grey stoneclad apartment block with its chrome balconies it was the kind of place where a young welloff professional would buy he took the lift up to the fourth floor and was let in by a young guy in a pair of shorts who had no interest in what was going on a movie was showing on the television he sat on the sofa with his girlfriend drinking beer the patrolman was out on the balcony his binoculars trained across the street he handed them to falcón there was a lot of greenery overhanging the balconies of the apartments opposite most of which were shuttered the incident was easy enough to find it was in the only apartment with any lighting there were no internal blinds or curtains drawn there was about metres of wall between a large window and the sliding doors out on to the balcony calderón and maddy krugman were sitting side by side on the sofa the judge held himself rigid feet and knees together arms folded tightly across his chest maddy krugman was almost lying down on the sofa in an absurdly relaxed fashion they were both dressed as if they were about to go out to dinner judging by the direction they were looking marty krugman was standing in front of them with his back to the wall separating the window from the balcony he came into view for a second he had no jacket there was a dark strip of sweat down the back of his creased shirt and he had a gun in his left hand the movie on the television finished and was replaced by ads the young guy came to the doors out on to the balcony whats going on over there just a domestic situation thats got out of control said falcón we heard the gunshot i thought it was on the movie what time just after ten it was now pm falcón surveyed the interior walls of the apartment he found the bullet hole in the wall above maddy krugmans head she obviously hadnt taken her husband seriously enough and had been reminded that this was neither a game nor a replica gun he called comisario elvira and gave his report whats krugmans mental state been like in the interviews youve conducted hes an intellectual with an obsessive streak prone to ranting but controllable he listens hes normally civilized and sophisticated but hes become more disturbed over the past few days probably as a result of his wifes liaison with juez calderón if hes psychotic its uncontrollable jealousy thats tipped him over the edge said falcón weve been getting on fine theres mutual respect id like to go in there and try to talk him down all right call him on the fixed line first tell him youre going to knock on the door no surprises garcia from the antiterrorism squad is coming down there and hes bringing a marksman with him wait until they arrive krugmans not a terrorist i know that now but i didnt know that then i alerted garcia when the information was imperfect anyway hes got experience in these situations garcia made contact a few minutes later falcón sent the patrolman to bring him up he came out on to the balcony with the marksman who seemed satisfied with the angle and went back inside to assemble his gun youre going in asked garcia i know the gunman therell be three of you and him on his own hell have to keep an eye on you which will give me possibilities out here i think i can talk this man down hes not crazy or on drugs thats good but if he does lose control theres not much opportunity for a marksman from out here without endangering the lives of the hostages what are you saying it would be better to storm the apartment i dont think itll come to that they worked out some emergency signals for falcón and he made the call to the apartment maddy answered the phone before marty could exert his control over the development falcón asked to speak to her husband its for you she said ironically and held out the phone to marty i still havent spoken to the russians said krugman chuckling im busy im outside marty said falcón leaving the apartment and heading downstairs i thought the shot might attract some attention he said this was supposed to be a private thing but maddy can be headstrong and i just had to show her i wasnt playing games anyway what can i do for you inspector jefe falcón crossed the street and started going up the stairs to calderóns sisters apartment i want to come in and speak to you im right outside the apartment door will you let me in i suppose youve got some kind of swat team out there with you no its just me the street is very quiet its been cleared for everyones safety thats all said falcón we dont want anybody getting hurt marty people have already been hurt he said i realize that no i mean really hurt physically said marty this isnt what you think it is then what is it its private were beyond any mediation im not here to mediate then you must have come to bear witness to the destruction of peoples lives no i certainly havent come for that said falcón ive just come to hear you out i told maddy they dont make cops like you back home said marty they like people with square heads that fit neatly into vices its easier to narrow their minds that way they dont see colour or any gradations just black and white we only come into peoples lives at the crisis points said falcón sometimes we have to simplify cut out the grey i try not to do it thats all im going to ring the doorbell now and id like you to let me in ok inspector jefe you can come in i need a fair man to listen to me but you have to know something first he said by coming in you only endanger yourself you will not affect the outcome that is already written fate dictated it some time ago i understand said falcón and rang the bell to keep the pressure on calderón opened the door he was sweating heavily and shivering in the chill of the apartment he had the sunken pleading eyes of a street beggar maddy krugman stood behind him looking fierce and behind her marty held the gun to the back of calderóns head in you come inspector jefe close the door double lock it and put the chain on krugman was calm while falcón dealt with the door he got the other two to lie down in the hall hands behind their heads krugman frisked falcóns upper body and thighs and asked to see his ankles they all went into the sitting room calderón and maddy resumed their seats she was quite languid in her movements as if none of this was her concern and it was just a tiresome family reunion shed been forced to attend ill sit here said falcón choosing an armchair near the sliding doors so that garcia had a clear view of him why not join us in the front row said maddy youre fine there said marty how did you get in to the apartment marty asked falcón lovers like to go out to dinner were not lovers said maddy irritated i was waiting outside for them he thinks were lovers said maddy trying to explain the absurdity of the notion to falcón if youre not then what the fuck are you said marty in english what the fuck are you doing in this apartment dressed like that going out to fucking dinner if youre not lovers your wife is going to answer your questions marty said falcón but people get nervous when you wave a gun in their faces they get defensive angry or totally fucking silent said marty twitching the barrel of the gun in calderóns direction youre accusing him of being your wifes lover maybe he thinks its best to keep his mouth shut i can smell his fear thats a loaded gun if youre doing what hes doing you have to be prepared for that i dont know what your problem is marty you knew from day one when esteban came round to our house that like all the other guys he wanted to get me into bed you also knew that i wasnt interested hes not my type i know you maddy i know how your mind works remember that in here your public relations dont make any difference because these two guys are not going to be able to help you even if they do believe what youre saying what happened to you marty she asked her face suddenly a mask of profound concern i met you he said his eyes wide and fierce now you see my problem she said turning to falcón how is anybody supposed to live with this i live with it all the time and i need some relief from it its too intense so i go out with esteban hes charming he flatters me flatters you said marty flattery youre telling me youre doing this for a bit of flattery are you fucking crazy keep calm marty said falcón now the bitch wants a bit of flattery said marty shell chuck nearly twelve years of marriage out of the window for a bit of flattery i can do flattery flattery is a piece of cake you make man ray look like a fucking amateur honey hows that your name will be spoken in the same breath as lee fucking miller any better marty said falcón and krugmans head whipped round you deserve answers and youll get them but this is a domestic situation it does not merit the use of a gun give me the gun and lets where i come from everything merits the use of a gun thats how were brought up its in our constitution leave it out marty said maddy bored stupid you dont understand what this is about inspector jefe said marty adjusting his grip on the gun you dont know what ive done for her what marty what said maddy what have you done for me marty faltered all the logic seemed to break down in him all his wiring so carefully laid down short circuited part of him knew why he was there there was a great breaking wave of certainty inside him but there was another part of him which found it all a complete mystery it was the usual thing he wanted out but couldnt leave he didnt want to be with her but could not resist her orbit im here because of what i did for you he said we are eternally joined by that act what did you do for her marty asked falcón its a long story weve got time be careful said maddy youve got no idea how much talk this guy has in him you give him license and this could be the state of the union address to the power of ten let him speak said calderón through tight white lips silence marty blinked at the sweat in his eyes seconds passed feeling like minutes we were living in connecticut he said as if this was history i was working in manhattan maddy worked part time in the city i worked long hours id get home at the weekend and feel as if id been away on a trip id seen so little of the house in daylight one morning at work i fainted and hit my head on the desk they sent me home maddy was supposed to be there but when i arrived she was out i went to bed slept i woke up and thought about how id allowed my life to get out of control i decided it was time for a change id take some time off wed go away live in europe i was standing at the bedroom window full of these possibilities when i saw her coming back to the house she was walking in a way that id never seen her walk before it was more like skipping like a girl skipping and i realized that i was looking at a very happy person i went down to meet her as she came through the door i was standing there and i saw her face fall all her happiness and gaiety disappeared the lead went back into her feet she smiled at me as if i was a mentally ill relation and i realized that somebody else was making her happy i didnt tell her of my plans i just told her about my accident and i started watching her and i noticed all the things i hadnt seen before theres nothing like suspicion to refresh your sight and tune up your hearing i started delegating my work to juniors i found time wherever i could i spied on her and i discovered reza sangari marty used his gun arm to wipe his forehead just saying that name cost him something he licked his lips im a good spy you know he said not such a good spy that the woman i was living with wouldnt ever find out but good enough to pin reza sangari to the board i got to know about the other women he was seeing pretty fast he had them all operating to a timetable françoise on these days maddy on those helena on the others and a whole lot more in between it was easy what was easy asked maddy no longer affecting boredom to call you into the city on a day that was not supposed to be yours we had lunch remember and in the afternoon i knew you wouldnt be able to resist it was a tuesday which was helenas turn i was there when she came out of the door and you took it like a slap in the face you were standing in a doorway across the street i could have offered you a cigarette and a light and you wouldnt have seen me you were looking at his door so hard i was there when you crossed the street to go up and scratch his eyes out and you ran into another one i didnt know her name she wasnt one of the regulars you were there said maddy i went back with you on the train i saw you crawl into the house i was with you all the way youre a sick fuck marty krugman she said you got your own back said marty i kept watching her you see inspector jefe i got addicted to it i found myself doing what she did in her photographs watching her in her unconscious moments hearing her when she thought she was alone the crying youve never heard anybody cry like that she cried like a sick dog vomiting she cried with her face to the bathroom floor gagging against her lungs in her throat anybody ever cry for you like that inspector jefe falcón shook his head have you ever seen someone you love cry for someone else like that cry themselves senseless until their organs seized up falcón shook his head again she didnt go back to him said marty you cant measure the pride that sits in that woman its fatter than a buddah and thats what she drew on next her pride turned to fury she used to go up into the attic and scream scream until her larynx shredded did you ever talk about any of this asked falcón marty shook his head then the writing started and maddy doesnt write said marty shes never kept a diary in her life her photographs are her diary but a few weeks after she realized what sort of a man shed fallen in love with she started writing and why do you think she started writing inspector jefe falcón shrugged because she knew i was watching she knew id be burning to see it and i was i had to see it i had to know it id put money into her pain and i wanted my dividend she locked the notebooks away but i got in there i know youre interested in psychology inspector jefe and im sorry that those papers dont exist any more because i doubt youve ever seen anything quite as horrific as the scribblings of maddy krugman she didnt just want him dead inspector jefe she wanted him to die under prolonged medically assisted torture you know im sure sex and torture are connected somewhere in the human brain maddy thought so didnt you honey i dont know what youre talking about marty she said this is definitely your trip and its a solo one you dont remember the lovers tongue like an electrode on the nipple the touch of his penis like a cattle prod in the vagina you wrote those things what did you do about it marty asked falcón i did what she wanted me to do i planned it all out for a saturday afternoon it was autumn the light was failing early and at the weekend reza sangaris part of town was almost silent i went to see him i introduced myself he let me into his apartment and i listened to his apologies he had a soft voice it was as seductive as a torturer who doesnt need to find out anything but just wants to cause you pain i stood amongst the expensive silk carpets where hed fucked my wife and i was filled with rage by the ease with which he made his excuses it was surprisingly easy to beat him to death did you hear that inspector jefe i marty krugman sophisticate intellectual aesthete the man who finds the whole idea of a bullfight loathsome i found it surprisingly easy to bludgeon a man to death something else i learnt the violence that flowed through my veins at that moment i havent felt power like that ever i came home in the dark the caveman with his club and she was there to meet me in her apron she cooked a special dinner and we ate it by candlelight it was another of our wordless dinners except that this one was different because at the end she took off her clothes and asked me to fuck her and i with this new blood in my veins obliged now that inspector jefe was a fuck to remember id finally found the thing that thrilled maddy krugman dont flatter yourself marty she said full of contempt anyway the madness ceased in the house we started living like human beings again a few days later the news carried the story of reza sangaris murder and she was totally impassive we smoked pot ate marvellous food and drank expensive wine and we had a lot of very violent sex the fbi came during the next week sometime they asked to speak to maddy in private i left them to talk then they wanted to interview me she asked if she could talk to me first we slipped into our roles without a word she came into the kitchen and told me straight about reza sangari for the first time my performance was flawless i behaved as if i was stunned by the news when in fact i was just stunned by the brilliance of our act the cops went away but they kept coming back i had no alibi i had a motive id been seen going into the city on the saturday although i was pretty sure i hadnt been seen coming back they came to see me at work they built up the pressure on me and the only time you and maddy spoke about reza sangari was when the fbi agents were in the house that first time asked falcón and we never spoke about it again said marty the murder inquiry was suddenly terminated they found sangari was heavily in debt due to a cocaine habit they put it down to a drug killing we came to europe my blood slowed down maddy krugman was grunting with incredulity this is all in your head marty she said pure fantasy and now shes doing the same again with our friend the judge said marty swivelling the gun towards calderón she wants me to kill you sr calderón do you know why calderóns head wobbled on his shaky neck because she hates you she hates what you represent the roving predatory male who sows his seed wherever he can i know her now like ive never known anybody in my life thats how deep it goes when you do someones killing for them im telling you juez calderón she gets a sexual thrill from the idea of you dead you lying there with your unseeing eyes open and a hole in your stony heart it will make her feel brilliant shut up marty she roared just shut the fuck up i discovered that unexpected bonus it lasted for quite a while it bound us together it exhilarated our sex life he said as if puzzled by how little that meant now until said maddy breathing heavily from her outburst until what said marty until you started thinking again you dumb fuck until you disappeared inside your fucking head i was in love with reza sangari he fooled around with other women i stopped seeing him and then you killed him or did you marty maybe all that is in your head too your weird little fantasy i didnt set you up to murder him if you did kill him you did that all on your own and once he was dead i needed you and you were there for me and thats why we were drawn together this shit youre talking about esteban i dont know where you theres something missing in this story said falcón theres a big gap between the fbi applying pressure and you appearing in seville as a nextdoor neighbour to rafael vega three faces turned on marty he changed the gun to the other hand wiped his palm on his trousers changed it back to his left hand what happened there marty asked falcón homicide cops dont normally let people with an opportunity no alibi and a strong motive off the hook the fbi are no different after years in the job we all have an instinct for murderers and we squeeze them until they crack why dont you tell us why they let you off the hook marty krugman shrugged what the hell i met someone on a train he said maddy sat up and frowned to herself people dont talk much on commuter trains and they dont normally ask you how you feel about your country but this guy for some reason wanted to know all the famous theories of marty krugman he wanted to know how good an american i was he wanted to know how strong my fear was how ravenous my greed i think looking back on it i qualified on the grounds of fear i told him that i wanted america to remain the most powerful nation of earth because i know where i stand with them at the helm we met again some days later and went for a walk in bryant park behind the new york public library it was freezing cold theres a good place to eat lunch there the bryant grill and it was there that this man revealed that he understood the nature of my problem and that he could solve it what was this mans name asked falcón looking at maddy foley macnamara said marty without missing a beat maddy blinked mouth open a crack we became regulars at the bryant grill foley told me how important presentation was in the maintenance of control how the ends justify the means and how the means necessarily have to be outrageous and quite ruthlessly executed in order to remind those with delusions of power who theyre up against he said that this was a big part of the agencys job to maintain image to hold loyalty to the brand the agency said maddy incredulous what agency marty that was when i asked him whether he was with the cia and he said he was not oh shit marty no said maddy youve finally fucking flipped the agency jesus christ he said he was a consultant and that he provided information for certain departments he said that he only worked in the business and political arenas never military he liked my profile id never worked for the government i had a welldocumented career as an architect i already spoke nearperfect spanish all they wanted me to do was go to seville make contact with an estate agency and they would put us next to rafael vega for a start marty we did not intend to go to seville if you remember we took a small house in provence that was where we were going to spend a year to try and live the life of that stupid fucking book if you remember but we went to barcelona to see my old pal gaudi and we ended up in seville maddy he said all i had to do was to keep up the flow of information about vega his situation what he was thinking and any plans he might have in return the thrust of the reza sangari investigation would be redirected we would be free to leave the country and restart our lives no admission of guilt was implied this is crazy said maddy burying her face in her hands you cant tell these people this stuff did you know who you were spying on asked falcón i only found that out as things started to develop in rafael vegas life the theory being that the less i knew the more convincing i could be who was your contact here in seville his code name was romany i used to meet him down by the river between the bridges did he give you rafael vegas real identity dont tell me you believe this stuff inspector jefe said maddy because i can tell you i mean this proves that we are dealing with an insane person here i learnt everything about him myself said marty ignoring her which meant i learnt nothing for months we discussed all sorts of things but he never talked about himself he was completely watertight until the end of last year when for the first time he got really drunk in my company and started to talk about his other life i didnt learn everything in one go i had to piece it together from a series of discussions but what was causing his distress was that hed been married before to a woman whod died some years ago in cartagena in colombia theyd had a daughter who had subsequently married and had children herself hed kept in touch with his daughter and the news hed received at the end of last year was that she her husband and the children had been killed when a truck had forced their car off the road it was a devastating blow and of course he had no one to talk to except me did he believe it was a genuine accident asked falcón in his confused and stricken state the real paranoia of the man came out said marty he didnt know whether it was his enemies coming back at him or just divine retribution so he told you what hed been doing in his other life asked falcón why hed had to cut himself off from his wife and daughter not exactly said marty he told me hed started seeing faces from his past maddy spread her hands as if this was proof of the mans complete delusion in dreams asked falcón i think they started as dreams and then dream and reality began to merge and thats what was frightening him while they were dream faces he found himself intrigued by why his mind had marked them out once he started to see these same faces on living people he thought he was going mad he wouldnt go and see anybody about it he said that hed started taking something for his anxiety but the faces kept coming at him in parks shops cafes and still he couldnt work out who they were it came out that hed been in the military said marty and using some very simple powers of deduction i reasoned that hed been involved in the chilean military takeover of i put it to him that some very unpleasant things happened in the process of the pinochet revolution and that perhaps these faces were from people whod suffered at the hands of the new regime and as i was saying this i knew id hit home he retreated into his head and spoke to himself and i heard him say they were the ones who didnt ask for their mothers i think that they were people hed tortured was that why you killed him marty asked falcón i understand your need to tidy things up inspector jefe said marty so pin the killing on me if you must but this was a man who was going to do the job himself what about the agency said maddy more provocatively this time they didnt want him dead said marty they still hadnt found out what they wanted to know and what was that asked falcón they didnt know they were just sure he had something that could be damaging to them or their interests do you think these people are going to believe that bullshit said maddy hitting high screechy notes my husband is a cia undercover agent youre pathetic marty krugman you are fucking pathetic and always have been and now gentlemen said marty this is over the bullet entered her chest to the right of her left breast marty slid to the floor with his back against the wall he put the barrel of the gun into his mouth falcón threw himself at marty trying to knock the gun away but everything had been calculated marty pulled the trigger and the white wall spattered red behind him chapter tuesday th july not much strength is required to throw off a cotton sheet but falcón couldnt find it his arms had been weakened by last nights failures he was glad hed already written his report his fingers felt like squid comisario elvira had insisted on him faxing the report through after hed delivered his verbal account while driving calderón back to his apartment snapshots of last nights events flipped through his mind the closeup of the light going out in marty krugmans eyes calderón paralysed on the sofa his face full of horror at the blood spreading out into maddy krugmans silk top the young patrolman surveying the carnage in the room and gagging into his hand garcia pushing past them to shake his head at the human mess the three of them going downstairs calderón holding on to the bannister the police marksman unused sitting in the front of garcias car with his case on his knees the drive back with calderón on the mobile giving inés a monosyllabic account inés in strappy pointy highheeled shoes standing in the glare of the headlights in the street outside the apartment building calderón with his hands weighing thirty kilos apiece by his sides as inés engulfed him in her arms their faces as he moved off hers with lower lip trembling eyes sparkling with tears and his lifeless apart from one shift of the eyes to the corners which said youve seen me javier falcón now go get away let me be the distance that seven hours of deep anaesthetic sleep had put between him and these events had made them seem like a journalists account of a crime committed in the s he felt different as if a surgeon had mistakenly removed something that had never troubled him and the result was going to change his life his conversation with consuelo came back to him hed called her lying in bed just moments before he blacked out the last exchange marty krugman was clearly insane she said was he he drove to the jefatura black and sick in his stomach as if hed drunk coffee on a bad hangover he gripped the steering wheel tightly as he came into the empty outer office he saw ramírez standing at the window leaning forward supporting himself on his hands i heard about last nights disaster said ramírez are you all right falcón nodded more or less elviras already been on the phone asking to see you as soon as you come in the comisario was standing at his window hands behind his back looking across calle bias infante to the parque de los principes his predecessor lobo used to do the same thing drawing the illusion of power from surveying a domain take a seat inspector jefe he said nipping behind his desk swift and agile giving his moustache a finger and thumb wipe ive read your report and juez calderóns which arrived first thing this morning ive already been in touch with the american consul and hes asked for copies they should come back to us this morning on the cia nonsense they wont want to let that notion build up any authority in our ranks so you dont give it any credibility sir sounds like the ravings of a deranged mind to me said elvira but then again when i heard that our government had sent death squads to wipe out eta terrorist cells i didnt believe that either i couldnt believe it so officially i would call myself sceptical whilst privately thinking the whole story completely fantastical he was deranged said falcón theres no doubt about that but you cant totally write him off im sure the fbi dont let people off the hook that easily and what he told me about reza sangari matches what i found out myself i see no reason why he should lie about killing the man unless that too was some fantasy which in his confused mind he hoped would draw his very strange wife back to him the stuff he spouted about the agency who knows im sure his wife didnt believe a word of it itll be interesting to see what virgilio guzmán comes back with on the profile of miguel velasco whats guzmán got to do with it hes a chilean he has expatriate contacts who can help with that sort of material said falcón one thing i do know about these dream faces he mentioned is that pablo ortega saw vega badly spooked in the corte ingles one day and i imagine that hed been seeing one of his visions youve got to be careful with virgilio guzmán said elvira there are people who say that he cant seem to take anything at face value any more hes sees a conspiracy theory in everything he clarified the element of the suicide note and that helped with the identification of rafael vega i thought he came to see you about montess suicide he did the inclusion of eduardo carvajals name in vegas address book was why id gone to see montes in the first place said falcón montes mentioned russian mafia involvement in the sex trade and the next thing i find is a russian connection to vega i ask montes about these russians and very soon after that he killed himself and you talked to guzmán about this i gave it to him as context but we had an agreement that he would not write about anything circumstantial only the provable facts and as yet we have nothing that links montes to the russians youre making me very nervous inspector jefe the montes suicide is an internal matter at the moment if there is corruption within the force we have to be extremely careful about how it is handled a journalist was sent to talk to me in my position as the investigating officer i was not briefed on what could or could not be discussed with him i believe with someone of the reputation of virgilio guzmán that transparency is the best policy have you read the diario de sevilla today yes there was a very extensive report on the career of inspector jefe montes falcón nodded waited but nothing more was said i think you should search the krugmans house before the americans come back to us said elvira ive already arranged a warrant falcón headed for the door elvira spoke to the back of his head if virgilio guzmán approaches you on the events of last night id like you to be very oblique about why juez calderón was in the apartment i dont want a scandal about the juez de instruccion having had an affair with the deceased has he admitted to that i asked for a separate statement on that subject he seems to have been obsessed by her said elvira who added without looking up from his papers im surprised that you didnt mention in your statement his action of bravery at the end his bravery asked falcón as krugman raised his gun to fire said elvira reading from calderóns statement i threw myself towards him in the hope of distracting his aim the bullet hit sra krugman in the chest inspector jefe falcón was unable to prevent sr krugman from putting the gun into his mouth and killing himself ill search the krugmans house said falcón leaving the office garcia didnt see it either said elvira as the door closed back in the office falcón sent cristina ferrera off to the lab to pick up the krugmans house keys from felipe and jorge who had removed them from the crime scene back in tabladilla ramírez was still slumped at his desk cia he said incredulous falcón threw up his hands or not cia but some shadowy consultancy connected to the cia he said fantasy said ramírez lets say that guzmáns conspiracy theory is correct if you were part of the american administration responsible for some very ugly things happening in south america during the seventies and you were worried that rafael vega had something that could prove personal involvement by senior members of the us administration what would you do kill him anyway thats because youre a ruthless bastard josé luis said falcón the fact is you wouldnt use the cia would you you wouldnt have the power to use it but there must be excia men with contacts and influence who have debts you see what i mean about crazy krugman you cant just dismiss him as a madman i can said ramírez hes too unstable for that kind of work what if hes your only option said falcón and what do you make of his final admission that the agency didnt want vega dead because they hadnt found out what they wanted to find out thats a bit of an anticlimax isnt it you mean he was doing all these vital secret tasks but none of the information he came up with was crucial enough that vega had to be killed said ramírez maybe what they were looking for is locked up in vegas safedeposit box for which we still dont have a search warrant youre beginning to believe josé luis youd better remind juez calderón if he comes in for work today the phone rang in the outer office ramírez went to answer it while falcón thought about krugman they if they existed couldnt have been expecting marty to find papers or a video tape that would have been too much what they were looking for were reports on vegas state of mind was this a man about to go to baltasar garzón or the belgian justice system and offer his services for instance that was the town hall in aracena said ramírez leaning against the door jamb they passed a restoration project on montess ruined finca valued at twenty million pesetas a total rebuild complete remodernization threephase electricity the works falcón passed the news on to comisario elvira who reacted as if hed been expecting it all along he told them to proceed with the krugman house search ferrera came back with the house keys and they drove out to santa clara the house was cold and silent and looked undisturbed as the three of them snapped on their latex gloves ill go upstairs said falcón join me when youve finished down here what are we looking for asked ferrera a little note from dr kissinger saying keep up the good work said ramírez that should do it falcón went upstairs the door to maddy krugmans exhibition room was open all the photographs had been removed from the walls and only one exhibit was left on a plinth in the centre of the room it consisted of a cutout of a blownup version of vega standing barefoot in his garden the cutout was encased in perspex and suspended within the transparent block like the skeletons of autumn leaves were the ghostly prints of human hands they all seemed to be pressing in on the lonely figure who stood imprisoned as if by his own history like an insect in amber there was a printed card attached to the piece written in spanish las manos desaparecidas the vanished hands he went across to her work room ferrera was going to have to spend a day going through all the prints transparencies and negatives checking every one up against the wall were the framed shots which had been hanging in the other room he flipped through them looking for the shot shed taken of him he found the empty frame he checked the paper shredder and saw his image hanging in ribbons marty krugman had converted one of the other bedrooms into his office there was a desk a laptop and a drawing board rolls of plans stood in the corners falcón went through the desk drawers he found a school exercise book with what appeared to be a collection of krugmans odd thoughts jotted down boredom is the enemy of humanity it is why we get up and kill the torturer learns his skills from the agonies of his own mind transformed by power guilt defines us as human but in consuming the mind destroys all that made us human only by public admission is our humanity restored that is the measure of our mutual dependence falcón flipped through to the last entry i know what youre doing im going to chain you up refuse you food and water watch you wither and crack fade and split and roll a rich red wine over my tongue while you die that was the problem with krugman he was like an unreliable witness taking the stand the purity of his intellect was always getting infected by the bacteria of emotion ramírez appeared at the door did you see the exhibit said falcón the vanished hands i came up here to ask cristinas question in private said ramírez what the fuck are we looking for that exhibit do you think its sra krugmans artistic interpretation of what was going on in vegas mind or did she know more said falcón this is a book of krugmans thoughts he talks about the mind of a torturer these are hints not clues said ramírez they are not usable were here because elvira is covering his back hes sceptical but he wants to make sure theres no obvious connection between krugman and what shall we call him a mysterious american said falcón that means were going to have to go through all of sra krugmans shots and but she photographed strangers all the time but not ones talking to her husband down by the river and if we find a shot youve gone back to being a nonbeliever again josé luis said falcón if id told you fifteen years ago that russian mafia gangs would control seventy per cent of prostitution in europe youd have laughed in my face but anything and everything is possible now people have started to see aeroplanes as bombs you can buy a new identity on the streets of any european city in fortyeight hours for a few thousand euros an ak can be yours in minutes there are alqaeda cells in almost every country of the world why shouldnt the cia be running a small operation in seville when the whole of europe has become a civilization simmering with anarchy and decadence remind me to live in fear javier said ramírez my point is so what if we find a shot of krugman with a mysterious american the consulate denies everything krugman was a madman who shot his wife and then himself where are we six people have died in less than a week five of them lived next door to each other even if i wasnt a cop i would find that extraordinary said falcón we might be witnesses to some sort of collective unconscious implosion where each death or suicide applies mental pressure to the next victim or we might simply be unable to see the connections because we dont quite know enough the mobile in his pocket vibrated elvira ordered him back to the jefatura the american consulate was sending someone over falcón left them at the search and drove back to calle bias infante the man from the american consulate was a communications officer called mark flowers he was about fifty years old goodlooking tanned with black hair that must have been dyed he spoke flawless castilian spanish and was well prepared for what he had to do ive read these two statements from inspector jefe falcón and juez calderón i was told that they were written separately the impressive detail seems to match and in the absence of any serious contradictions i informed the consul that i believed them to be accurate and true both statements were therefore sent to the cia in langley for their comments they categorically deny any knowledge not only of marty krugman but also this socalled consultant foley macnamara comisario elvira also asked if the cia had any record of one miguel velasco aka rafael vega who was exchilean military receiving any cia training theyve informed me that they did a file search of all personnel as far back as the creation of the cia after the second world war and found that nobody of that name had received any training they also offered the opinion that at no point last night did marty krugman refer to rafael vega as miguel velasco and that the information he gave seemed to be his interpretation of sr vegas mental problems krugman himself deduced that vega had been in the chilean military and that he had been involved in torture they describe sr krugman as a classic fantasist with access to an imagination infected by psychosis who given his personal experience of south american politics of that era would have no trouble what personal experience of south american politics asked falcón immigration ran a search on marty krugmans travels outside the usa and found that he was attracted enough through his own liberal and leftleaning politics to make four trips to chile between march and july as you know during the allende administration the american government was very concerned at the development of their marxist policies and as a consequence us citizens visiting that country were closely monitored what about vegas late wife and his daughters family asked falcón that as you can imagine is rather more difficult for them to verify all they can say is that neither miguel velasco nor rafael vega was married on us soil said flowers i meant krugmans assertion that vegas anxiety stemmed from his paranoia that they might have been killed by his enemies who are these enemies the people who provided him with a witness protection programme from which he thought it best to escape you might be interested to know that the cias research on chilean military personnel revealed miguel velasco to be quite a notorious member of the pinochet regime known for his extremely unconventional and distasteful interrogation techniques the opposition revolutionary movement the mir knew him by the nickname el salido the pervert but what did the cia have to say about the fbi input on the matter asked falcón surely absconding from an fbi protection programme after acting as a witness in a drugtrafficking trial should be something the cia would be interested in the cia were only examining these documents in the light of sr krugmans behaviour and claims i know they have a file on miguel velasco because of his actions in the pinochet administration if theres anything else it would of course be classified your response has been very rapid and thorough said falcón they pride themselves on it said flowers since there have been changes in the service especially on reaction time to all inquiries in which there is a reference to that date even if it did refer to i added a summary of the vega case to the statements said elvira for the purposes of clarification it was very helpful comisario said flowers what would be the reaction from the cia if we could provide photographic proof that meetings had occurred between sr krugman and us government officials asked falcón who was finding mark flowers to be rather too amicable and gracious extreme surprise i would imagine said flowers whose face remained completely impassive as you know sr krugmans wife was a wellknown and active photographer who particularly enjoyed taking shots of people down by the river which was where her husband said he had meetings with code name romany flowers blinked once but said nothing he handed elvira his card and left do you have photographic evidence asked elvira no comisario said falcón its just a way of terminating a line of inquiry if sr krugman was a fantasist well never hear from mark flowers again but if he was supplying information there will be some anxious people in the consulate id be interested to hear if you receive communication from a higher authority elviras phone rang falcón got up to leave elvira stayed him with his hand the comisario listened made notes and hung up that was a senior officer from aracena he said hes just been informed by the fire department that the forest fire raging around almonaster la real in the past few days was an arson attack and that they have now traced the start of the fire to an isolated finca which belonged to inspector jefe alberto montes the contents of the house have been almost completely destroyed but they have found a rudimentary timer which they believed was attached to an incendiary device that ignited a large quantity of petrol chapter tuesday th july it was still brutally hot outside the city which crouched in a haze behind falcón like a beast in its own fetor but the openness of the rolling plain ahead of him the swaying brown grasses the distant hills made him feel free of the discomfort of his own body the temperature dropped as he drove through the sierra and although it never reached below blood heat the sense of release from the citys feverish concrete into the high greenery of the chestnut trees induced a mild delirium or was it elton john singing benny and the jets on the radio it was impossible to think that anything terrible could happen out here whereas the city drew the poor the lost the corrupted and the depraved to the mangled teat of its bristly underbelly this country seemed untouched the jostling leaves of the trees filtered the sunlight to the pure dappled memory of less confused times until falcón turned off the main road to almonaster la real the charcoal stink of torched forest reached him before the sight of blackened stumps and scorched defoliated trees with their barkflayed arms stretched out in the distress of serious burn victims the forest floor of blackandgrey coals still smouldered as if panting from the devastating consumption the white sky provided a pitiless backdrop as if to emphasize to those doubters who passed through this monochromatic horror that what had happened here was as wrong as war the police and firemen he met in the local bar in almonaster were grim and the townspeople shocked and in despair as if they were the survivors of some wartime atrocity they knew things that falcón as yet didnt he was led down to the finca which was several kilometres outside the town and isolated in the forest there was a kilometre of rough dirt track up to the house whose windowless roofless blackened shell looked like a giant stovedin human skull everything wooden in the house had been consumed the first floor no longer existed it had burnt or collapsed under the weight of the falling roof on to the concrete below the ground floor was piled with black terracotta roof tiles charred beams and furniture smoking mattresses screenless televisions and pools of molten but now hardened plastic they took him down through the concrete floor into the basement which was badly scorched but intact it didnt look like any basement hed ever seen there were four metal doors two on either side of a short corridor the doors had bolts on the outside which could also be padlocked none of the rooms had windows all had burnt wooden pallets and mattresses they were cells in which people had been kept in one of the cells whose walls were unplastered revealing the original stone there was some writing scratched on to a rock in the corner by the bed it was in cyrillic script an enamelled metal plate lay upside down on the floor they led him back upstairs and out on to the land whose grass had been burnt off leaving a bald stretch of black and brown beaten earth which now looked like the hide of a diseased dog at the edge of the land inside what would have been the tree line were two piles of earth with the forest burnt down we could see these two humps said the officer we dug down about a metre and found these falcón looked down on the skeletal remains of two people nestled in the dark earth we didnt want to dig further until we had proper forensics here but the local doctor measured them and thinks that they are a boy and a girl of around twelve or thirteen years of age he thought that theyd been buried for between eight months and a year given that there is no tissue left what do you know about how this house was being used asked falcón needing to get something out because his rage was reaching uncontainable levels weekends only and not every weekend friday and saturday nights mostly did you ever meet the owner inspector jefe montes of course he came and said hello to us he said hed bought the house and that some friends were going to do it up and use it as a hunting lodge they walked back to the house and falcón could see that there were airconditioning units for the lower and upper floors so they came in the summer as well said falcón pointing at the blackened boxes not to hunt obviously said the officer in the end they didnt do much hunting at all we didnt think i much about it at the time and because inspector jefe montes was the owner we didnt think anything the officers voice trailed off illegal seemed an ineffective word to describe what had gone on in this house of horror whoever started this fire had to bring a great deal of petrol up to the house said falcón they probably used plastic jerry cans and theyd have needed a pickup can you contact every petrol station in this area and well you know what to do falcón called elvira and gave him a report he asked for felipe and jorge to be sent out with a change of clothes because they were certainly going to have to spend the night he also asked for some manpower to phone around the petrol stations in the seville area looking for a pickup with probably two people whod filled possibly ten plastic jerry cans with petrol late saturday night or very early on sunday morning he hung up and told the officer that the area was to be cordoned off and kept under guard nobody was to touch anything on the property until the forensics arrived he checked the airconditioning boxes on the ground floor but didnt find what he was looking for he asked for a set of ladders a car was dispatched to town falcón stood in the blackened landscape and drew fury from the destruction the car returned with a set of ladders falcón leaned them up against the house and found himself mentally praying he took out an evidence bag and a pair of tweezers and climbed up to the airconditioning units one by one on the third unit he found what he wanted scorched but not destroyed was the peeling sticker of the company that had installed the units aire condicionado central de sevilla ignacio ortegas company he took out another evidence bag and walked down the rough track and scooped up some dust he expected it to match the dust found on vegas old peugeot ortega vega montes he thought and only one left alive ramírez was bored as he took falcóns call on his mobile there were thousands of maddy krugmans prints on paper and on hard disk and the task did not inspire him his boredom evaporated as falcón briefed him on montess finca near almonaster la real did you check ignacio ortegas alibi asked falcón yes but that was for the night that rafael vega died where was he he was in bed with his wife on the coast i told him about pablos death late on saturday night and he didnt come back to seville until sunday morning i can ask him for proof of his whereabouts for that week if you want i dont want to spook him well if he organized that arson attack you already have said ramírez how many people know what happened at montess finca by now the whole of almonaster la real i mean not in detail but they know its nasty theyll probably know about the bodies so thats all going to be on the news this evening we havent got enough on him to link him to what was actually happening at montess finca well have to find the arsonists first and they might give us the link said falcón leave cristina at the krugmans house and go back to the jefatura and make it allhappen josé luis falcón went back down into the basement of the house and with a pen torch in his mouth copied downthe cyrillic script written on the wall as he looked around the four cells he realized that the mattresses had all been doused with petrol and set alight but that there hadnt been enough oxygen to keep them going more people were dispatched to town to bring large plastic sheets which they laid out on the scorched earth the mattresses and pallets were numbered off and lifted out of the basement and laid on the plastic falcón conducted a minute search of the walls of the empty cells in the second cell he noticed a dark stain on the floor coming from the back wall out into the centre of the room he chipped out a piece of concrete and bagged it in the fourth cell he found a oneeuro coin behind a loose piece of mortar he bagged that outside they started work on the mattresses peeling back the outer fabric and working through the stuffing the mattress from cell two had a shard of curved glass in it a section of a broken wine goblet the mattress from cell three had the real treasure a used gillette ii razor blade still with some bristles attached at pm they broke for lunch felipe and jorge had arrived in almonaster la real and over pork chops chips and salad falcón told them to concentrate on the interior of the house before they moved on to exhuming the bodies square metre by square metre photographs all the way dust everything for prints even if they look completely burnt out all televisions video recorders remotes theres a lot of congealed plastic in there which might be from videos see if theres one centimetre of tape available were also looking for personal items money jewellery clothing people come to a place like this they lose things i want a finger search of all the land around the house be meticulous do everything by the book nobody and i mean nobody who has been to this house and been involved with whats been going on here should have the slightest chance of being able to get away with it on a technicality a grim determination settled over the lunch table calls were made to the neighbouring towns of cortegana and aracena for more people to help with the finger search of the land by the time they returned to the finca there were thirty people falcón put twentysix on to the finger search and four to help felipe and jorge lifting things out of the house all findings were photographed in situ logged in a school exercise book with the photograph number and bagged any large items with discernible prints were wrapped in plastic falcón asked elvira to have two lab technicians standing by to receive the material and process the evidence by pm they had completed the finger search of the land and about twothirds of the house interior ramírez called ive found your arsonists he said im putting a squad together to go and pick them up now they live out in tres mil vivendas and i dont want them getting away from us in that little hell hole that was quick work josé luis i got lucky he said i reckoned theyd be doing this at night so i started with all the latenight garages on the road out to aracena i thought they might not be stupid but in this heat they could easily be lazy i reckoned they wouldnt fill all the jerry cans up at one petrol station and draw attention to themselves but they might want to do it on the way two of the garages remembered a pickup with two guys filling plastic jerry cans but neither of them had closecircuit television i worked back from there until i found a petrol station with cctv and this was where i got lucky the guys came back twice to fill up i went out there to view the tapes both guys were wearing hats so they knew they were vulnerable to cctv and i didnt get a sight of them or the vehicle because it was parked on the other side of the pumps but the second time there was a truck parked where they wanted to be so they had to come into the light between the shop and the pumps the cctv cameras were pointed so that they picked up the activity on that part of the forecourt their registration number just slid beautifully into view have you got names yes and theyve both got police records for petty theft and burglary and one of them picked up an assault conviction too but neither of them has been done for arson im on my way back with the first vanload of evidence he closed down the mobile which rang again instantly alicia aguado told him she could find a friend to take her out to the prison for her next session with sebastián ortega one of the aracena police officers with a relative in seville volunteered to accompany the vanload of evidence falcón headed back to the city alone at speed as if he was rushing towards a brilliant conclusion he had to pull over to take three calls on the way back the first was from cristina ferrera saying that shed been through maddy krugmans prints and hard disk and come across two shots of marty krugman sitting with a different stranger in each in one he was animated and talking in the other he seemed to be waiting in both shots he was either in the background or off to one side the one in which he appeared in the background had been taken from the hard disk and shed had to blow up that section of the shot to confirm it was him the second call was from ramírez confirming that theyd arrested the two arsonists and he was conducting a search of their apartment the third call came from elvira just as he was about to hit the main road into seville the comisario wanted to see him as soon as he arrived back in the jefatura falcón went straight up to elviras office his secretary had already left the comisarios door was open elvira sat at his desk staring into it as if contemplating a terrible loss somethings going on said elvira pointing him into a chair whatever it is it doesnt look good theres political pressure coming from unseen powers said elvira that article published in the diario de sevilla this morning you didnt seem too concerned by that earlier today the extensive obituary alongside it was a very care fully angled piece of writing there were no reasons given for montess suicide and the piece didnt make any claims but people who know were in no doubt when they came away from that article that there were implications serious ones there has been a reaction to those implications from senior people at the town hall and important members of the andalucían parliament they want to know the state of our house falcón started to say something and elvira held up his hand ive just heard two other reports which could be interpreted as unfortunate holiday accidents or sinister coincidences dr alfonso martinez a member of the andalucían parliament is now in intensive care after his car left the road on the motorway from jerez de la frontera to cadiz and crashed into a bridge and the wife of enrique altozano found her husbands clothes in a pile on a beach between pedro de alcántara and estepona and alerted the authorities they are currently searching the coast but he has not been found he was the man in the planning department of the seville town hall who was responsible for awarding licences to new building projects this time falcón didnt try to say anything powerful people are like jackals on the prairie they put their noses to the air for the smell of scandal and the faintest whiff carries to them from kilometres away said elvira the job of the politician is to always maintain power he does not necessarily want to deny that something disgraceful has occurred but he does want to contain it so that institutions dont completely disintegrate youre preparing me for something comisario said falcón i hope its not going to be a disappointment in those institutions or the people that run them i am telling you how it is so that we can develop this case in a way that maximizes the number of convictions and minimizes the serious political damage said elvira if we show that we are only interested in taking down everybody involved we will be prevented from doing that we have the example of our own government that if you remember was how felipe gonzalez survived the death squad scandal are you concerned that i might be a fanatical zealot it would be understandable given what we know so far of the unpleasantness of this case let me get this straight said falcón two powerful people have either been killed or attempted suicide this has alerted other powerful people who have hinted to the jefatura that should we want to press this case to its logical conclusion we will suffer an in depth examination of the state of our own force in other words if we show their corruption to the world they will show ours comisario lobo said you would understand perfectly our problem is that the crucial conviction in this case is the one that will bring down the whole house of cards said falcón ill tell you what i think has happened comisario ignacio ortega took over the procuring work for the paedophile rings from eduardo carvajal as he had a connection to the russians that connection is strong enough that they were able to award him contracts without consulting rafael vega j montes was already corrupted at the time of the death of eduardo carvajal he was forced into further incrimination by the purchase of this finca near almonaster la real which ignacio ortega helped to restore as a result of montess involvement in the finca the authorities never bothered to investigate how the house was being used im nearly sure that rafael vega was a client well do a few tests which might confirm that to us mark flowers gave us an indication of vegas tastes when he told us his nickname at the time of the chilean coup these two latest casualties youve just told me about could mean that martinez and altozano may have been clients too to completely stamp this out we should ideally take out the russians but i dont know how we can get to them the next rung down is ignacio ortega the problem is that he is not a character who will go down quietly he will demand from his friends that he be saved or he will bring down the individuals in these highly valued institutions of ours dont allow any of that bitterness to creep into your words said elvira i understand why you should feel like that but outside people will dismiss you as difficult and you will never get what you want what have you got on ortega very little said falcón he came under suspicion because of his behaviour around the death of his brother i interviewed his son who is a heroin addict and he reluctantly told me about the systematic sexual abuse that he and his cousin had suffered as well as a number of his friends when they were children favours were being done in the building trade between ignacio ortega vega and the russians the minimum ortega did was to install the airconditioning units in montess finca inspector ramírez has caught the arsonists who set fire to the finca were hoping they will provide a more concrete link to ignacio ortega that will give us the minimum option of holding ortega on conspiracy to arson charges the next step might be more difficult the sexual abuse charges against his son dont have much hope given his drug problems i know its wrong but thats the perception he said he wouldnt testify against his father anyway and sebastián ortega has been convicted of a serious crime which we are hoping we can prove that he did not commit but that wont help us with ortega we need more time all right said elvira sitting back tired and exasperated see if theres a link between ignacio ortega and the arsonists if there is we have to plan our next move and i dont need to tell you but you cant talk to virgilio guzmán about any of this chapter tuesday th july in the outer office cristina ferrera was sitting at a desk feet hooked round the chair legs looking at the two paper printouts of the shots of marty krugman down by the river she turned the two a sheets round on the desk for falcón to look at the first shot showed marty off to the left of the frame sitting on a bench by the river he was not the focus of the shot the man sitting next to him was a stranger to both marty and falcón the second shot is a blowup of the background of a larger shot said ferrera in this shot marty krugman was turned sideways on the bench and was talking to a man falcón immediately recognized as mark flowers and these are off the hard disk said falcón no film negatives she handed over a cd in its box she used two cameras if she saw something she thought she liked she used mm film if she was just snapping people generally she used a digital camera the only record of these two shots are on this cd and in her laptop i can see this took a lot of hard boring work i know it would have been better to have had negatives she said this is good enough said falcón none of this is going to end up in court wheres inspector ramírez hes downstairs setting up the interrogation rooms said ferrera hes very excited he found something good in the arsonists apartment i want you to take this to the lab said falcón handing her the used razor blade hed found in the finca there are bristles on the blades its a long shot but i want them to run a dna test on it and make a comparison with rafael vega by the way sra krugmans laptop is in the evidence room said ferrera but i left everything else at the house what about the keys she pushed them across the desk at him one other thing said falcón giving her the paper with the cyrillic script you remember the russian translator we used with nadia kouzmikheva ask her to translate that for us tomorrow will do ramírez was sitting in interrogation room with his elbows on his knees and his head hanging down smoke rose from the fingers of his right hand he didnt move when falcón entered the room he didnt move until falcón touched him on the shoulder he sat back slowly as if in pain whats the problem josé luis ive been checking a tape what tape ive revised my opinion of the arsonists they were bloody idiots tontos perdidos they went in there with the minds of petty thieves and before they torched the finca they stole a tv and video recorder and inside the video recorder was a tape said falcón galvanized by the development and it was what i thought it would be child pornography but what i didnt expect was to recognize one of the participants not montes no no thank god that would have been too terrible this was a guy from the barrio you remember i told you about the one whod done very well for himself but it was never enough he had to come back and tell us all how rich and important he had become ram it down our throats he was the cabron on the tape so this tape is a recording of events filmed in the finca i presume so but i didnt get beyond the first minute i started feeling sick elviras going to have to know about this said falcón but is there any way we can make a copy of it before we send it upstairs ramírez gave him a long hard look dont tell me what i think youre going to tell me he said elvira is on our side sure he is said ramírez until someone starts treading on his balls thats why we make the copy because theyre already treading said falcón but theyre in ballet shoes at the moment you wait said ramírez when they hear about this tape especially if theres someone important on it theyll be down here in their cuban heels ramírez drummed the floor of the interrogation room with his feet who knows youve got the tape nobody the tv and video recorder were dumped inside the arsonists front door it was only when i got them back here that i thought to look and see if the video was loaded good then we copy the tape hand over the original and see what happens do you know how to copy tapes i know you need two vcrs and we cant do it here said ramírez and we cant ask anybody to explain how its done in small easy to understand words or the whole jefatura will know youve got a machine at home and so have i said falcón get one of your kids to explain to you how to copy a tape and bring your machine over to my place where its quiet falcón set up the video ready to show the interviewees what theyd stolen ramírez gave him the vehicle details the record of its sightings in the garages a copy of the cctv tape and the hat worn by one of the arsonists who was called carlos delgado have we got a photo of ignacio ortega to show them asked ramírez not a clear one said falcón but theyll know his name and theyll be very scared to say it im sure knock on the door when you need to use the tape first one to get a confession loser buys the beer said ramírez the two arsonists were brought down ramírez took pedro gomez falcón sat down with carlos delgado and made the necessary introductions to the tape recorder what were you doing on saturday night and early sunday morning carlos sleeping were you with your friend pedro we live in the same apartment and he was with you that night hes in the next room why dont you ask him was anybody else there carlos shook his head falcón showed him a shot of the pickup is this yours carlos looked down nodded were you using this vehicle on saturday night or sunday morning we went to see pedros aunt in castillo about eleven oclock on sunday morning do you know who was using your vehicle on saturday night sunday morning no is this your hat yes said carlos then after a few beats who are you guys with you ask about my car my hat what the fucks all this about were investigating a very serious sex crime a sex crime we havent committed any sex crime falcón asked him to come over to the tv screen while he played the cctv tape from the garage the screen revealed the grey images of the pickup arriving carlos getting out filling up the jerry cans and going to pay in the shop javier froze the frame that pickup has the same registration as the one on the table which you said is yours we didnt commit any sex crime but that is your pickup yes and this person is you paying for the petrol thats me but i didnt thats ok thats all i need to know whats this sex crime asked carlos somebody rape the girl in the shop what did you do with the jerry cans once youd filled them up we went home straight away yes we bought the petrol for pedros aunt but youd been to this garage before and a couple of other ones where you filled two jerry cans in each and you filled up others at petrol stations on the way out to the turnoff to aracena what were you doing out there silence why did you drive all the way up to almonaster la real with all that petrol in your pickup we didnt you didnt said falcón you know carlos arson is a serious offence but thats not the only thing were interested in at the moment what we want to do is put you away for a very long time for a sex crime as well i havent committed any when you were picked up in your apartment inspector ramírez searched it and found a television and a video recorder in your possession theyre not ours what are they doing in your apartment with your fingerprints on them that stuff isnt ours come with me i dont want to come with you were just going to the television no falcón pushed the television closer he removed the cctv tape and put in the other tape he turned up the volume and pressed play the scream from the television even made him jump carlos delgado kicked his chair back waved his hands at the screen and then gripped his thick curly hair as if for support no no no stop it thats nothing to do with us he shouted it was in your possession turn it off just turn it off falcón stopped the tape carlos was shaken they sat child abuse is a very serious offence said falcón people convicted of such crimes go to prison for a long time and have miserable lives there most choose to go into solitary confinement for the seven to ten years of their sentence we stole the television and the video recorder said carlos where from carlos told the story theyd been paid euros to buy petrol and been given directions and a key to the finca theyd set fire to the place as theyd been asked to do and they stole the stuff on the way out that was all they had no idea what was in it they just wanted a bit of extra cash for the equipment falcón nodded encouraging more exonerating detail who paid you the fifteen hundred euros to do this he asked i dont know his name how do you know him how does he know you asked falcón you dont ask just anybody to burn a house down thats a serious thing isnt it there has to be some trust you only trust people you know silence from carlos as he swallowed hard are you afraid of this man asked falcón carlos shook his head how old are you thirtythree youre a sevillano youve never lived anywhere else thats right still got friends from your childhood pedro pedros the only one youre the same age he nodded unable to think where this was going when was the last time you saw your old childhood friend salvador ortega carlos was stunned he sat there blinking uncomprehending i dont know anybody called salvador ortega he said falcón felt something cold developing in his stomach was the name of the man who gave you fifteen hundred euros to burn down the finca ignacio ortega carlos shook his head falcón looked into his eyes and knew that hed never heard that name before that it inspired no fear no dread and no horrific memories tell me the name of the man who paid you to burn down the finca speak clearly please alberto montes falcón left the room and knocked on ramírezs door he leaned against the wall in the corridor feeling sick you got him already asked ramírez closing the door i didnt get the right result though said falcón i should have thought this out properly ive been believing in my own stupid instinct too much hes just named alberto montes joder said ramírez thumping the wall and now its all fallen into place said falcón this is precisely what montes would have done hed panic or his selfdisgust would finally get the better of him or both and hed just want to get rid of the problem burn the place down except the whole sierra caught fire thousands of hectares were destroyed and hed blown it again thats why he jumped the day i saw ignacio ortega i knew he was a cunning little bastard and i didnt think hes on a different level the reason why were getting the pressure is that hes told those people to put pressure on us he would never do anything as stupid and unsubtle as arson hes gone straight to the top of his client list and told them to stop us dead or face the consequences carlos and pedro were sent back down to the cells without writing their statements falcón took the audio tape of carloss confession and kept it with him he picked up maddy krugmans laptop from the evidence room ramírez went home they reconvened at falcóns house and copied the tape it was grim viewing but they realized it was the product of a secret camera hidden in the wall of one particular room it featured only four clients the businessman from ramírezs barrio a wellknown defence lawyer a tv presenter and an unknown this is how the russians get things done said ramírez as they packed everything away i dont know why they do it im not a clever lawyer or businessman and i cant think of any sexual excitement that would induce me to expose myself to such risk this isnt about sex said falcón this is about damage having had damage done to you or doing damage to others sex is a long way from whats going on on that tape whatever said ramírez pouring out another two beers weve done this weve made the copy of the tape and now what were fucked arent we this isnt going anywhere as soon as it comes out that montes paid the arsonists were dead in the water we have to keep our mouths shut or they go through us with a hobnail enema elvira gave me a lecture about not being too zealous in the pursuit of justice in this case said falcón institutions are protected by powerful people who want to hold on to power and they will ensure that i never get what i want but when you see something like this and that finca out in the sierra and you begin to understand the level of corruption that made it possible i start thinking that maybe we should clear the whole lot out and start again ive realized that im very naive when it comes to these elevated heights of operation well you know who that will include if you want to clear out the old said ramírez tapping his chest my past is not so sweet i think that priest i confessed to aged a decade when he heard me out what are we talking about josé luis a few favours from hookers its not good he said shrugging in this sort of atmosphere nobody gets let off youre not in the same league as these people and you know what it is about these people said ramírez the beer hitting his empty stomach that cabron from the barrio hes successful wealthy has a couple of houses here some more on the coast a yacht a speedboat more cars than trousers and yet he still wants more you see theres only so much lobster you can eat only so much champagne you can drink only so many pretty girls you can fuck for money and then what the excitement of the forbidden fruit said falcón so maybe i was wrong before maybe it isnt about damage at this level maybe its about power the power to do these things with impunity id better go i can see where this evening is heading said ramírez but i tell you once they get hold of the montes shit theyre going to make sure we live in fear did you see the printouts cristina found of marty krugman i didnt recognize the guy he was talking to hes called mark flowers said falcón hes the communications officer at the american consulate hah not so crazy krugman theres probably a very reasonable explanation for it they were lovers said ramírez good night desperate for some good news falcón called alicia aguado and was glad to find her still elated after her session with sebastián ortega the first big step had been taken hed revealed the extent of the sexual abuse hed suffered at the hands of ignacio ortega despite the horror of what the boy had been through the breakthrough had made her happy the healing process had started falcón longed for that sort of job satisfaction instead on nights like these with the arrowroot stalks of fortune up in the air he could only see his work as a desperate shoringup of the breakdowns a sticky plaster applied to the gourdsized stinking abscess in the body of society he wished her well and hung up he hid the video behind two locked doors in franciscos old studio back in the study he checked he had krugmans house keys the laptop the printout of mark flowers and his loaded revolver he drove out to santa clara and parked his car in consuelos driveway he went in to explain his nights work to her and she insisted on feeding him she was not herself she was listless quiet distracted even depressed she said she was missing her children that she was worried about them even with the police protection but there seemed to be something else as well at pm he walked across to the krugmans house let himself in and went upstairs and put maddy krugmans laptop back in her work room he went to the bedroom switched off his mobile lay down and dozed fitfully at two oclock in the morning his eyes opened to a sharp click from downstairs he waited and listened to the complete silence of a good thief at work there was no sound for several minutes then a flashlight came on in the corridor outside the bedroom he was a first rate methodical thief not a cheap rowdy one prone to defecating on the floor he went into maddy krugmans work room there was a sound like a nylon zip opening as the thief booted up the laptop even breathing sounds loud when a good thief is at work but while he was waiting for the laptop to boot up he was using the time to go through the physical prints falcón used that noise to get off the bed wait for the feeling to come back into his right hand take out his revolver and walk down the corridor towards the light bouncing in the room are you looking for this he asked holding out his gun the thief looked up from the laptop whose screen lit his irritation he sat back on maddys work stool and put his hands on his closecropped head and looked bored im not interested in you said falcón im interested in what you do when youve found what he wants i call him and we meet down by the river call him and tell him you got lucky said falcón slow movements the thief made the call which took seconds because he said only one word romany they went down to falcóns car and the thief drove them back into the city they parked on cristobal colón and went down the steps to the walkway by the river they waited in the dark after some minutes footsteps came down on to the walkway a man stood looking around falcón came at him from the shadows is this what youre looking for mr flowers asked falcón holding out the printout lit by his pen torch flowers nodded studying the shot i think we should take a seat he said the thief ran off up the steps flowers handed back the printout he took out a handkerchief sorry for underestimating you inspector jefe said flowers wiping his brow and face i came down here from madrid ten months ago the madrilenos have a rather jaded view of the sevillano mentality i should have been less crude in my methods ten months ago were taking a more active interest in our north african friends and the way they come into europe since last september of course you are said falcón and how did marty krugman fit into all that he didnt said flowers the vega business was a side issue although we got a fright when we heard about his suicide note until we found out where that came from which was it had been scratched on to the wall of one of the cells in the villa grimaldi torture centre in santiago de chile by an american called todd kravitz who was held there for a month in before being disappeared said flowers the full inscription reads we will be in the thin air you breathe from until the end of time poetic enough to stick in his mind and come back nearly thirty years later to haunt him he mentioned to his doctor that he was having sleepwalking problems said falcón but not the unconscious writing the pressures on a mind that didnt know it was guilty said flowers lets talk about marty krugman said falcón why dont we start with what he was doing and who was he doing it for thats a little more awkward for us to discuss this isnt america mr flowers im not wearing a wire my only interest as the inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios is who murdered rafael vega and why i have to take precautions said flowers falcón stood flowers frisked him expertly found the gun immediately they sat back down the vega business was not strictly a government operation said flowers it was more of an agency issue company business the tying up of loose ends but there was cooperation between the fbi and the agency which extended to allowing krugman to walk away from the reza sangari killing they couldnt make a case without marty cracking up and confessing the whole thing to them and i told you about his trips to chile in the seventies what i didnt tell you was that the chilean authorities did eventually catch up with him and he spent three weeks in the london clinic which was another torture centre on calle almirante barroso in three weeks of punishment he didnt give anybody up the only reason he didnt suffer the same fate as todd kravitz was because it was later on in the game and the human rights people were being more assiduous by then this was not a guy who was going to crack under some fbi questioning so you thought it was fitting that he should be reporting back to you on someone who had been a notorious member of that regime said falcón most europeans think that americans have no sense of irony inspector jefe was that why you didnt give him any information on rafael vegas real identity one of the reasons said flowers but if youre supposed to be reporting back on the state of mind of a person its better not to have your insight distorted by history what was so important about vegas state of mind this was a guy we lost track of in when he absconded from a witness protection programme so that was true about him testifying in a drug trafficking trial that was the surface truth he held some damaging information about us army officers and agency personnel who were involved in running drugs for arms back in the late seventies and early eighties so we cut a deal he would act as a witness in a show trial and we would give him a new identity and fifty thousand dollars he took both and disappeared we couldnt find him anywhere but you knew about the wife and daughter thats all we could do keep an eye on them and hope that he resurfaced he was careful he didnt come back for his daughters wedding which we were all expecting and we assumed he was dead we stopped watching but we did send someone down to his wifes funeral when was that not that long ago something like three years i cant remember exactly but the funeral was when we found him again hed finally thought he was safe said flowers we researched his life found that he was a successful businessman and thought that we had nothing to worry about until the russian mafia connection came to light about eighteen months ago did you think he was in the arms dealing business again we just thought wed better take a closer look at rafael vega said flowers but i lied to you earlier we did train him he knew our ways he knew our type of people so we looked for other candidates and that was where the fbi came in marty krugman was our perfect candidate apart from some instability in his marriage do you know what im feeling now sr flowers said falcón that youre giving me just enough information to satisfy my curiosity the full story would take a long time one moment youre talking about tying up loose ends and the next youre talking about reporting on his state of mind it was both what loose ends were you really nervous about we had begun to think that he might be operating again in some way said flowers its an addictive profession inspector jefe we found out that hed bought a passport in the name of emilio cruz and that hed taken moroccan visas i assumed that was his escape route what did he need to escape from maybe it was from you sr flowers said falcón he had the emilio cruz passport before we put marty krugman next to him before we discovered his russian mafia connection why did he run from the witness protection programme in the first place theyre living deaths those things said flowers id have done the same did he have good reason to believe that his daughters family was not killed in an accident that was twenty years after hed absconded said flowers its one of the unfortunate side effects of an addiction to this profession you can never take things at face value people die in road accidents all the time inspector jefe and did you discover what the russian mafia connection was all about he allowed them to launder money through his projects and they indulged his paedophilia i understand he liked to watch el salido remember so what was martys job if you already knew all that silence from sr flowers a big bored sigh when did you tell him that rafael vega was miguel velasco asked falcón no no youre wrong there inspector jefe im not lying to you about that said flowers youre thinking we told him and because of his past involvement in chilean politics that was enough to incite him to murder forcing a man to drink acid said falcón its a nasty way to die said flowers it sounds like a revenge killing but i want to be clear on that we did not give away vegas real identity we did not want vega dead you have to believe marty when he told you so what did you want to know were not sure this doesnt sound very convincing sr flowers said falcón probably because its the truth and weve developed this magnificent myth about american infallibility how about this for a theory said falcón you wanted to know his state of mind because you were worried that he had information that would further compromise more important members of the us administration of that era the secretary of state for instance we were worried that if he did have something he might look for ways of using it against us but we didnt know what it could be who is us asked falcón that is all im saying on the matter said flowers you told me that your concern was whether krugman killed him and i can tell you that he didnt be satisfied how can i be sure of that because marty krugman was with me on the night that rafael vega died from between two and five oclock in the morning said flowers i have a timed and dated recording of that meeting because it took place in the american consulate chapter wednesday st july on the way to the jefatura falcón stopped for a cafe solo on the avenida de argentina he felt bleary and down like everybody else in the bar the heat had wrung all the natural alegria out of the sevillanos leaving some introverted version of themselves to wander the streets and populate the bars there was no sign of ramírez or ferrera in the office he took the audio tapes of the interviews with the arsonists and the original videotape stolen from the montes finca and went up to elviras office he met ramírez coming down i spoke to the arsonists again and asked them how they knew montes said ramírez twenty years ago montes used to run a youth football side for disadvantaged kids they were on his team ive just checked it with the inspector from grume and ive had a proper look at their files montes was involved in helping them with all their brushes with the law did they know montes had killed himself ramírez shook his head wished him good luck with elvira he was not allowed in to see the comisario not even into the secretarys office she put him in the corridor with the singleword explanation lobo ten minutes later he was called in lobo stood by the window arms folded across his chest tense angry elvira sat at his desk his face drawn as if hed been there all night what have you got for us asked lobo leaping the chain of command in his fury two audio recordings of the arsonists did they name ignacio ortega no they named alberto montes lobo pounded elviras table with three devastating blows that jumped his pencils into disarray what else said lobo one video tape with footage from a hidden camera in the finca showing four men participating in sexual acts with minors are any of them known to us theres a defence lawyer and a tv presenter joder said lobo ramírez can identify one of the other men a businessman who comes from his barrio the fourth is unknown who knows about this tape ramírez and myself keep it that way said lobo still brutal with rage what about the arsonists asked elvira i dont think they knew what theyd stolen so the only link between ignacio ortega and montess finca is that he installed the airconditioning units said elvira you have no proof that he was procuring children from the russians for use at the finca and you have no proof that he brought clients to the finca to participate in sexual acts with minors that is correct said falcón knowing this had all gone wrong before hed even started the only way i could establish that he was taking clients to the finca is by speaking to the men on the tape is there anything on the video that proves the footage comes from the montes finca asked lobo thats difficult to say now that the building has been completely gutted by fire have you had a report back from felipe and jorge about their findings not yet they probably stayed up in the sierra last night they were still working at seven oclock in the evening when i left the lab technicians here will be working their way through the first batch of evidence hopefully there will be some surviving fingerprints on i tried to call you last night said lobo i had my mobile switched off said falcón i was working on my other case rafael vega what progress there falcón gave his report on his meeting with mark flowers i think i should have a meeting with the american consul about that said lobo how does that leave you with your investigation asked elvira juez calderón gave me fortyeight hours my time is up im finished i have no suspects and unless sergei the gardener turns up i have no possible witnesses or leads said falcón what about this safedeposit box key you found in vegas house asked elvira it belongs to a box kept in the name of emilio cruz at the banco banesto juez calderón has not had time to supply a search warrant yet youll keep us informed when he does said elvira you might have to content yourself with the fact that rafael vega was a bad man who either punished himself or got what he deserved said lobo i expect juez calderón to terminate the case when i see him later this morning said falcón in terms of connecting ignacio ortega to the finca we have one final possibility with the two bodies buried on the property any thoughts about what happened there in the corner of one cell by the bed i found an inscription scratched into the wall in cyrillic script im having it translated i suspect that it has something to do with the large stain in the middle of the floor which i did not see until all contents were removed the stain is likely to be blood a sample of the concrete is being tested in the mattress of the same room i found a piece of glass i assume there was another piece which was used by the occupants of the cell to slash their wrists i suspect that these two bodies were suicides a local juez de instruction was being used at the crime scene at the finca i would suggest that a juez de instruction is appointed to oversee the case here as this is where all the evidence will be processed and will be where we hope to convict ignacio ortega that is being discussed with the juez decano de sevilla at the moment said elvira what do you intend to do now inspector jefe the obvious move is to establish a link to ignacio ortega by questioning one or more of the men on the video tape once hes confirmed as the central figure in this paedophile network we can bring him in and proceed in the direction of the russian mafiosi vladimir ivanov and mikhail zelenov said falcón i realize that the last element in that very ugly equation might be the most difficult to satisfy elviras drawn features eased away from the intensity of falcóns glare they both ended up looking at the darkening cumin complexion of lobos furious face for the moment inspector jefe he said in the light of what youve just told us about one of our senior officers involvement in this case i am going to ask you to do nothing and say nothing in the silence that followed that request which included a weighty admission the questions started stacking up in falcóns mind he couldnt ask a single one he said good morning and went to the desk to pick up the tapes best to leave those said lobo falcóns hand withdrew as if the wolf had snapped down in the outer office ramírez was sitting with his feet up smoking he put a finger to his lips nodded next door and mouthed the words virgilio guzmán i cant talk to you now virgilio said falcón walking behind guzmán and into his chair about what anything what about alfonso martinez and enrique altozano one is in intensive care the other has disappeared enrique altozano miraculously reappeared this morning said guzmán doesnt that sound like someone whos been told the coast is clear it can sound like anything to speculative minds all right said guzmán shall i tell you about miguel velasco i already know about him what do you know that he was in the chilean military thats a bit vague is it going to help me to know any more than that ill give you the short history and then you tell me said guzmán he was born in the son of a santiago butcher he was an alumnus of the catholic university and a member of patria y libertad his mother died in from a heart attack he joined the chilean military in after the coup he was transferred to the force that was eventually to become the dina in june his father who did not like allendes politics but also did not agree with the pinochet coup disappeared in october and was never seen again during his service with the dina he became one of the chief interrogators at the villa grimaldi and a close personal friend of the head of the dina colonel manuel contreras that note he held in his hand when he died i heard that it was an inscription on a cell wall in the villa grimaldi said falcón i was also told he was known by the mir as el salido perhaps you didnt hear about his work at the venda sexy said guzmán that was the name of a torture centre at calle iran in the quflu quarter of santiago de chile it was also known as la discoteca because loud music was heard coming from it day and night before miguel velasco was moved to the villa grimaldi he devised the techniques practised there he forced family members to watch and participate in taboo sexual acts such as incest and paedophilia sometimes he would encourage his fellow torturers to join in that helps explain things or rather not explain but tell me finish the biography virgilio he was an outstanding interrogator and from the villa grimaldi he was moved to one of the active cells in operation condor specializing in kidnappings interrogations and assassinations abroad in he was moved to the chilean embassy in stockholm where he headed covert operations against the chilean expatriate community he transferred back into the military in late and its believed that he received some cia training prior to developing a lucrative drugs for arms business that trade was exposed in and there followed a trial in which he acted as a witness for the prosecution in he was put into a witness protection programme from which he disappeared almost immediately stockholm asked falcón the swedish prime minister olaf palme was vociferous in his disgust at the pinochet regime in the days after september th the swedish ambassador in santiago harald edelstam ran around the capital extending asylum to anyone who was resisting the coup and so stockholm naturally became a centre for a european antipinochet movement a dinacni cell was set up there to run drugsmuggling operationsineurope and to spy on chilean expatriates interesting but none of it helps me any more said falcón that case is about to be closed i can sense some disappointment in you javier you can sense what you like virgilio ive got nothing to talk to you about people think im a bore because a lot of my sentences start with the phrase when i was working the death squads story said guzmán ramírez grunted his agreement from the outer office you must have learned a lot during that investigation i always managed to turn up in peoples offices at crucial times said guzmán call itzeitgeistor tapping into the collective unconscious do you believe in all that crap javier yes youve become monosyllabic javier its one of the first signs of what that i havent lost my sense of timing said guzmán what do you think the collective unconscious is im not in the mood virgilio where have i heard that before in your own bed ramírez shouted from the outer office have a go javier youre not going to talk your way in here said falcón pushing over a note with his home address and pm written on it do you know why i left madrid said guzmán ignoring the note i was pushed if you ask people why theyll tell you that id started to live in a hall of mirrors i didnt know what was real any more i was paranoid but the reality was that i was pushed because id become a zealot i got that way because the stories i would run with always had something that made me writhe with rage i couldnt control it id become the worst thing possible the emotional journalist we dont allow that in the police force either or we all start cracking up its an incurable disease said guzmán i know that now because when i read what velasco used to get up to in the venda sexy i hit that same whitehot vein of rage thats what he used to do to human beings not just torture them but fill them with his own appalling corruption and the next thing i know im back to thinking that was pinochet thats what pinochet thought of human beings and why was he there because nixon and kissinger wanted him there they would rather have someone who promoted the electrocution of genitals the raping of women the abuse of children than than what than a tubby bespectacled little marxist who was going to make life difficult for the rich now you see my problem javier i have become what my bosses used to call me my own worst enemy youre not allowed to feel youre only allowed to report the facts but you see its in that feeling that my instinct lies and it hasnt failed me because i know that the rage i felt when i found out about miguel velascos speciality guided me here this morning and its guided me here because it wants my nose to be in the door of the coverup as it slams shut guzmán snatched up the note kicked back his chair and stormed out ramírez loomed large in the doorway looking back at the vapour trail left by guzmán in the outer office hes going to do himself some harm if he carries on like that said ramírez is he right did you see me come back with anything asked falcón opening his hands to show no tapes lobos a good man said ramírez pointing a big finger at him he wont let us down lobos a good man in a different position said falcón you dont get to be jefe superior de la policía de sevilla unless people want you to be he has political pressure on his shoulders and he has a big mess in his own house left by alberto montes what about the bodies of those two kids up in the sierra de aracena theyve been seen everybody knows about them no one can hide that sort of thing if they were local kids then of course not but who are they said falcón theyve been dead a year the only piece of really usable evidence weve got from the house is the video tape and as lobo pointed out we cant even prove that what they were doing took place in montess finca our only chance is if were allowed to interview those people on the tape ramírez walked over to the window and put his hands up against the glass first of all we had to listen to nadia kouzmikhevas story and do nothing now were going to watch these cabrones walk away too nothing is certain we have the tape said ramírez after what montes has done we have to be very careful about the tape said falcón that is not something to proceed with lightly now im going out where to to do something that i hope will make me feel better about myself on the way out of the office he bumped into cristina ferrera who had been to see the russian translator about the inscription on the wall of the finca leave it on my desk said falcón i cant bear to look at it falcón drove across the river and along avenida del torneo as the road swung away from the river towards la macarena he turned right and into la alameda he parked and walked along calle jesus del gran poder this was pablo ortegas old barrio he was looking for a house on calle lumbreras which belonged to the parents of the boy manolo lopez who had been the victim in sebastián ortegas case he had not called ahead because he didnt think the parents would welcome this new intrusion especially given what hed heard about the fathers health problems he walked through the cooking smells of olive oil and garlic and up to the house where the boys parents lived it was a small apartment building in need of repair and paint he rang the doorbell sra lopez answered it and stared hard at his police id she didnt want him to come in but couldnt find the confidence to ask him to leave them alone the apartment was small airless and very hot sra lopez sat him down at a table with a lace cover and a bowl of plastic flowers and went to bring her husband the room was full of mariolatry virgins hung on walls found themselves cornered on bookshelves and blessed stacks of magazines a candle burned in a niche sra lopez steered her husband into the room as if he was a lame cow in need of milking he looked to be in his late forties but was very unsteady on his feet which made him seem older she got him into a chair one arm seemed to be dead hanging useless at his side he picked up falcóns id card with a shaky hand homicidios he said not on this occasion said falcón i wanted to talk to you about your sons kidnapping i cant talk about that he said and immediately started to get to his feet his wife helped him out of the room falcón watched the complicated process in a state of increasing desolation he cant talk about it she said coming back to the table he hasnt been the same since since since manolo disappeared no no it was afterwards it was after the trial that he lost his job his legs started to behave strangely they felt as if they had ants crawling all over them he became unsteady one hand started shaking the other arm seemed to give up now he does nothing all day he moves from here to the bedroom and back thats it but manolo is all right isnt he hes fine its as if it never happened hes on holiday camping with his nephews and cousins so you have much older children as well i had a boy and a girl when i was eighteen and nineteen and then twenty years later manolo came along did manolo have any reaction to what had happened to him not exactly to what happened to him said sra lopez hes always been a happy boy in himself he was more disturbed by what happened to sebastián ortega he finds it difficult to imagine him in prison so whats been bothering your husband said falcón he seems to be the one who has reacted badly he cant talk about it she said its something to do with what happened with manolo but i cant get him to say what it is is he ashamed thats not an unusual reaction for manolo he says not would you mind if i talk to him on his own you wont get anywhere i have some new information which might help him he said the last door to the left at the end of the corridor she said sr lopez was lying on the dark wooden bed under a crucifix a ceiling fan barely disturbed the thick stale air he had his eyes closed one hand twitched where it lay across his stomach the other lay dead by his side falcón touched him on the shoulder his eyes stared out from a frightened mind all you have to do is listen to me said falcón i am no mans judge ive come here to try to put things right thats all sr lopez blinked once as if this was a devised sign language investigations are strange things said falcón we set off on a journey to find out what happened only to find that more things happen on the way investigations have a life of their own we think we are running them but sometimes they run us when i heard what sebastián ortega had done it had nothing to do with the investigation i was working on but i was fascinated by it i was fascinated because in those cases its very rare for the victim to be allowed to leave and for him to bring the police to where the perpetrator is waiting to be arrested do you understand what im saying sr lopez he blinked once again falcón told him about the jefatura and how stories circulate and how hed heard about what had really happened in manolos case the demand for a stronger statement to help the prosecutions case was not an unusual occurrence that sebastián would not defend himself against the stronger statement was unforeseen and resulted in a much harsher sentence than the actual crime merited i have no idea what is playing on your mind sr lopez all i know is through no fault of your own and perhaps because of sebastiáns own mental problems an unnecessarily severe justice has been done i am here to tell you that if you so wish you can help balance the scales all you have to do is call me if i do not hear from you you will never see me again falcón left his card on the bedside table sr lopez lay on the bed staring up at the slow fan on the way out falcón said goodbye to sra lopez who took him to the door pablo ortega told me that he had to leave this barrio because nobody would talk to him any more or serve him in shops and bars said falcón as he stood on the landing why was that sra lopez she looked flustered and embarrassed her hands shifted about straightening her clothes she eased herself behind the door and shut it without answering his question in the flinching brightness of the street falcón took a call from juez calderón who wanted to see him about the vega case before he got back into his car he went into a bar on the alameda and ordered a cafe solo he showed his police id and asked the same question of the barman as he had of sra lopez he was an older guy who looked as if hed seen a few things in his time as a bar owner at the seedier end of the alameda we all knew sebastián he said and we liked him he was a good boy until he did wrong when he did what he did people started to talk about how abusers start out as the abused conclusions were drawn and it wasnt helped by the fact that nobody much liked pablo ortega he was an arrogant prick who thought the whole world loved him the sweat cooled quickly on falcóns body as he sat in calderóns office waiting for him to come back from another meeting as calderón took his seat it was clear that whatever had been troubling him over the past days had gone he was his usual solid self the certainty had returned falcón told him he was finished with the vega case that hed found out everything there was to know about him except whod killed him he gave calderón a compilation report on what hed learnt from mark flowers and virgilio guzmán have you checked this recording of marty krugman in the american consulate from the night of sr vegas death comisario lobo is going to talk the whole issue through with the consul said falcón i dont expect to hear whether that recording existed or not so you think marty krugman killed rafael vega i do said falcón and despite his wifes denial on monday night i think she drove him to kill reza sangari if he hadnt killed reza sangari you dont think hed have been able to kill rafael vega i dont think he was developing a taste for it but theres no doubt that hed been excited by the power he felt from his first experience said falcón and when he found out who vega really was whether by his own deduction or being told by mark flowers he felt he had the power to do it again i think he killed sangari passionately and vega intellectually and sra vega that was the problem krugman knew mario was staying at sra jiménezs house so he didnt have to worry about the boy he also knew that lucia vega was a heavy sleeper he and rafael had long discussions sometimes in vegas house and they never disturbed her but he didnt know that she took two sleeping tablets a night to knock herself out the second one at around three in the morning so when rafael vega went into his death agonies she probably came downstairs saw the horror and ran back up to the bedroom with krugman in pursuit thats why her jaw was broken she was screaming and he hit her then he had to kill her too which would explain why krugman was so unstable from the outset and all these threats from the russians perhaps they were just trying to discourage us from investigating too hard and finding out about their moneylaundering arrangements is that all asked calderón thats a bit heavy handed dont you think theyre heavyhanded people said falcón youre depressed javier and youre not thought falcón but he said i failed in the vega case i failed to prevent the krugmans from dying before my very eyes and yes well my psychologist tells me its bad to use the word fail with the first person singular so ill shut up ive heard rumblings said calderón its lunchtime tectonic rumblings coming from the jefatura said calderón heads will roll jobs will be lost pensions terminated because montes jumped out of his office window that was the start of it said calderón back to enjoying himself in the intrigue of the moment what about martinez and altozano falcón shrugged calderón could find out for himself why the russians were really threatening you know something javier dont you so do you he said oddly irritated by the familiarity i know the juez decano and the fiscal jefe had a meeting behind closed doors for one hour this morning and you dont often get them in the same building in the same room those rumblings you heard are the sound of the powers that control us closing ranks said falcón tell me said calderón were the blind the deaf and the dumb today esteban he said and got to his feet id still like that search warrant for vegas safedeposit box we might as well satisfy our curiosity ill have that ready for you this afternoon said calderón checking his watch joining him at the door ill walk down with you inés and i have got some shopping to do they went downstairs and through the bear pit of justice where people bowed and scraped to the young judge he was back in his element the horrors were off the horizon they went through security inés was on the other side falcón kissed her hello she put an arm around calderóns back and he pulled her to his chest kissed her on the head inés gave falcón a tinkling wave before she turned with a little back kick of her high heels and a big happy smile thrown over her shoulder her hair swung across her back like the girls in the shampoo ads falcón watched them go and tried to imagine what could have possibly passed between them since that fatal monday night and with that thought came the answer absolutely nothing they had clung to each other in the terror of their possible loneliness wished it all away and thrown their arms open to what life had been before was that the man that isabel cano had said was on the hunt for difference was that the woman whose stamp of approval falcón had thought he so desperately needed he watched them heading towards the city and a life of small hurtful destructions consuelo called asking to meet for lunch she sounded as she had done last night distant and preoccupied they agreed to meet at his home on calle bailén and he would do the cooking falcón bought food in the corte ingles on his way home he emptied his mind in the kitchen he sliced onions fried them slowly in olive oil until caramelized he boiled up potatoes and poured oloroso sherry over the onions and reduced it to a syrup he cleaned and seasoned the tuna made a salad he arranged the prawns with wedges of lemon and mayonnaise he drank chilled manzanilla and sat in the shade on the patio to wait for consuelo she arrived at two oclock as soon as he let her into the house he knew that something was wrong she was closed off shut in hed had this feeling from women before a sense that everything will be withheld until the air is cleared her mouth did not respond to his kiss her body kept its distance he felt the quickening plummet in his stomach of the lover who is about to be told something very kindly he led her to the kitchen as if they were condemned and this was their last meal they ate the prawns and drank manzanilla while he told her that the vega case was officially closed he got up to fry the tuna steaks he reheated the oloroso syrup and poured it over the fish he sat down with the pan between them unable to bear it any longer youve got tired of me already he said serving her a steak quite the opposite she said or is it my profession he said i know youve come here to tell me something because ive been told this sort of thing before youre right but its not because im tired of you she said is it because of what happened on sunday i can understand that i know how important your children are to you id have been ive learnt to recognize what i want javier she said shaking her head its taken me a lifetime but i have learned that valuable lesson not many people do said falcón serving himself a tuna steak which now looked banal on his plate i used to be a romantic youre talking to a woman who once fell in love with a duke remember even when i came down here i still entertained those romantic illusions once i had my children i realized i didnt need to fool myself any more they gave me all the love the real unconditional kind that i needed and i returned it doubled i had an affair to satisfy my physical needs you met him that idiot basilio lucena and you understood the relationship that we had it wasnt love it was much less complicated and manageable than that you dont have to let me down lightly said falcón you can just say i dont want to do this any more this is me being honest with a man for the first time in my life she said looking him straight in the eye i thought that what we had going between us was a good thing it felt right said falcón the emotion rising in his throat for the first time in my life it felt absolutely right it is a good thing but it is not what i want now you want to devote yourself to your children thats part of it she said the rest is me we have a good thing going now but it will change and i dont want the intensity the complications the responsibility but most of all and this is my failing i do not want the daily confrontation with my weakness your weakness i have weaknesses nobody sees them but they are there she said this is my big weakness you know everything about me every terrible thing because our relationship started in the terrible arena of a murder investigation but you dont know this i am hopeless in love and i cannot bear it how do you know if youve only had the illusion of it before because its already started she said she stood up the tuna untouched the sauce congealing on the plate she came round to his side of the table he tried to say things he wanted to talk her out of it she put her fingers on his lips she held his face ran her hand over his hair and kissed him he felt the wetness of her tears she pulled back squeezed his shoulder once and left the door slammed he looked at his plate there was nothing that could get past what he had growing in his throat he scraped the tuna into the bin looked at the brown smear left on the plate and then he hurled it against the wall chapter wednesday st july strange siesta sleep left falcón feeling oddly rested but with his brain sitting awkwardly in his head like a breech birth the mornings events drifted in his mind slow as river mist it had been so disastrous that a hysterical positivism staged a small rampage in his head he sat on the edge of the bed shaking his head dredging for laughs and an idea came to him which propelled him into the shower where it grew clearing his mind he drove to san bernardo hitting the steering wheel at odd intervals thinking that it wasnt finished between him and consuelo she wasnt going to drift away from him that easily there was still some talking to be done some persuading he went up to see carlos vázquez and caught sight of himself in the lift mirror there was a mad determination in him id like to speak to the russians said falcón walking into vázquezs office do you think you could arrange that for me i doubt it why not they wouldnt have anything to say to you inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios you could invite them over you know something to do with their projects and i could join you for the meeting that would not be possible charm them sr vázquez vega construcciones are no longer actively involved in their projects they have no reason to come and see me said vázquez they sold the buildings they sold them they were theirs to sell dont you think sr vázquez given their intricate involvement with your late client that it would have been judicious to have informed us i was told not to inform anybody except the third party in the sale but you didnt think that we deserved some notification under normal circumstances i would have told you said vázquez hands clasped knuckles white and what was so abnormal about these circumstances vázquez opened his desk drawer and took out an envelope i bought my children a dog last christmas a puppy they took it down to the coast with them for the holidays said vázquez they called me at the end of last week to say the dog had disappeared they were all in tears on monday morning i received a package sent from marbella which contained a dogs paw and this envelope falcón shook out the contents a single photo of vázquezs family sitting on the beach looking happy on the reverse side was a note theyre next what do you think of that for psychology inspector jefe falcón drove to the jefatura it occurred to him that since sunday there had been no more threats from the russians and now he knew why theyd accomplished what they set out to do theyd extricated themselves from the vega projects and his investigation was now officially over and their most criminal action had been the slaying of a childrens pet ramírez and ferrera sat in the office wordless whats going on asked falcón shouldnt you be down in the lab with felipe and jorge theyve been told to work behind closed doors and to only discuss their findings with comisario elvira said ramírez what about the razor blade i sent down there theyre not allowed to talk to us about anything and the arsonists theyre still with us said ramírez we dont know for how much longer in your absence i called elvira to ask if we should get them to write their statements he told me to do nothing and im an expert at that so here we are doing fuck all any calls lobo wants to see you and alicia aguado wants to know if youre going to be able to take her to the prison this evening its not over yet josé luis said falcón he took the lift up to lobos office on the top floor he called alicia aguado and arranged to pick her up he wasnt kept waiting by lobo who was now calm they sat and looked at each other as if there was some disastrous battle plan laid out between them which had resulted in the deaths of thousands the detective work by you and your squad has been excellent said lobo which flattery falcón took to be a bad sign you think so said falcón to me its been a remarkable catalogue of failures i have no killer for vega and a landscape littered with dead bodies youve cracked a major paedophile network i dont think i cracked it exactly ignacio ortega has been ahead of me all the way as is proven by the fact that i have nothing on him other than his installation of the airconditioning units in the finca and the late alberto montes has been tripping me up with his every action said falcón now ortega is laughing in my face and the russians are still out there free as birds to continue their trafficking of adults and children for sexual purposes ignacio ortega is finished hes a marked man nobody will go anywhere near him applause said falcón hes still living in his comfortable house running his successful business hell keep his head down for a few years and then because of the nature of his particular obsession hell be back that sort of person has a compulsion to desecrate innocence and its no less strong than the serial killers compulsion to feel fresh bodies struggling for life in his hands and i dont need to tell you comisario that ignacio ortega is just one little link that weve managed to temporarily cut the big monster the russian mafia is still out there spreading its tentacles over the whole of europe despite what the public relations section of your mind is telling you this is one of our most significant failures and its a failure that is being perpetrated by the very administration who are supposed to be supporting us i might as well tell you that montess wife was caught retrieving a box from a storage warehouse which contained one hundred and eighty thousand euros said lobo but were satisfied from the interviews weve conducted so far that he was acting alone more applause said falcón what are we going to say to the stunned population of almonaster la real about the two bodies the boy and the girl found dead at the finca whats going to happen to the four men on the tape whats going to happen to the other children felipe and jorge will make a full report of their findings said lobo methodically and that will form a part as will every aspect of your investigation of a file which comisario elvira will present to me we are already conducting an internal investigation within the jefatura weve named the fourth man on the tape everything has been documented and therell be a reading of it in the andalucían parliament silence and all these people will appear in court the reason why we have an organized society and not chaotic anarchy is that people believe in our institutions said lobo when franco died in what happened to all his institutions what happened to the guardia civil you cant tear them apart and throw them all out for the simple reason that they are the only people who know how to run things so what do you do you curb their powers you control their recruitment you change the institution from the inside out thats why people believe in us now thats why they no longer fear us thats why the guardia civil no longer operates as a secret police force talk to virgilio guzmán about that said falcón the point is that nobody from this case is going to face justice not because they dont deserve to but because our institution has dirty linen and the administration that controls us is using that because theirs is even dirtier theyre all marked men said lobo youll see people will lose their power have contracts taken away from them lose their status they will suffer they might not realize their ambitions which will be their little tragedy said falcón but theyll remain at liberty which will be ours so you believe that we should expose everybody reveal the corruption within yes said falcón and start again all those years as a cop and youve learnt nothing about human nature said lobo how long will it be before the russian mafia starts working on the next generation im having my say comisario thats all said falcón feeling that weakness coming back into his arms you know javier this is not something peculiar to spain said lobo its happening all over the world weve just had the cia on our doorstep and what were they doing preserving their institutions maintaining the dignity of office of the president of the united states and the secretary of state is that what the consul told you in so many words said lobo so you didnt see the recording that flowers said proved krugmans innocence the consul confirmed that it existed such trust between institutional powers said falcón you didnt see that recording because there isnt one flowers gave krugman an alibi because it was probably his decision to end the uncertainty about what secrets vega was holding the man had become too unstable to predict i think krugman killed him when flowers gave him the mans real identity and lets have a moments silence for the forgotten lucia he also had to kill his completely innocent wife i cannot call the integrity of the us consul into question to his face javier said lobo annoyed now i know these things comisario im naive in the workings of power but not totally inexperienced but every time something like this happens and lets remember the financial impropriety of your predecessor which put you in the exalted office you hold now every time something like this happens a little of that dirt rubs off on me i scrub and i scrub but theres always that understain showing through i start thinking ill have to get back into my suits just to give myself the illusion that good can still prevail we need men like you and inspector ramírez javier said lobo dont be in any doubt about that do you im not so sure the tools of the good are so pathetic and predictable when compared to those of the bad said falcón if were these dirty people with a deep understanding of ingrained dirt from our years working in these corrupted institutions maybe we should learn something from that all this firsthand knowledge of the forces of darkness should not go to waste well that is a dangerous path to tread said lobo back in the office ramírez and ferrera looked up for the chink of hope falcón stood before them and opened his hands to show the emptiness within he went into his office there was a small piece of paper in the middle of his desk on which he knew was written the translation of the inscription found at the finca he put his hands on either side of it and braced himself to read it im sorry mummy but we cannot do this any more he left the office without a word and went to pick up alicia aguado he was glad to be with her she was happy and looking forward to her next session with sebastián she was pleased by his progress pablos death had released him from his past and he was revealing things in days that would normally have taken months to extract when they arrived in the observation cell it was obvious that sebastián was glad to see her he sat and bared his wrist impatient falcón could hardly concentrate on their discussion his conversation with lobo was still spiralling through his mind and forming a triple helix with ignacio ortega and the russians every avenue of contact to the russians had been cut vega montes and krugman were all dead and vázquez paralysed with fear the only way left was the darkest path of all through ignacio ortega and that was where the three strands of his triple helix met lobos last words to him some intensity from the observation cell broke through to him and he concentrated on the dialogue for a moment how old were you asked aguado i was fifteen it wasnt an easy time for me school was difficult my home life was constantly disrupted i was unhappy tell me how it came out we were driving to huelva he was appearing in a play there and we were going to carry on to tavira in portugal and spend the weekend on the beach why did you choose that moment i didnt choose it i got angry with him i got angry with him telling me what a wonderful guy his brother was how considerate he was how helpful my father was useless at running his finances and ignacio was constantly helping him out he also sent electricians and plumbers around to the house to do repairs he even rewired the house free of charge it was nothing to ignacio it didnt cost him anything he put it all through his company but my father thought he was a great guy for doing all this he didnt see what ignacio was up to he didnt see how much his brother loathed him how much he despised him for his talent and his fame so in one of these moments when pablo was polishing away at his brothers gilded image i told him can you remember your exact words i remember everything as if it just happened said sebastián i said you know when you used to go away on tour and you left me with your brother and my father turned to me and smiled and his face was full of love for what he was about to hear another wonderful thing about ignacio it was so pathetic i nearly couldnt bring myself to say it but my anger got the better of me and i rammed it home i said he used to sexually abuse me every night he lost control of the car it came off the road and we ended up in a ditch he started hitting me slapping me around the head and face so i opened the window and clambered out into the ditch he came after me heaving open his own door like a man coming out of a tank the thing about my father was that you never knew when he was acting he could do anger and turn around and do love but that afternoon there was no mistaking his rage he caught up with me in the field by the road he grabbed me by the hair and swung me around he slapped me about the face and head with the front and back of his massive hands until i was a ragdoll he pulled my face up to his and i saw his sweat and his teeth and his lips stretched white and the smell of his breath as he forced me to take back my words he made me say to him that i had lied he made me beg for his forgiveness and when i did he gave it to me and said that we would never speak about this day ever again and we didnt we never really spoke to each other again after that day do you think he talked to ignacio about it im sure he didnt i would have known about it ignacio would have come after me to frighten me back into silence they sat quietly for a moment alicia weighed the enormity of that day in her mind falcón sat outside remembering the dream pablo had told him and his subsequent collapse on the lawn he could see the thoughts in alicias twitching unseeing eyes was this the right time what should my next question be what question will unlock the reasoning behind sebastiáns extreme action have you been thinking over the past few days why your father killed himself she asked yes i have ive thought very hard about his note to me said sebastián my father loved words he loved to talk and write he liked his own voice he liked to be verbose but in that letter he reduced himself to one line silence sebastiáns head trembled on his neck and what did that line mean to you it meant that he believed me and why do you think hed come to that conclusion before i was convicted my father had reached a point in his life when he never questioned himself whether it was to do with his belief in his own brilliance or the sycophants around him i dont know but he never thought that he might be wrong or have made a mistake until i was arrested once they put me in here i refused to see him so i cant be sure but i think that was when doubt started to creep into his mind he had to leave the barrio said alicia he was ostracized they didnt much like him in the barrio he thought they all loved him in the same way that all his audiences loved him but he never bothered with any of them as individual people they were just there for the further glorification of pablo ortega that must have given him reason to doubt that and the fact that his work was drying up gave him reason to start living in his own head more and as i know if you do that you come across all sorts of doubts and fears and they grow large in your loneliness he probably spoke to salvador too he wasnt a bad man my father he took pity on salvador and helped him with money for his drugs i doubt salvador would have told him straight because of the force of my fathers personality and his own fear of ignacio but once there was doubt in his mind he might have started to pick up on things and when they were added to his doubts he might have found the answer to that horrible equation in his head which was the sum of all his fears it must have been devastating for him but dont you think that this was an incredibly drastic action on your part to put yourself in here you dont think i did this just to get my fathers attention do you i dont know why you did this sebastián he took his wrist away from her and covered his head with his arms he rocked to and fro on his chair for several minutes perhaps weve had enough for today she said finding his shoulder he calmed down disentangled himself held out his wrist again i was scared of what i had growing in my own mind he said lets take this up tomorrow said alicia aguado no id like to try and get this out he said putting her fingers to his wrist id read somewhere i couldnt help reading this sort of thing the newspapers are full of stories of child abuse and my eyes used to close in on every story because i knew they were relevant to me i extracted things from these stories which created doubt in me and i began to find a corner of myself that i could no longer trust it grew from there until it became a certainty in my head only a matter of time before before i think this is too much for you today sebastián she said youre driving your mind too hard please let me get this out he said just this one thing what did you extract from these stories said alicia aguado just tell me that yes yes that was the beginning of it he said what i saw in these stories that was relevant to me was that the abused become abusers themselves when i first read that i didnt think it could be possible that i could end up with the same sly little look that uncle ignacio had when he sat on my bed at night but when youre lonely doubt creates more doubt and i really began to think that it could be something that might happen to me that i wouldnt be able to control it already i found that kids liked me and i liked them i loved to share in their innocence i loved to be with them in their unconscious world no past horrors no future worries just the glorious unravelling present and the thought grew that eventually i might do something unspeakable and i lived in constant fear of it and then one day i couldnt bear it any longer and i thought that i would just do it when the moment came though i couldnt but it didnt matter any more because the fear inside me was already so great i let him go manolo and while i waited for the police to come i found myself praying for them to put me in a cell and throw away the key but you couldnt do it sebastián she said you didnt do it my fear was not telling me that my fear was telling me that eventually it would happen but what did you feel when you faced the reality of your intention i felt nothing but revulsion i felt that this would be a very wrong unnatural and cruel thing to do falcón dropped alicia back in calle vidrio and continued home he went to his study with a bottle and a glass full of ice the whisky tasted good after the day hed had he sat in his study with his feet up on the desk thinking about the man hed been only twelve hours ago he wasnt depressed which surprised him he felt oddly solid connected and determined and he realized that anger was holding him together he wanted to get consuelo back and he wanted to bury ignacio ortega virgilio guzmán arrived punctually at pm falcón poured him a whisky and they sat in the study after the mornings outburst hed expected guzmán to come in hard about the coverup hed smelt in the jefatura but he seemed more interested in talking about his holiday in mallorca which was coming up in a weeks time whats happened to the crusading journalist who stormed out of my office this morning asked falcón drugs said guzmán the whole reason i left madrid was to come down here and lead a more relaxed lifestyle i get a whiff of that story and i go mad my blood pressure went through the roof now im on tranquillizers and you know lifes really quite nice when it comes to you filtered does that mean youre dropping the story doctors orders they sat in silence while falcón tested that for veracity did someone talk to you virgilio its a very closeknit community down here said guzmán the papers not going to run with it unless somebody else cracks it open first and you know something javier i dont give a shit thats drugs for you how about giving me some advice as an impartial observer dont make me drink too much whisky he said it doesnt mix with the drugs falcón told him everything about the coverup the montes finca the dead bodies up in the sierra the arsonists the tape both the original and the copy upstairs guzmán listened and nodded throughout as if this was stuff that came to his ears every day what do you want from all this said guzmán whats your minimum requirement to put ignacio ortega away for a very long time thats understandable he sounds like a very nasty piece of work do you think im being too narrowminded said falcón should i be gunning for our hallowed institutions thats the whisky talking said guzmán you havent got a chance concentrate on ortega he seems to be well protected by his connections so how do you weaken that protection to get at him i dont know well thats your training youre trained to think within the limits of the law said guzmán putting down his empty whisky glass im going now before its too late and youre not going to tell me it wouldnt be right for me to tell you i dont want that responsibility said guzmán the answers in front of you but i dont want to be the one to infect your mind chapter thursday st august bad night asked ramírez looking out over the jefatura car park bad dreams bad night said falcón i lay awake fantasizing about nailing the russians tell me i thought id go to ignacio ortega and ask to be put on the russian payroll tell him i liked the look of the hundred and eighty thousand euros sra montes was caught with was it that much thats what lobo told me said falcón i could spin ortega some line that i could be the guy running the grupo de menores while they find a suitable replacement for montes that would never happen for a start said ramírez then id persuade him to set up a meeting with the russians and hed believe you well no but hed do it anyway and then id find out where the meeting was to take place and secretly let you know im not even sure that this fantasy is bmovie quality the meeting would take place in a garage in the middle of nowhere id be with ortega wed be sitting around an oil drum waiting for the russians wed hear a car coming from some way off then ivanov and zelenov would arrive theyd give me a very ugly interview in which it was clear they didnt believe a word i was saying and just when theyd got to the point of laughing at me the garage door would crack open and youd come in and blow them all away my kids could think of something better than that maybe instead of you coming in blasting away we could think of something more subtle the garage door would still crack open it always does that but youd only cover them with your gun id disarm them then the shutter to the main entrance of the garage would roll up and there would be police cars with flashing lights thats another thing that always happens one of the police cars would reverse in the russians would be cuffed and as they were being put into the car they would turn to see us slapping ortega on the back shaking his hand and theyd think that theyd been served up by the time they reached the jefatura the defence lawyer would already be there the same one from the tape in montess finca theyd be out in four hours then cut to ortegas house ignacio sitting at his desk listening to julio iglesias on his perfect sound system eyes closed until an alien sound opens them and the horror two silenced shots blood flowers on his white shirt and his face is ruined the audience would be drinking beers before the credits rolled said ramírez ferrera put her head round the door to say good morning lets have a talk said falcón ferrera backed into the outer office ramírez went to close the door you too policía ferrera said falcón and ramírez narrowed his eyes at him close the door behind you they sat around the desk were the voices of experience here said falcón and you policía ferrera are the voice of morality is that in my role as exnun youre in said ramírez thats all that matters so shut up and listen i think youve realized by now that theres a cover up going on said falcón the crimes committed at the montes finca are being covered up from both ends because of montess involvement the jefatura is vulnerable to attack from the politicians there is fear amongst our masters that a major scandal involving a number of figures from public life may cause a collapse of faith and they are determined to maintain the dignity and integrity of their institutions the three of us know that what went on in the montes finca was wrong and that the perpetrators should face justice and public shaming comisario lobo has told me that everything that has happened at the finca will be documented he has been unable to guarantee that any of it will be heard he has only been able to assuage my sense of outrage by assuring me that no one involved in what went on in that finca will get away scot free they will suffer loss of position status and wealth im crying for them already said ramírez what about the media virgilio guzmán said they wouldnt touch it unless somebody else broke the story first said falcón hes ill and has had to go on medication what did i tell you about that guy said ramírez the russians are untouchable theyve pulled their money out of the vega projects theyve threatened vázquezs family our only access to them is through ignacio ortega and he isnt about to pass on our card we have no physical evidence even of their money laundering operations which is presentable in court we couldnt justify arresting them even if we could get to them what chance have we got of taking ortega down asked ramírez he is protected thats how he survives as weve seen from his secret filming in the finca he has the dirt on everybody thats why weve been cut off from all forensic information and everything has to be directed through comisario elvira all we have now is the tape what tape asked ferrera the arsonists stole a television and video from the finca before they torched it the video recorder was loaded with a tape which shows four men having sex with minors said falcón the original is with elvira we have retained a copy what about the madrid newspapers asked ramírez thats a possibility but we would have to give them the whole story and it would all have to be backed up with information we dont have access to there would be no question of anonymity we would be seen as having broken ranks with the jefatura and wed be out on our own probably facing the end of our careers theres also a lot thats unpredictable in using the media even our own here you put people with their backs to the wall and they will fight dirty we could all end up getting hurt your families too and we still might not get the result were looking for lets send a copy each to their wives and get on with our lives said ramírez but we still wouldnt take ortega down said falcón silence for some time broken only by the metronome of ramírezs huge finger thumping up and down on the edge of the desk something that would give me a lot of pleasure said ramírez looking up at the ceiling as if for divine inspiration would be to give my old friend from the barrio a private showing of his part of the tape that would mean id get to see his face and then i would tell him that there was nothing i could do about it but that he could have words with ignacio ortega words asked falcón hed kill him said ramírez i know that guy he would not let anybody live with that kind of hold over him silence again cristina ferrera looked up to find both mens eyes fixed on her youre not serious are you she said and then i could arrest him for murder said ramírez i cant believe youre even asking me to contemplate thinking about such a thing said ferrera if you are serious you dont need a moral guide you need a full transplant falcón laughed ramírez joined in with a loud guffaw relief spread across ferreras face from the small nose outwards well nobody can say we didnt consider every possibility said falcón im going back to the computer she said and left closing the door behind her were you being serious asked ramírez leaning over the desk falcón didnt move a muscle in his face joder said ramírez that would have been something the phone rang very loudly startling both men falcón snatched it to his ear he listened carefully while ramírez rolled an unlit cigarette in his fingers youve made a very courageous decision sr lopez said falcón and put the phone down some good news at last said ramírez putting the cigarette into his mouth that was the father of the boy who was supposedly abused by sebastián ortega the boy manolo is on his way back to seville now hes going to come straight to the jefatura and give a revised and completely true account of what happened thats not going to be much of a wedding present for juez calderón but you know what that means dont you josé luis the unlit cigarette dropped into ramírezs lap the phone rang again this time it was juez calderón confirming that he now had a signed search warrant for vegas safedeposit box held in the name of emilio cruz at the banco banesto falcón picked up the box key and the two men left for the edificio de los juzgados on the way out he told ferrera that manolo lopez was going to arrive with his mother to make a revised video statement and that he wanted her to read the ortega file prepare the questions and interview him they drove to the edificio de los juzgados calderóns secretary gave ramírez the search warrant they continued to the banco banesto and asked to see the manager they showed their ids and the warrant and were taken down into the vault falcón signed himself in and the manager accompanied them to the boxes she inserted her key turned it once and left them to it falcón used his key and they pulled out the stainless steelcovered box which they put on a table in the middle of the room on top of the papers in the box was an old spanish passport and some travel tickets the passport was issued in and the photograph was of rafael vega but it was in the name of oscar marcos the tickets were held together by a paper clip and they were in date order the first trip was from seville to madrid on th january and then back to seville on th january the next trip took place on th february and was by train from seville to madrid to barcelona and finally paris on th february there was a train ticket from paris to frankfurt and on to hamburg on th february he went from there to copenhagen and on th february he crossed into sweden and went up to stockholm the return trip started on st march and was from oslo to london by air three days were spent in london and then he flew to madrid and took the train to seville this stuff said ramírez who was going through the papers underneath must be in code because they read like a childs letters to his father falcón called virgilio guzmán and asked him if he could come to his house on calle bailén immediately they emptied the safedeposit box and put the contents into a large evidence bag falcón told the manager the box was now empty gave her a receipt and returned the key they drove to calle bailén and falcón read the letters while they waited for virgilio guzmán each letter had its envelope clipped to it they were all posted from america to the postbox address in the name of emilio cruz the letters made sense individually but not as a whole guzmán arrived he sat at the desk with the papers he looked through the passport and then checked through the travel tickets end of february stockholm sweden he said do you know what happened then no idea on th february the prime minister olaf palme was shot as he came out of the cinema with his wife said guzmán the assassin was never found what about all those letters asked ramírez ive got somebody who can help me with decoding them but i imagine they were his instructions for one last operation for his old friend manuel contreras said guzmán he had the perfect cover he was fully trained it was the kind of thing they did in operation condor all the time no possible trail back to the pinochet regime and one painful thorn is finally removed from the presidents hide its perfect so why would he keep all this stuff i dont know except that killing the prime minister of a european country is no small thing and perhaps he might have felt the need for a bit of security in case things changed later on like now said falcón the pinochet regime is finished manuel contreras is in jail having been betrayed by his old friend the general said guzmán and vega thinks its time to even the score show what the pinochet regime was capable of said falcón its the strategy of no return you might put pinochet away but you finish yourself as well and thats what he did said guzmán he died with that note in his hand you did what he wanted you to do by investigating the crime you found his safedeposit box key and now his secret will be revealed to the world they photocopied all the letters from the safedeposit box and guzmán took them off to his codebreaking friend who he revealed was an exdina man now living in madrid know thine enemy said guzmán explaining the relationship ill scan these into the computer email them up to him and hell read them like a book ill have an answer for you by this afternoon falcón and ramírez returned to the jefatura in time to meet sra lopez and manolo who was already at work on his video interview and enjoying cristina ferreras company by one oclock the boy had finished and falcón called alicia aguado he played the statement to her over the phone and she agreed to put it to sebastián ortega ferrera took a patrol car to the poligono san pablo to find salvador ortega while falcón drove alicia aguado to the prison they showed sebastián manolos video interview and he broke down he then wrote his own fifteenpage statement detailing five years of abuse at the hands of ignacio ortega ferrera called to say that salvador was now at the jefatura falcón faxed sebastiáns statement through for salvador to read salvador asked for a meeting with sebastián ferrera drove him out to the prison and he and sebastián talked for over two hours after which salvador agreed to write his own statement he also gave falcón a list of seven names of other children now adults whod suffered at his fathers hands at five oclock falcón was eating a chorizo bocadillo and drinking a nonalcoholic beer when virgilio guzmán called saying that hed had the letters decoded and he wanted to email him the translations they proved to be a series of instructions to vega where and when to go and pick up his passport in madrid the route he should take to stockholm intelligence on the movements and nonexistent security of olaf palme where to go in stockholm to pick up the weapon where to dispose of the weapon after the hit and finally his return route to seville im running with this story in tomorrows paper said guzmán i didnt expect you to do anything else virgilio said falcón its only going to hurt people who deserve to be hurt by six oclock in the evening falcón had a dossier with the revised video statement from manolo lpez and the two from sebastián and salvador and what happens if they block you on this said ramírez as he left the office then youll be the new inspector jefe del grupo de homicidios josé luis not me said ramírez tell them theyll have to look to subinspector perez when he gets back from holiday as well as the three statements he took the contents of vegas safedeposit box and printed out the decodes of the letters from guzmáns email he went up to see comisario elvira who was again in a meeting with comisario lobo they didnt keep him waiting falcón talked them through the contents of the safe deposit box and read out the pertinent decodes which contained the assassination instructions and the target the two men sat in stunned silence and who would have known about this apart from the obvious people in the regime asked lobo i mean do you think the americans knew anything about it they knew something about vega said falcón whether they knew any or part of this detail i have no idea but i doubt it i now believe flowers when he said that they didnt know what they were looking for they were just hoping that it was nothing that would reflect badly on them or the administration of the time do you think the americans could have been involved in killing vega or are you satisfied that he was either murdered by marty krugman or committed suicide mark flowers has given me an enormous amount of information the only problem is that i dont know whats true and what isnt said falcón theres a part of me that believes that they werent involved in his murder because this is what they wanted to find out the contents of the safedeposit box which they never found but i also think that flowers might have decided to stop the uncertainty and been a party to taking vega out case closed said elvira falcón shrugged what else said lobo eyeing the dossier on falcóns lap he handed it over as lobo read each page he handed it to elvira both men glanced up nervously as they worked through the catalogue of abuse when they finished lobo was looking out across the park as he used to do when he occupied this office he talked to the glass i can guess he said but id like you to tell me what you want my minimum requirement from all the crimes that were committed in the montes finca was that ignacio ortega should go down said falcón that was not possible i dont agree with it but i understand why this is a separate case nothing that happened in the montes finca will surface in this family abuse case i want a juez de instruction to be appointed not juez calderón of course i want to arrest ignacio ortega and i want him to face these charges and any others we might be able to bring after talking to those on the list of names supplied by salvador ortega were going to have to discuss this and get back to you said lobo i dont want to put any undue pressure on your discussion but i do want to remind you what you said to me in your office yesterday remind me you said we need men like you and inspector ramírez javier dont be in any doubt about that i see inspector ramírez and i would like to make the arrest tonight said falcón and left he sat alone in his office aware of ramírez and ferrera waiting for news the phone rang he heard them jump it was isabel cano asking if she could have a response to the letter shed drafted to send to manuela about the house on calle bailén he said he hadnt read it but it didnt matter because hed decided that if manuela wanted to live in the house she was going to have to pay the market value less the agency commission and there would be no discussion on the matter whats happened to you she asked ive hardened inside isabel the blood now rifles down my cold steel veins said falcón did you ever hear about the sebastián ortega case hes pablo ortegas son isnt he the one who kidnapped the boy thats right said falcón how would you like to handle his appeal any strong new evidence yes said falcón but i should warn you that it might not make esteban calderón look very good its about time he learnt a bit of humility she said ill take a look falcón hung up and sank back into the silence youre confident said ramírez from the outer office we are men of value josé luis the phone went in the outer office this time ramírez snatched it to his ear silence thank you said ramírez he hung up falcón waited josé luis he said there was no sound he went to the door ramírez looked up his face was wet with tears his mouth drawn back tight across his teeth as he fought the emotion he waved his hand at falcón he couldnt speak his daughter said ferrera the sevillano nodded thumbed the huge tears out of his eyes shes all right he said under his breath theyve done every test in the book and they cant find anything wrong with her they think its some kind of virus he slumped in his chair still squeezing fat tears out of his eyes you know what said falcón i think its time to go and have a beer the three of them drove down to the bar la jota and stood in the cavernous cool and drank beers and ate strips of salt cod other police officers came along and tried to strike up conversation but didnt get very far they were too tense the time clipped round to pm and falcóns mobile started vibrating against his thigh he put it to his ear youre all clear to arrest ignacio ortega on those charges said elvira juan romero has been appointed the juez de instruction good luck they went back to the jefatura because falcón wanted to make the arrest in a patrol car with flashing lights to let ortegas neighbourhood know ferrera drove and they parked outside a large house in el porvenir which as sebastián had described had gate posts topped with concrete lions ferrera stayed in the car ramírez rang the bell which had the same electronic cathedral chime as vegas ortega came to the door they showed him their police ids he looked over their shoulders at the parked patrol car lights flashing wed like to come in for a moment said ramírez unless youd rather do this in the street they stepped into the house which did not have the usual headache chill of fierce air conditioning but was completely comfortable this air conditioning started ramírez this isnt air conditioning inspector said ortega you are now in a stateoftheart climatecontrol system then it should be raining in your study sr ortega can i offer you a drink inspector asked ortega mystified i dont think so said ramírez we wont be staying long you inspector jefe a single malt i even have laphroaig falcón blinked at that it was a whisky that francisco falcón had favoured there was still a lot of it in his house undrunk his own tastes were not so eclectic he shook his head do you mind if i drink alone asked ortega its your house said ramírez you dont have to be polite for our sakes ortega poured himself a cheap whisky over ice he raised his glass to the policemen it was good to see him nervous he picked up a fat remote with which he controlled his climate and started to explain the intricacies of the system to ramírez who butted in were bad losers sr ortega he said im sorry said ortega were very bad losers said ramírez we dont like it when we see all our good work go to waste i can understand that said ortega covering his nervousness at ramírezs looming aggressive presence what do you understand sr ortega asked falcón your work must be very frustrating at times why would you think that asked falcón now that hed caught their tone and found it unpleasant ortega turned ugly himself he looked at them as if they were pathetic specimens of humanity people to be pitied the justice system is not in my hands he said its not up to me to decide which cases go to court and which dont ramírez snatched the remote from ortegas hands looked at the myriad buttons and tossed it on to the sofa what about those two kids that we found buried up at the finca near almonaster la real said ramírez what about them falcón was appalled to see a little smile creep into ortegas face now he knew what this was about now he knew that he was safe now he was going to enjoy himself what about them asked ortega mildly how did they die sr ortega said ramírez we know we cant touch you for any of that stuff but as i said were bad losers and wed like you to tell us that one thing i dont know what youre talking about inspector we can guess what happened said falcón but wed like to have it confirmed how and when they died and who buried them there are no traps said ramírez holding his hands open youre well clear of any traps arent you sr ortega id like you to leave now thank you very much he said and turned his back on them were going just as soon as youve told us what we want to hear youve got absolutely no right to barge your way you invited us in sr ortega said falcón go and complain to your friends in high places when weve gone said ramírez you could probably have us demoted suspended without pay thrown off the force with all the contacts youve got leave said ortega turning on them snarling tell us how and when they died said falcón were not going until you do said ramírez cheerfully they committed suicide said ortega how the boy strangled the girl and then slashed his wrists with a piece of broken glass when eight months ago which was about the time that inspector jefe montes started to drink even more than he was already said ramírez who buried them somebody was sent over to do that i imagine theyre good at digging holes said ramírez russian peasants when was the last time you dug a hole ramírez had gone up close to ortega now he grabbed his hand it was soft he looked into his face i thought not no conscience at all but maybe that will change in time he said i told you what you wanted to know said ortega now its time for you to leave were going now said falcón ramírez took a pair of handcuffs out of his pocket he cuffed the wrist of the hand he was still holding falcón removed the whisky glass from the other ramírez joined them behind ortegas back and clapped him on the shoulders youre both finished said ortega you know that were placing you under arrest said falcón for the repeated sexual abuse of your son salvador ortega and your nephew sebastián ortega ortegas smiling face stopped falcón mid sentence you seriously think a heroin addict and someone whos been convicted of kidnapping and abusing a young boy have any chance of putting me away said ortega things have changed said falcón as ramírez put a huge hand on top of ortegas head the reason we wanted the boy and girl up at the finca to be prominent in your mind was so that youd know that youve just been touched by vanished hands coda falcón sat outside la bodega de la albariza on calle bétis with a beer and a tapa of fried fresh anchovies it was cooler today there were a lot of people down by the river hed given up on his usual spot in the centre of the puente de isabel ii it reminded him too much of bad times and intrusive photographers the river was no longer some stygian limbo of hand wringing strangers but as it always had been the life force of the city now he sat with people at tables eating and drinking watching couples of all ages kissing as they strolled in the sunshine at joggers and cyclists as they pushed themselves along the tow path on the opposite bank the waiter stopped by and asked him if he wanted anything else he ordered another beer and a plate of chipirones baby squid there were two things from that last torrid week in july that just wouldnt leave him alone the first was rafael vega and his son mario and his answer to calderóns question what couldnt you bear your son knowing about you he remembered the pity hed felt for mario as he was swept away into his new family and he wanted the boy to know not now but eventually just one thing about his monstrous father he wanted him to know that rafael vega had been returned to humanity by love and loss hed faced his conscience and been tormented by it hed died wanting some good to come out of his appalling life how would mario ever know that the second thing that he could not shake off and didnt want to was what had happened between him and consuelo shed left him and gone away to the coast to be with her children hed tried to find out where she was from the restaurant managers but they were under strict instructions to inform nobody her mobile was never switched on he heard nothing back from the messages he left on her answering machine he dreamed about her saw her in the street and ran across squares to grab the arms of shocked strangers he lived with her in his head longed for the smell of her the touch of her cheek on his the sight of his empty chair opposite hers in a restaurant the waiter brought the chipirones and the beer he squeezed the lemon over the squid and reached for his beading glass the coldness of the beer brought tears to his eyes he nodded to a girl who asked if she could take one of his chairs he sat back and let the high palms of the seville skyline blur in his vision tomorrow was the first day of september he was going to morocco in a few days time marrakesh he was happy his mobile vibrated on his thigh he nearly couldnt be bothered to answer it in the languor of the afternoon robert wilson
