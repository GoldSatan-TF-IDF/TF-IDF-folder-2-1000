admirals daughter chapter nicholas renzi nodded to the man sharing with him the warmth of the log fire at the angel postinghouse and regarding his deep tan with suspicion it was not an attribute often seen in england after a hard winter renzi was newly returned from tumultuous experiences on the other side of the world that had left him questioning his reason he had sailed to new south wales as a free settler determined to forge a new life there but it was not to be and now in just a little while he would see cecilia the ship that had brought him home had docked three days ago and having signed off on the voyage he and thomas kydd had made for guildford it had been cowardly of him renzi acknowledged to have asked his friend to arrive first to prepare his sister for their sudden reappearance cecilia had nursed him through a deadly fever and touched his heart but such was his respect for her that he had vowed to achieve something in the world before he made his feelings known to her and had left without a word he had laboured long and hard to try to create an arcadia of his small landholding for cecilia in that raw land eventually kydd had rescued him he had suggested that renzi make use of his education by devoting himself to the elucidation of natural philosophy from a new standpoint where rousseau and his peers had pontificated from the comforts of rarefied academia renzis studies would be rooted in the harsh reality of the wider world which he had encountered at first hand in places as varied as the caribbean and the vast south seas the sylvan quiet of wiltshire and the alien starkness of terra australis he would distil his observations and experiences into a series of volumes on the extraordinary variety of human response to the imperatives of hunger and aggression religion and securityall the threats and challenges that were the lot of man on earth that would be an achievement indeed to lay before cecilia and it must be confessed it was a prospect most congenial to himself this he would owe to kydd who had said he would employ his friend as secretary aboard whichever ship kydd might captain for renzi performing this rolemore of a clerk than anything was a small price to pay for the freedom it bestowed on him he had learned the tricks in spanish town long ago and knew that his duties would not be onerous he had never set store by the petty vanities of rank and was glad to withdraw discreetly from the hurlyburly of tasking and discipline to be found on deck above all he and kydd old friends would continue to adventure together a boy brought the other mans pot of flip beer spiked with rum and looked doubtfully at renzi who shook his head and stared into the fire it was all very well to have found for himself an agreeable position but the wider world was now filled with menace the recently concluded hostilities had ended with the worst possible consequences prime minister william pitt had been replaced by henry addington whose panicked response to the spiralling cost of the revolutionary war was to trade away all of englands hardwon conquests round the world for peace at any price and napoleon bonaparte now squarely atop the pyramid of power in france was energetically accruing the means to succeed in his greater goal world dominance the king had recently delivered an unprecedented personal message to parliament in tones of bleak urgency he had pointed to the first consuls naked aggression since the peacehis occupation of switzerland his annexation of savoy and more there was little doubt now that addingtons gamble of appeasement had failed and that england must brace herself to renew the struggle against the most powerful military force the world had ever seen kydd an experienced and distinguished naval officer would not languish in unemployment for long and renzi felt a stab of concern might his friend be prevented from keeping his word on their arrangement he glanced at his pocket watch his thoughts now on his imminent meeting cecilias image had gone with him in his minds eye on his long journey and stayed with him to be burnished and cherished soon he would face its reality he drew a long breath kydds mother handled the capacious muff of kangaroo skin dubiously its warm foxred fur divided pleasingly to an underlying soft dark greybut might not other ladies disdain it as an inferior substitute for fine pine marten t catch em boundin along ma its so divertin t see they hoplike this to the consternation of the housemaid kydd performed a creditable imitation of a kangaroos leap do behave yself son his mother scolded but today kydd could do little wrong have y not given thought dear she continued in quite another tone that now youve achieved so much an all it might be a prime time t think about settlin down take a pretty wife an sport wi yr little onesi saw some fine cottages on the godalming road as might suit but her son was clearly not in the mood to listen the commotion of his arrival began to subside a little as the rest of the knickknacks expected from a voyage of ten thousand miles were distributed his father now completely blind felt the lustrous polish of a cape walkingstick fashioned from walrus bone and exotic wood as kydd presented cecilia with a little box which contained a single rock that sis y may not buy even in london fr a thousan guineas he said impressively cecilia examined it quietly its frm the very furthest part o the world any further an theres jus empty sea to th south poleth very end of everythin he had pocketed the cool bluegrey shard when renzi and he had gone ashore for a final time in the unspeakably remote van diemens land itsits very nice cecilia said in a small voice her eyes averted you did promise me something of your strange land in the letter thomas she said i do hope the voyage wasnt too vexing for you kydd knew she was referring to his captaincy of a convict ship and murmured an appropriate reply but he was alarmed by her manner this was not the spirited sister he had known and loved since childhood there was a subdued grief in her taut pale face that disturbed him cec thomas do come and see the school its doing so well now she said sounding brittle and retrieved the key from behind the door without another word they left the room and crossed the tiny quadrangle to enter a classroom for a space she faced away from him and kydds stomach tightened tthomas she began then lifted her head and held his eyes dear thomas ii want you to know that iim so very sorry that i failed you her hands worked nervously her head drooped youyou trusted me with your ddearest friend and i let him wander out and be lost wha cec you mean nicholas dear brother whatever you say ifailed you its no use she buried her face in her hands and struggled for control ii was so tired kydd reeled he had sworn secrecy about renzis feelings for his sister and the logic that had impelled his friend to sever connection with her they had prepared a story together to cover renzis disappearance it had better be believable he took his sisters hands and looked into her stricken face cecilia i have t tell yenicholas lives she froze searching his eyes her fingers digging painfully into his own hes not lost hehe straggled away intellect all ahoo y see it seemed such a paltry tale and he cursed yet again the foolish logic that had denied her the solace of just one letter from renzi he was er taken in an attended fr a long time an is now much recovered he ended awkwardly you know this kydd swallowed i heard about nicholas in deptford an hurried to him cec youll be seein him soon hes on his way may i know who took him in she continued in the same level voice this was not going to plan oh er a parcel o nuns or such he said uncomfortably they said as how they didnt want thanks th savin o souls was reward enough so hes now recovered yet was never in all that time able to pen a letter to me kydd mumbled something but she cut in he tells youhe confides in his friendbut not me a shadow passed across her features she stiffened and drew back pray dont hold my feelings to account thomas if you are sworn to discretion then who am i to strain your loyalties cec its not as yere sayin do you think me a fool she said icily if hes taken up with some doxy the least he can do is to oblige me with a polite note cec no im strong enough i can bear it its just thatim disappointed in nicholas such base behaviour only to be expected ofof her composure was crumbling and kydd was in a turmoil where did his loyalties lie the words fell out of him th truth then sis an ye may not like it now there was no going back she waited rigid ye have t understand cec that nicholas is not like y common sort o cove he has a rare enough headpiece go on an at times it leads him into strange notions she did not stir er very strange there was no help for it she would have to know everything hehe cares fr you sis kydd said he told me so himself i own before ye this day that cecilia is dearer t me than i cn say this he said t me in van diemens land she stared at him eyes wide hands at her mouth he was there with you then what y see cec while he was abed wi the fever he was thinkin of you sis an he feels as it would be improper for him t make it known t ye without he has achieved somethin in th world somethin he cn lay before ye an be worthy of yr attention so he ships out fr new south wales as a settler thinkin t set up an estate in th bush by his own hands but i reckon hes no taut hand at yr diggin an ploughin an he lost his fortune and reason toilin away at his turnips kydd took a deep breath i offered him passage home now hell come t sea wi me an work on an ethnical book its all a mort too deep fr me but when its published ill wager yell hear from him then cecilia swayed only a slight tremor betraying her feelings kydd went on anxiously he made me swear not t tell a soul an it would go ill wi me y understand cec should he feel id betrayed his trust nicholasthe dear dear man she breathed we conjured up th story sis as would see ye satisfied in th particulars but he tailed off uncertainly thomas i do understand its more than i could ever a shuddering sigh escaped her and she threw her arms round him dear brother you were so right to tell me he shall keep his secret and only when hes ready why its mr renzi just as y said thomas mrs kydd was clearly much pleased by renzis reappearance and ushered him into the room his eyes found cecilias then dropped why nicholas you are so thin cecilia said teasingly and your complexionanyone might think you one of thomass island savages she crossed to him and kissed him quickly on both cheeks renzi stood rigid then pecked her in return his face set she drew away but held his eyes asking sweetly im so grateful to the nuns who ministered to you what was their order i believe we should thank them properly for their mercies to our dear brother restored to us oh er that wont be necessary renzi said stiffly you may be assured that every expression of gratitude has been extended dear sister then a small gift a tokeni will sew it myself she insisted kydd coughed meaningfully then grunted leave him be cec tell us your news if y please she tossed her head why nothing that might stand with your exciting adventures she sighed only last week oh dear what is it mama ive jus this minute remembered mrs kydd rose and went to the sewing cupboard i have it here somewherenow where did i put it put what pray oh a letter fr thomas from london th navy i think she rummaged away oblivious to kydds keen attention i thought id better put it away safely untilah yes here it is kydd took it quickly from the fouled anchor cipher on its face it was from the admiralty he flashed a look of triumph at renzi and hastened to open it his eyes devouring the words the king ordersincouncil you are required and directed too excited to take in details he raced to the end where sure enough he saw the hurried but unmistakable signature of the first lord of the admiraltybut no mention of a ship a command renzi stood by the mantelpiece watching kydd with a halfsmile nicholas what do ye make o this kydd handed him the letter i should go t plymouth not london renzi studied it coolly by this you may know that your days of unalloyed leisure on halfpay are now summarily concluded and you are once again to be an active sea officer if i catch the implication correctly lord st vincent has knowledge of your far voyaging and therefore is not sanguine as to your immediate availability for service he directs you however to repair at once to plymouth where no doubt the admiral will be pleased to employ you as he sees fit he frowned yet within there is no mention of the nature of your employment i rather fancy you should be prepared for whatever the good lordor the admiralprovides then we should clap on all sail an set course fr plymouth i believe exclaimed kydd just so said renzi quietly cecilias face set nicholas youre sadly indisposed you need not go with thomas with infinite gentleness renzi turned to her dear sister but i do come the voice from inside the admirals office was deep and authoritative kydd entered cautiously as the flaglieutenant intoned commander kydd sir then left closing the door soundlessly after him admiral lockwood looked up from his papers appraised kydd for some seconds then rose from his desk he was a big man and in his gold lace powerfully intimidating mr kydd i had been expecting you before now sir youre aware well be at war with mr bonaparte shortly aye sir kydd replied respectfully it was not the navy way to offer excuses whatever their merit hmm the admiralty seems to think well enough of you desires me to give you early employment the gaze continued considering thoughtful now i can give you an immediate commandkydds heart leaptin the sea fencibles the whole coast from exmouth to the needles eighty miles two hundred men immediate command what do you say sir kydd had no wish to take a passive role ashore with a body of enthusiastic amateurs and fishermen watching and waiting on the coast he clung stubbornly to his hopes er thats very generous in ye sir but i had hoped fr afr a command at sea sir at sea lockwood sighed as we all do mr kydd he came round the desk and stood before kydd legs braced as though on a quarterdeck youve come at it rather late for that for weeks now ive had all the harumscarum young bloods to satisfy and you as commander and not a lieutenant it had come back to haunt kydd yet again as a lieutenant he could be put instantly in any one of the large number of cutters brigs armed schooners and the like but as a commander only a sloop as befitting his rank would do ahi have it command how do you feel about taking brunswick seventyfour to the leeward islands hey a twodecker shipoftheline to the caribbean kydd was dumbstruck was the admiral jesting where was the joke then he realised the only way he could captain a seventyfour was if she was going to sail en flûteall her guns removed to make room for troops and stores a glorified transport which would effectively remove him from the scene of action sir if y please id rather yes yes i know you would but almost everything that swims is in commission now dont suppose volcano fireship appeals no ohi nearly forgot eaglet fine shipsloop in dock for repair confidentially i rather fancy that after the court meets her present commander may find himself removed for hazarding his vessel and then well have to find somebody hey kydd realised he had probably reached the end of the admirals patience and in any case a shiprigged sloop was an attractive proposition that would suit me main well sir i thank but then again lockwood seemed to have warmed to him his brow furrowed and he faced kydd directly now its only proper to tell you eaglet will be long in repair there is one other in my giftbut again to be fair no one seems keen to take her thats probably because shes a trifle odd in her particulars foreignbuilt malta i think now if youd be sir her names notteazer as it happens yes do you know her sirill take her chapter kydds face was sore from the spray whipping in with the dirty weather disputing every foot of teazers progress but it bore an ecstatic smile as he braced against the convulsive movements of his ship it would be some time before they could be sure of clearing the cherbourg peninsula in this veering sousoueasterly but it would be an easier beat as they bore up for le havre kydd couldnt help but reflect that it was passing strange to be navigating to raise the enemy coast directly where he had every intention of anchoring and making contact with the shore earlier he had eagerly claimed his ship and set about preparing her for sea then in the midst of the work urgent orders had been hurried over from the admirals office it was his majestys intention to respond to the repeated provocations of napoleon bonaparte by granting general reprisals against the ships goods and subjects of the french republic within days it would be the end of the fragile peace england planned to steal a march on napoleon by declaring war first and any vessels like teazer that could be spared were dispatched urgently to the north coast of france to take off british subjects fleeing the country before the gates slammed shut teazer had put to sea within hours terribly shorthanded and with few provisions little in the way of charts and aids to navigation and neither guns nor powder in the race against time she had left behind her boatswain master and others including renzi who was ashore acquiring some arcane book still miraculously kydd was at sea in his own shipand it was teazer bound for war what more could he ask of life warmly he recalled the welcome from the standing officers who had remained with the vessel all the time he had been far voyaging purchet the boatswain duckitt the gunner hurst the carpenter and in a time of the hottest press seen that age the imperturbable quartermaster poulden had appeared on the dockside followed some hours later by the unmistakable bulk of tobias stirk who was accompanied by another younger seaman thought as how teazer might need us mr kydd stirk had said with a wicked grin and pushed forward the young man an has ye need of a fine topman as cn hand reef n steer fit t ship aboard the barky kydd had grunted and sized the man up in his early twenties he had the build and direct gaze of a prime deepwater sailor of course he would take himbut why was the man wearing a grin from ear to ear that just wouldnt go away then it dawned on him ah do i see young luke b chance the ships boy of long ago in the caribbean had grown and matured almost unrecognisably and was now able seaman luke calloway but as stirk and calloway were trusted men kydd had allowed them to go ashore and they were somewhere in the dockyard when he had sailed sir teazers only other officer kydds first lieutenant hodgson pointed astern twisting in his streaming oilskins kydd saw the dark outlines of questing scouting frigates emerge through the blurred grey horizon and then behind them lines of great ships stretching away into the distance he caught his breath this was cornwallis and the channel fleetshipsoftheline on their way to clamp a blockade on the great port of brest and thereby deny napoleon the advantage of having his major menowar at sea on the outbreak of hostilities the grey silhouettes firmed the stately seventyfours passed by one after another only two reefs in their topsails to teazers own closereefed sail and disdaining to notice the little brigsloop the grand vision disappeared slowly to leeward across their stern kydd felt a humbling sense of the responsibility they held the devotion to duty that would keep them at sea in foul conditions until the war had been won or lost weve made our offing i believe kydd threw at hodgson stations t stay ship now was the time to put about to clear start point for the claw eastwards kydd was grateful that a brig was more handy in stays than any shiprigged vessel but he had to make the best of the situation caused by their hasty departure youll be boatswain mr hodgson an ill be the master as well as the absence of these vital two warrant officers he had a raw and shorthanded ships company they wore round effectively though and set to for the thrash upchannel with no shortage of wind they would be in position to seaward off le havre at dawn the next day however kydd was uncomfortably aware that nearly all his sea service had been in foreign waters the boisterous and often ferocious conditions of these northerly islands were unfamiliar to him the morning would tax his sea sense to the limit all he had of the approaches was the smallscale private chart of havre de grce of some forty years before published by jeffreys with barely sufficient detail to warn of the hazards from shifting sandbanks in the estuary daybreak brought relief as well as anxiety they were off the french coast but where small craft scuttled past on their last voyages unthreatened by marauders and paid no attention to the brig offshore under easy sail kydd had ensured that no colours were aloft to provoke the french and assumed that if any of the vessels about him were english they would be doing the same he steadied his glass rounded dark hills with cliffs here and there the coast trending away sharply from the pencilled notes on the old chart he realised that these were to the south of le havre and teazer duly shaped course past them to the north they would be up with their objective in hours his instructions were brief and plain he was to make the closest approach conformable with safe navigation to honfleur further up the river then send a boat ashore to make contact with an agent whose name was not disclosed but whose challenge and reply were specified it would mean the utmost caution and he would need to have men with a handlead in the chains as they entered the tenmilewide maze of channels and banks in the estuary they closed slowly with the land the wind was now moderating and considerably more in the west then he spotted a sudden dropping away and receding of the coastlineit was the sign he had been looking for this was where a great river met the sea the mouth of the seine paris the centre for the storm that was sweeping the world into a climactic war was just a hundred miles or so to the southeast in the forechains the leadsman began to intone his endless chant of the fathoms and deeps below the baie de seine was a treacherous landscape of silted shallows and other hazards that could transform them into a shattered wreck but that was not kydds greatest worry as teazer busily laid her course into the narrowing waters who was to say that the peace had not ended while they were on passage that behind the torpid quiet of the just visible fortifications ahead soldiers were not casting loose their guns and waiting for the little brig to glide past the firming heights of cap de la hève loomed on the north bank of the estuary the chart noted the position closer in of the fort de sainteadresse which lay squat atop the summit of its own mount but their entry provoked no sudden warlike activity the huddle and sprawl of a large town at its foot would be the main port of havre de grce their duty was to pass on to lie off the ancient village of honfleur on the opposite bank and make contact with the shore uneasily kydd conned the ship in his chart was at pains to point out the menace of the gambe damfard a sprawling mileslong bank that dried at low water into hardpacked sand lying squarely across the entrance he glanced over the side the turbid waters of the seine slid past murky and impenetrable he straightened and caught hodgson looking at him gravely others round the deck were still and watching if the venture ended in failure there was no one to blame but the captain kydd began to look for little rills and flurries in the pattern of wavelets out of synchrony with their neighbours the betraying indications of shoaling waters a deepladen cargo vessel was making its way upriver and kydd fell in to follow carefully noting its track a passing halfdecked chaloupe came close to their stern and the man at the tiller hailed them incomprehensibly but his friendly wave reassured kydd as they passed the batteries into the confines of the river mouth honfleur was five miles inside the entrance a drab cluster of dwellings round a point of land kydd sniffed the wind it was still unsettled veering further but if it went too far into the west they stood to be embayed or worse stand by forrard he snapped he turned to the setfaced hodgson take th jollyboat an four men therell be one in th character of an agent looking fr us somewhere in th town he moved closer out of earshot of the others and muttered challenge is peur reply dégoût mr hodgson ssir purr and daygoo the lieutenant asked hesitantly thats fear an loathin in the frenchy tongue kydd said impatiently ah i see sir fear and loathingyes sir peur and dégoût if y please purr and daygoo aye aye sir kydd smothered his irritability it had not been so long ago that he was equally ignorant of french and if the agent was wise allowances would be made for uncultured englishmen and sir hodgson held himself with pathetic dignity perhaps it were best that i shift out of uniform while ashore kydd hesitated er i think not how will th agent sight ye as a naval officer else he refrained from mentioning that in uniform it was less likely hodgson would be mistaken for a spy it was unsettling to order another into danger particularly the harmless and wellmeaning hodgson who had been almost fawning in his gratitude to be aboardhe had spent the last five years on the beachbut there was no other with the authority send th boat back wi the agent well keep the rest o the boats manned ready to ship th refugees as y sends em kydd stood back while hodgson called for volunteers there were none teazer had yet to acquire that sturdy interdependence within her ships company that would develop into a battlefield trust and even the most ignorant could see the danger kydd picked the only names he could remember harman joseph then pointed at a nearby pair an you two later the rest would find themselves manning the other boats in deference to the unknown tide condition the anchor went down a quartermile offshore and teazer swung immediately to face upriver a disquieting measure of the strength of current ye may leave now mr hodgson kydd said encouragingly red weft at th main is yr recall the little boat leant jauntily under a single spritsail bobbing through the hurrying waves in a series of thumps of spray it disappeared round the headland to the small port beyond leaving kydd under a pall of apprehension now the rush and excitement had settled to danger and worry it seemed an age before the jollyboat hove into view the busy river still had no apparent interest in the anchored brig with no colours and the boat wove tightly through the other vessels hodgson was not in it but a darkfeatured man with an intense expression boarded quickly and hurried to kydd msieur le capitaine he said in a low nervous voice nous devons nous déplacer rapidement then glancing about he exclaimed cest guerre le tyran a choisi de se déplacer contre langleterre kydd went cold and the agent continued napoleon had suddenly declared war himself on the pretext that britain had not ceded malta under the terms of the treaty the news was not yet public but dispatches were being sent even now all over franceand the worst was that contrary to the rules of war and common humanity the first consul had ordered the instant arrest on the same day of every citizen of britain including civilians on french soil it could be days hours or the next minute that the orders came and when the origin of the unknown brig off honfleur was revealed the guns would open fire they were inside the ring of forts and in full view the time to leave was now but ashore there were desperate people who had made a frantic dash to the coast their only hope was teazer kydd could not just depart every boat in th water were not leavin em to boney he yelled and challenged the seamen with his eyes do ye wish t see the ladies taken b the french soldiers an th gentlemen cast in chokey there were growls of unease but they came forward well done y sons o neptune kydd said heartily theres those wholl fin reason t bless ye tonight the first boat returned the sight of the packed mass of forlorn windwhipped creatures brought mutterings of sympathy from those still aboard who helped them over the side but kydd did not want to waste time in introductions and waited apart poulden dealt manfully with a tearful hysteric while the gunner took the brunt of a tirade from a foppish young blade an animated babble replaced teazers disciplined quiet until the first passengers were shooed below at the sight of the cutter coming with others more arrived including a tearful woman who had been separated from her husband and an older man with a strong countenance who looked about watchfully as he boarded how much more time would they be granted a muffled crump sounded ominously from across the estuary answered almost immediately from the ficfleur battery further up the river a horrified lull in the chatter on deck was followed by excited speculation then alarm as another thud was heard this time the ball could be seen the distant plume of its first touch followed by an increasing series of smaller ones as it reached out towards them send up th signal weft kydd ordered there was no longer any doubt about french intentions the news had got through and they must now know of teazers origins be damned to it he said hotly hoist th ensign if y please they would go out under their true colours hands t unmoor ship there was every prospect of the situation turning into a shambles so many were away in the boats still yet he needed men to bring in the anchor others to loose sail silence on deck he roared at the milling crowd as more boatloads arrived in a rush where was the damned jollyboat was hodgson having difficulties disengaging from the other frantic refugees who no doubt had arrived his mind shied away from the memory of a similar plight in guadeloupe and he tried to focus on the present one more thud then anothershots from cannon ranging on them distances over sea were deceptive for landbased gunners but sooner or later they would find the range and then the whole battery would open up on them he needed time to think most forts faced the wrong way to be a serious menace at this stage but that didnt mean teazer was safe any warship hearing gunfire and coming to investigate would end their escape before it began a ball skipped and bounced not more than a hundred yards away to screams of fright from those who had never been under fire before kydd knew they had to gobut should he wait for hodgson send someone back for him there was still no sign of the jollyboat but to put to sea now would condemn both the officer and the four seamen with him to capture and incarceration or worse could he bear to have this on his conscience in a whirl of feeling and duty he made the decision to leave he lifted his face to sniff the wind again it would dictate how teazer should unmoor and win the open sea then he realised that while he had worried over other things the wind had shifted westwards and diminishedthe arc of navigability for a squarerigged vessel was closing already their entry track was barred to them more midchannel and tightly closehauled on the larboard tack was the only way outand be damned to the halftide banks he sent a hand forward to set axe to cable as others loosed sail on the fore alone tiderode and therefore facing upstream teazer rapidly began to make sternway and under the pressure of full sails on the fore and a naked mainmast together with opposite helm she wore neatly around until able to set loose at the fore take up closehauledand proceed seaward a ripple grew under her forefoot they were making way at two or three knots and with the current from the great river this was increasing to a respectable speed they had a chance kydd trained his glass on the fortifications they seemed to have been caught unready by teazers smart pirouette and were silent but the penalty for making midstream was that they were opening the bearing of the closer villerville gunsand shortening the range for those on the opposite bank it would be a near thing kydd shied at the mental image of hodgson and his seamen watching hopelessly as they left but he needed to concentrate on the sea surface ahead for any betraying crosscurrent and tried not to notice the renewed activity of the cannon the fall of most shot could not be seen but several balls came close enough to bring on a fresh chorus of shrieks he bellowed orders that the decks be cleared all passengers driven below it would give them no real protection but at least they would be out of sight of the gunfireand teazers commander poulden took several sailors and urged the passengers down the mainhatchway a lazy dark stippling in the sea to larboard forced kydd to order the helm up to pay off to leeward and skirt the unknown danger suddenly there was an avalanche of crumps from the far shore they were losing patience with the little brig that was evidently winning through to freedom but would the artillery officer in charge of this remote coastal battery be experienced enough to direct the aim with deadly effectiveness more sinister rippling appeared ahead teazer bore away a few points further to leeward more guns sounded the last of the people were being shooed below and in an unreal tableau as though it happened at half the speed kydd saw a welldressed lady take the rope at the hatchway and her arm disappear she stared at the stump in bewilderment then the blood came splashing on her dress and down the hatchway ladder she crumpled to the deck chaos broke out some tried to force passage down the hatchway as others sought to escape the madness below the fop tore himself free and beseeched kydd to surrender the man with the strong features snarled at him it may have been just a lucky shot but who were these folk to appreciate that kydd reflected grimly others joined in a relentless assault on his attention and his concentration slipped with a discordant bumping teazer took the ground and slewed to a stop sail was instantly brailed up but with a sick feeling kydd knew his alternatives were few as far as he could tell they had gone aground on the southern edge of the gambe damfard tidal bank the critical question was what was the state of the tide would they float off on the flow or end hard and fast on the ebb he looked about helplessly virtually every vessel in the estuary had vanished at the sound of guns the last scuttling away upriver as he watched the battery rumbled another salvo and he felt the wind of at least one ball it was now only a matter of time was there anything at all and had he the right to risk civilian lives in the saving of a shipofwar did his duty to his country extend to this if only renzi was by his sidebut he was on his own t me all teazers lay aft at once d ye hear he roared against the bedlam frightened seamen obeyed hurriedly probably expecting an abandonship order kydd became aware that the strongfeatured man had joined him captain massey he said simply how can i help ye after just a moments pause kydd said thats right good in ye sir ive lost m only ltenant and if youd it was breathtaking gall but in the next instant hms teazer had a full postcaptain as her new temporary first lieutenant in token of which kydd gave him his own cocked hat as a symbol of authority together they turned to face the seamen as kydd gave out his orders ones that only he with his intimate knowledge of teazer was able to give and ones that were her only chance of breaking out to the open sea in any other circumstance the usual course would be to lighten ship jettison guns and water anything that would reduce their draught even by inches but teazer had not yet taken in her guns and stores and was as light as she would get the next move would normally be to lay out a kedge anchor and warp off into deep water but he had neither the men nor the considerable time it would take for that and time was the critical factor as if to underline the urgency another ripple of sullen thuds sounded from across the water and seconds later balls skipped past ever closer long bowls massey grunted slitting his eyes to make out the distant forts a weak sun had appeared with the lessening airs and there was glare on the water the last element of their predicament however was the hardest the winds that had carried them on to the bank were necessarily foul for a reverse coursethey could not sail off against the wind and kydd had noticed the ominous appearance of a number of small vessels from inside the port of le havre these could only be one thinginshore gunboats a ship the size of teazer should have no reason to fear them but with empty gun ports hard and fast what kydd had in mind was a common enough exercise in the mediterranean but would it work here from below seamen hurried up with sweeps special oars a full thirty feet long with squaredoff loom and angled coppertipped blades at the same time the sweep ports nine tiny square openings along each of the bulwarks closed off with a discreet buckler were made ready the sweeps would be plied across the deck their great leverage used to try to move teazer off the sandbank clear th decks kydd roared at those still milling about in fear through the clatter he called to massey if yed take the larboard sir then he bellowed every man t an oar yes sir even you he bawled at the fop who was dragged bewildered to his place three rowers to each sweep an experienced seaman the furthest inboard the other two any who could clutch an oar hey nowthat lad ahoy kydd called to a frightened youngster down t the galley y scamp an find the biggest pot an spoon ye can kydd at an oar himself urged them on the ungainly sweeps built up a slow rhythm against the unyielding water then with a grumbling slither from beneath it seemed that a miracle had happened and the brig was easing back into her elementin the teeth of the wind to the dissonant accompaniment of a cannon bombardment and the urgent tingtingting clang of a galley pot his majestys brigsloop teazer slid from the bank and gathered way sternwards and into open water the sweeps were pulled in the playful breeze obliged and teazer slewed round to take the wind on her cheeks with sails braced up sharp she made for the blessed sanctuary of the open sea after this it seemed all the more unfair when kydd saw the three gunboats squarely across their path a fourth and fifth on their way to join them clearly someone had been puzzled by the lack of spirited response from teazer and had spotted the empty gun ports one or two gunboats she could handle but no more not a group sufficient to surround and from their bow cannon slowly smash her into surrender it was senseless to go on they could close the range at will and deliver accurate aimed fire at the defenceless vessel with only one possible outcome this could not be asked of innocent civilians and sick at heart kydd went to the signal halliards and prepared to lower their colours id belay that if i were you mr kydd massey said and pointed to the bluff headland of cap de la hève kydd blinked in disbelief there like an avenging angel an english manowar had appeared no doubt attracted by the sound of gunfire he punched the air in exhilaration chapter aye it was as who might say a tightrun thing kydd said acknowledging with a raised glass the others round him in the kings arms he flashed a private grin at captain massey who lifted his eyebrows drollytheir present coming together in sociable recognition of their deliverance was due to his generosity i own its very heaven to be quit of that odious country and poor mrs lewisis there any hope for her at all a lady of mature years enquired she is in the best of hands massey said and added that she was at stonehouse the naval hospital kydd looked out of the mullioned windows down into sutton pool the main port area of old plymouth it was packed with vessels of all description fled from the sea at the outbreak of war and now settling on the tidal mud it took little imagination to conceive of the economic and human distress that all those idle ships would mean however it was most agreeable to sit in the jolly atmosphere of the inn and let calm english voices and easy laughter work on his spirits the immediate perils were over teazer now lay in the hamoaze awaiting her turn for the drydock after her encounter with the sandbank her grateful passengers were soon to take coach for their homes in all parts of the kingdom there no doubt to relate their fearsome tales a couple from an adjoining table came across we must leave now captain the elderly gentleman said you will know you have our eternal thanksand we trust that your every endeavour in this new war will meet with the success it deserves others joined them pinkfaced kydd accepted their effusions as he saw them to the door in a chorus of farewells they were gone leaving him alone with massey kydd turned to him i have t thank ye sir for yr kind assistance when dont mention it mboy what kind of shab would stand back and let you tackle such a shambles on your own but even so his majesty will need every sea officer of merit at this time mr kydd i rather fancy it will be a much different war the last was to contain the madness of a revolution this is a naked snatching at empire bonaparte will not stop until he rules the worldand only us to stand in his way kydd nodded gravely the dogs of war had been unleashed destruction on all sides misery and hunger would be the lot of many in the near futurebut it was this selfsame conflict that gave meaning to his professional existence his ambitions and future no other circumstance would see his country set him on the quarterdeck of his own ship in a fine uniform to the undoubted admiration of the ladies i shall notify their lordships of my presence in due course massey said affably and you will no doubt be joining the select band of the channel gropers teazer was fitting out when we put t sea kydd responded im t receive m orders after we complete this was probably a deployment with cornwalliss channel squadron off brest yes massey said slowly but hold yourself ready for service anywhere in these waters our islands lie under as grave a threat as any in the last half a thousand years no more mediterranean sun for you sir at kydds awkward smile he added and for prizes the western approaches cant be beat all frances trade may be met in the chops of the channel and on her coasts you shall have sport aplenty a look suspiciously like envy passed across his face before he continued but of course you shall earn itits not for nothing that the english coast is accounted a graveyard of ships yes sir and a different kind of seamanship navigation sir youll take care of yourself then mr kydd who knows when well see each other again he rose and held out his hand fare y well sir kydd resumed his seat and let the thoughts crowd in admiral lockwood will see you now sir the flaglieutenant withdrew noiselessly leaving kydd standing gravely ah lockwood rose from his desk and bustled round to greet him warmly glad you could find the time kyddi know how busy you must be fitting for sea but i like to know something of the officers under my command any kind of invitation from the port admiral was a summons but what had caught kydds attention was the my so it was not to be the channel fleet and a humble part of the close blockade rather some sort of detached command of his own my honour sir kydd said carefully do sit lockwood said and returned to his desk kydd took a chair quietly sunlight from the tall windows warming him the muted rumble of george street traffic reaching him through the creeperclad walls teazer did not suffer overmuch lockwood said as he hunted through his papers but three days in dock only sir reginald kydd answered aware that in any other circumstance he would be before a court of inquiry for touching ground in a kings ship two seamen hurt an a lady im grieved t say has lost an arm tut tut its always a damnably distressing matter when your civilian is caught up in our warring aye sir er do ye have news o my ltenant hodgson lockwood found what he was looking for and raised his head no but you should be aware that a lieutenant standish is anxious to take his placeasking for you by name mr kydd do you have any objection to his appointment in lieu none sir so hodgson and the four seamen were still missing the lieutenant would probably end up exchanged but the unfortunate sailors would certainly spend the rest of the war incarcerated as for his new lieutenant he had never heard of him and could not guess at the reason for his request very well so let us assume your sloop will be ready for sea in the near future the admiral leant back and regarded kydd ill tell you now your locus of operations will be the channel approachesspecifically the coast from weymouth to the isles of scilly occasionally the bristol channel and you shall have plymouth as your base which in course means that you might wish to make arrangements for your family ashore hereyou may sleep out of your ship while in plymouth commander no family sir kydd said briefly the admiral nodded then continued sternly now youll be interested in your war tasks you should be disabused sir of the notion that you will be part of a great battle fleet ranging the seas there will be no bloody nile battles no treasure convoys and it will be others who will look to the frenchy invasion flotillas he paused then eased his tone there will be employment enough for your ship mr kydd the entrance to the channel where our shipping converges for its final run is a magnet for every privateer that dares think to prey on our shipping and in this part of the world the wild country and filthy state of our roads means that fourfifths of our trade must go by seadefenceless little ships tiding it out in some tiny harbour and hoping to get their hardwon cargo upchannel to market not to mention our homewardbound overseas trade worth uncounted millions should this suffer depredation then england stands in peril of starvation and bankruptcy i understand sir kydd said therefore your prime task is patrol clear the soundings of any enemy privateers or warships safeguard our sea lanes other matters must give best to this mr kydd other come now sir im talking of dispatches worthy passengers uncommon freightand the revenue of course sir lockwood looked sharply at kydd sir im aware your service has been for the most part overseas he stopped then continued evenly his majestys customs and excise has every right to call upon us to bear assistance upon these coasts should they feel overborne by a band of armed smugglers or similar understood sir now i say again that i would not have you lose sight of your main task for one moment mr kydd security o the seas sir quite so for this task you are appointed to a command that puts you out of the sight of your seniors to make your own decisions as to deployment engagements and so forth this is a privilege sir that carries with it responsibilities should you show yourself unworthy of it by your conduct then i shall have no hesitation in removing you do you understand me sir i do sir very well no doubt you will be acquainting yourself with navigation and its hazards in these home waters i suggest you do the same soon for the other matters that must concern you i will sir the admiral leant back and smiled but then of course you will have a splendid opportunity in the near future sir i shall be holding a ball next month which the officers of my command will be expected to attend there will be every chance then for you to meet your fellow captains and conceivably learn much to your advantage he rose this ill have you know sir your contribution to the defence of these islands at this time stands in no way inferior to that of the channel fleet itself if hms teazer and you mr kydd do your duty in a like manner to the other vessels under my flag ive no doubt about the final outcome of this present unpleasantness have you any questions none sir then he ventured that is t say but one do ye have any objection to my shipping mr renzi as captains clerk hes as well you may ship mother giles if it gets you to sea the earlier lockwood said with a grim smile your orders will be with you soon good luck mr kydd so this was to be teazers future to face alone the predators that threatened the storms and other hazards on this hard and rugged coast relying only on himself his ships company and the fine ship he had come to lovenot in the forefront of a great battle fleet but with an equally vital mission poulden brought the jollyboat smartly alongside the bowman hooked on and stood respectfully for kydd to make his way forward and over teazers bulwark as purchets silver call pealed importantly kydd doffed his hat to the mateofthewatch the etiquette of the royal navy was important to him not so much for its colour and dignity or even its flattering deference to himself as a captain but more for its outward display of the calm and unshakeable selfconfidence rooted in centuries of victory that lay at the centre of the navys pride purchet came across to kydd ill need more hands t tackle th gammoning sir but shes all ataunto i believe kydd hesitated before he headed below the view from where teazer was moored opposite the dockyard in the spacious length of the tamar river was tranquil a garden landscape of england that matched his contentment he turned abruptly but paused at the foot of the companionway mr dowse he called aye sir the master was tall and had to stoop as he swung out of his cabin might i see ye fr a moment they passed into the great cabin and kydd removed a bundle of papers from his other easy chair then offered it have ye had service in this part o the world mr dowse i have that sir not as youd say recent yed understand but i know most o the coastline hereabouts an west t the longships can be tricky navigation an needs a lot o respect thats as may be our orders will keep us here fr the future an i mean t know this coast well mr dowse do ye find the best charts an rutters then let me know when yere satisfied an well go over em together ive sent out fr the new nories an i has hamilton moore ready set by fr a channel pilot he cant be beat more discussion followed dowse was new to kydd but was of an age and had experience his wisdom would be vital in a small ship like teazer thank ye well talk again before we sail with a sigh kydd turned to his paperwork fielding the purser had carefully prepared his accounts for signature tysoe entered silently with coffee his urbane manner in keeping with his station as the captains servant and valet kydd congratulated himself yet again on having sent stirk ashore to find his servant of teazers last commission whom he had necessarily had to let go when he had lost his ship with the brief peace of the treaty of amiens tysoe had raised no objections to quitting his situation with a local merchant and had slipped back easily into his old post kydd completed a small number of papers but found he was restless all over the ship men were working steadily on the ageold tasks of completing for sea and all he could find to do was address his interminable load of reports there was one matter however far more agreeable to attend to he got up quickly passed through the wardroom and emerged on to the broad messdeck there were surprised looks from the seamen but his hat was firmly under his arm signifying an unofficial visit and he crossed quickly to the tiny cabin adjoining the surgeons that extended into a corner of the mess space it was new the thin panels still with the fragrance of pine and with a green curtain for a door it had cost him much debate with the dockyard but teazer now had a cabin for her captains clerk an unheardof luxury for one so humble kydd tapped politely after some movement the curtain was drawn aside and a dishevelled head appeared nicholas is this at all to yr liking or renzi pulled back inside and kydd could see into the tiny compartment the forward bulkhead was lined with books from top to bottom as was the opposite side with each row laced securely in the middle a very small desk stood complete with a gimballed lamp and a cot was being triced up out of the way it was definitely a oneperson abode but if the seachest could be made to suffer duty as a chair and movements were considered and deliberate there were possibilities renzi gave a rueful smile grateful that his years of sea service had prepared him for the motion here should we meet with a seaway of spirit it may require our stout boatswain to exercise his skills in the lashing of myself to my chair but here i have my sanctum thank you the contrast with kydds own appointments could not have been greater but this was all that renzi had asked for er should ye be squared away b evening m friend might we sup together nicholas dear friend it does m heart good t see ye aboard the cabin was bathed in the cosy glow of twin candles on the table your chair nicholas kydd said pointedly pulling forward one of an identical pair of easy chairs renzi gave a halfsmile but said nothing who wouldve thought it kydd went on as yed remember come aft through th hawse an all renzi murmured something and reclined watching kydd steadily tysoe filled the glasses and left noiselessly and now were shipmates again kydd concluded lamely renzi unbent a little this is true and imgratified that it should be so you must believe brother kydd smiled broadly and handed him a glass then i give ye joy of our friendship nicholas he laughed if its t be half o what it was when we were afore the mast then yes dear fellow heres a toast to those days and to that which lies ahead renzi answered softly but kydd realised in his heart that there was no going back in the years since they had been foremast hands together too much had happened his elevation to the majesty of command renzis nearmortal fever and subsequent striving for significance in life and all that had passed which had seen them both pitched into bloody combat and fear of their lives they were both very different men aye the old days more wine renzi said politely i can only applaud your taste in whites this portuguee is the gayest vinho verde this age yesthat villain in town cant stand against tysoe kydd said shortly nicholas may i know if yeve set course ready for yr studies there may be no studies renzi said his face taut kydds stomach tightened no studies did renzi see the great gulf in their situations as a sick reversal of the relationship that had gone before we gull ourselves brother renzi said evenly if we believe that the world will abide by our little conceit he shifted in his chair to face kydd squarely consider you are captain and therefore lord over all and may direct every soul in this ship as you desire but that is not the same as the unthinking obeisance of your redcoat or the sullen obedience of the serf in the field our jack tar famously has an independence of thought he smiled thinly you might set me at an eminence and sup with me i may pace the quarterdeck in your company and be seen to step ashore with you this is all within your giftyou are the captain yet what will our honest mariner perceive of it and your new lieutenant t arrive tmorrow what construction will he place on our easy confidences our privy conversations am i to be in the character of the captains spy renzi was right of course the practicality of such a relationship was now in serious question any interpretation might be placed on their conduct from the bawdy to the felonious kydds position was fast becoming untenable and it would seem he risked his ship for the sake of an innocent friendship nicholas to have the prospect of resolution to the loneliness of command snatched away was too much answer me true m friend are ye still resolved on yr achievin in the academic line for the sake o cecilia he added carefully were it possible then it shall be so an im settled on it kydd said firmly it is th worlds perceivin only he added an the world must know how it is he paused framing his words with care the truth is always th safest in society you shall be introduced as a learned gentleman guest o the captain who is undertaking interestin voyages fr the sake of his studies an who fr the sake of appearances in the navy takes on himself th character of clerksecretaryto th captain this should prove the easiest task it would be assumed in the timehonoured way that renzi would not of course be expected to sully his hands with the actual clerking which would be handled by a lowly writer in the navy we take another tack which is just as truthful here we have th captain takin pity on an old seafriend recoverin from a mortal fever and takin the sea cure who spends his hours wi books an worthy writin he paused for effect i spoke with th admiral he continued innocently who told me directly that he sees no objection to mr renzi shippin as clerk in teazer you discussed my health renzi said acidly not in smany details kydd replied and hurriedly made much of tysoes reappearance signalling dinner rattlin fine kidneys he offered but renzi ate in silence even a wellbasted trout failed to elicit more than grunts and kydd was troubled again was renzi finding it impossible to accept their new relationship or was he appalled by the difference in their living accommodation kydd tried to brighten why here we lie at anchor in devonshire th foremost in the kingdom in the article of lamb our noble cook fails in his duty th rogue if he cannot conjure some such meat the cutlets were indeed moist and succulent and at last renzi spoke i can conceive of above a dozen matters that may yet prove insuperable rocks and shoals to our objectives kydd waited impatiently for the cloth to be drawn allowing the appearance of a salver of marzipan fruits crafted yr chretien pear an monaco fig damn well dont y think just so renzi said not to be distracted you will want to be apprised of these preclusions i believe if y please nicholas the first is yourself of course kydd held silent there was no point in impatient prodding for renzi would logically tease out a problem until a solution emergedor proved there was none very well some matters are readily evident the chief of which is that this scheme requires i be placed in a condition of subjection to you which the rule and custom of the sea demands shall be absolute you shall be the highest i shall be the lowliest nicholas no not at all ii would not kydd trailed off as the truth of his friends words sank in exactly renzi steepled his fingers i journey on your fine bark as a member of her crewif this were not so there would be no place for me therefore we must say that the articles of war bear on me as scrupulously as upon the meanest of your ordinary seamen and with all the same force of law kydd made to interrupt but renzi went on remorselessly as captain you cannot make exception it therefore necessarily demands that i should be obliged to make my obedience to you in all things there was a finality in his tone does this mean it does but my dear fellow it is the most logical and consequently most amenable to sweet reason of all our difficulties a smile stole across his features to leave issues unsaid to be tacit and therefore at the mercy of a misapprehension is pusillanimous thus i shall now be explicit i do not see fit to vary my behaviour by one whit in this vessel i see no reason why i should be obliged to do you at a loss for words kydd merely mumbled something im glad you agree brother therefore from this time forth i shall render to the captain of hms teazer every mark of respect to his position in quite the same way as i allowed the captain of tenacious seaflower artemis aye nicholas said kydd meekly splendid in the same vein i shall of course discharge the duty of captains clerk in the fullest senseany less would be an abrogation of the moral obligation that allows me victualling and passage in teazer as you must surely understand yr scruples do ye honour m friendbut this at least can be remedied capns attendance take precedence ye shall have a sidesman o sorts a writer frm out of our company even before he had finished the sentence he knew who luke calloway who had learnt his letters from kydd himself in the caribbean would be completely trustworthy and on occasion would not object too strenuously to exchanging the holystone for the quill but then we must attend to more stern questions these had to wait as the table was cleared and the brandy left and the captain and his visitor had resumed their easy chairs stern questions some might say of the first martial importance you wish to be assured of the conduct of every member of your company in the event of a rencontre with the enemy including that of myself this is your right to ask and i will answer similarly as before as a member of teazers crew i have my duties in time of battle as has everyone aboard as a clerk this is as a clerk my quarters are strictly specified and these are to attend upon my captain on the quarterdeck for the period of the engagement i shall be therethis you may believe he said softly kydd looked away overcome and if teazer faces an assault upon her decks from without i shall not feel constrained in defending myself and my ship this also you may believe he paused but in any affair that calls for noble leadership the drawn sword at the head of a band of warriorsthere you will see that by our own devising we are denied i am a clerk not even a petty officer and no man can thus be made to follow me as bidden i might carry a pike or haul on a rope but otherwise renzi was laying down terms for his continued existence in teazer or more properly defining limitations that tidied things logically for his fine mind kydd hoped fervently that there would be no situation in the future that tested the logic too far he found the brandy and refreshed their glasses ye spoke ofpreclusions m friend here is one renzi regarded kydd steadily how can it be right fr a man o letters sensible of th finer points t be battened below like a like a common foremast jack it was said to kydds relief renzi eased his expression do you not remember my time of exile in the company of neptunes gentlemen it was my comfort then to remark it that the conditions were to be borne as a necessary consequence of such a sentence i now take notice that there is a similarity in like manner to your monk or hermit scratching away in his cell in his sublime pursuit of truth and beauty there are conditions contingent on the situation that may have to be endured as price for the final object should i not have the felicity of voyaging in teazer then i fear my purse would not withstand an alternative course and therefore i humbly accept what is so agreeably at hand fear not dear fellow i have years at sea that will inure me and besides this time i have a sanctum sancti where at any time i may take refuge to allow my thoughts to run uncheckedi need not point out to you that the keeping of sea watches now mercifully will be a memory for me thats well said nicholasbut you er will need t talk out yr ideas try out some words or so indeed i will we shall promenade the decks in deep discussionas the disposition of the ship allows of courseand should you be at leisure of an evening it would gratify me beyond words to dispute with you on the eternal verities yet kydds soaring hopes hung suspended we both have calls upon our time it were more apt to the situation should we both inhabit our different worlds for the normal rush of events and perhaps rely otherwise on the welltried rules of politenesswhich places so much value on invitation rather than crass assumptions as to the liberty of the individual to receive kydd smiled inwardly this was no more than renzi securing to himself the ability to disappear into his sanctum when he desired to by all means nicholas er might i know yr station fr messin it was a delicate point the need for a captain to keep his cabin and table clear for ships business was unspoken and therefore a standing arrangement for dining à deux was not in question this had now been dealt with but where renzi took his victuals had considerable social significance a lowly clerk in a brigsloop could usually expect the open messdecks it was only in weightier vessels that the captains clerk would rank as a cockpit officer and berth in the gunroom i have been led to believe that steerage will be open to me this was the open area below bounded on both sides by cabins and aft by the captains quarters it would be where the first lieutenant would hold court over the lesser officersthe master surgeon and purser the gunner boatswain and carpenter had their own cabins forward why this does seem a fine thing weve achieved this night kydd enthused raising his glass heres t our success renzi gave an odd smile as it will rise or fall by the caprice of your own ships company he murmured aye well find a way nicholas never fear so lets drink an apologetic knock on the door sounded clear come kydd called it was the mateofthewatch sir we have lieutenant standish here come t join behind him a figure loomed both streamed water rain must have swept in unnoticed on the anchorage as they dined ltenant standish i hadnt thought yed join afore sir m apologies and duty but ive been afire to be aboard since i heard im to be appointed his figure was large but indistinct in the darker steerage ah im sorry sir i didnt know youd got company ohthats no matter mr standish id like ye t meet mr renzi hes a learned gentleman whos takin berth with us th better to further his ethnical studies in th character of captains clerk as it were standish looked mystified from one to the other but renzi got quickly to his feet he inclined his head to the newcomer then turned to kydd and said civilly i do thank you for your politeness and entertainment sir but must now return below good night y see sir duckitt held out a horny palm in it was a tiny pyramid of harsh dark grey particles the earlymorning light picking out in curious detail the little grains smaller than any peppercorn this is y new cylinder powderthrows a ball jus the same range wi a third less charge he said or a third further if y charge is th same kydd retorted but his curiosity was piqued it was seldom he came across the naked powder guns were served with it sewn safely inside cartridges of serge or flannel to be rammed home out of sight and priming powder had a different grain size ah well as t that sir ye must know that its an admiralty order as we takes aboard twenty per centum fewer barrels a sceptical look appeared on the hovering boatswains face which disappeared at kydds sharp glance and o course yed be aware we gets less anyways bein channel duties only are ye sayin mr duckitt kydd snapped that we must land the powder we now has aboard not all of it sir we keeps a mort o white lg for closein work an salutin for th rest its all red lg powder best corned an glazed charge a third yr shot weight and a half fr carronades one fourth for doubleshottin its all there in m orders jus received it would take time to discharge from their magazine cramped into the after end of the hold then there was the swaying inboard of the lethal copperbanded barrels from the low redflagged powderbarges no doubt only now beginning their slow creep down from the magazines further upstream very well id have wished t know of this afore now kydd growled purchet turned anxiously shall i rouse out th larbowlines below now sir no no mr purchet th forenoon will do let em lie the thought of breakfast was cheering as he turned to go below he saw standish emerge on deck ready dressed for the day against kydds shirt and breeches sira very good morning to you oher thank ee he had asked that his new first lieutenant present himself in the morning clearly the man had taken him literally and was prepared for the morning watch which started at four i had expected ye later has all y dunnage been brought aboard it has sirall stowed and put to rights cabin stores coming aboard this afternoon he glanced up into teazers bare masts if were to get to sea this age it were better i begin my duties directly he said briskly kydd paused was this an implied slight at teazers untidy state or the sign of a zealous officer it does ye credit mr standish but theres time enough fr that shall we take breakfast together at all he added firmly there was no reason why he should be cheated of his own repast and it would give him proper sight of the man for the first time why thank you sir standish seemed genuinely flattered and followed kydd respectfully to the great cabin another fr breakfast tysoe kydd warned his own meal was ready laid at one end of the polished tablewiggs dainty breakfast pastries and sweet jelly quiddany of plums in a plain jar the coffee pot steaming gently well mr standish the suns not yet over the foreyard but im t welcome ye into teazer i believe tysoe brought napery and cutlery and set another place pleased indeed to be aboard sir youll understand that to be idle when your country stands in peril sits ill with me standish was well built his strong features darkly handsome hair tied back neatly in a queue like kydds but with a studied carelessness to the curly locks in front kydd helped himself to one of the wiggs added a curl of butter and a liberal spread of the conserve then asked casually tell me sir may i know why y asked fr teazer especially standish seemed abashed oh well sir he put down his knife and paused turning to face kydd do you mind if im frank sir do fill an stand on the man held himself well and kydd was warming to his evident willingness youll be aware that you sir are not unknown in the service he began respectfully your boat action at the nile has often been remarked and dare i say it your courage at acre has yet to see its reward thats kind in ye to say so i will be candid sir my last post was a shipotheline and while a fine enough vessel she was to join cornwallis before brest he went on earnestly for an officer of aspiration this is er a slow route a frigate berth is too much sought after to be in prospectthen i heard of ltenant hodgsons misfortune kydd nodded for him to continue sir my reason for requesting teazeryoull pardon the direct speakingis that i believe you to be an active and enterprising captain who will see his chance and seize it in fine sir prospects of a distinguished action for all will be better served in teazer than another it was true that the only sure path to glory and promotion was distinction on the field of battle and subsequent recognition above ones peers standish had heard something of kydds history and had made a cool calculation that this captain would not hold back in the event of an engagement so his chances were better for a bloody victory in teazer than in a battleship on blockade duty thank ye fr your frankness mr standish but it may be that within a short time th channel fleet will meet the french an their invasion fleet glory enough fr all i would say coffee the officer looked sincere and was clearly eager to be an active member of teazers company tell me mr standish have ye been fortunate in th matter of actions i was at copenhagen sir third o the monarch he said modestly and was fourth in minotaur when we cut out the prima galley this was experience enough in nelsons squadron during the bloody affair against the danes and before in the fine exploit off genoa that saw the difficult capture of the heavily manned vessel were ye in the boats i had the honour to command our pinnace on that occasion yes sir this was no stripling learning his trade in a small vessel standish was going to be a distinct assetif his other qualities were as creditable well i hope teazer cn afford ye some entertainment in the future thank you sir may i ask itdo we have our orders yet none yet but admiral lockwood assures me well have em presently do help yself to more wiggs if i might be allowed to make my excuses sir i feel i should make an early acquaintance with our watch and station bill kydd noted the our with satisfaction if there is fault to be found im anxious it shall not be mine standish added he rose to leave then hesitated did i hear aright sir that your friend our learned gentleman mr renzi is he not also in the nature of aa clerk kydd allowed his expression to grow stern in hms teazer he is captains clerk mr standish he is b way of being a retired sea officer and brings a deal of experience t the post you will find him of much value when he assists ye as he will aye aye sir said standish uncertainly it was while the powder boy was alongside and the ship in a state of suspended terror at the sight of the deadly barrels swaying through the air that teazers two midshipmen arrived awed by the tension they sensed in the manoeuvres around them they stood bareheaded and nervous before a distracted kydd andrews sir squeaked the younger his wispy appearance was not going to impress the seamen kydd reflected boyd sir the other said stolidly yere welcome aboard gentlemen but fr now clew up wi mr prosser thats him by th forebitts say yere to take station on him an ill attend to y both later prosser was teazers only masters mate the lads trotted off and kydd turned back to events purchet was in charge his style was to give few orders and those quietly forcing the party of men to a strained quiet in case they were missed the boatswains mate standing by meaningfully the morning wore on and with the last of the powder aboard and securely in the magazine the atmosphere eased carry on if y please mr prosser kydd said and turned to go below at the bottom of the steps he nearly bumped into standish ah sir do you have a few moments he was carrying a sheaf of papers and in the subdued light of belowdecks kydd saw renzi standing politely a few paces back he hesitated caught between courtesy to his friend and a captain acknowledging a mere clerk in front of an officer and compromised with a civil nod the two officers went together to kydds cabin leaving renzi alone standish spread out his papers it was the watch and station bill and he had no doubt with discreet hinting from renzi made sizeable inroads into the task two watches i think you requested sir he said with businesslike vigour smoothing out a larger paper made of two sheets pasted together with a complement of eightytwo men in a brig this size i see no difficulty here sir i will stand watch opposite mr prosser and we will apportion the men to divisions in like wise it was a good plan both would see the same men every watch they would lead in detached service or for which they would take domestic responsibility standish added as to petty officers o the tops and similar as you have been to sea once with them i respectfully seek your opinion he handed over his list of stations for each seaman in the various manoeuvres that teazer must perform mooring ship taking in sail heaving up the anchors this showed a reassuring technical confidence discussion continued mess numbers had been assigned and standish had a useful suggestion about hammock markings and location it was always a tricky thing to find a man at night in the press of offwatch humanity below and men did not take kindly to being clumsily awakened as the carpenters crew or others were found and roused out we stand eighteen short o complement kydd saidit was a nagging worry as they had to be fully prepared for war im trusting t snag some local men he added doubtfully it was unlikely but not impossible there must be a fair number of sailors thrown ashore from the crowds of coastal shipping he had seen lie idle on the mud in plymouth they might be glad of the security of a kings ship known to be on service only in home waters standish left as the purser came for more signatures suddenly from the deck above there was a bull roar that pickerooning rascal in the foretop ahoy if you think to take your ease sir we can accommodate youmr purchet it seemed teazers new first lieutenant was losing no time in making his presence felt teazers orders arrived and kydd sought the solitude of his cabin to open them there were no surprises the whole coastline between portland bill and the isles of scilly would be his responsibility to cruise for the protection of trade of his majestys subjects particularly of the coasters passing that way from any attempts of the enemys cruisers using your best endeavours to take and destroy all ships and vessels belonging to france which you may discover or be informed of he was to call regularly at falmouth fowey and other ports to acquire intelligence orders or letters and further it seemed he should neglect no opportunity to procure men for his majestys fleet who should then be borne on the supernumerary list for victuals until conveyed to the nearest regulating captain there was however no mention of customs and excise but if any trade or convoy in the downs bound to the westward should eventuate he was to see them safely as far as their way may be with yours all in all it was eminently suited to teazers qualities and vital to the countrys survival and it left full scope for a bold action against any enemy daring to cross her bows kydd grunted in satisfaction gathered up the papers and reviewed what had to be done now in the way of charts victualling manning a small folded paper that he had overlooked slipped out it was watermarked and of high quality and he opened it carefully admiral sir reginald and lady lockwood request the pleasure of the company of commander thomas kydd at a june ball at the long room stonehouse kydd caught his breath there was no escape he must go and if standish were invited separately he must make sure he accepted as well it would be his first formal occasion in home waters as captain of a ship and because of his long overseas service it was as well his first entry into proper english society on his own terms the guildford assemblies paled into insignificance beside this this was something for renzi he knew all the finer points the way through the social quicksands and the subtleties of conversational byplay the rules for bowing and scraping kydds grasp of the fundamentals of politeness was adequate for the usual run of social events but if at this level he were to bring disgrace on teazer with an unfortunate gaucherie kydd stood up and was on the very point of passing the word for mr renzi when he stopped how in the name of friendship could he summon renzi to appear before him simply when it suited it would risk alienating him and fundamentally affect their delicate arrangement it was important for the future that kydd find a way to achieve the same object in a manner that did not offend sensibilities of course in renzis very wordsthe rules of politeness the value of invitation tysoe do inform mr renzi that i request th pleasure of his company when he is at liberty to do so as it was done in the best circles m friend id take it kindly if yed give me a course t steer in this matter kydd handed over the invitation annoyingly renzi did not display any particular admiration or surprise he merely looked up and asked calmly an invitation to a ballis there an exceptional service you therefore wish of me im concerned t put on a brave face fr teazers sakethat is not t appear th drumble as it were y understand nicholas kydd said warily i think i do renzi said evenly this ball it is given by our admiral and to it will come all the officers under his command in order that he might make their social acquaintance and allow the same to discover each others wit and shining parts ayethis is what vexes me shall i be found wantin in polite company ive not attended a regulargoin society ball in england what is yr advice nicholas what cn ye tell me of how to conduct mself what have i t learn dear fellow you have the gracespolite conduct is the same in nova scotia malta and plymouth if you acquit yourself creditably there then a mere ball and be assured that as the captain of a ship you will not lack for admirers among the ladies and will command respect and attention from the gentlemen i would not fear an ordeal thats kind in ye to say so m friend so theyll take me fr who i am you may be quite certain they will not renzi said immediately this is england and they will take you as they see youan uncultured boor or salty son of neptune your character will be fixed only as they perceive it but i will be clear if the prescripts are not observed then quite rightly they will conclude that you are not of their ilk their social persuasion and would therefore not be comfortable in their company in fine you would in mercy be excluded from their inner circle kydd remained stubbornly silent but listened as renzi continued you would no doubt wish to exhibit the accomplishments of a gentleman in order not to frighten the ladies among these that you lack at the moment i might list dancing cards and gallantry im said t be light on m feet and renzi looked at him kindly on the matter of dancing i dare say that you may well have been considered of the first rank but i have to confide to you that those wretches the dancing masters to secure their continued employment are always inventing quantities of new dances these you must surely hoist aboard as unaccountably your female of the species sets inordinate store on their confident display i would suggest some lessons without delay cards ye know im no friend t gamblin cards do you propose to spend the entire evening stepping it out with the ladies this would surely be remarked upon it would be much more the thing from time to time to sit at a table with your brother officers being amiable to the ladies at loo vingtetun or some such to hazard a shilling a hand would not be noticed then m gallantry ahgallantry this is not so easily won and may be said to have as its main objective the reluctance of the lady to quit your enchanting company the science you will find in the worthy tomes such as your baldwin and the artthe art you must discover for yourself at the first hand baldwin my constant companion in youth the polite academy or school of behaviour for gentlemen which will repay you well in the studying now if there is nothing else you desire of me i should return to my new acquaintance the abbé morelly whose views on the origin of social ills is quite startling andand interesting please do nicholas kydd said warmly then caught himself and added i find that yere not t be invited m friend you should know this is not as id wish it he trailed off embarrassed no matter brother renzi said quietly you have earned your right to enter in upon societyi seek quite another felicity there was a warm softness on the evening air a delightful earlysummer exhilaration that added to kydds heightened senses he tried to maintain a sombre countenance before standish who sat next to him in the hired diligence as they clipped along durnford street but it was difficult this was the night when he would discover if he had it within him to claim a place in high society they passed the last elegant houses and across an open space to approach the curiously solitary single edifice of the long room it was ablaze with light in every window and the sight brought on in kydd a fresh surge of excitement they drew up before the stately entranceflights of steps ascending each side of what was plainly the ballroom handed down by a blankfaced driver kydd clapped on his hat and fumbled hastily for silver aware of the gawping crowd standing about to see who was arriving in their finery he turned and saw a young lieutenant in fulldress ceremonials approaching good evening sir and welcome to the ball might i kydd commander thomas kydd captain of teazer sloopowar he would not yet be known by sight of course if you would accompany me sir the admiral is receiving now there was a guilty thrill in being aware of the respect he was accorded by this flaglieutenant and kydd followed with his head held high as a lesser mortal standish would have to wait his boatcloak and hat were taken deftly in the small anteroom and after a nervous twitch at his cravat he stepped from the small foyer into noise light and colour thank you flags ah kydd glad to see you sir the admiral was in jovial mood standing in the splendour of fulldress uniform an intimidating figure he turned to the two ladies who flanked him my dear persephone might i present commander kydd now captain in one of my ships here hes much talked about in the mediterranean you must believe kydd turned to the admirals lady and bowed as elegantly as he could and was duly rewarded with a civil inclination of the head i do hope you will enjoy this evening commander i did have my fears of the weather she said loftily an im sure it will back westerly before sunup maam kydd replied graciously he was uncomfortably aware of straightbacked dignity and hard appraising eyes he tried to smile convincingly when he turned to the daughter there was a quick impression of a willowy figure in a filmy white highwaisted gown that bobbed decorously in response to his bow when she rose kydds eyes were met by amused hazel ones in a fashionably pale patrician face a neat gloved hand was extended elegantly miss llockwood kydd said taking the hand renzis polite words learnt so laboriously fled from his mind at the girls cool beauty mmy honour er is mine he stuttered i do trust that you dont find england too dull after the mediterranean mr kyddthey do say that naples is quite the most wicked city in the world the wellbred voice had an underlying gaiety that kydd could not help responding to with a grin aye theres sights in naples would set ye something warned him of lady lockwoods frosty stare and the admirals frown and he concluded hastily that is t say we have pompeii an herculano both rattlin good places t be why i shall certainly remember should i ever have the good fortune to visit the daughter said demurely but the laughter was still in her eyes after a brief hesitation she withdrew her hand gently from kydds fingers the orchestras subdued airs went almost unnoticed among the hubbub while he waited for standish to be received kydd looked about him the room was filled with laughter and noise the occasional splash of military scarlet and to kydd the much more satisfying splendour of the blue white and gold of the royal navy tiered chandeliers hung low from the lofty ceiling shining brightly to set eyes and jewellery asparkle and lightly touching every lady with soft gold he looked back there were still some to be received but standish was not among themhe had disappeared into the throng kydd was alone glances were thrown in his direction but no one ventured to approach he knew whyhe had not been introduced to any other than the admirals party and he was unknown purposefully he strode into the room neatly avoiding knots of people in just the same way as he would on the messdeck in a seaway clutching to his heart renzis strictures about politeness and genteel behaviour then he found what he was searching for a jollylooking commander who was holding forth to a fellow officer and his shylooking lady while controlling a champagne glass with practised ease kydd hovered until the reminiscence was concluded but before he could step forward the man turned to him what cheer m lad are you here for the dancing or oh er dancing would be capital fun kydd said stiffly then added with a courtly bow commander thomas kydd o teazer sloop well commander thomas kydd first we must see ye squared away wi a glass he signalled to a footman discreetly bazely sir edmund bazely out o fenella brigsloop and this unhappy mortal be parlby o the wyvern the handshake was crisp the glance keen are ye to be a channel groper b chance kydd loosened the champagne was cool and heady and his trepidation was changing by degrees into an irresistible surge of excitement aye so it seems fr my sins an new to our charming devonshire too new mr bazely all m service has been foreign since since i was a younker an im amazed at how im t take aboard enough t keep teazer frm ornamentin a rock one day all foreign yere t be reckoned lucky kydd as a midshipman i can recollect mooning about in a seventyfour at spithead and with no more sea service than a convoy to the downs for all o two years he mused for a moment then recollected himself but we have a whole evening looming ahead if yell excuse us mrs parlby i want to introduce m foreign friend here to some others as they moved slowly towards the side of the room he chuckled no lady in towi take it from this ye have no ties kydd none then where better to make your acquaintance wi the female sex than tonight they reached a group of young ladies with fans fluttering deep in excited gossip they turned as one and fell silent as the two officers approached fans stilled miss robbins miss amelia wishart miss emily wishart miss townley might i present commander kydd bazely said breezily and be ye advised that he is captain o the good ship teazer now lying in plymouth shortly to sail against the enemy miss townley is visiting from falmouth he added amiably kydd bowed to each feeling their eyes on him as they bobbed in return one bold another shy the others appraising his mind scrambled to find something witty to say but he fell back on a feeble yr servant ladies mr kydd are you from these parts the boldeyed miss robbins asked sweetly why no miss robbins but i do hope t make yr closer acquaintance kydd replied but was taken aback when the young ladies fell into a sudden fit of smothered giggles bazely laughed if yed excuse me m dears i have to return do see my friend is tolerably entertained kydd took in their waiting faces and tried to think of conversation er fine country is devon he ventured ive once been t falmouth as pretty a place as ever ive seen but mr kydd falmouth is in cornwall miss robbins laughed no it is not kydd said firmly they subsided looking at him uncertainly not at all falmouth is in antiguathe caribbean he added at their blank looks mr kydd you have the advantage over we stayathomes pray tell have you seen the sugar grow is it in lumps ready for the picking or must we dig it up it was not so difficult the ladies showing such an interest and so pleasantly was time passing that he nearly forgot his duty miss amelia he enquired graciously of the shyest and therefore presumably safest cn you find it in yr heart t reserve th cotillion for mself gratified he watched alarm then pleasure chase across her features why sir this is an honour she said with a wide smile a pity she was so diminutivenot like the admirals daughter who he had noted was nearly of a height with himselfbut miss amelia had a charmingly cherubic face and he could not help swelling with pride at the image of the couple they must present a disturbance on the floor resolved into the master of ceremonies clearing a space about him and the hum of conversation grew to a noisy crescendo then died away m lords ladies n gentlemen pray take your partnersfor a minuet kydd offered his arm it had seemed so awkward practising in the great cabin of hms teazer with renzi but now it felt natural it was to be expected that a stately minuet would open the ball but the dances elaborate graces and moves were too intimidating to consider until his confidence strengthened and they stood together on one side as the lines formed he nodded amiably to the one or two couples that had seemed to notice him and glanced down at his young lady she smiled back sweetly and kydds spirits soared it seemed that the admirals formidable wife was being led out by his flaglieutenant to open the dancing and kydd conscious of miss amelias arm on his sought conversation a fine sight yr grand ball is it not do ye have chance fr many her eyes grew wide oh sir i have come out only this season she said in a small voice that had kydd bending to hear thats as may bebut ill wager yell not want fr admirers in the future miss amelia the cotillion was announced kydd led her out with pride and they joined the eightsome opposite a starstruck maiden and her attentive beau a young lieutenant who bowed respectfully to kydd he inclined his head civilly and the music began miss amelia danced winsomely her eyes always on him the more vigorous measures bringing a flush to her cheeks kydd was sincerely regretful when it ended and he escorted her gallantly back to her friends somehow he found himself in the position of requesting that miss robbins grant him the pleasure of the next dance which luckily turned out to be gathering peascods a fashionable country dance that he had only recently acquired between the changes miss robbins learnt that he was widely travelled had been moderately fortunate in the matter of prizemoney and was unmarried kydd was made aware that miss robbins was from a local family much spoken of in banking and lived in buckfastleigh with her two younger sisters single like herself there was no question but that this was the world he might now call his own he was a gentleman and all now knew it at the final chords he punctiliously accorded miss robbins the honours of the dance then with her on his arm wended his way back to her chair happy chatter swelled on all sides he was conscious of the agreeable glitter of candlelight on his gold lace and epaulettes the welltailored sweep of his coat and knew he must cut a figure of some distinctionit was time to widen his social connections he threaded his way through the crowded ballroom and headed for the upper floor where there would be entertainment of a different sortcards and conversation at a glance he saw the tables with cardplayers and others politely attendant on them but also couples promenading sociable groups and forlorn wallflowers mr kydd ahoy a remembered voice sounded effortlessly behind him and he wheeled round mr bazely he acknowledged and went over to the table curious eyes looked up as he approached mrs watkins miss susanna this is commander kydd come to see how prodigious well the ladies play in devon do take a chair sir he said rising to his feet may i know how the pot goes kydd asked courteously remaining standing why four guineas mr kydd one of the ladies simpered sensing that bazely would not be averse to respite he replied sadly ah a mort too deep fr me madam turning to bazely he bowed and asked but if you sir are at liberty t speak with me of the country for a space id be obliged bazely made his excuses and they sauntered off in search of the punch table your mrs watkins is a hard beat t windward kydd he sighed gustily mr watkins being a fiend for dancing and always absentin himself he added with a glimmer of a smile tell me kydd asked how do ye find service in these waters if i might ask ye with a shrewd glance bazely said for the learning of seamanship an hard navigation it cant be beat the coast to the sou west is poor remote devilishly rockbound and a terror in a fresh blow he pondered for a moment the folk live on fishing mostly some coastal tradingand free tradin if they gets a chance kydd knew this was a local euphemism for smuggling so what sports t be had as it dares bazely grunted now at the punch table he found glasses and poured liberally getting bold and saucy yr johnny crapaud sees his best chance is not b comin up agin nelson an his battleships but going after our trade if he can choke it off he has us beat no trade no gold t pay for our war no alliesll trust us wed be finished the punch was refined and had none of the gaiety kydd remembered from the caribbean but ye asked me how i find the service bazely smiled aye it has to be said i like it no voyage too long home vittles waiting at the end entertainments t be had detached service so no bigfleet ways with a flagship always hanging out signals for yeand doing a job as is saving the country true enough kydd agreed come now mr fireeater should boney make a sally youll have all the diversion yed wish why here you are mr kydd a silvery voice cooed for shame neglecting the company to talk sea things im persuaded a gentleman should not so easily abandon the ladies miss lockwood i stan guilty as charged kydd said and offered his arm his heart leaping with exultation the admirals daughter chapter help yself to the bath cakes nicholasi did s well last evenin at supper kydd stretched out in his chair the morning bustle of a manowar sounded from on deck but gloriously this was the concern of others then your appearance in plymouthian society may be accounted a success renzi asked i did have my concerns for you in the article of gallantry it being a science of no mean accomplishing all fr nothing m friend the ladies were most amiable an im sanguine theres one or two would not hesitate t throw out th right signal t come alongside should i haul into sight kydds broad smile had renzi smothering one of his own do i take it from this you find the experience congenial aye ye do itsits another world t me new discovered an im minded t explore but for the time being you will be taking your good ship to war i believe kydd flushed m duty is not in question nicholas we sail wi the tide after midday what im sayin only is that if this is t be m future then i find it agreeable enough were t expect some hands frm the impress service afore we sail he added briskly thisll please kit standish their eighteen men shortfall translated to a oneinfour void in every watch and station he was uncomfortably aware that the first lieutenant had found it necessary to spread the crew of two forward guns round the others to provide full gun crews the impress service would try its best but after the hullabaloo of the hot press on the eve of the outbreak of war every true seaman still ashore would have long gone to ground kydd finished his coffeein hours teazer would be making for the open sea out there the cold reality of war meant that the enemy was waiting to fall upon him and his ship without mercy the extinction of them both a bounden duty was teazer ready was he he nodded to renzi i think ill take a turn about th deck pray do finish yr breakfast at two in the afternoon the signalling station at mount wise noted the departure of the brigsloop teazer as she passed devils point outward bound through plymouth sound on her way to war what they did not record was the hurry and confusion about her decks m compliments an ask mr standish t come aft kydd snapped at the midshipman messenger beside him battling teazers exuberant motion andrews staggered forward to the first lieutenant who was spluttering up at the foretopmen mr standish this will not do growled kydd their first fight could well take place within hours and their sailhandling was pitiful i see yr captain o the foretop does not seem t know how t handle his men well do it again an tell him hes to give up his post t another unless he can pull em togetheran that directly sir only one bell fr grog an supper then we go t quarters to exercise gun crews until dusk he lowered his tone and continued grimly were not s big we can wait until were strong do ye bear down on em if y please while they were exercising on a straight course south and safely out to sea they were away from the coast and not performing their assigned task kydd kept the deck all afternoon he knew that the sailors so recently in the grogshops and other entertainments of the port would be cursing his name as they laboured the occasional flash of sullen eyes showed from the pressed menthere had been only nine men and a boy sent out to teazer before she sailed all of questionable worth there were so few of her company he knew and trusted when eight bells sounded at the beginning of the first dogwatch sail was shortened and after a quick supper it was to the guns until the long summer evening came to a close teazers bow still to seaward kydd would not rest one by one the seniors of the ship were summoned to the great cabin and over a glass of claret he queried them concerning the performance of their men their strengths and prospects it was not to be hurried the intricate process of turning a collection of strangers into a strong team that would stand together through the worst that tempests and the enemy could bring kydd knew that any weaknesses would become apparent all too quickly under stress of weather or battle the following day broke with blue skies and a clear horizon both watches went to exercise and at the noon grog issue kydd saw the signs he was looking forthe previously wary defensive responses were giving way to confident chatter and easy laughter that spoke of a shared challenging existence this would firm later into a comradely trust and reliance already characters were emerging the loud and overbearing the quiet and efficient those who hung back leaving others to take the lead the ones who made a noisy show with little effect the eager the apprehensive the brash his seniors would be picking up on them all and he in turn would be taking their measureit was the ageold way of the sea where the actions of an individual could directly affect them all in the early afternoon they wore about to reverse course back to plymouth but kydd was determined that his ship should take up her station without the smallest delay when the misty rolling devon coast firmed again there was only one decision to be madewith his home port at the midpoint of his patrol area should he go upchannel or down the weather was fair seas slight with a useful breeze from the atlantic mr dowse to set us t the westward if y please he ordered ready or no teazer was going to war for him it would be a much different conflict from those he had experienced so far there was no specific objective to be won no foreign shores with exotic craft and unknown threats it would be a challenge of seakeeping and endurance that might explode at any time into a blazing fight that must be faced alone kydd recognised the massive triangular rockface of the great mewstone the eastern sea mark of plymouth sound that and the sprawling heights of rame head on the other side he knew from before but then he had been a distracted captain about to set forth on his urgent mission to france now his duty was to close with the land to go against all the instincts of his years at sea and keep in with this hard fractured coastline there were other sail some taking advantage of the flurries and downdraughts from the cliffs and appearing unconcerned at the hazards sternly advised in the chart and coastpilot no doubt they were local fishermen who had lived there all their lives once past penlee and rame head the tenmile sweep of whitsand bay opened up dowse moved closer ifn we wants t clear all dangers between here n looe we keep th mewstone open o rame head kydd noted the tone of careful advice it would be easy for the master to slip into condescension or reserve and he needed this mans sea wisdom in these waters aye then thats what well do mr dowse he responded and glancing astern he watched as the faroff dark rock slid obediently into alignment with the bluff face of rame head with teazer a good three miles offshore this left a prudent distance to leeward in the brisk winds kydd relaxed a little he and his sailing master would likely get along the earlysummer sun was warm and beneficent it set the green seas aglitter and took the edge off the cool atlantic winds with teazer eagerly taking the waves on her bow and held to a taut bowline kydd could not think of anywhere he would rather be he gazed along the decks his first lieutenant was standing forward one foot on a carronade slide as he observed the topmen at work aloft the watch on deck were busy tying off the lee lanniards as new rigging took up the strain purchet had a party of hands amidships sending up a fresh main topmast staysail and kydd knew that below the purser was issuing slops to the pressed men with renzi and young calloway preparing the recast quarters bill somewhere under their lee were the first tiny ports of cornwallportwrinkle and looe then the remote smuggling nest of polperro this was quite different country from the softer hills of devon and he was curious to set foot in it the afternoon wore on the big bay curved outwards again and ended in precipitous headlands and steep rocky slopes with a little more south in the wind whitsand bay could well be a trap embayed a squarerigged ship would not be able to beat out and would end impaled on those same rocks makin good time mr kyddthats fowey ahead beyond th inner point the visibility was excellent and kydd lifted his telescope presumably the port lay between the far headland and the near landmass he picked out the dark red of the oakbarktanned sails of inshore craftbut nowhere the pale sails of deeperwater vessels fowey then i believe well pay a visit mr dowse fowey dowse had pronounced it foywas one of the customs ports and well situated at the halfway point between plymouth and the oceanfacing port of falmouth no doubt they would welcome a call from the navy and it was his duty to make himself known and check for orders mr standish well moor fr the nightno liberty t the hands o course there was no point in sending the men so soon to sail into temptation i shall make m call on th authorities an i require ye to keep the ship at readiness t sail aye aye sir standish said crisply an find me a boats crew o trusties if y please the busy rush of the waves of the open sea calmed as they passed within the lee of gribbin head the looming far headland leavin punch cross a cables length berththats th rocks yonderuntil we cn see the castle dowse told him kydd gratefully tucked away all such morsels of information at the back of his mind they glided through the narrow entrance and into the tranquillity of the inner harbour in the evening light and let go the anchor into the wide stretch of water that had opened up a twinkle of lights began to appear in the small town opposite through the myriad masts of scores of ships nicholas do ye wish t step ashore or are books more to yr taste said kydd as he changed from his comfortable but worn sea rig renzi looked up he had taken to reading in the easy chair by the light of the cabin window when kydd was not at ships business this was more than agreeable to kydd as now his cabin had lost its austere and lonely atmosphere and taken on the character of a friendly retreat exactly as he had dared to imagine when the romans invaded these islands brother the native britons who did not succumb to the blandishments of civilisation were driven to the remote fastnesses of cornwall and wales there to rusticate in barbarian impunity thus we might account the natives here foreignersor are we i have a yen to discover the truth of the matter and add this t your bag o ethnical curiosities id wager just so renzi agreed then id be obliged if yed keep sight o the boat once we land ive no notion how long ill be it was stirk at the jollyboats tiller poulden at stroke with calloway opposite and a midshipman at each of the two forward oars kydd gave the order to put off andrews struggled with his big oar and tried his best to follow poulden while the larger boyd handled his strongly but with little sense of timing poulden leant into the strokes theatrically giving the youngsters every chance to keep with him as they made their way across the placid waters towards the town quay stay within hail if y please kydd called down from the long stone wharf after he had disembarked this left it up to stirk to allow a small measure of freedom ashore for his crew but as kydd and renzi moved away he saw the boat shove off once again and savage growls floated back over the water the trip back would be more seemly than the coming had been nestled against steep hills the town was compact and narrow the main quay had substantial stone buildings some medieval to renzis delight and all along the seafront a jumbled maze of small boatbuilders reeking fish quays and pokey alleyways met the eye they were greeted with curious stares along the evening bustle of fore streetword would be going out already in the fowey taverns that a kings ship had arrived the harbour commissioners office was at the end of the quays before the narrow road curved away up a steep slope inside a single light showed renzi made his farewell and kydd went up to the undistinguished door and knocked a figure appeared carrying a guttering candle before kydd could say anything the man said gruffly the brigsloopcome to show yself right aye sir commander thomas kydd sloop teazer at y service his bow was returned with an illnatured grunt as ive been waiting for ye he grumbled beckoning kydd into what appeared to be a musty waiting room illuminated by a pair of candles only brandy are ye the harbour commissioner sir kydd asked port o fowey t lostwithiel an all outportsbibby by name mr bibby to you capn the spirit was poured in liberal measure might i know why yeve been waitin for me kydd said carefully bibby snorted and settled further into a leather armchair ye were sighted in the offing afore y bore up for foweystands t reason yell want to make y number with me he gulped at his brandy so in course im awaiting here for ye kydd sippedit was of the finest quality and quickly spread a delicious fire i dont understand why bibby slammed down his glass then clap y peepers on those y see there he spluttered gesturing out of the window into the dusk at the lights from the multitude of ships at anchor were all awaiting for you mr damn kydd kydd coloured i dont see wars been on wi boney for weeks now an never a sight of a ship o force as will give em the confidence t put to sea wheres the navy mr kydd at sea where it belongs an if i cn remark it wheres the spirit as keeps a ship bailed up in harbour fr fear of whats at sea kydd came back bibby paused then went on gruffly yere new on the coast let me give ye somethin t ponder heres a merchant captain and he has a modest kind o vessel say no moren four five hunnerd tons like all hes concerned to see his cargo safe t port as it says in his papers but in this part o the world hes not doin it for a big tradin companyno sir for in his hold is bulk an goods from every little farm an village around and about brought down b packmule oxwagon and a mans back t load aboard in the trust itll get to the cattewater falmouth the big tradin ports upchannel he sails wi the tidean gets took right away by a privateer thats bad but whats worse is that these folk o the humble sort have put all their means into the cargo and now its lost no insurancein time o war its ruinous expensive and they cant afford it so theyre done for sir quite finished it may be the whole village is ruined and the sailors from these parts their loved uns ll now be without a penny an on the parish the ship shell be on shares from the same parts now all lost so youre going down now t the quay an tellin our merchant captain to his face as hes a cowardly knave for preservin his ship when he knows as theres at least three o the beasts out there kydd kept his tone even theres three frenchy privateers been sighted in these waters where was thisn exactly well three ships taken these last two days stands t reason anyways one we know we call the bugger bloody jacques on account he doesnt hesitate to murther sailors ifn hes vexed then its one privateer fr certain only and ive yet t see a corsair stand against a manowar in a fair fight sir kydd said stoutly but a hundred and fifty miles of coastline defended by himself alone however there was something he could do he took a deep breath and said an so well have a convoy im t sail fr falmouth presently an any who wishes may comeer that is only deepwater vessels desirous o protection before joining their reglar atlantic convoy there this was going far beyond his orders which called only for his assistance to existing convoys chancing through his area convoys were formed solely by flagofficers and were complex and troublesome to administer with their printed instructions to masters special signals and all the implications of claims of legal responsibility upon the admiralty once a vessel was under the direction of an escort by taking it on himself to declare a convoy he had thereby assumed personal responsibility for any vessel that suffered capture and in that case would most surely face the destruction of his career and financial ruin i shall speak with th masters in the morning if yed be s good as to pass the word kydd said nicholas ive declared a convoy kydd mumbled through his toast have you indeed dear fellow renzi replied adding more cream to his coffee er are you sure this is within the competence of your sloop commander however eminent despite his anxiety kydd felt suddenly joyful at last the decision might have been his but never more would he have to face one alone perhaps not but can y think of aught else as will stir em t sea teazer is a fine ship but one escort i saw a cutter at moorings upriver off bodinnickshell have only a ltenantincommand and thusly my junior shortly hell hear that hes now t sail under my orders she would help considerably but it would be little enough escort for the dozen or so deepwater vessels he could see at anchor if they could get away to sea quickly though word of them would not reach the jackals on the other side of the channel in time so would ye rouse out every hand aboard cn drive a quill ive some instructions fr the convoy t be copied an i mean to have em given out after i talk kydd pushed back his plate and began jotting down his main points a simple private identifying signal instructions to be followed if attacked elementary distress indicators vanes wefts and other arcane features of a proper convoy were an impossibility but should he consider the customary large numbers painted on each ships quarter hms teazer led a streaming gaggle of vessels all endeavouring eagerly to keep with her in the light winds past the ruins of polruan castle and the ugly scatter of the punch cross rocks in the open sea and with the rounded greengrey headland of the gribbin to starboard she hove to allowing the convoy to assemble kydds instructions had specified that teazer would be in the van with sparrow the cutter taking the rear her elderly lieutenant had been indignant when prised from his comfortable berth and had pleaded lack of stores and water but kydd was having none of it and the little craft was now shepherding those at the rear out to sea the wind was light in this first hour after dawn kydds plan was to make the safety of falmouth harbour before dark but a dazzling glitter from an expanse of calm waters met him to seaward the light airs were fluky about gribbin head and kydd shook out enough sail to ease away slightly he looked back to check on sparrow but she was still out of sight and the narrow entrance was crowded with vessels issuing forth in an unholy scramble to be included in the convoy the little bay would soon be filled with jockeying ships which in the slight breeze would have little steerage way and before long there would be collisions there was nothing for it but to set sail without delay teazer bore away in noble style as if conscious of her grand position as convoy leader an excited andrews pointed high up to the rounded summit of gribbin head where an unmistakable flutter of colour had appeared signal station sir said standish smartly bringing up his glass kydds eyes however were on the ships crowding into the baythere were scores he swivelled round and squinted against the glare of the open sea now would be a sovereign opportunity for bloody jacques to fall upon the unformed herd and take his pick it was fast turning into a nightmare cant seem to make em out standish muttered bracing his telescope tightly they must have been perplexed to see the port suddenly empty of shipping and were probably wanting reassurance a small thud and a lazy puff of gunsmoke drew attention to the hoist but it hung limp and unreadable in the warm still airs hells bloody bells kydd snarled there was no way he could conduct a conversation by crude flag signals at this juncture god rot th pratting lubbers for a he checked himself we didnt see em did we he bit off tell prosser t douse his acknowledgekeep it at th dip standish gave a conspiratorial grin aye aye sir it was perfect weather for those ashore enjoying the splendid view of so many ships outward bound the mists of the morning softened every colour where sea met sky the green of the water graded imperceptibly into the higher blue through a broad band of haze an intense paleness suffused by the sunlight take station astern y mumpin lunatic kydd roared at an eager west country lugger trying to pass them to the wider sea his instruction to the convoy had been elementary essentially a follow me that even the most stupid could understand he took off his hat and mopped his brow aware that he was making a spectacle of himself but not caring the milling throng began to string out slowly and at last in the rear kydd saw sparrow but she was not making much way in the calm air and was ineffectual in her task of whipping in the stragglers indeed teazer found herself throwing out more and more sail the zephyr that had seen them out of harbour was barely enough to keep up a walking pace however with gribbin head now past and the wider expanse of st austell bay opening up abeam they had but to weather dodman point and would then have a straight run to st anthonys head and falmouth apart from the insignificant inshore craft the sea was mercifully clear of sail but who could know with the bright haze veiling the horizon looking back astern again kydd saw a dismaying number of ships strung out faithfully following in his wake by turns he was appalled and proud the undisciplined rabble was as unlike a real convoy as it was possible to be but on the other hand he and his fine sloop had set the argosy on its way how dye believe were proceedin mr dowse kydd said dowses significant glance at the feathered dogvane lifting languidly in the mainshrouds followed by a measured stare at the even slope of the dodman was eloquent enough i mislike that mist in the suns eye i do sir id like t lay the dodman at th least two mile under our lee very well mr dowse the band of haze had broadened but charged as it was with the new suns splendour kydd had paid it little attention but if this was a seafog it was unlike any he had seenthe dank close ones of the grand banks the cool welcome mists of the mediterranean surely this summer haze should give no problem hoist keep better station kydd called to the pair at the signal halliards sparrow seemed to have recovered some of the sea breeze but was crossing about behind their flock to no apparent purpose after a few minutes she drew back to the centre of the rear but it was clear they were going to get no reply either the humble cutter did not possess a full set of signal bunting or her captain did not see why he should play bigfleet manoeuvres at kydds whim sir dowse nodded meaningfully at the haze it was broader and the luminous quality at its midpart now had an unmistakable core soft and virginal white kydd glanced at the dodmanst austell bay had swept round again to culminate in this historic point ahead one of the major sea marks for generations of mariners over the centuries it was now far closer the menace of gwineas rocks to starboard showed stark and uglyand the band of misty haze was wide enough now to touch the lower limb of the sun early summer sir in a southerly ye sometimes find as after it passes over th cool seas itll whip up a thick mist quick as yed like specially ifn the wind veers more t the west the sun was now reduced to a pearlescent halo the foot of the advancing mist clearly defined things had suddenly changed for the worse kydd glanced at the looming precipitous bluff it was so unfair another mile and they would have weathered the point but they would be overtaken by the rolling mist just as they reached the hazards to the south of the dodman the heavy tidal overfalls of the bellows stretching out for a mile or more into the channel to fall back from where they had come with his unwieldy armada in an impenetrable fog and a lee shore was impossible and a dash north for mevagissey or one of the other tiny harbours marked on the chart was out of the question for a complete convoy kydd bit his lip he could not return neither could he go on and chance that unseen currents and an onshore wind would draw teazer and the convoy on to the deadly bellows should he anchor and wait it out that would risk his charges who expecting him to press on might blunder about hopelessly looking for him the first cool wisps of the mist brushed his cheek the world changed to a calm enveloping uniform white that left tiny dewdrops on his coat and rendered nearby vessels diaphanous ghosts that disappeared kydd took a deep breath and made his decision he was about to give the orders when he saw a still form standing back why mr renzi i didnt notice ye on deck before he said distracted you will anchor i believe i never doubted it kydd replied nettled at renzis easy observation then he realised that the words were intended as a friendly contribution to the burden of decisionmaking and added aye the greater risk is t go on he took a few paces forward mr dowse way off the ship mr purchet hands t mooring ship well wait it out their bower anchor splashed noisily into the calm and the wind died to a whisper dowse had previously recorded careful bearings of the shore and had now himself taken a cast of the lead and was inspecting the gravel and broken shells at its base a sepulchral dong from close astern was answered by their own bell struck enthusiastically by a ships boy there was an occasional muffled crack of a swivel gun from a nervous vessel other sounds near and distant came flatly from all round them the mist swirled gently past as kydd peered over the bulwarks he could see the water was sliding along on its way aft equally on both sides the tide was on the make and at her anchor teazer was headed into it and therefore would be facing into the currents surging round the dodman they were as safe as it was possible to be in the circumstance and could only wait for the sun to burn off the mist it was little more than an hour later that the forms of vessels could be made out once more and the sun burst through kydd scanned about anxiously and his heart lurched as he saw that of the dense mass of ships that had followed him to sea there were only ten or fifteen left had they failed to notice him anchor had they drifted ashore been taken by a corsair in the fog such a practical race of sailors renzi murmured what kydd said sharply why im sure youve made notice that these vessels remaining are your deepsea species only the small fry being local have navigated clear and inspired by your actions have for a surety pressed on to falmouth his friend was right of course kydd acknowledged grudgingly then smiled in brilliant sunshine and a strengthening breeze what remained of the convoy won its anchors and rounded the dodman they took little more than an hour in the fine southeasterly to lay the dramatic gull rock to starboard and by early afternoon they made falmouth bay kydd however had no intention of going ashore at falmouth and possibly having to make explanation so he rounded to well off the entrance his charges passed into the harbour some with a jaunty hail of thanks the cutter tacked about smartly and disappeared without ceremony it had been an experience but teazer was accounting herself well in this her first war cruise mr standish course south an all sail abroad i mean t clear the manacles before dusk an then we snug down fr the night aye aye sir the first lieutenant confirmed his orders were chalked on the watchkeepers slate and teazer shaped her course eran pipe hands t supper with a double tot fr all kydd added there was no reason by way of service custom for the generosity but he felt his little ship and her company had reached a milestone dawn arrived overcast the ship had stood off and on in the lee of the lizard throughout the night and was now closing with the coast once morethe massive irongrey granite of black head loomed there was nothing around but fishing craft and in the distance a shabby coastal ketch kydd decided to send the men to breakfast then put about to press on westward this would mean a closer acquaintance of that most evocative of all the sea marks of the southwest the lizard the exact southerly tip of great britain and for most deepocean voyages the last of england the men saw on their way to war or adventure fortune or death it was as well the longedfor landfall for every returning ship running down the latitude of finally to raise the fabled headland and the waters of home kydd had seen the lizard several times and each experience had been differentwatching it emerge leaden and stolid from curtains of rain or seeing it dappled dark and grey in the sunshine and sighted twenty miles awaybut always with feeling and significance do ye lay us in with th coast mr dowse kydd ordered curiosity was driving him to take a closein sight of this famed place ohyounker he called to a rapt midshipman my compliments t mr renzi an id be happy t see him on deck he would never be forgiven if it were missed the master pursed his lips aye sir a board to the suthard will give us an offing of somethin lessn a mile thank ye kydd said gravely with the southwesterly strengthening it was a dead lee shore around the point and asking a lot of the master to approach they stood away to the south until the last eastern headland was reached beyond the atlantic swell crowding past the lizard was resulting in ugly tumbling seas that put teazer into violent motion the wind now with real strength in it producing long white streaks downwind from the crests the land receded as the offing was made then approached again after they went about on the other tack the seas almost directly abeam causing the brig to roll deeply call down th lookouts kydd snapped even at forty feet with the motion magnified by height the situation for the men in the foretop would be dangerous and near unendurable dowse pointed inshore where the sea met the land in a continuous band of explosions of white manowar reef the quadrant yonder he indicated a cluster of dark rocks standing out to sea and in furious altercation with the waves an lizard point there it was the southernmost point of england and the place kydd had always sighted before from the sanctity and safety of the quarterdeck of a shipoftheline he clung to a weather shroud and took it all in the abrupt thump of waves against the bow and a second later the stinging whip of spray leaving the taste of salt on his tongue they eased round to the northwest and into the sweeping curve of mounts bay the last before the end of england the scene was as dramatic as any kydd had met at sea completely open to the hardening southwesterly and long atlantic swell piling in the rugged coastline was a smother of white kydd said nothing when he noticed the quartermaster was edging imperceptibly to seaward from the dead lee shore but turned to the master i think well give best t this souwesterly mr dowse is there any haven short o penzance to th westd none as we cn use sirthis is a hard piece o coast he gazed thoughtfully at the busy seas hurrying shoreward porthleven opens t the souwest nought else really mr kydd then penzance itll have t be mr boyd compliments t mr standish an i believe well send th hands t dinner after we moor there most would prefer the comfort of a hot meal later than a scratch one now the midshipman looked uncomfortable come come mr boyd lively now reluctantly the lad released his grip and lurched to another handhold kydd realised that his order sending the boy below would probably condemn him to the seasickness he had so far manfully avoided as teazer leant closer to the wind to clear a small island boyd slid down the canted deck to finish well soused in the scuppers the islet passed under their lee a tiny scatter of houses huddled together under dark precipitous cliffs at the head of a small patch of discoloured sand who lived in this impossibly remote place mullion cove siran there dowse had noticed a big threemasted lugger at anchor riding out the blow in the lee of the island the only vessel they had sighted since the lizard no doubt all smaller local craft had scuttled off prudently to find a harbour a wise man kydd replied but something niggled they plunged on an indistinct hail came from forward then calloway hurried aft and touched his forehead shyly sir i saw over on th land in them cottages yes it were red like frm the windows he trailed off dropping his eyes those nearby looked at each other in amusement but kydd knew calloway from the past his young eyes were probably the best in the ship tell me if y please he said kindly well as we was passin i saw somebody hold somethin red out o the window an as i watched i swear one b one they all has red out o their windows doggedly he went on an then sir they all starts shakin it like the amusement was open now titters starting from the waisters who had fallen back to hear i swear it mr kydd calloway blurted at a loss kydd looked about the little group on the quarterdeck all averted their eyes except renzi ah there is one conceivable explanation supposing our unlettered countryfolk were to recognise us as a kings ship equally suppose that they have a guest an unwelcome one who holds them in deadly thrall from where he lies at anchor the lugger how then should they signal their disquiet a red flag of some sort for danger i can see no other interpretation of such helm alee kydd bawled to the wheel luffn touch hermr dowse once we have th sea room we wear about an return in an instant the atmosphere aboard changed and activity became frenzied braces were manned by seamen slipping and sliding in the crazy bucketing as teazer was sent clawing offshore as close to the wind as she could lie only when they were at a sufficient distance from the dangerous shore could they risk a turn inwards to the land kydds mind raced a bloody engagementin these conditions it was preposterous but the logic of war demanded it he was now sure in his own mind that the anonymouslooking finelined lugger was an enemyand it was his duty to destroy him a dishevelled first lieutenant burst out on deck mr standish i believe weve surprised a frenchy privateer an i mean t take him well go t quarters only when we have to but i desire ye to bring th ship to readiness now aye aye sir there was no mistaking the fierce gleam in the officers eye kydd took out his pocket telescope and trained it aft on the lugger but the wild jerking made it near impossible to focus once he caught a dancing image of a vessel quite as big as their own a long bowsprit raked mizzenmast and a line of closed gun ports the whole length of the ship he forced his mind to coolness what were the elements in the equation he had never seen a northern french privateer lugger a breton chassemarée or others of this breed but he had heard of their reputation for speed on the wind and the daring impudence of their captains but no privateer worth his salt would take on a manowar their business and profit were in the taking of prizes not the fighting of battles kydd lifted the telescope and tried to steady it against a shroud but the brisk thrumming thwarted his efforts and he lowered it in frustration but by eye there was some movement aboard someone must have correctly interpreted teazers move as the precursor to a return and most likely they were now busy preparing a hot defencewith all the luggers men sent to the guns haaaands to stations t wear ship the manoeuvre of tacking was tighter but anything going wrong would result in their being blown rapidly ashore even so in wearing ship the act of deliberately turning their backs to the wind this close inshore had its own dangers kydd threw a final glance at the lugger held by his anchor directly into the wind there was sudden jerky activity at his prow they were cutting the cable exactly at the moment the vessel swung free a jib soared up from the long bowsprit and instantly caught the wind slewing his bow round then sail appeared on all three masts together evidence of a sizeable crew it was neatly done the lugger was now under way close inshore paralleling the coastand thereby closing with teazer the realisation hit kydd with a cold shock they were going to have to fight in the open sea and any advantage they had at the guns would be nullified by the wild circumstances what was the enemy thinking to try conclusions in these conditions when any victor would be unable to board and take their prize belay that he roared at the seamen ready at the braces stand down th men mr purchet the obvious course for the lugger was to throw over his helm at the right moment to take up on the other tack and with the advantage of his foreandaft rig slash straight out to where the closehauled teazer was striving desperately to get to seaward and then what it was clear when he thought about it the privateer needed only to bring about some little damage to their rigging and the weather would do the rest in these winds the squarerigged teazer would be driven out of control on to the whitelashed crags and be destroyed as utterly as if she had been cannonaded into ruin kydds grip on the shroud tightened it had changed so quickly and only one could see them through teazers captain he raised his eyes and met renzis his friend did not speak but gave a halfsmile standish gazed hungrily at the oncoming lugger while the others about the deck watched silently they must hold their course seaward the only question now was when to send the men to the gunsbut with the leeward bulwarks so low and seas swirling aboard any pretence at serving a gun there was futile on their lee side they were essentially defenceless the privateer gathered speed rolling wickedly with the seas abeam but making good progress a halfmile closer inshore kydd allowed reluctant admiration for the unknown seaman in command of her he must possess considerable local knowledge to feel so confident close to this grim coast kydd decided that the men would go to the guns precisely when the privateer put down his helm to tack in their direction he waited tensely for the lugger to find teazer at the right angle for that sudden slash towards minutes passed and still the privateer held her course down the coast the villains making a run fr it nicholas once again the situation had changed but kydd was beginning to appreciate his opponents clear thinking he had declined battle for good practical reasons and was now using his luggers superior rate of sailing to make off using that local knowledge to stay close inshore knowing his antagonist dared not do likewise were going after th rascal teazer eased away three points or so and no longer tight to the wind stretched out in fine style on the same course parallel to the coast but further seaward kydd guessed the privateers intention was to use his speed to pull far enough ahead to chance going about across their bows then to escape seaward with no risk of battle damage to cut short his cruise it was a shrewd movebut there was one essential not within their control the winds teazer was from the mediterranean the home of the savage tramontana and with just a single reef in her topsails was handling the bluster with ease her sturdy design well able to take the steeper seas close inshore the lugger on the other hand was making heavy weather of it with lugsails taut on all three masts he had not attempted topsails at the cost of his speed advantage the result was that teazer was more than holding with the privateer and paced the vessel the long sweep of mounts bay ahead ended suddenly at penzance and as long as they could keep sail on there would be a conclusion before the day was out it was an exhilarating charge along the whitestreaked waves rampaging towards the dour coastline the lugger tapping every resource of knowledge about rock and shoal in keeping so close in with the shore while teazer kept tight watch far enough offshore to have warning of any sudden move and in prime position to intercept a break for the open sea dowse pointed out the little settlements as they passed poldhu chyanvounder berepper and then porthleven foreignsounding exotic and untouchably remote a headland loomed its steep grey crags half hidden in misty spume beyond a beach all of a mile long stretched away with another larger promontory at its end now more than halfway to penzance was this where the attempt would be made as if in direct response to the thought dowse gave a sudden shout the aspect of the privateer was altering rapidlyhe was making his move and it was to seaward kydds stomach tightened to serve a gun in the insane rolling was madness yet how else was he going to fight then without warning every sail on the privateer disappeared and the baremasted vessel fell back still bows to sea until it was just clear of the breakers rolling into the beach well ill behes thrown out an anchor sir an hopes t ride it out till dark dowse said in open admiration if in fact that was the intention kydd mused hed already led them on a merry dance mr dowse heave to if y please he ordered it would give him time to think and for a short time preserve his superior position lying awkwardly diagonal across the line of whitecaps teazers motion changed from a deep rolling to a vicious whip as the waves passed at an angle down the pitching hull making it difficult to concentrate if the privateer muffled shouts from forwardan urgent man overboard kydd saw the fall of a sheet uncoil out to leeward and staggered to the side at first he saw nothing but foamstreaked waves in vigorous progression towards the shore but then he made out a dark head against the foam and an arm clutching frantically at air not five yards off it must have been a foremast hand caught by the sudden change of motion and pitched overboard kydd could not recognise him from the flailing shape but he was being carried by the waves impetus ever further from his ship poor beggar standish handed himself along to stand next to kydd but his eyes were on the enemy kydd said nothing his mind furiously reviewing his alternatives mr purchet secure a dan buoy to th kedge cable and sir youre not proposing a rescue why yes mr standish o course i am face set standish confronted kydd sir the lugger might take the opportunity to escape he might sir it is my duty to remind you that we are in the presence of the enemythat man is as much a casualty of war as if he had fallen from a shot the sailor was now several waves downwind and thrashing about in panic like most seafarers he could not swim what standish had said was undeniable but kydds plan would give the man a chance and still have them in some sort of position to more confused shouting came from forward then a figure rose to the bulwarks and toppled into the sea get forrard an find out what th hells goin on kydd snarled at standish with two in the water his plan was now in disarraywere they to be the first men to die in teazer clear away th cutter he bawled at the gaping mainmast hands it was the biggest boat they had and was secured up in its davits cut th gripes away damnit he shouted as they fumbled with the ropes this was a desperate throwhe would have the boat streamed off to leeward at the end of a line and hauled back bodily if it capsized the men could cling to it standish worked his way aft his face expressionless sir i have to report that midshipman andrews took it upon him to cast himself in the sea in an attempt to save the man four volunteers fr the boat kydd snapped each with a lifeline t a thwart what was the boy thinking to take such a risk it was madness but a noble act for one so young it was a fearsome thing to set the cutter afloat with the rocketing rise and dizzying fall of the seas under their stern but at least this was in teazers lee and temporary protection the seaman was out of sight downwind hidden by the driving combers but the midshipman could occasionally be seen striking out manfully for him in the welter of seas hes seen our boat standish said coldly watching the lugger a jib was jerking up in the privateer and when it had taken the wind other sails were smartly hoisted kydd refused to comment obstinately watching the cutter as line was paid out and it drew near to andrews sir hes under way and going round our stern weve lost him kydd glanced once at the lugger as it leant to the hammering southwesterly and made its escape derisory yells coming faintly over the tumult accompanied by rude gestures from the matelots along the decks the privateer was still in sight driving southwards towards france under all sail possible when the boat was hauled in half full of water with a soaked and subdued andrews the sailor had not been found will you follow him do you think renzi asked softly kydd had not seen his friend come up but now standish had moved away and was standing apart trying to catch the fastdisappearing lugger in his glass not today kydd said quietly it was over for the poor wretch who had reached out obediently to do his duty and found instead a lonely death in an hour or so a dark shape would appear in the line of breakers at the seas edge carelessly rolled about by the swash of surf they would retrieve it and give it a christian burial in penzance kydds eyes pricked no matter that he had seen so many lose their lives following their profession of the seathis had occurred on teazers first commission in home waters and he as captain things could never be the same feeling the need to be alone he left standish to lay teazer to her anchor went to his cabin sprawled in his chair and stared moodily out of the stern windows there was a soft knock at the door and renzi appeared come in old friend kydd said renzi made his way cautiously to the other chair the lively movement becoming more unpredictable as the ship felt her anchor you would think it fatuous of me should i remark that the sea is a hard mistress aye i would then but then o course it doesnt stop it bein true nicholas kydd heaved a sigh and continued softly its just thatthat they that go down to the sea in ships renzi intoned softly true as well renzi broke the moody silence is the frenchman to be blamed do you think he asked no kydd said decisively he has his duty an that hes doing main well he levered himself upright what takes m interest is that not only does he shine in his nauticals but he knows too damn much of th coast he reflected for a moment then said quietly hes goin t be a right tartar t lay by the tail m friend pensively he watched the shoreline come slowly into view as teazer snubbed to her anchor then added but we must account him our pigeon right enough what will i do nicholas there was no reply and when kydd turned to look at renzi he saw his friend with his arms folded regarding him gravely i find i must refuse to answer renzi said finally you let me be more explicit do you accept the undoubted fact that you have your limitations there was no use in being impatient when renzi was in logic kydd knew and he answered amiably that must be true enough nicholas then you must hold that this must be true for myself also aye and it follows that since you have advanced so far and so rapidly in the sea profession you must be gifted far beyond the ordinary to have achieved so kydd shifted uncomfortably if ye mean for myself i accept this without rancour that you are so much my superior in the nautical arts you have the technical excellence the daring andif i may make bold to remark itthe ambition that places you at such an eminence all of which sets my own small competences to the blush nicholas you therefore the corollary is inescapable and it is that if i were to venture an opinion in such matters then it will have sprung from so shallow a soil that it may not stand against one cultured to so full a bloom it would be an impertinence to attach weight or significance to it and from this we must accept therefore that it were better not utteredi shall not be offering a view on how you will conduct your ship nor praise and still less blame your decisions shall be yours to make and i like every one of teazers company will happily abide by them so there would be no private councilsofwar for there was no shifting renzis resolve logically arrived at but then it dawned on kydd close friends as they were nothing could be more calculated to drive a wedge between them than the holding of opposite opinions before an action only one of which would be proved correct to the discomfiture of the otherwhoever that might be renzi was putting their friendship before self kydd recognised for the future the decisions would be his own but unconditional warmth of the companionship would always be there at the trifling cost of some defining limits why thats handsomely said nicholas he replied softly he paused then began again in a different tone we have t put down the rascal thats clear but where t find him thats the rub renzi waited an i have notion where we might may i know your reasoning renzi said carefully evidently discussion was possible but advice and opinions were not i feel it in m bones our bloody jacques is not going home hes lost not a single spar in th meeting of uswhy should he give it away while he cn still cruise unspoken was the feeling that be damned to it he was going to have a reckoning for his own selfrespect so where just as soon as were able we clap on sail to th suthardi mean t make wolf rock b sunset wolf rock said renzi in surprise the dangerous single outcrop well out into the entrance to the channel was feared by all seafarers aye and er why renzi prompted pray excuse nicholas theres a mort t be done afore we sail there was now just enough time to punish andrews for breaking ship and hazarding his shipmates then deal with standish with penzance under their lee they left mounts bay for the south kydd had dealt kindly with andrews even as the letter of the law judged him guilty of desertion and what was worse that his captain had been presented with a situation not of his intending or control the crestfallen lad was given the thirtyfourth article of war to get by heart before claiming his supper standish however was a harder matter clearly quite sure of his opinion he had become cold and reserved in his dealings and would need careful handling if this were not to turn into something more charged within the hour they had left the shelter of the bay and headed out into the channel first to the south and the winds proving favourable further towards the open atlantic the seas moderated and as the afternoon continued the sun made an appearance setting all in their path aglitter in a last display before dusk tidell be an hour earliern falmouth hereabouts sir dowse said laconically aye its highwater springs sir he added with more feeling thatll be so i believe kydd didnt want any discussion about his dash for wolf rock for while his reasons could be explained logicallythe rocks position as a fine place of lookout squarely athwart both the eastwest and northsouth shipping channelshis conviction was based on intuition only in some way he knew that the privateer captain would head for friendly waters for the night but then turn about and believing teazer to be continuing her patrol along the south coast round the tip of cornwall to resume his depredations this time on the north coast but first he would have to pass within sight of wolf rockand there teazer would be waiting sir dowse went on heavily wolf rock covers at highwater spring tides kydd had seen the ugly rock several times from seaward but what dowse was saying meant that his plan to lie off with it in sight as a means of keeping his position during the dark hours and by knowing where it was guard against coming upon it unawareswas now questionable as if mocking him a pair of seagulls keened overhead while dowse waited with dour patience dusk drew in and somewhere out there just under the surface was a deadly cragit could be anywhere beneath the innocent waters ahead attempts in the past had been made to erect some kind of warning mark but the sea had always swept it away they could not continue into such danger ah it seems kydd stopped away on the weather bow there was a discontinuity in the wan light on the sea a black object that had appeared vanished then reappeared in the same place where it remained he stared at it eyes watering standish made a play of raising his telescope and lowering it again naught but a seal he said with studied boredom as we might expect this time of the year i remember that will do kydd said with relish the beast sits atop th rock clear away th best bower an stream anchor an we moor for the night why sir i hardly think dowse seemed lost for words mr purchet be sure an buoy th cables we may have t slip without a deal of warning anchor sir y knows that wolf rock is steep to seabed drops away twhat twenty thirty fathom the boatswain said uneasily hes right sir standish interjected if we were silence kydd roared hold y tongues all o you t question me on m own quarterdeckim not standin fr it he waited until he felt his fury subside then went on frostily th bower cables seven hundred n fifty feet out to its bitter end so with th usual allowance fr three times the depth o water we cn moor an with cable t spare it would be damnably little but the greater peril lay in blundering about a dangerous shore in the blackness of night by mooring fr the night well be in position ready in th morning an no danger of bein cast up on the rock he glared round defiantly and left the deck for standish to carry out his order an hour before dawn sir and er nothing in sight kydd struggled to wakefulness at tysoes gentle rousing he had spent a restless night even though at this distance offshore a spacious and soothing ocean swell had predominated over inshore fretfulness he dressed hastily and made his way to the dimness of the quarterdeck where prosser was on watch brisk mornin kydd said slapping his sides in the cold earlymorning breeze sir prosser said without emotion standing with his arms folded next to the empty helm do ye think well be lucky t day sir the watch on deck were forward rehanking falls and squaring away in the grey morning light kydd caught the flash of glances thrown in his directionhe needed no one to tell him the topic of their conversation the light strengthened it was uncanny to be anchored in the middle of the sea for while land was in sight from the masthead in accordance with kydds plan to be both invisible and allseeing there was nothing at all from deck level except an unbroken expanse of water and the disfiguring seawashed black of wolf rock away on their beam the men were piped to breakfast an hour later with nothing on the horizon and teazer lying to single anchor hands were turned to for exercise kydd paced along the deck time passed and apart from a small merchantman and a bevy of morning fishermen the coast remained clear standish wore a look of pained toleration as he went about the deck and renzi kept out of the way below sail hoooo in wi the landa big un there was no mistaking the animation in the mainmast lookouts voice kydd threw his hat to the deck and scrambled up the mainshrouds where away the lookout pointed to the distant dark band of coast and there indeed was a vessel of size on the bearingthe three pale blobs had to be sail on three masts kydd fumbled for his glass a lugger sprang into view and with that oddly raked mizzen there could be little doubt deck hooo he yelled in exultation enemy in sight buoy an slip this instant d ye hear he swung out and descended hastily thinking of what he might say to standish but nothing clever came to mind and he contented himself with the brisk orders that sent the men to their stations for rapid transition from quiescence to flying chase he had been right his intuition was sound and the privateer had returned to the place kydd had reasoned he would at anchor far to seaward and without sails abroad they were invisible to the unsuspecting frenchman who had passed gwennap head and was therefore now committed to the passage round to the north he was due an unpleasant surprise the buoy with the anchor cable secured to it splashed away to set them free and sail dropped from the yards as if in sudden eagerness teazer caught the wind and leant towards their quarry who must now be in complete astonishment at the manowar that had appeared from nowhere like a magic spell and was now hot on his heels it would be a tight chase again they were well to windward of their prey in a southwesterly and again the privateer could not contemplate putting about to return for that would require tacking round and right into the path of his pursuer but this time teazer was perfectly positioned and conditions could not have been bettered the winds were strong and in her best quarter for sailing while the privateer was being forced against the coast as it trended to the northwest to lands end which must first be rounded before they could bear away along the north coast in less than an hour the two ships would reach a point of convergence somewhere close to the longships lighthouse which stood atop a group of wicked rocks extending out from this final promontory how to open the action there was little need for lengthy planning however the lugger would lie under their guns to leeward in a very short time and his guncaptains would know what to do then kydd sent for his sword remembering to speak encouraging words to those for whom this would be a first taste of powder and in good time hms teazer went to quarters the tumbling mass of grey rock that was the very tip of england drew closerso did the lugger sailing perilously in with the cliffs and rolling uncomfortably from the seas on her beam every detail became clear the faded black sides soaring pale lugsails with odd offsquare topsails straining above and no colours of any sort flying a point of red at her bow had kydd reaching for his telescope under its bold bowsprit was a figurehead a crimson fighting cock with spurs extended in ferocious challenge i own i stand rebuked for want of faith sir standish said quietly he stood in front of kydd and bowed awkwardly that is bloody jacques for a suretyi heard a lot of him in fowey ah i had th feeling kydd said lightly we open fire t stbd he went on and resumed his hungry stare at the privateer when were within pistolshot teazers carronades were deadly at close quarters but not to be relied on for accuracy beyond a few hundred yards it would not be a onesided fight that much was certain while teazer outgunned the similarly sized vessel her company would be so much less than that of a privateer crowded with prizecrew and she must at all costs remain out of reach of the torrent of boarders yet she must close the rangeand risk any sudden lunge to grapple i can almost feel pity for the frenchman renzis calm reassuring voice came from behind him kydd had not noticed his clerk take up his station for battle his halfsmile was in place and he wore a plain fighting hanger but in accordance with duty held a regulation notebook to record all significant events the privateer lay no more than seventy yards ahead and kydd could see the small group round the helm clearly one was certainly the shrewd captain looking back at teazer and weighing his chances the longships with its lighthouse now lay close ahead and with rising exhilaration kydd began to estimate distances and sea room on what must soon be the field of battle they had successfully crowded the lugger against the coastline and now it must shape course towards them to get round the longshipsthat would be the time to let the seven starboard guns do their work kydd drew his sword and raised it high teazers he roaredthen stopped in bafflement the privateer was not altering course while teazer was hauling her wind to round the longships the big lugger carried on with a full press of sail heading for the narrow band of open white water between the shoreline and the lighthouse be damned throw up yr helm poulden an follow in his wake sir where he cn swim so can we mr standish kydd tried not to think of teazers keel cleaving the water a couple of fathoms below them as they bore off into the narrowing space between the lighthouse rocks and the cliffs what if the lugger had been specially designed with a light draught for just this inshore work kydd clutched the shroud he was holding as they plunged throughdark shadows of kelpstrewn rock in the sea flicking past under them the wind gusted and flawed so close to the shore another smaller outlying group of rocks surged white off to portand bloody jacques opened fire admittedly they were fourpounder chase guns only but both of teazers were aft for defence and in kydds cabin the manoeuvre through the channel had brought both vessels into line and now as they bucketed madly along teazer must suffer the vicious slam of shot across her decks with the wind now dead astern they swept through together and on the other side it became clear that in these conditions teazer had the edgethe lugger was slowly but surely being overhauled as soon as they had established an overlap the move was as unexpected as it was effective like a dancer pirouetting the privateer threw down his helm and came up into the wind as close as he could lie in the process bringing his entire broadside to bear the gunsmoke was whipped away quickly downwind but kydd felt the sickening crunch in the hull where balls had struckand not a gun could they fire in return the lugger was now away on the wind the distance increasing by the second follow he bellowed directly at the quartermaster poulden who spun the wheel furiously teazer moved round more slowlyher square rig needed men at the braces instead of the guns now it was lunacy closehauled the privateer was now headed to pass the longships and reach open sea where presumably teazer would find sea room to force a conclusion but was this a desperate attempt to shake off a pursuer or kydd glanced at dowse the master was tense and his white face told kydd he had knowledge of perils that he was keeping to himself while in contact with the enemy renzi was looking up from noting the change of course but everyone else was gazing after the lugger whose deck seemed crowded with men the occasional glint of steel among them giving point to their threat the privateer captain was wily and kept a fine discipline to handle his ship as he hadthere had to be a reason for his strange move and there was at precisely the right place the luggers bow swung passing through the winds eye took up on the other tack and stood away to the southeast it was a masterstroke the squarerigged teazer needed room to manoeuvre if she wanted to tack about and must go beyond the longships the foreandaftrigged lugger had gone about neatly enough but additionally he had taken advantage of the rocky outlier and was now threading between it and the longships to return the way he had come and would be long gone by the time teazer could follow sir no but kydd had no intention of trying to emulate the corsair they had to let him go he let out his breath in a sigh of appreciation at the princely display of seamanship watching the lugger thrashing southward and turned to standish a right devil should we have we could do no other sir im persuaded and if i might make remark our motions must have given him pause he may well decide to prey on less welldefended shores why thank ee mr standish but ive a feelin well be meetin again ill not forget this day the ships company of hms teazer gathered beside an open grave the vicar of the ancient gulval church had performed this office so many timesthe sea giving up its dead from shipwreck foundering piracy and war these at least had a christian burial far more had been removed from human ken and had not returned from a voyage they had died far from home of disease a fall from aloft any one of the multitude of hazards lying in wait for every seafarer the young foretopman shyly added his handful of earth to the rest on the coffin conscious of the sombre eyes of his shipmates packed closely about the grave he stepped back and raised his eyes to his captain kydd understood and looked at the vicar who nodded solemnly er they that go down t th sea in ships he began and stopped he was the captain his ship had suffered her first loss to the sea and they were looking to him for words of strength the trouble was that he himself had been affected by the death more so for its occurring not in the heat of battle but in the course of the seamans obedience to his own commands he gulped and tried to concentrate we all who use th sea the unseen perils must find courage our duty to th end the unblinking eyes watching him gave no indication of the seamens thoughts when he clapped on his hat they returned down the little road to penzance kydd stood for a moment longer by the graveside then his eyes met renzis wordlessly they turned and followed chapter with six sailoftheline at anchor in cawsand bay and plymouth sound alive with wartime shipping it was probably too much to expect any to notice the arrival in port of so modest a vessel as the brigsloop teazer but commander kydd didnt care pacing his own quarterdeck in his best coat and breeches he was ready for any summons from the admiral after a not uneventful first war cruise the challenge flag fluttered up the mast of the signal station at mount wise and teazers reply shot up the lee halliards as she eased to larboard to avoid an ungainly indiaman working her way seaward then within a few hundred yards of the grassy sward of plymouth hoe teazers helm went over for the final mile to the notorious devils point and the entrance to the hamoazeand rest kydd concentrated on the approach the vicious currents in the narrows had claimed many victimstheir bleached timbers could still be seen on the banks in the fine weather people were thronging the pleasant gardens on the point why theres a beauty wants to be noticed standish exclaimed he had his telescope trained on one particular lady who was waving both arms enthusiastically distracted kydd turned back to the conn but something about that figure if y please he asked and took a peek it was cecilia mr prosser dip th ensign standish looked at kydd with alarm my sister he said defensively obediently teazers colours lowered six feet and proudly returned he had no idea why she was there but her gaiety did not seem to indicate a family crisis after teazer had picked up her moorings he penned a quick note to go ashore with the first boat inviting her aboard after the flurry of official business which always awaited a warship returning from a cruise boat ahoy blared the mateofthewatch at the approaching pinnacethere was really no need for it plainly bore only an assortment of passengers but its coxswain poulden bellowed the required no no to indicate that no naval officer was coming aboard cecilia climbed daintily over the bulwarks handed across by an attentive kydd who tried not to notice the look of admiration she received from standish his elaborate bow however was lost on her she threw her arms determinedly round her brother and kissed him soundly to the delight of the seamen on deck dear thomas im so thrilledyou have no idea captain of your ship why yes er welcome on board hms teazer cecilia kydd said hastily an this is he turned to the two other passengers stepping aboard oh you must remember jane she invited me to stay and how could i refuse the lady dimpled with pleasure at the introduction and shyly held out her hand as cecilia continued in jamaica i helped at her wedding to william and we all had dinner together that time the thickset man grinned broadly i was a lowly ensign o foot he chuckled clearly impressed to know the captain of a kings ship and apparently not recalling that in jamaica kydd had been but the quartermasters mate of a tiny cutter cecilia took his arm with determination do take us about your ship thomas she said with an impish smile kydd cleared his throat importantly mr standish let me know if ye have any troublesill be takin these people fr a tour his visitors showed every delight at the sights to be had in a manowar towering masts with their incomprehensible tracery of rigging the soaring naked bowsprit so immensely long at close quarters the deadly fascination of the line of guns at either side the compass binnacle and spoked helm now motionless heads were bumped on the deckhead below but they were able to see for themselves the clean expanse of the messdeck with its tables triced up and ditty bags against the side the boatswain affably displayed his store and they witnessed at first hand the procedure for the issuing of victuals to the messcooks for preparation finally they entered the great cabin of hms teazer and admired the noble appointments accorded the ships captain cecilias eyes shone as she looked up at her brother while her friends peered hesitantly into kydds sleeping cabin he whispered an yere invited t the captains table at eight bells tonight sis it called for sherry all round before kydd had regretfully to announce that owing to pressure of work he must conclude their tour and send them ashore they returned on deck blinking in the sunshine but cecilia hung back thomas she said in a small voice we havent seen nicholas aye well he doesnt like t be disturbed y see he said uncomfortably renzis instructions had been clear she met his eyes levelly but said nothing ah b chance he might be at leisure t see you he said and excused himself to his visitors and went below hearing cecilias footsteps tapping behind him the tiny cabin had its curtain pulled across but kydd cleared his throat and said brightly nicholaser heres someone desirous o speaking with ye there was movement and renzis head poked out he paused when he saw kydds sister then turned and looked accusingly at kydd cecilia gave an encouraging smile and said sweetly so kind in you sir to receive us without notice do i find you in health her eyes were already straying beyond the curtain and renzi with a curious air of dignity yet defiance answered i do thank you for your politeness but as you may see i cannot in all civility invite you to enter kydd hastened to say oh er youll understand cec we dont have an overplus o room aboard an this is how nicholas wants it cecilia stooped to see inside ignoring renzis pained expression why this is nothing but your monks cell she said taking in its spartan simplicity its just the right place for you i vow and will we be seeing you tonight mr renzi iim desolated to find that on this occasion there is ships business ashore that has the prior claim upon me miss kydd oh aye this cn be so cecilia kydd said hastily y remember he acts in th character of ships clerk an always knows his duty i find miss cecilia sir tysoe held the door as she entered the great cabin awed now by the effect of the candlelights tawny gold on the naval splendour within good evening thomashow kind of you to invite me tysoe accepted her pelisse with the utmost courtesy his approval of the quality of kydds visitor barely concealed oh sis i dont think yeve made yr number with tysoe here hes been m personal servant since before canada an gives the greatest satisfaction tysoe exchanged a pleased inclination of the head for cecilias wary interest my brother is in good hands then she said and allowed herself to be conducted to one of the two easy chairs set to take full advantage of the view from the stern windows in the gathering dusk kydd sat companionably in the other our dinnerll be alongside presently cec the cooks warned off yere aboard can i help ye t the wine afore we eat thats so kind but i will decline for now thomas she replied delicately the incongruity of his younger sister deploying the arts of politeness for his sake touched a chord and he laughed evoking in her a pleased smile just think she said with childish warmth it was only a few years ago her face shone then she turned and said eagerly tell me what its like tom the captain of a kings shiphow does it feel kydd affected not to notice the deep glow of the gold lace on his coat why its so fine a thing i find it hard t remember when i was aught elsebut i cn tell ye now ye must believe th biggest thing in life was t be removed frm the focsle to th quarterdeck cecilia remained silent as he continued y see sis when yere only a foremast jack y peep aft an see officers whore calm n strict looking down at ye all the power an discipline an when i heard i was t join em i didnt know what i must expect fr me the big surprise was t find that in th wardroom all th rank an ceremony is left on deck not an order given except its on the quarterdeck never below it means were all equal y see we share like brothers an this means that in battles an such we understand an trust one wi the other itsits but now youre captain thats what im tryin to say ive been plucked out o their compny now cec an not a one cn speak t tom kydd but hes addressin his captain an we both know it her eyes grew round then this is why nicholas is ayei own that im truly fortunate t have his company aboard even if its a mort hard t hoist in his meanings at times tysoe interrupted an introspective silence dinner is served sir cecilia regained her vivacity as the meal progressed to think itdo you eat in such ceremony every day and all alone reassured on the practicalities she persisted with a shy giggle does it not cross your mind ever what your sailors must be feeling as they look at you i mean once you were one and you must know what theyre thinking thats a question ive often asked mself sis an the answer is that yes i do have a notion whats in their minds it was th same fr me that ye see th captain afar off an know hes the one set over us all an theres no quarrel wi that now respect theres another thing if ye hasnt their respect then y hasnt their confidence an that way ye lose battles looking intently at her wine cecilia said carefully if i might be so bold as to remark it when you speak of respect i am obliged to mention that while it may be said that you have advanced far in life do you not find the sailors might resent being commanded by one of yourer our origins kydd gave a wolfish smile men like t have a captain whos a swell cove an to have a lord is primebut always theyll like a fighter best he put down his glass y know cec theres not too many in th sea service from forrard like me we call it coming aft through th hawse an i doubt theres above a hundred reached th quarterdeck that way theres some o theseright good seamen allwho glory in where theyve come from and these are yr tarpaulin officers now im not as who might say ashamed o bein a foremast handim proud t have been onebut sis fr me whats chalked up on my slate is not where ive come from but what i cn look forward to as a gentleman o consequence selfconsciously he went on it was at th admirals ball cec i was capn thomas kydd honoured guest an i met th ladies an everyone an they took me as one o them i have t tell ye it was very pleasing t mevery agreeable indeed cecilia smiled sweetly and kydd went on except that i had the feelin i was aa visitor if ye gets m meanin welcome fr all that but a visitor t their world just the same now cec what i want t be isnot a visitor i want em t take me as their own y see just th same as when i came aft t the wardroom is this s wrong for such as i bless you thomas no it is not butbut there are difficulties which i feel obliged to point out fire away then sis you will understand that i speak from the kindliest motives and some years in the employ of lord stanhope where ive been privileged to move in the highest levels of society aye that i do then kindly attend thomas she said seriously the first point i will make is that you ask to enter society as a waif and straywithout you have an establishment a lodging at the very least you cannot expect to receive visitors or hold the usual polite assemblies it was a novel thought home had always been his ship the centre of his world and failing that then guildford where his parents lived he and renzi had briefly shared a residence there it was true but they had always known it would be temporary cecilia was now telling him to have life outside his shipto put down roots for the first time ive been staying with jane and her husband who is something in a financial way in plymouth she will tell us where distinguished sea officers might find suitable accommodation she regarded kydds splendid fulldress commanders uniform doubtfully in course you will not often be in uniform on the land thomas you will need to consult a tailor coat and breeches simply will not answer any more pantaloons and cravat are all the thing ill not be made then shall you meet us for an expedition on the strand tomorrow or ayeat eleven kydd muttered now pray dont take it amiss brother but im bound to observe that your speech is not at all that is to be expected of a high officer it smacks too much of the old ways and simply will not do you must try to speak more slowly to pronounce every word to its full measure to use circumspection in your language surely you dont want to be mistaken for some kind of sea bumpkin kydd felt a flush rising the seas a hard enough place y need plainspeakin he growled but were not at sea when were on the land cecilia replied firmly and on shore we do as others do i will give you a poetry book and you are to read it aloud every morning to tysoe trying very hard to make the words beautiful utterly lost for something to say kydd snorted and thomas she said primly i cannot help but note that you speak to me in too familiar a manner i may be your sister but that is no excuse for omitting the usual delicacies of converse do please try to be a little more polite in your address to me if thisn pleases yr ladyship kydd said sarcastically and instantly regretted it cecilia was right the eighteenth century had gone and with it much of the colour and vigour he remembered from his youth now in the year times were more sombre and careful appearance and manner were valued over spirit and dash that is t say yere in the right of it o course the warmth of her smile touched him and he felt ashamed of his obstinacy ill try sis he said sincerely well now theres the matter of deportmentbut you already cut a fine figure of a man thomas i think we might accept your qualities in this but there are other skills of a social order that youll find indispensable ability at cards the arts of gallantry be damned youre beginnin t sound too much like nicholas her face shadowed oh er cec i didnt mean to but there was no going back may i know how is it wi nicholas an yourself are you at first she did not answer she crossed to the windows and stared out into the darkness then she spoke he is a man like no other thomas i will wait for him whatever his reasons but you are never in life to tell him of mymy feelings for him when hes ready she found a handkerchief and dabbed her eye is heis he happy do you think floundering at the change in subject kydd gathered his thoughts nicholas well ibut then hes a fathom an a half too deep for me t know fr certain but i can tell yethat is t say youthat hes taken aboard s many books and scratches away in his little cabin all th hours god gives that it must be givin him satisfaction youre such a good friend to him thomas she said softly youll both take care wont you kydd saw her eyes had filled out of his depth in the presence of female emotion he reached for the brandy cecilia lets toast t the future sis as who knows whats lyin in wait for us both mm yes i do see what you mean cecilia dear mrs mullins was in no doubt about kydds shortcomings in the way of dress and twirled her parasol in exasperation men are such tiresome creatures to encourage when it comes to matters of appearance quite so dear jane cecilia said comfortably on kydds arm for the short walk up fore street to the plymouth diligence stand but thomas has promised and he shall bear his lot with patience until his dress may match his station in lifeis this not the case thomas aye cec he said reluctantly i do beg your pardon thomas er i meant t say that is so ceccecilia be damned to this wry way of talkingbut she was right kydd accepted that in some ways his sister had advanced much further into polite society than he even to familiarity with the ways of the nobility and landed aristocracy if he was to be fully accepted there was no alternative but to follow her strictures and conform to the way things were at those levels jane has very kindly brought a newspaper with her and after we have finished at the tailor we shall consult her concerning a suitable district for your residence cecilia informed him firmly we are fortunate thomas that we have a friend living here who is to advise us they climbed into the diligence and set off for plymouth town the ladies happily chattered about sartorial possibilities while kydd stared out over the sourpool marshes scattered pine houses among their melon and cucumber pits there was no question but that he was going through with whatever it took to enter fully into society fortune had brought him this far but he had to fit himself properly to take advantage of the next big stroke he allowed his fancies to soar as a commander he had the respect of the world but most probably it would be as far as he could reasonably expect to go in naval service and he should then be content with an honourable retirement as a gentleman in the navy the next and final step was to postcaptain with an automatic but slow rise by seniority to admiral but for this he had either to succeed in a particularly spectacular feat of armsunlikely in a brigsloopor benefit by the workings of interest on his behalf interest embittered officers envious of others rise blamed a system whereby if it was possible to secure protection from one of lofty rank at the centre of power ones name would go forward over others of equal merit kydd however saw that at least it was an open and recognised form of favouritism that carried its own check and balance the favouring would be clearly seen so no senior figure would allow his name to be associated with that of a fooland if his protégé went on to glory he would bear the credit also this was how a daring young man such as nelson had been given his chance a postcaptain at twenty the rattling jolting conveyance left the potholes of the open country for the smart clatter of cobblestones as they reached the frankfort gate and the old town kydds mind however sped on the key to interest was first to come under notice but even to come within sight of a luminary he should be able to move in social circles that would intersect on the right occasions and having achieved this nothing could be more disastrous to his cause than to be seen as an outsider however characterful his course was set the way ahead clear the tailor was most obliging promising a first fitting in two days and kydd found himself in prospect of showing quite a different face to the world gone were the gorgeous colours and lace of before mr brummell had decreed that gentlemen would now be choosing the plain but exquisitely cut over satins and brocades lightcoloured pantaloons with cuffedtop boots in place of breeches and buckles it would take some getting used to but kydd persevered in the end he allowed himself satisfied a darkgreen coat that swept back rakishly into tails with not a peep of lace a buff doublebreasted waistcoat cut high and a pair of what felt like indecently closefitting cream nankeen pantaloons sirll require some gallowses wi his hinexpressibles of course pantaloons were cut generously at the top for comfort when horseriding and would need reliable suspending at the bootmaker orders were put in train for the latest style of pointedtoe black boots with brown tops despite kydds objections that they resembled a jockeys and at the gentlemans outfitter much care was given to the selection of a black beaver hat with a white silk lining it was odd to feel its round bulk in place of the sensible navy bicorne but he could tell it would be much more convenient in the bows and flourishes of polite ceremony now thomas we have time to inspect one or two properties for you jane is insistent that officers of rank do favour stonehouse above plymouth for its salubrious air and genteel neighbourhood will we visit do you think commander kydd lord of sixteen guns and suzerain of near a hundred men agreed meekly and followed his sister they reached stonehouse and turned south down the main street which he recognised as leading to the long room but stopped well before the open fields in durnford street which consisted in the main of substantial terraced mansions after a flash of glances between herself and jane all lost on kydd cecilia announced that number eighteen might repay the visiting and shortly kydd found himself before the sturdy pale façade of a halfmansion three storeys high appalled he turned to cecilia no its too nonsense thomas you will need to entertain come along the landlords agent sized kydd up and with a wellpractised smile took them in the front door opened into a small hallway and a passage with rooms on either side the ladies sniffed politely in unisonthe kitchen and scullery apparently passed muster at the end of the passage a fine staircase mounted invitingly up ushered impatiently kydd ascended to the first floora fleeting impression of a jolly dining room on one side and a fulllength drawing room on the otherthen to the second with a capacious main bedroom and a childrens room should you desire to view the servants quarters ayeer yes kydd said hurriedly it was the navy way always to ensure that the men were taken care of before consulting ones own comfort the final attic floor with its sloping ceilings and two sizeable rooms would be more than adequate for any level of domestic manning that kydd could consider a last quick look and they were on the street again with cecilia possessively on his arm well thomas i do declarea fireplace in every room an entirely splendid drawing room we shall need to change that odious curtain colour of course and the floor rug is rather disgraceful but your bedroom is quite the most commodious i have seen it was for kydd toohe remembered it hazily as nearly the size of teazers quarterdeck now sis afore we go much further this is jus too big fr me i dont dont be such a silly cecilia said impatiently one drawing room one dining room a bedroom for yourself and another how can you live with less a glance at the serene expression of her friend seemed to suggest that an understanding of sorts had already been reached and in these matters it were best to follow along but cec the cost must be an arrangement in the short term would be ruinously expensive ill agree she said but an annual lease will be had for say twenty pounds or so she added with suspicious confidence that was a substantial portion of his pay but less than he had feared and the thought of being master in his own home to do as he pleased to return invitations to announce an assembly have dinners to be talked about for months afterwards y may be right cecilia ill think on it nicholas id be greatly obliged if youd assist me in a small matter renzi looked up from his book by all means brother the morning light reflected up from the water was playing pretty patterns on the cabin deckhead but kydds mind was on other things y see im thinkin on takin a leasein a small way of coursein a lodgin ashore if youd be so kind as to step off wi me to inspect it courteous and patient renzi toured number eighteen with kydd admiring the staircase commenting on the number of floors and forbearing to point out that kydds observation on the felicity of having cooking country on the lowest floor and the servants safely aloft in the highest was quite in keeping with general practice might i know the asking price for this lease he murmured twenty guineas kydd answered stoutly that will be unfurnished i believe shall we say about twentythree if semifurnished which i earnestly recommend ah just so id think kydd replied hastily and sought to bring himself to a proper state of seriousness nicholas i have a proposition id like ye to consider choosing his words carefully he went on in the matter of yr own situationi know how scant yr means are as a captains clerk wi no other as a man o learnin youll need a place to rest your books an things im offerin such a place for you herebut i have m price im flattered to receive your offer renzi said equally carefully but as you may see im fully provided for aboard the fine ship teazer ah but here you would have an address you can give to people that will stop em thinkin yere a singular cove as lives all his life in a ship renzi paused and yr grateful assistance at times of m social duty such as dinners will be well remarked i see he stroked his chin you mentioned a price as i remember i did one shillin a monthand i shall see m name thomas kydd printed for all the world to see in yr first book renzi looked away when he had regained his composure he turned with a smile and said lightly then it seems that not content with topping it the captain over me you shall be my landlord as well he held out his hand and heres my word on it it was amazing the amount of work that was apparently needed before they could claim their domicile drapery of fashionable colour replaced darker hangings at the windows tastefully painted and varnished sailcloth lay over plainedged floorboards in all but the drawing room where an only slightly worn greenpatterned carpet complemented the restful sage of the walls when it came to his bedroom kydd refused strenuously to contemplate the larger room contending that he felt uneasy in any but shipsized quarters and besides renzi would need all the space he could find for book stowage thus it was that his friend could have an imposing writingdesk fit for the finest scholar at the window leaving the rest for a modest bed and a satisfying expanse of empty shelving for himself he indulged in a mahogany fourposter bed of the latest design somewhat incongruous with the spartan furniture already in the room when cecilia arrived to inspect progress her scrupulously polite suggestions were only sometimes parried by renzi albeit with an even greater civility until decoration and additional furniture had been settled to mutual satisfaction while teazer lay under repair for her slight wounding by the privateer chez kydd neared completion in the dining room wallmounted mirror sconces were fitted to cast a more cheerful light on proceedings and a modest amount of silver sheffield plate found its way into the sideboard in the drawing room the marble mantelpiece was decorously ornamented and all proper brass implements mustered and found correct a silk firescreen completing the furnishings a turningpoint came when it became necessary to engage domestic staff the indispensable jane allowed that word had been put out that a position might be open in the house of a bachelor naval captain which was probably why a diminutive but brighteyed seawidow named mrs bargus arrived that day to apply for the position of housekeeper kydd unsure of the niceties sent for tysoe imperturbable as always his man took charge and mrs bargus was installed to maintain the residence against mr kydds return from sea in the way of things she would oversee a maidofallwork who would share her quarters and it seemed undertake to produce a cook and scullerymaid of her acquaintance on a daily basis while teazer was in port with tysoe as butler and head of staff mr kydd was no longer to be troubled with domestic concerns and number eighteen took on new life a shy becky the new maid curtsied to kydd and mysterious clatters from the lower regions was a sure sign that the cook was taking a measure of her domain at last the day came when tysoe was persuaded to pronounce the house habitable and kydd rubbed his hands with glee nicholas tonight we shall dineand who do y think we should invite renzi hid a smile at kydds boyish excitement do you not think it a vexing imposition on our new cook that she must prepare dishes for the multitudes it were better that we dine in solitary splendour and see what she conjures in the event the cornish sole overtopped with fried oysters was entirely tolerable and by the roast pigeon kydd was passing content with his portion in life with tysoe hovering solicitously with the wine and a timid becky anxiously removing dishes under the august eye of the head of the household a watershed had been reached in kydds life shall we withdraw do you think he said lazily to renzi shall we indeed a brandy would be a capital thing to me at this time renzi answered with equal contentment after a pause to dispose of the last of the custard pudding in no way an aspersion on our inestimable cook aboard teazer but i rather fancy that at the hands of this one we should no longer fear to invite whom we will it was a splendid party was it not renzi chuckled throwing his newspaper on the floor and helping himself to the breakfast kippers bazely quite kept the ladies in a roar with his drollery i suspect hes not to be deprived of sociable occasions kydds daily visits to teazer as she lay under repair were not onerous and the success of the party the previous night combined with the warmth of a long friendship to produce a glow of satisfaction aye that it was nicholas he mused with a sigh remembering these very drawingroom walls resounding to laughter the soft candlelight on flushed cheeks do y think we should make th next by way of a fancy dress if six made a rousing evening they could probably stretch to eight and have a glorious rout an miss robbins tells me theres quantities o ladies would favour us with a musical evenin if begged renzi pursed his lips this is an agreeable prospect my friend and im desolated to intrudebut have you given thought to the unfeeling demands of mammon y mean nicholas wheres the pewter as will pay for it have you by chance perused your books lately books of account household books of account as may readily be seen in both the greatest and meanest houses in the land kydd bristled but renzi continued remorselessly as will detail to the prudent the ebb and flow of income and expenditures so as to give comfort that any projected enterprise will be within when i have th time nicholas kydd said curtly as i suspected renzi said your lofty duties spare you no time for this necessary chore and therefore i will make you a return proposition should you see fit to reduce my monthly lodgings to sixpence i should be happy to assume the character of bookkeeper for youfor us both as it were no blurted kydd appalled pray may i know why not as i already perform the function in part for your fine vessel butbut youre a learned gentleman fit fr more than it were folly to despise the importance of keeping ones accounts my friend even for a scholard kydd smiled reluctantly youre in the right of it o course very well nicholas he said humbly thank you an i honour ye for it the door squeaked as becky entered bobbing to each draw the curtains sir she asked timidly please do kydd replied with an absentminded nod and turned to his friend nicholas ive been wonderin would y tell me how your work is progressin now certainly renzi said with a pleased smile steepling his fingers as you know my study is ethnographical in nature at its heart i will be trying to extract universals from the differing response around the world to the same challenges be they grand or petty to this end i will be on quite another tack from your usual philosopher for i shall look only to the assembling of observations at the first hand to support my truths my own and others not the cloistered ratiocinatings of the ivory tower and for this i have started down two trails the first that i must gain a thorough acquaintance of what passes for knowledge in the subject at present and the second concerns the amassing of my facts this is a difficult and complex task which ive yet to structure satisfactorily but it is clear that in essence it will require two storehouses one truths which are so because i or another have seen them to be so and two suppositions which are said to be so and which therefore i cannot accept until verified he smiled diffidently your kind service in allowing me a berth in your ship does of course mean that many observations will be possible that are unavailable to the landbound and your other kindness in affording me a place ashore to lay my head is of increasing value to me for as i acquire correspondents they will need an address dear fellow your name will most certainly be inscribed in the preface as principal benefactor you may be assured kydd sat back this was a far greater project than he had understood no wonder renzi had been closeted for hours each day with little to show for it so far if theres anything he began hesitantly thank you no but on quite another subject did i not spy a certain invitation arrive this morning kydd reddened er yes y did nicholas how to include his ships captains clerk in anything with a naval connection was still not settled in his mind from admiral lockwoods lady a picnic t be held next week over in lord edgcumbes estate he added as offhandedly as he could and handed it over it will be a social event of some significance renzi admitted after studying the card all the notables will be there and yourselfbut i fear that this of course will be by ulterior design kydd paused er design he said suspiciously why yes you are fresh blood a personable young man of good nature who is at present unattached and shows no immediate prospect of being otherwise therefore a prime choice to make up numbers as the hostess has a requirement oh i see do bear the disappointment with fortitudeit would seem that your prospects for many further invitations will be bright should you acquit yourself amiably enough on this occasion ah the invitation says and friend um nicholas would you it seems to me that here is your opportunity to impress your sister with your social standing she would be delighted to venture abroad on a picnic i shouldnt wonder cecilia serenely on his arm kydd joined the group assembling at the mutton cove jetty in some trepidation conscious of being under eye and in his new pantaloons and boots feeling more than a little conspicuous there in the centre was the admirals wife the formidable lady lockwood and kydd set course resolutely to approach madam might i be allowed t present m sister cecilia he managed remembering to remove his beaver hat in an elegant sweep as he bowed it appeared to satisfy conversations stilled as the newcomers were noticed but the admiral gave an encouraging smile and lady lockwood replied imperiously to cecilia so glad you could be here my dear im sure you will enjoy yourself her eye rested briefly on kydd before she moved on to the next arrival kydd glanced about furtively there was not a soul he recognised but cecilia steered him subtly to an apprehensivelooking middleaged woman on the arm of a florid gentleman in blue whom she had met recently at a rout do forgive the impertinence but i cannot help remarking that adorable bonnet cecilia said gaily the ribbons do so suit your complexion the woman started in pleased surprise and after kydd was introduced to her husband the two ladies were soon deep in converse the short trip across the water to cremyll in the admirals barge passed in a blur of impressions they stepped out to a picture of rural charm rolling parkland kept in immaculate order acres of greensward interspersed with pretty groves of english trees and a double avenue of spreading elms that stretched away up the rise to a grand mansion with curious octagonal towers if there are any who feel unequal to the ascent im sure we could send for a chair lady lockwood declared however it was pleasant in the bright summer sun passing slowly under stately chestnut trees to sylvan glades and kydds fears slowly eased a picnic was laid out on the level expanse of lawn before the great house servants standing behind hampers with sunshades at the ready and after the admirals party had decorously draped themselves over the spread rugs there was a general move to do likewise you must try to be more entertaining in your talk thomas cecilia whispered sharply as she smiled politely at the acquaintance who had claimed her attention once more obediently kydd turned to the man one mr armitage a landed relative of the admirals wife and from ireland and whose conversation seemed to consist chiefly of illnatured grunts nothing in common was evident and kydds despairing talk about pitts chances of returning to government the shocking price of tobacco and a juicy local murder all left the man unmoved and he lapsed into silence cecilia had been taken away by mrs armitage to meet a friend leaving them both alone and while elegant conversations swirled round him kydd reflected mutely on the trials of a society occasion then he sensed movement and looked round it was the admirals daughter persephone now stooping to offer him a plate mr kydd might i press you to try one of these little olive pies theyre quite the most toothsome her gay voice however had a cool patrician ring that might have been intimidating her dressa sweeping filmy gown in sprigged muslindid nothing to conceal her willowy figure and a single pink coral necklace complemented a smart beribboned bonnet covered with confusion kydd scrambled to his feet miss lockwood how ggood to see you again his foot caught in the rug and he stumbled dropping his new hat in his anxiety not to lose the pie he had accepted from her she laughed and picked up his hat for him this is a smart beaver indeed its not often a naval officer displays such good taste there was a disarming warmth in her tone and the laughter had stayed in her eyes oh er the hat for that i must own its my sister is m pilot in matters o fashion he looked about for cecilia but she was not in sight y should meet her miss lockwood all the men do think her the prime article i shall mr kydd she said amused her glance strayed to the stolid form of kydds acquaintance and she added loudly if this is your first visit here youll be entranced by the views to be had do lets see other couples were promenading or talking together and kydd walked forward stiffly trying hard to appear fashionable he felt sudden pressure on his arm as persephone stifling a giggle said softly armitage can be such a bore when he wants to be and i did feel so sorry for you on your own can you bear to forgive me carrying you off miss lockwood ii thank you for y service to me and i do confide it would be of some interest t me should we sight the sound this was a small distance across the rise to the thin line of trees veiling the view eastwards but still within plain sight of the picnic gathering then so we shall they walked slowly together until the rise fell away to reveal the wide glittering expanse of plymouth sound past the hoe to the busy cattewater and a sweep on out to sea i never tire of this prospect persephone said its always so animated so everchanging but then you must have quite another perspective im sure not possessed of a witticism worthy of such a lady kydd fell back on a simple recounting of a mariners experience when entering the great port it seemed to satisfy for persephone remained attentive throughout papa tells me you were with nelson at the nile she said well not really im afraidy see i was in a different ship frm his and we fought in the dark i couldnt see much o the flagship she looked at him oddly and at acre the same year kydd gave a wary smile this was not really a fit subject for fine ladies yes but i dont care fr yr landfightin its so so disagreeable he finished lamely after a space she said quietly do you know mr kydd youre quite unlike anybody else ive metthat is to say for a sea officer you may believe that an admirals daughter does not lack for mens company but you anyone else would have delighted in telling me of their victories in the face of such perils and you are different kydd found he had to look away from her frank gaze i heard admiral lockwood went t london to attend the court did you b chance go as well and see er their majesties he asked tentatively persephone paused and looked at him kindly papas brother is groom of the stole and one of prinnys set and mama is remembered as ladyinwaiting to princess charlotteshes now the queen consort of frederick of wurttemberg of courseso you may be sure its quite impossible to stay away she said with a sigh prinny said kydd awed the prince of wales is such a spendthrift and coxcomb of course but i do believe his heart is in the right place suddenly she looked down i think we should return now mr kydd i thank you for your company and i do wish you well for your next voyage then with the flash of a sweet smile she walked ahead of him back to the picnic chapter did y find entertainment enough along shore mr standish kydd asked the figure in glistening black oilskins standing next to him as another slowly drifting rain squall passed over the little sloop the first lieutenant shook himself in a shower of droplets and allowed a smile i do have my hopes of the young ladies here sir kydd kept his eye on the swirling current lapping noisily round the rocks in the narrows of devils point on the ebb and with this mild southwesterly there should be no difficulty with the sharp turn before drakes island on their way out to sea standish raised his speaking trumpet and blared at the forebrace hands as teazer straightened for the run past the hoe i believe sir you now have an address in stonehouse i have kydd said with satisfaction durnford street there can y see the darker roof o the third house along a view o the hamoaze on one side an plymouth hoe th other it was an unreal thought that there he had a home of his own making sir the quartermasters voice was sharp with alarm as he pointed at the bulk of a large merchantman ahead emerging from the rain squalls and about to cross their bows on its way to the mill bay docks it was unfortunate the lookouts had probably assumed that his attention was on the task in hand and had refrained from pointing out the obvious annoyed with himself he snapped the orders that took the way off the sloop to pass astern of the ponderous vessel it seems were in some need of a sea breeze t clear our heads as soon as were t seaward o jennycliff lets see th hands lose some sweat both watches t exercise then mr standish aye aye sir he acknowledged er and sirif youd excuse the impertinencei did learn as well that our captains clerk is now er of the same address aye he is kydd said firmly sir then am i t understand that hes easy in his dutiesas whos to say backward in diligencewhen assistin you why no sir standish answered hastily he is very amiable and obliging mr renzi is a learned gentleman o shinin qualities as is acceptin th convenience of this vessel by th admirals express permission and who finds the value of an um piedàterre in this place an obligin thing if your philosophicals are lofty enough youll have th chance t quiz him as y please for ill be invitin you an mr renzi both t dinner soon the afternoon brought an improvement in the weather and with the wind backing to a pleasant westerly kydd decided to patrol the eastward half of his area there was no need for haste as who was to say where any trouble might lie the admirals office had received no recent reports of predation and kydd wondered if he would ever again get the chance to face bloody jacques at bay meanwhile his contentment continued to build with warm thoughts of his progress in society mingling with enjoyment of the tumbling green devonshire coastline and the clean sparkling summer seas ahead renzi had received the news of kydds successful first foray into real society politely and had been cautiously approving when he had heard in some detail of his encounter with an admirals daughter kydd had no idea how he had done but the very fact that she had stayed to talk implied that his presence was not altogether uncongenial she was certainly of a quality far above his yet she had singled him outthis was surely proof of his acceptability in gentle company he hugged the conclusion gleefully to himself and turned on his heel to pace the quarterdeck the line of coast was beginning to take on meaning and characterkydd recognised the mouth of the erme river it had been there so long ago that he had been one of the party that had crept ashore to discover the truth of the great mutiny learning of the worst in the pretty village of ivybridge below the moor as the coast trended south past the bolt tail and head it peaked with start point one of the major seamarks for the winterbeset battleships of the channel fleet fleeing a ferocious gale it promised calm and rest at tor bay beyond teazers patrol limit was at the other end of the long sweep of lyme bay at portland and nearby weymouth there were no seaports of consequence in the bay beyond exmouth and he determined to stretch out for portland mr standish tomorrow is sunday an we shall have divisions if youd be s kind it was a little unfair the ship was still being squared away after three weeks in dockyard hands but what better way to pull teazer into shape than to have a captains inspection and bracing divine service anyway it would give him a good idea of the temper of his men it was the duty of the first lieutenant to prepare the ship and standish would be held to account for any shortcomings this was the custom of the service and he would be as much on display as the ship at four bells kydd stepped out of his great cabin to the piercing squeal from the boatswains call in full dress uniform he acknowledged the polite report from standish that his majestys ship teazer was now at readiness for his inspection he went to the mainhatchway and stood aside for the boatswain to precede him on deck with a single warning peal the still then kydd emerged gravely on to the upper deck with fitting gravity he began in a measured pace to process down the larboard side of the deck every man still and watching lines from aloft appeared properly belayed and additionally the ends were each laid flat in a careful concentric spiral a flemish coil he moved past the bitts to the shot garlands alongside each squat carronade the gunner watched kydds progress steadily kydd knew it would be astonishing indeed if the balls were not wonderfully chipped and blacked and the carronades gleaming on their slides but appearances must be preserved and he went carefully through the motions the foredeck was in the same pristine state as aft the lines were not pointed as they were on the holy ground of the quarterdeck where the final four inches had been artistically tapered but in other ways there was pleasing attention to detail here he noted that every ropes end was neatly whipped in the complex but secure and elegant west country style while the canvas grippings of the foreshrouds had been painted instead of tarred a strong showing mr standish kydd allowed standish tried to hide his smile of satisfaction but professional pride was at stake here kydd looked about covertly but there was nothing to which he could take exception he would have to try harder noting the angle of the breeze across the deck he crossed to a carronade neatly at rest on its slide at the cost of his dignity kydd squatted and felt under its training bed forward before the waterway and found what he was looking for wisps of oakum and twine trimmings wafted there during the work that morning he straightened and looked accusingly at standish ah sir ill be speaking to the captain of the focsle the lieutenant said with a touch of defiance kydd growled but theres a matter o higher importance that concerns me he held standishs eyes provoking in the other man a start of alarm kydd went on it is sir th foretop lookout failin in his duty they snapped their gaze aloft to catch the interested lookout peering down at events on deck then hurriedly shifting his attention back out to sea kydd had known the mans curiosity would probably get the better of him and had deliberately refrained from looking up before th mateothewatch t inform me how hes to teach this man his duty he barked in the respectful hush he turned and went down the fore hatchway to the berthdeck men were mustered below in their respective divisions headed by their officers and stood in patient silence the swaying forest of sailors filled the space and kydd picked his way through knowing all attention was on him he moved slowly fixing his eyes to one side then the other looking for a shifty gaze resentment or sullen rebelliousness but saw only guarded intelligence or a glassy blank stare he passed along and stopped why has this man no shoes he demanded of prosser the sailors went barefoot where they could at sea but mustered by divisions for captains inspection only shoes would do he doesnt have any sir prosser answered uncertainly why doesnt he have any kydd responded heavily the divisional system of the navy was a humane and effective method of attending to the mens welfare by assigning an officer responsible not only for leading his division into combat but as well concerning himself with any personal anxieties his men might have prosser shifted uncomfortably tell me why do y have no shoes kydd asked the man directly i aint got m pay ticket he mumbled youre frm er foxhound kydd recalled are you saying that yr pay due entitlement has still not come t teazer sir kydd rounded on prosser inform th captains clerk that this matters to be brought t the attention of foxhound an report to me the instant this mans account is squared it annoyed him that prosser a masters mate was holding his men at arms length like that only by getting to know them and winning their confidence would he be of value to themand more importantly be in a position to make good decisions when at their head in action it was no secret that prosser had been hoping for a bigger more prestigious rate of ship but if he was looking for an early recommendation from his captain then this was not the way to gain it aft was where the petty officers berthed their mess was in immaculate order and on impulse kydd asked that the rolled canvas that would screen them off from the rest should be unfurled as he suspected it was richly painted on the inside with a colourful pastiche of mermaids and mythical seabeasts he lifted his eyes and saw stirk looking at him across the deck it had been so many years but some of kydds happiest times at sea had been spent with stirk in a mess such as this he fought to control a grin and contented himself with a satisfied nod the cooks domain was spotless the mornings salt beef standing by for the coppers the boatswains store was trim and wellstowed and in the sailmakers tiny cuddy kydd found a miniature hammock slung snugly fore and aft and in it the lazyeyed ships cat spritsl looking sleek and assured emerging from the cloistered depths of teazer to the more civilised upper realms kydd pronounced himself satisfied as a shipofwar there was little to complain of and he turned to standish rig fr church if y please he ordered and went to his cabin to allow the bedlam to settle that was the tolling of the ships bell for divine service and the clatter of matchtubs and planks being brought up as pews if yed rather kydd offered to renzi the absence of a chaplain meant that the office would normally be carried through by the captain or other officer but renzis reputation for fine words would ensure him a respectful hearing i think not answered his friend he added warmly your good self is much the closer to a divine in this ship the captains clerk would however need to appear in front of the men on report from standish two sailors slowly mounted the mainhatchway and appeared on deck every man and boy of the ships company sat stolidly in a mass facing their captain who stood by the helm behind an improvised lectern kydd liked what he saw these were his men sitting patiently those who would sail his ship and fight at his word and on whose skills and courage the success of the commission would directly depend he was coming to be aware of several in terms of their character some he knew well their features strong and comforting but others were still just faces wary and defensive all waited quietly for the ceremony that the lords of the admiralty in their wisdom had ordained should take place regularly in his majestys ships but first kydd drew himself up and snapped articles of war off hats roared standish heads were bared while the captains clerk stepped forward and in a rolling baritone the equal of any to be found on the shakespearean stage declaimed the stern phrases to the sea and sky every person in the fleet who through cowardice negligence or disaffection shall forbear to pursue the chase of the enemy or run away with any of his majestys ordnance ammunition stores either on the high seas or in any port creek or harbour and being convicted thereof by the sentence of a courtmartial shall suffer death duty done renzi stepped back the two men were brought forward on report for being slack in staysstandish wanted the job done speedily kydd could only approve of his zeal and sentenced them both to fourteen days in purchets black book cares of the world dealt with it was time to address the divine a respectful silence was followed by a rustle of anticipation kydd knew he was on trialsome commanders would be eager to play the amateur preacher others flippant and dismissive but the common run of seamen were a conservative godfearing breed who would be affronted at any kind of trifling with their sturdy beliefs gissing the carpenters mate stood up with his violin and joined midshipman boyd at his german flute when all was ready kydd announced the hymn o god our help in ages past and the ships company sang heartily together the old words to the wellknown tune sounding forth loud and strong it was the sign of a ships company in good heart kydd went to the lectern notes ignoredthese were his men and he knew what they wanted men of teazerteazers men he began there was a distinction and it was rooted in the different allegiances between those merely on her books and those who had found their being in and of the ship let me spin ye all a yarn this got their attention years ago when i was in m very first ship we joined action with a frenchy and as we closed with th enemy i was sore afraid but my guncaptain was there who was older an much wiser he was the very best kind o deepsea mariner and he said to me words o great comfort that let me face th day like a man his eyes found stirks and he saw the studied blankness of expression that showed he too had remembered that day kydd he said now its certain yell get yours one day but yell never know what day thisll be when y wakes up in the morning if it is then y faces it like a hero if it wasnt then its a waste o your life to worry on it kydd waited for the murmuring to die then picked up the bible hes in the right of it o coursebut it was here all th time matthew the sixth chapter an the thirtyfourth verse take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof men should y need a course t steer in any weather then th chances are youll find it here portland bill was the eastern limit of teazers area but it would do no harm to show the denizens that the navy was here t take us past the bill an round to off weymouth he instructed the master there was no real need to pass into the next patrol area especially with the notorious race extending out to the shambles but this was only bad in heavy weather and it was well known that the king took the waters at weymouth in summerwhat more loyal act could there be than to demonstrate to his majesty that his sea service was dutifully safeguarding the shores of his realm in the bright sunshine the distant wedge of the peninsula seemed too tranquil for its reputation and the irregular rippling over the shambles was a tame version of the violent tidal overfalls kydd had heard about teazer slipped between them and in an hour or so came to off the town the hands that had been at their recreational makeandmend which was customary after divine service now lining the bulwarks more than one telescope was trained shorewards as they slowed and swung with the current but the king was not at homethe squat king henry fortress showed no colourful royal standard take us out if y please kydd ordered it would be harder to return now for the wind was veering more to the west but if they took lyme bay in long boards it would not only give the men more time to enjoy their makeandmend but enable them to raise exmouth in the morning the next day as they lay off exmouth for an hour or two it had clouded over if there were any urgent sightings or intelligence a cutter would come out to them after breakfast they clapped on sail for the south and teignmouth where they did the same thing heaving to well clear of the bar at the narrow harbour mouth kydd felt a sense of unreality creeping in this was not war it was a pleasant cruise in a wellfound craft with eighty men aboard who had nothing more to their existence but to obey his every whim and before him lay only another easy sail south past some of the loveliest coast in england to start point then a leisurely beat back home to plymouth when would it pall when would come the time that teazer had to justify herself as a manowar and when would he cross swords with bloody jacques sail was spread and teazer leant to it heartily hopes nose was their next landfall and beyond it tor bay and brixham there was just time to go below and do some work and reluctantly kydd left the deck renzi was deep in thought at his accustomed place in the stern windows so kydd left him in peace settling down with a sigh to an unfinished report he worked steadily but his ears pricked at sudden shouts on deck and the rapidly approaching thump of feet sir blurted andrews at the door mr standishs compliments and the fleet is in sight a fleet was this the dreaded invasion sir channel fleet flag o admiral cornwallis kydd threw on his coat and bounded up on deck to find they had rounded hopes nose to the unfolding expanse of tor bay and come upon the majestic sight of the battleships of the blockading fleet entering their fallback anchorage looking up kydd saw their commissioning pennant standing out long and proud at precisely a rightangle from the shore this meant a dead westerly so the french in brest were locked fast into their lair unable to proceed to sea the shrewd cornwallis was taking the opportunity to refit and resupplyfor as long as the wind held should it shift more than a point or two all anchors would be weighed in a rush and the fleet would stand out to sea to resume its watch and guard cornwallis was known as billy blue his custom was to leave the blue peter flying all the time he was at anchor the navy signal for imminent departure kydd kept teazer at a respectful distance while the great fleet came to rest by the laws of the navy he was dutybound to call on the admiral to request permission to proceed a polite convention that allowed the senior man the chance to coopt his vessel temporarily for some task full fig tysoe their salute banged out while kydd shifted into his fulldress uniform and complete with sword and medals embarked in the pinnace for the mighty and forbidding gun flagship ville de paris tor bay was a scene of controlled chaos from nowhere a host of small craft had appeared summoned by an urgent telegraph signal that the fleet had been sighted hoys wherries lighters and a ceaseless stream of boats plied between the ships this was resupply a population equivalent to one of the biggest towns in england had appeared magically offshore and demanded months of provisions putting into motion a formidably complex system that was timed to the hour as kydd journeyed across to the flagship constantly at hazard of entangling with the furious passage of the small craft his boats crew marvelled at the scene on each ship they passed men were thick in the rigging sending down worn canvas rereeving end for end the halliards and braces that had seen so much service in the ceaseless struggle to keep the seas lighters were being towed out from the breweries at millbrook laden deep with vast quantities of beer a healthier alternative to water in the casks after weeks at sea and hoys struggled with all the onions cabbages and other greens they could carry that very morning these had been in the ground and hapless contractors were at twelve hours notice to supply many tons of vegetables there was much activity ashore on paignton sands too snaking lines of horses and cattle were stretched out over the hills heading towards a series of tents around them were piles of barrels and men in frenetic motion the oxen driven overland from the depot at ivybridge were being slaughtered salted and headed up there and then in casks on the beach it was a telling commentary on the efforts of the nation to provide for its sailors and a demonstration for all to see of the value placed on keeping this vital battle fleet at sea the monstrous sides of the flagship towered up and kydd felt nervous this was the commanderinchief sir william cornwallis whose iron discipline was chiefly responsible for holding together the fleet in the fearsome conditions of the atlantic blockade his sea service went back to the american warhis brother had surrendered at yorktownand he had been with rodney at the battle of the saintes and served as a commodore in india against tippoo sahib kydd mounted the sidesteps carefully and was met at the ornate entryport with the thrilling squeal of pipes and the bored looks of the receivingparty a lieutenant politely doffed his hat while kydd punctiliously saluted first the quarterdeck then him before he strode aft and up to the admirals cabin sit yself down m boy the great man muttered rooting about among his charts then looking up mildly kind in ye to call the florid countenance and bluff ways of a country squire hid a sharp mind and ruthless organiser the seamen called him billygotight and stood well clear when he was to be seen pacing slowly head down about the decks seen much sport cornwallis asked kindly naught but one privateer who gave me th slip sir kydd said apologetically never mind lad early days yet now if yed pay mind t me theres a service id like ye to perform as will spare one of m frigates aye sir a palefaced lieutenant looked round the door and promptly vanished at cornwalliss frown the admiral turned back to kydd do ye find immortalité frigate capn owen an pass to him a small chest fr which youll take a receipt in due form for yr information it contains a sum in goldfr which ill take your receipt sirby which we buy our intelligence sir er could i know where shes t be found inshore squadron cornwallis answered testily who knows in a westerly could be anywhere off th goulet between the béniguete an toulinguet at kydds hesitation he growled ask flags an get some halfdecent charts while yere about itits a graveyard o ships there an this has t be in the right hands main quickly sir it made sense of a kind conceded kydd resentfully as teazer left the commotion of tor bay astern and stretched out for start point a little brig taken from her lawful duty was far less of a drain on precious resources than a fullblooded frigate but this took no account of the feelings of her commander at being so casually sent on errands on the other hand this was for kydd and teazer a first time in one of the worst stretches of sea to be found anywhererockstrewn and treacherous the approaches to brest at the extreme atlantic northwest of france had claimed the lives of countless english menowar over the centuries it was a dangerous leeshore in all but the infrequent easterlies and no place for the faint of heart all too soon the start was abeam it might be possible to fetch their objective in one tack but in this cloudy petulant weather there would be no sightings to fix their position reliably and the increasing westerly with a making tide would result in a leeward drift of an unknown quantity that would make even the best estimations questionable despite the need for dispatch the only prudent move would be to make a westing sufficient to come about again and in the morning raise the guardian of brest the outlying island of ushant then knowing their position for a certainty they could work in closer it seemed overly cautious but kydd was aware of the little wooden chest with the iron padlock that lay well secured in his bedplace much might depend on its safe arrival davies an amiable masters mate from ville de paris had volunteered to act as guidedowse had only limited familiarity with the region so the younger mans advice would be crucial prosser had made much of his time of service on blockade in the s but this was as a midshipman and given his brash attitude kydd was not readily inclined to take suggestions from him any experiences of the lower deck made no reference to charts or coasting pilots and were no better than reminiscences the dawn brought with it thin misting rain driving in from the west in tall white curtains that advanced slowly over a sullen swell to soak the sombre group on teazers quarterdeck as far as could be relied upon their reckoning placed them some twentyfive miles to weather of ushant the traditional fleet rendezvous but the sea was empty as the fleet was in tor bay helm up kydd ordered steer east the die was cast they were now sailing directly downwind towards france they would sight ushant and shape course accordingly or missing it end embroiled in the maze of halftide rocks promised by their chart kydd went over the arithmetic the higher he was on the ship the further he could see distance to the horizon in miles was times the square root of the heightofeye in feet as he stood on the quarterdeck his eye was about ten feet up which gave a figure of some four miles at its highest ushant was no more than a hundred and forty feet odd which by the same calculation gave about fourteen miles therefore adding the two he could expect to make landfall at eighteen miles off and nearer twentythree for a lookout in the maintop get up there lad he ordered andrews another pair of eyes in the tops would never be too many with so much riding on it but before the lad could swing into the shrouds a sudden cry came from the foretop laaand hooo the lookout gestured vigorously to leeward in a fever of impatience kydd waited for the land to come within sight of the deck an anonymous grey shape firming before them take it southabout kydd told the quartermaster if it was ushant they needed to be in place for their southward search and if it was not davies came and stood next to kydd staring intently certainly looks the part sir he said pleasantly as though unaware of the tension about him well discover fr sure when we see him off t the norwest he has a deep bay there lookin all the world like the open claw of a lobster we used to say nutcracker in diomede prosser said importantly he had taken up position on the other side of kydd who didnt reply it proved to be ushant and therefore they had their position exactlyfor the moment the westerly was holding and beginning to kick up a bit of a sea although this was probably more due to its disputing with the last of the downchannel ebb kydd fretted at the ragged rain squalls that marched across and lasted for long minutes bringing visibility down to yards not only did this make sighting immortalité difficult but it hid the dark rocks off to starboard twere best we made our southing through the chenal dfour davies offered we have the slant wi this westerly prosser puffed his cheeks in diomede it was always chenal dhelle on account hold yr noise kydd snapped havent ye somethin t do forrard leaving the black mass of ushant astern they sailed on uneasily until a low line of darker grey spread across the horizon hardening into a craggy coastline france sir davies said unnecessarily kydd grunted of more concern to him now was their undeviating approach directly towards it detail became clearer as they neared a wicked uncompromising cragginess the chart had shown an appalling jumble of unconnected reefs and halftide rocks and had hinted of fierce tidal currents to be avoided at all costs to thread a safe route through would be a nightmare without help are ye sure davies nodded patiently tut tut an this is a rare moil exclaimed dowse looking askance at the approaching cliffs now no more than a couple of miles distant it was a dead lee shore and all his masters instincts jangled in alarm his eyes met kydds nothing t worry of davies said cheerfully need to keep inshore o lpâtresses is all the helm went over a bare mile short of the grim heights but as they made their passage south to parallel them kydd saw why at this distance there was a noticeable back wind from the nearby seacliffs which went some way to easing the situation away to starboard the misty sea was full of dismal black crags whitefringed and dreadful and after they had passed a stern headland at less than a mile it was evident that they were edging nearer being crowded ever closer to the coastsuddenly there was no longer any space to wear about or even to tack back to where they had come from i mislike it sirno sea room we cant put back dowse said what if they were being funnelled between a substantial seaweedblack islet to starboard and a gaunt twisted headland to larboard but as they drew in there was a flat thump on the damp air kydd heard more and searched feverishly for where the guns were there must be a battery somewhere atop the lofty cliffswhich they would pass close beneath he turned to davies who said calmly pay no mind t the frenchy sir hes got no notion o range over water and in any case i know a little diversion this state o th tide asll take us close in past the béniguete instead true to his word teazer found herself picking her way warily past the frighteningly close kelpstrewn islet while the guns thudded away impotently another mile and they were in open water the dark coastline fallen away to nothing clear sir davies said smugly this is yr goulet he added gesturing to the tumble of seas stretching away to the left and brest lies no moren a dozen miles away there t the eastd this was all very fine they had won through the worst to the main approaches of the port but where was immortalité the little brigsloop continued across the wide mouth towards the other side but still no trace and the irritated french might be driven to sending out gunboats picking up on pointe du toulinguet on the opposite side to the anguish of the master watching the ugly scattering of black rocks stretching seaward for miles they hauled away across the iroise towards its natural boundary at the pointe du raz and the fifteen miles of reefs and shoals extending straight out to sea with a fourthousandmile fetch the wind from the open sea had a relentless urge to it that seemed to want to bully teazer ever closer towards the grim coastline and it was increasing now with an ugly lop and white horses here and there the rain had eased to flurries but there was low scud above the ragged cloud mr davies kydd asked heavily it was getting uncomfortable beam on to the racing seas and while visibility was improving the doubled lookouts were not seeing any sign of sail why y have to understand sir in the inshore squadron we has two jobs to dotell england when the mongseers put t sea and the other is t show ourselves anywhere theres a frenchman tells em theyre under eye and its better for em to stay snug in harbour immortalité could be well anywheres thank you mr davies kydd looked out to the unfriendly sea and back to the forbidding coast naval duty was a hard taskmaster at timeswas it expected that he comb the seas interminably until he found his frigate in these dangerous waters with thick weather promising the rocky barrier out from the pointe du raz was approaching decisions would have to be made to leeward out of sight from the deck the sweep of douarnenez bay had no port of interest except possibly the small haven of douarnenez itself he was not about to risk entering the baydouarnenez a tickle of memory came his first ship and he a lowly ordinary seaman smelling gunpowder for the first time it was here that duke william had clashed briefly with emerging french shipsoftheline they must have been taking shelter in an accustomed anchoragewith which the frigate would of course be familiar and might now be reconnoitring we bear up fr douarnenez i believe mr dowse they entered the bay past a prominent foreland towering up to larboard the bay opening up widely beyond the further shore would only be in sight from the tops and kydd gazed up at them impatiently butnothing no sail no frigate gdamn it he blazed sir sir andrews piped from his station on the afterdeck hopping from one foot to the other he was pointing vigorously astern tucked well into the lee of the foreland just past a ship lay at anchor her ensign plain for all to see immortalité davies confirmed however so far downwind there was nothing for it but to beat back to the big vessel a gun boomed on her focsle drawing attention to the challenge that had shot smartly up her halliards private signal roared kydd to andrews thank heaven he had had the foresight to claim these from the flagship before he left and to have the correct signal of the day made up for hoisting every morning it soared up briskly it wouldnt do to trifle with a crack frigate of the inshore squadron teazer leant to the wind and beat her way over while kydd decided that he would not stand on ceremony even a postcaptain would not expect him to dress for a visit on this occasion as they neared a twentyfourpounder crashed out and the sea plumed ahead of their forefoot at the same time all along the length of the frigates gun deck cannon were run out and kydd found himself staring down the muzzles of immortalités broadside his mind froze then he thought to check again with her ensignif she had been captured the french could never fire under false coloursbut she still flew an ensign of the royal navy mr purchet bellowed kydd his voice breaking with effort loose the fore topsail sheets this instant in a frenzied motion they were cast off and the sail banged and fluttered free it was the nearest thing to striking topsails the ageold signal of surrender that kydd could think of clear away the cutter boats crew t muster he croaked under pouldens urgent bidding the men stretched out for the frigate kydd sitting bolt upright his foulweather gear damp and uncomfortable as they neared there was confirmation that this was a vessel of the royal navyseaworn she might be but every detail from the blacked muzzles of the cannon to the fancy ropework round the windvane spoke of a proud sea service they came alongside and hooked on the boat jibbing like a lunatic in the seas that swept the sides of the frigate kydd waited for the right moment and jumped for the sidesteps his wetweather gear tangling and whipping as he climbed up and over the bulwarks two stolid lines of armed marines met him instead of a sideparty a grimfaced postcaptain waited ahead and held up his hands for kydd to stop where he was and who the devil are you sir he grated ccommander kydd brigsloop teazer at yr service sir kydd said breathlessly prove it snarled the captain kydd smothered a retort when he realised that but for a bedraggled and threadbare hat he was in anonymous foulweather gearand he had not a scrap of identification on him as a british officer he wheeled round on poulden who stood rigidly behind whats th best public house in plymouth town quickly man ththe town beggin yr pardon sir but we likes best t hobanob at th portsmouth hoys fore street in dock as serves the best brown ale but if y means old plymouth why he tailed off uncertainly under the ferocious glare of the frigate captain there was a brief unreal silence before the captain grunted very well stand down the marines secure from quarters he marched up to kydd and halted within inches now sir do you account for yourself affronted kydd retorted im at a loss sir why you fired into me the captain kept his eyes fixed on kydds and snapped so you would not were you a frigate captain which i highly doubt will ever be the case then pray look at it from my point of view a strange andi observeforeignlooking sloop sails unconcerned as though in home waters straight into douarnenez bay which all good englishmen do shun he sees me and quick as a flash throws out the private signal just as if hed got it by him after capturing one of ours he puts about impudently and takes his chance to close with me hoping to catch us offguard and at anchor so then he may pour in his treacherous broadsides but hes forgotten one detail he paused giving a savage smile then went on in a voice of rising thunder if hes of the channel fleet carries their private signalsthen why in hades is he flying the wrong damn ensign too late kydd remembered on her temporary sidevoyage for cornwallis teazer was flying not the blue ensign of cornwalliss fleet but the red of lockwoods command chapter an im determined on it nicholas kydd said stretching happily in his armchair we have hardly had time to scrape the salt from our eyebrows after our hard weeks on the briny deep dear brother renzi sighed and here you are proposing we should immediately embark on the rigours of not a high occasion as would embarrass th exchequer ill grant ye more in the way of an assembly or so kydd said comfortably becky came in shyly to draw the curtains and departed with a smile then might we not consider a rout no expense of a meal at table quantities of people arriving and departing when they will wine and jollity on all sides and of course the decided social advantage of there being the opportunity to accommodate more than the usual number so there will be many more in the way of return invitations done what was the use of maintaining an establishment if it were not to be gainfully employed who shall be invited as ye know teazer will not be in port s long while invitations were agreed plans were put in train im of th mind that a womans touch might be an advantage kydd said should ido y think that cecilia is t be invited renzi looked up from his writing of the invitationsa bold round copperplate of impeccable executionand said in measured tones she is your sister it would be singular indeed if you did not ask her and if by this you make allusion to any feelings i might have entertained for the lady pray spare me your delicaciesshe is quite free to come and go as she chooses which is her right as a gentlewoman his head bent to the writing the evening seemed destined for success all invitations were taken up and kydd was kept busy greeting the steady stream of guests who showed every inclination to linger cecilia sparkled as hostess her orangeflower and brandy rout cakes were universally applauded becky under tysoes discreet tutelage mingled with a tray of cordials and wines and it was not long before number eighteen resounded to scenes of gaiety and warmth ah mrs mullins kydd said warmly yr help in acquiring m residence is much appreciated can ye not feel how it likes t see a party i do that mr kydd she replied hiding a smile sir a miss robbins it was the hired footman at the door why mr kydd so good of you to remember us there was movement behind her as she went on ah the invitation did mention a friend did it not she cooed o course it did miss her friend emerged from behind her stopping kydd midsentence oh er ththank you fr coming miss lockwood he managed then remembered a polite bow took the proffered hand and escorted her in she was in a cream dress of the latest fashion and had taken some considerable pains with her grecian hairstyle i noticed your ship arrive mr kydd she said warmly such a pretty creature a brigsloop id hazard ayethat is t say yes she is teazer is her name how curious she said her hazel eyes held his for a long moment does she suit you kydd returned the look coolly but inwardly he exulted how had she known it was his ship unless it had been pointed out to heror she had been looking out for it either way it proved her interest in him why miss lockwood theres been three teazers in our sea service this age but none s sweet a sailer on a bowline asas my teazer how agreeable for you she paused and continued softly tell me this would you trust your very life to her in a great storm i would kydd answered immediately he wondered what lay behind her words realising that she was using the seafarers she for a ship instead of the landlubbers soulless it i have afore now an conceive i will again all th time im in english seas just so she said politely her eyes still on him kydd felt a blush rising well mr kydd if i dont see you again tonight let me tell you how much i have enjoyed meeting you once more kydd bowed wordlessly and claimed by miss robbins persephone lockwood entered the throng kydd gazed after her seeing people fall back in deference to her quality and respectful glances flashed his way he resumed his duties conscious of rising elation time passed and the first guests made ready to depart among them miss lockwood should he strike up a conversation before she left but before he could act she had caught his eye and moved over to him mr kydd thank you for a lovely evening mmy pleasure miss llockwood he stuttered i wonderno i have no right to ask it of you she said with a frown a gloved hand going to her mouth do please kydd said gallantly well since you are so obliging it does occur to me that you could be of some service to me in a small matter that would really mean a lot miss lockwood if i cn do anything its for my father she said apologetically i have it in mind to present him with a painting for his birthday a marine painting you see im concerned that it be completely authentic in its sea detailyouve no idea how testy papa gets when he espies errors in the rigging and so forth if you could assist me to choose wisely i would be most grateful er yes i mean t say o course i will youre most kind then shall we meet at the print publisher in old plymouth ive been told he also has some fine sea paintings would wednesday at eleven suit wednesday yes kydd blurted two days ohand this had better be our little secret she concluded with an impish smile come kydd looked up from his pile of official letters ill be off ashore then sir his first lieutenant said boyishly he looked dashing in his cutaway coat and gush of lace cravat and held a rakish silk hat as though he was trying to hide it by all means mr standish the unwritten custom was that the two officers would take turn and turn about to be out of the ship while at short stay in port an good fortune with the the entertainments the other flashed a broad smile and was gone kydd bent once more to his task the constant stream of invoices dockets reports and correspondence requiring his sole attention never ceased to amaze him but any matter skimped or overlooked might rebound at a later time enter he called at a timid knock from ashore sir squeaked andrews it was a simple folded letter from cecilia dear thomas jane has been lately telling me of your dockyard and how it is the very wonder of the age she says that if you are known to a person of consequence it is quite the thing to visit at length under escort you would oblige me extremely if you will indulge my curiosity when convenient his dockyard kydd smiled plymouth big as it now was was near dwarfed by the naval dockyard and the vast population of workers that had grown up around it but he was feeling restless and an excuse to get away and promenade in the sunshine was welcome at ten the north stairs he scribbled on the back of the note she would know where the officers stepped ashore she was waiting for him twirling a parasol and in infectious good spirits such a handsome escort for a lady she exclaimed taking his arm since the return of kydd and renzi from terra australis cecilia had made a remarkable recovery and was now undeniably in looks her strong dark features catching eyes on all sides then shall we spread sail an get under way cec seamen touched their hats with a grin and a grave ensign of foot saluted kydds gold and blue smartly as they moved off round the wall to the fore street entrance the master porter emerged from his little house and recognised kydd with a wave the two sentinels coming to a crashing present this is yr royal dockyard then sis seventyone acres an three thousand artificers not t mention th labouring men i dare t say there are moren half ten thousand men at work before ye now it gave pause for the largest industrial endeavour in his home town the guildford iron foundry could boast of no more than a few score and none other in kydds acquaintance had more than some small hundreds what a charming chapel cecilia murmured looking at a trim little edifice just inside the gates seventeen hundred sis william the third an avenue of welltended lime trees stretched away to a lengthy terrace of fine houses that might well have graced bath or london an those are the quarters of the officers o the dockyardthere yell find the commissioner master shipwright clerk o the cheque all your swell coves gardens at th back an offices in the front but her eyes were down the slight hill to the main dock area and the towering complexity of a shipoftheline in drydock as they approached the scale of the sight became more apparent soaring to the skies her masts and yards higher by far than the tallest building anywhere it seemed incredible that this great structure was actually designed to move clutching kydds arm cecilia peered over the edge of the graving dock unprepared for the sheer grandeur of the dimensions of what she saw the huge bulk of the vessel the muddy floor of the dock so far below and the tiny figures moving about from under ill show ye a sight as youll never forget kydd said mind yr dress he found a small flight of stone steps with an iron handchain that led down into the abyss come on cec frightened but trusting she clung to the chain and they descended down and down the sunlight faded and a miasma of mud and seaweed wafted up thick and pungent on the last step kydd called a halt look now sis she turnedand caught her breath in a giddying domination the colossal greenstreaked bulk of the battleship reared above them blotting out everything as well it stretched away down the dock on and on longer than a town street and the impression of a monstrous bulking poised only on the central keelblocks and kept from toppling by spindlylooking shores caused a strange feeling of upsidedown vertigo kydd pointed past the fat swell of the hull to the further end those are our dock gates cec i have t tell ye that the other side o that is the sea and where were stood is usually thirty feet under th waves they wwont open them while were still here will they she added in a small voice not till i give em the order kydd chuckled but cecilia mounted the steps back to the sunshine with almost indecent haste at the top kydd could not resist stepping over to the adjacent dockeven bigger the seventyfour within seeming quite diminished now this one its the biggest in th world an the dockyard has a story about it y see when it was built it was designed fr our largest ship the queen charlotte of a hundred guns but then the frenchies built one much bigger th commerce de marseille of a hundred and twenty gunsnearly three thousan tons so just in time they enlarged it an finished it fr the war in ninetythree he paused for effect now yell recall in that year that viceadmral lord hood took toulon an much o the french fleet so this is sayin that its just as well they made their changes when they did for the first ship t use the dock was the commerce de marseille herself arm in arm they passed the clatter of the joinery workshops the rich stink of the pitch house then dock after dock each with a manowar in various stages of repair and alive with shipwrightery and riggers at a substantial kiln a procession of men were withdrawing steaming planks wrapped in cloths the chippies use th steam chest t bend their strakes round th frames an fit em by eye thats three curves in one ill have ye know kydd said admiringly remembering antigua dockyard in the caribbean ohthe poor man cecilia gasped peering into a sawpit she had glimpsed the lower individual of a pair who were plying a mighty whipsaw to slice a bole of oak to planks the one above the trestle bent to saw and direct the cut while his partner showered with chips and dust as he worked took the other end in a dank pit the size of a grave all day an a shillin only kydd said then pointed out the rigging house youd not credit it but old tenacious has near twenty miles o rope aboard goes frm your light tricin line all the way t the anchor cable which is two feet round if ye can believe it cecilia nodded doubtfully so kydd went on which is sayin that the crew on the capstan are heavin in seven tons weight o cable alone straight up an down and stand fast the weight of the anchor seeing her suitably impressed he changed tack an above the riggin house we have the sail loft yell know how important this is when i say that we carried moren four acres o sail and if y stop t think that we needs so much spare canvas an ropes wear s fast and multiply this by the hundreds o ships we keep at sea a broad canal crossed their path running a quarter of a mile straight into the interior of the dockyard fortunately it was spanned by a swivelling footbridge this is th camber right up there we have th boat pond an its also where teazer hoisted aboard her fit of anchors an i think i cn find ye somethin there tolerably divertin they turned left towards a stone building a good hundred yards square bristling like a porcupine with multitudes of tall chimneys a muffled cacophony of clanking screeches and deep thumping strengthened as they neared the fitful yellow glare at the glassless windows the smithy cecilia pronounced seeing an expanse of adjacent open ground covered with hundreds of finished anchors each set upright and painted black against rust aye the blacksmiths shop but lets take a peek inside it was a scene from the inferno hundreds of men at work on fifty huge forges in an atrocious clamour whitehot metal showering sparks into the smoky gloom the dismal clanking of the bellows chains and pale faces darting about with redhot objects shall we see th hammer forge cec kydd shouted in her ear hercules they call it an it takes thirty men to it seemed that his sister would be happy to defer this pleasure to another time and instead was content to hear that the shop contributed an amazing number of metal objects to be found about a shipofwar and that when it was time for anchorforging the men demanded large quantities of strong ale in place of their usual gallon of small beer such were the hideous conditions the wonders of the dockyard seemed endless at the mast house cecilia admired a foot mainmast for a firstrate manowar being shaped from a number of separate pieces to form a single spar ten feet round before it was rolled into the mast pond with a thunderous splash at the ropewalk she saw yarns ravelled in the upper storey ready to be laid up together into strands below and these then twisted mechanically against each other to form the rope a sizeable hundredfathom cable takes three thousand yarns kydd explained as she watched after the acrid pungency of the pitch house where she was told about the difference between the two tars to be found aboard shipone was asphaltum from trinidad used for caulking deck seams and the other quite different derived from fragrant pinetree resin from the baltic and was used for tarring ropeshe confessed dear thomas im faint with impressions do let us find somewhere to sit down and refresh it was a little disappointingthere was the wonderful sea stench to be experienced only in the burning of old barnacled timbers to recover the copper and of course the whole south corner where so many noble ships lay building on the stocks and the bunkers hill battery which had a most curious brass gun from paris but perhaps it would be better to leave some sights for another time they walked slowly back to the gate cecilia wore a dazed look and kydd asked did you enjoy th party at all i didvery much thank you thomas she roused herself to say the guests seemed t have a good time kydd said proudly did ye notice the admirals daughter persephones her name he added casually so good in her t come oh yes it was surprising i suppose well she was invited b another lady but cec i think shes interested in me she asked about teazer an if she suited me well anyway i thought she was dear brother hers is a notable family and shes certain to have a whole train of admirers of quite another sort to ourselves but thomas shes a very nice person i can tell but please dont mistake her politeness for anything else i beg miss lockwood kydd advanced into the upper room of the premises where he had been told she was waiting why mr kydd youre very prompt you knowid only just arrived she wore flowers in her hair which complemented her gay morning dress the only other in the room was an unctuous proprietor who hovered discreetly what do you think kydd advanced to inspect the oil it was a robust piece a firstrate vessel of another age with bellying sails and two sloops on an opposing course the man scuttled up and said quickly ah samuel scott a first rate shortening sailtime of the second george he was cast a withering look and retreated mr kydd this was not a time for hasty opinions and kydd took his time a fine painting he began aware from the discreet price tag that the artist was no mere dauber it is th commanderinchief as we cn see from the union at the main an if im not mistaken there is the gentleman himself in the stern gallery with another she peered closer unavoidably bringing her face close enough to his that he could sense her warmth hahm he continued trying to marshal his thoughts however here i find a puzzle the name is shortening sail but i see th sheets are well in an the buntlines o the main course are bein overhauled if there are no men on th yard takin in sail it speaks t me more of loosin sail setting em abroad mr scott was well known as a marine artist a friend to mr hogarth could it be that hes amiss in his nauticals do you think persephone asked kydd swallowed miss lockwood if yell observe the seait has no form all up an down as it were real sea t this height always has a wind across it an you can tell from th waves its direction an this must be th same as the set o the sails she waited for kydd to continue we have here our boats aswim which is tellin us th seas are not s great so why then do we not see tgallants set in any o the ships and yr sloopsat sea we do not fly our union at the fore or th ensign at the staff this is reserved fr when we take up our moorins and bravo she applauded i was right to ask your assistance mr kydd we shall have no further dealings with this artist she threw a look at the proprietor who hurried back i can see we have a client of discrimination he said avoiding kydds eye therefore i will allow you to inspect this pocock he said importantly unlacing a folio a watercolour le juste and the invincible should this be more to your taste do you think he drew it out and gave it to persephone who handed it pointedly to kydd it was of quite another quality a spirited interchange between two shipsoftheline the leeward frenchman nearly hidden in clouds of powdersmoke the liveliness and colour of the sea a deep atlantic green was faultless the glorious first of june of course the man added smoothly seeing kydds admiration you were present at that were you not mr kydd persephone put in to the proprietors evident chagrin but kydd had been a shipwrecked seaman at the time held in a hulk at portsmouth er not at that action he answered shortly neither was papa she replied stoutly yet i do believe you were in another battle besides the nile ayethat was camperdown he said do you have any oil of camperdown she enquired kydd felt relief the price of the pocock was alarming a whitcombe perhaps the man offered camperdown had been a defining moment for kydd soon after the nightmare of the mutiny at the nore he had found escape in the bloodlust of the battle the hardestfought encounter the royal navy had met with during the war it was there that he had won his battlefield commission to lieutenant his eyes focused again his battle quarters had been on the gun deck and the fight had been an invisible and savage chaos outside away from his sight and knowledge however from what he had heard about the engagement afterwards it was not hard to piece together the point of view of the painting yes in the middle this is admiral duncan in venerable right enough drubbing the dutchy de winter in fryhide here y sees th signal number five it means t engage more closely it had been such a nearrun battle with men who had been in open mutiny so soon before raw memories were coming to life theres monarchthats rear admiral onslow who gave me m step his family is frm near guildford sensing his charged mood persephone asked softly is this sea to your satisfaction itsits a fine sea kydd said quietly short n steep as yed expect in the shallow water they has off the texel then this will be the one ill take it the proprietor hurried off with it leaving them alone persephone turned to him with a warm smile so now i have my painting that was kind she moved to a bench against the opposite wall do lets rest here for a moment she said sitting down gracefully it seemed the most natural thing in the world to join her tell me mr kydd if youll forgive the impertinence i cannot help but observe that you look the very figure of a mariner would you tell me what was it that first called you to the sea kydd hesitated any information she would have been able to find about his past would only have covered his service as an officer and he was free to say anything he wished i was a pressed man she blinked in surprise were you really aye it was only at camperdown i was given th quarterdeck he looked steadily at her but saw only a dawning understanding yet you took to the seaas though you were born to it the sea isa different world way of living anan its excitin in a way th land can never be exciting th feel of a deck under yr feet when the bow meets th open seaalways yr ship curtsies to neptune an then shes alive an never still you feel er um he finished lamely no do go on but kydd kept his silence he wasnt about to make a fool of himself before a lady of her quality and in any event she would discover the full truth of his origins sooner or later then i must take it that the seas mystery is not for the female sex she said teasingly then subsided mr kydd do please forgive my curiosity but there are so many experiences denied to a woman and my nature is not one to bear this easily she looked away for a moment then turned to ask in level tones if you are a sailor and have aa tendre for ships what is your feeling when you fire off your great cannons into another which contains sailors like you was she trying to provoke him she must know it was his duty as a naval officer or was she trying to reach him in some way well in course we see this as th foe who brings an item o war forward as were obliged t remove like a piece at chess an we fire at it until it is removed and when you are looking down a musketbarrel at another human being she regarded him gravely the proprietor bustled up with the parcelled work i have it ready your ladyship if you i shall be down presently she said evenly they were left alone once more and she looked at him expectantly i fire on th uniform not th man kydd responded your sword you stand before a man you would pierce with it does it not cross your mind that i have killed a manseveral that im here today before ye is because i did what was this about she smiled softly i was right you are different is it because you won your place in the world the hard way your naval officer of the usual sort would be telling me of duty and honour but you see through the superficialities to the hard matter without adornment rising to her feet she straightened her skirt and in a businesslike voice went on you are an interesting man mr kydd perhaps we may continue this conversation on another occasion do you ride the man from london stood up briskly strode to the centre of the room and looked about smuggling if there are any among you who still thinks to puff up smuggling as the stuff of romance then sir i will take the most forceful issue with you its a pernicious and abiding folderol that conceals the most frightful consequences to the nation there was intelligence but also animal ferocity in the mans demeanour and kydd recalled the respect in the admirals manner when he had introduced him as an emissary from whitehall kydd stole a glance at bazely who wore an expression of studied blankness the three other captains present seemed either puzzled or bored i see that i shall require to be more direct with you sea officers the speaker continued you sir he said pointing to parlby how do you conceive this war is being funded hey where is the means to be found to bestow plentiful vittles and rightful pay on your fine ship it costs his majesty some thousands merely to set it afloat pray where sir is this treasure to be found parlby started in surprise why er the consolidated funds of the treasury which are entirely derived from ahtaxes yes brow furrowed parlby hesitated and was instantly rounded on taxes and since mr pitts scheme of tax upon income was lately repealed what others are left to his majestys government naught but a sad collection of imposts on hairpowder windows candles playingcardsand the dues of customs and excise his glare challenged them all if this source withers the very capability of this country to defend itself is in question gentlemen i have to tell you in confidence that the situation now is of such a grave nature that the prime minister has asked that no pain be spared to control this accursed bleeding of treasure and it is a grievous loss we find that for every ounce of tobacco faithfully dutypaid near a pound is smuggled and three fourths or more of our tea escapes its fair due when i confide our best understanding is that for every cask of contraband intercepted eight get through what is this but a ruinous deprivation to the country that it cannot sustain just so lockwood rumbled discomfited by the mans intensity now gentlemen we are asked to apply our best efforts to the suppression of this vice my orders will reflect this request requiring you to pursue these rogues with the same vigour as you would a privateer or similar he flourished a handkerchief and trumpeted may i remind you that any smuggler taken in the act will suffer seizure of ship and cargo to the interest of the captor chasing smugglers was no way to achieve fame and distinction but on the other hand there was a real threat to the nation and the path to duty was clear sir are there any parts o the coast that we should especially watch kydd enquired devonshire and cornwall might be accounted as having the worst rascals in the kingdom sir theyve been at the trade since the time of good queen bess and i dont believe they see reasons now why they should abandon their ways polperro and fowey have been mentioned and penzance is far from guiltless but you will find their kind everywhere you look each tiny cove and fishing village has its free traders who in the twinkling of an eye can turn back into honest fishermen but there has lately been a change a disturbing and possibly fatal turn our best information has it that an organising intelligence is at work along the coast such that where before we could try to contain and subvert the efforts of an individual village there appears now to be one evil genius who can control and direct the smuggling ventures of all if we descend on one there will be a speedy diversion elsewhere and we cannot watch every contemptible little hamlet the situation approaches dire calamity penzance harbour was a shimmering expanse under summer sunshine while teazer anchored in the lazy calm saw to her domestics kydd returned aboard went below divested himself of his coat then gratefully accepted a cordial from tysoe be damned kydd threw at renzi who sat inoffensively with a book at the stern windows not as who should say but th revenue are a hard crew t fathom he flopped into his chair and took out some notes d ye know nicholas as theres a rare parcel o coves needed t keep a customs post i give ye tidewaiters boatsitters searchers of salt ridin officers an quantities of landwaitersthe rest i forget how entertaining brother did you by chance learn of how they spend their day customs an excise as far as i cn tell theyre tasked to see that every merchant vessel from over th seas attends at a fullrigged customs port an there will find the legal quay t land cargo to be assessed this is where we find our tidewaiters and landwaiters at work t keep a weather eye open that alls legal an above board legal quay aye this is yr definition if freight is landed not at a legal quay then in course its contraband and we may seize the villain but all thisn is your revenue man earning his daily bread where well be of use to em is in the preventive servicecatching the rascals as they come in from seaward to try t land th contraband they have their own officers i believe they do nicholasan a sea service as well if y remember seaflower was revenue cutter builtmonstrous sail area mighty bowsprit an the rest all built fr speed to catch our smuggler but theyve boats as well galley built as will take twenty oars some ofem can go against th wind or chase up a hidden creek and along shore theres ridin officers out on good horses goin up an down the coast atop the cliffs t spy out whats to see with more afoot t call on they will have their successes then kydd looked at him askance theyre losin th battle is my supposina sizeable venture has too much hangin upon it theyre desperate men now theyre bein organised the revenue is outnumberedan just consider would you with a wife an children stand against an armed robber fr a shillin a day then whats to be done renzi said putting down his book were havin a council o war tomorrow the collector has an information as will see us at a landin an then we shall have an accountin im pleased to hear it brother renzi said mildly and picked up his book again er nicholas there is another matter an itll greatly oblige me if yed give me yr opinion you shall have it please acquaint me with the substance of the arguments itsits not yr regulargoin philosophy at all y should know clap on sail and stand on my friend kydd hesitated marshalling his thoughts what do ye conceive a womans meaning is when she calls you an interestin man nicholas in that case id expect shed mean that in some way you have piqued her curiosity aroused her feminine sensibilities in matters of character that sort of thing why has a wicked jade been making her advances ignoring his friends tone kydd persisted an if she needs t know if i ride renzi paused do you mean an tells me to m face that im different frm othersand what are m true feelins in a battle it seemed so unreal now the conversation this is miss lockwood is it not renzi said quietly aye nicholas in th print publishers then it is altogether a different matter dear fellow he sighed kydd bristled how so not to put too fine a point on it you should understand at once that there can be no question of it proceeding beyond the civilities why renzi hesitated i speak only as a frienda true friend you must allow you must take it from me that the higher orders of polite society do view therelations of a gentleman and lady in quite another way it is the object of any union to serve first a social purpose in the ordering of the relationships between great families the arrangements of property and wealth that will ensue and so forth and in this the wishes of the couple are seldom consulted any advances made by your good self will therefore be repelled with the utmost rigour for a young lady must approach any consideration of nuptials with her reputation of the purest hue a casual dalliance withwith another will most certainly be terminated with prejudice kydds expression turned to stone she will no she will not to be brutally frank i am taking it that your intentions are perfectly respectable therefore i must needs put it to you that a marriage of romantic attachment is available only to the lower sort this lady will be expected to conform to her parents wishes and it is my opinion that it were better you remain agreeable but distant in this instance she said i was interestin and damnit im man enough t spy when a womanswhen shes lookin at me renzis face was grave thomas dear friend it has been known for a wellborn lady to playtoywith men and while yr opinion is noted nicholas an i thank ye for it i shall take care but i tell ye now if my addresses are not disagreeable t a lady then i will press m suit if i feel so inclined the collector of customs for penzance closed the curtains of the long room im sorry to have to ask ye to come at such an hour this night itll become clear why later kydd and standish sat together in the front row kydd ignored a quizzical look from his first lieutenant and waited patiently the rest of those in attendance were hardfeatured and anonymouslooking individuals who were not introduced proceedings opened quickly it seemed that mysterious information had been received of a run in two nights time it promised to be the most daring for months and would involve a degree of deception but there was apparently one great advantage the revenue possessed ill trouble ye for the lights the collector boomed importantly one by one the candles were snuffed leaving the room in heavy darkness there was the sound of grunts and scraping from the end of the hall then quiet stay in your seats if y please i should explain to ye that we have now a gentleman whos in with the free traders and has the griff concerning their plans which hes agreed to let us know for a consideration yell understand o course that hell be requiring to keep his face from ye so ill thank ee not to ask questions as will put a name to him now anything y may wish to ask from the body of the hall a voice called wheres the run then in the blackness nothing could be made out of the man beyond a vague shape praa sands the voice was deep and chesty with little attempt at disguise thats where yell see em two nights time praa sands why thats i didnt say thats where th cargos run ashore i said thats where youll see em he paused see theyll make a showing an while youse come athunderin along the tubs are bein landed in another place where stackhouse cove are ye forgettin acton castle only a couple o hundred yards above an at dead low springs theres a strip o sand will take a boat easy enough kydd had no idea of the location or its significance but he would find out more later er do y know aught o the signals theyll use he threw into the darkness an odd sensation two lights together in bessys window n the coast is clear o the revenue leadin lights are two sets o spout lanterns in th field below the castle trouble pistol flashes anythin else what vessels can we expect t see ah well i cant help ye with that who is it organising do you think standish demanded loudly after a slight pause the man replied an that neither it was quickly settled as the smugglers expected the revenue at praa sands that was where they would be while teazer would lurk offshore at stackhouse cove over a convivial draught the collector pulled out a chart the whole stretch o coast heremounts bay east from perranuthnoe to the lizardis nothing lessn a nest o thieving scapegallows and the worst of em youll find past cudden point here just on from stackhouse cove ever hear on the carters king of prussia john calls himself and he an his brother harry have led us a merry dance this last twenty years had a bloody tumble with druid frigate once running in a freight at cawsand even and leaving men dead whats this was mentioned about yr castle kydd came in acton castle thats john stackhouse then the slivey knave knows the carters well but claims hes only abotanising seaweed id like to know as how your seaweed is such a rare business he can set up a castle on the proceeds it would be a fine thing t catch him out mr kydd he added grimly well be ready are y sure yell want to stay at praa sands kydd asked i dont altogether trust our manchances are hes told us its only a show at praa while were off to stackhouse cove and the truth of it is praa sands is where itll be landed so with most of us and the kings ship safely away out of it theyll be rolling their tubs ashore there thank ye but well stayand know yell be doing y duty at stackhouse cove if its to be the other way there was a warm stillness to the night they were trying to close with the land in murky darkness a smugglers moon a filmy crescent of light was just enough to make out shapes and movement without betraying detail that same stillness was robbing the ship of steerage way just when it was most needed sir i have t warn yethe greeb aye thank you mr dowse kydd needed no reminding about the evil scatter of crumbling granite that was basore point or the particular menace of the greeb a dark lacing of rocks reaching straight out to sea for nearly a quarter of a mile away boats if the smuggling gang could try conclusions with a frigate then kydd was taking no chances as many as he could spare would go with standish and lie concealed in undergrowth behind the long lizardlike cudden point overlooking stackhouse cove others under prosser would take up position on the near side at trevean teazer left them to it ghosted back offshore and hove to it would be impossible to see an approaching vessel until it was upon thembut at the same time they themselves would not be seen kydds plan was to wait until the landing was in progress signalled by the shore party and catch them in the act from seaward an hour passed in absolute quiet the slap and chuckle of water along their side and the creaking of timbers in the slight swell the only sounds then another it was difficult to keep men mute for so long but kydd had warned the petty officers of his requirement for silence a shape materialised next to him a roborant against the night air dear fellow renzi whispered proffering hot negus kydd accepted gratefully but out of consideration to others slipped below to his cabin to finish it it sticks in m throat to see teazer used so he growled as fine a manowar as swam set against a gang of shabbaroonsits not natural you were lecturing me sternly only this morning about the countrys peril from such blackguards aye kydd answered morosely the collector expects forty or so in a vessel fifty ashore t lift cargo others is it right to set our seamen in harms way like this it is their duty renzi said firmly as it is yours but do you not think the greater villain is he who funds and orders their depredations the greater villains he who buys their run goods thered be no smuggling else just so it would however be a fine thing to examine these creatures at some length renzi mused in part for the insights we might gather into the sensibilities they violate in order to resolve a response to the claims of their perceived environment will we discuss th philosophy at another time kydd said ill be returnin on deck could sight th rogues at any time midnight approached still no sign of smugglers let alone a ship wearily kydd scanned the shore yet again no lights no signals praa sands was out of sight behind cudden point and therefore there was nothing to indicate whether the landing was going on there only an inky blackness a rocket soared into the night sky from beyond the point th shore party theyve seen something hands t th bracesmove yrselves bellowed kydd another rocket sailed up this time at a sharp angle out to sea god rot it kydd swore looking over the side at the pitiful speed they were gathering but with half teazers number on shore nothing could happen quickly still no lights no signalsand no ship anyone sees anything anything atall but there was nothing a chance thinning of the clouds lifted the level of illumination enough to show that stackhouse cove was empty but two rockets was no accident could the landing be taking place on the other side fervently grateful for the fair southwesterly kydd brought teazer about and hauled for cudden point which they passed as close as he daredand at once made out a large twomasted lugger lying inshore motionless lay us alongside mr dowse kydd snapped the information had been false and had successfully lured the two forces away from the true landingplace but for kydds precautions of having men ashore and standish wisely keeping lookout on both sides they could have landed their tubs safely out of sight a muskets flash stabbed the darkness from the lugger then another followed by the crack of a fourpounder kydd burnt with angerfor such vermin to fire on seamen defending their country a broadside from teazer could settle the matter on an instant but that was not the way it must be tysoe appeared with his fine fighting sword which had seen so much honourable action in the absence of the first lieutenant it would be kydd leading the boarding he shook his head no tysoe thank ee theyre not worth its bloodying he crossed to the arms chest and took up a cutlass no firing less they do he roared and prepared to leap the firing died away as they neared and confused shouting came from the shadowy figures in the lugger theyre skinning out yelled a foremast hand pointing a boat was in the water on the other side and men were tumbling into it the two vessels came together in a mighty thump and heavy creaking and kydd jumped down the foot or so to the deck of the lugger racing aft towards the wheel followed by a dozen teazers secure th helm he ordered and strode to the side the boat was in a tangle of panicking men get out kydd roared mr kydd theyre in a mill ashore sir andrewss voice was cracking with excitement and as kydd watched there was a flurry of shots in the shadowy cliffs theyre making a fight of it sir the smugglers had scores of accomplices on shore to carry away the contraband and standish might be in real trouble if he chose to make a stand into th boat teazers he bawled in a frenzy they pulled into the small cove and grounded on a tiny patch of sand a rush of men met them but it was cutlasses against cudgels and they broke and fled scrabbling up the steep scrubby cliff in the distance hoarse shouts rose and faded they were alone teazers ahoy kydd bellowed mr standish sir the voice from the spine of the point was accompanied by a crashing of undergrowth and the dishevelled officer appeared panting but with the white flash of a smile in the darkness a good nights work i believe sir be damned t that wheres their cargo ohah it must still be aboard sir the boat was shoved out into the black depths to return to the lugger its crew squatted sullenly on deck mr purchet get into th hold an see if theres anything in it kydd called to the boatswain empty sir i already checked then it could only be at one place they would have to move fast for if they missed their chance all evidence would be lost quickly kydd gathered a party of men and took the boat back into the little cove after me he ordered them and struck out for the heights in the shadowy dark they slipped and scrambled up the rough path to the slopes above where a stone building stood in darkness you three wake em up an stand guard upon my return nobody t move an inch breathing heavily he headed up towards the massive square bulk of acton castle a single light showed below the central battlements but the rest was in utter blackness with me he ordered and moved forward quickly thankful to meet the level grass of a lawn the party hurried across it and stopped at an oddly narrow front entrance kydd hammered on the door with the hilt of his cutlass his men crowding behind no movement he banged again louderit produced a querulous cry from inside but kydd knew that if he could move quickly enough there was no possibility that they could conceal dozens of bulky tubs in time in the name o the king he bawled with a tedious sliding of bolts and grating of keys the door finally swung open to reveal the anxious face of an aged servant mr stackhouse get me mr stackhouse this instant y villain hehes not here the man stammered suddenly catching sight of the men crowding behind kydd then get him ii pushing him aside kydd strode into a hall bedecked with mockmedieval hangings he looked sharply about then hailed his party take position at the doorways all of yesmartly now kydd pricked his ears if there was any mad scurrying to hide contraband he would hear it but the night was still then there was movement on the stairs the light of a candle showed at the top and began to come down it was an elderly man in nightgown and cap who descended slowly at the bottom he stopped and stared about him mr stackhouse kydd challenged brusquely the mans gaze turned on him incredulously and kydd became aware of eyes with the unmistakable glint of authority you he grated what the devil do you mean by this sir there was something about mr stackhouse ive reason t believe a pox on it im not john stackhouse as well you know sir er captain praed sir kydds feverish mind supplied the rest this was none other than nelsons senior navigating lieutenant whom hed last encountered at the battle of the nile those years ago he was now a postcaptain and bizarrely the new owner of the castle the next few minutes were a hard beat to windward for commander kydd the stone building above the cove turned out to be a country drinking den bessys tavern an they swears they know nothin sir did they take him for a fool thank you mr purchet an ill keep a tight guard until daybreak then search properly but the smug look on the landlords face gave little hope that they would find anything distant hails proved to be the party from trevean on the other side who came up breathlessly agog for news savagely kydd sent them about their business and returned to teazer it had not been a scene of triumph but he was damned if hed give up now we carry th lugger to penzance fr inspection he grated conceivably the vital evidence was still aboard in a cunning hidingplacefalse bulkheads trick water casks and the rest in the morning they would search the drinking den he had fifteen men sealing it off for the rest of the night and nothing would get past them call me at dawn he told tysoe and fell into his cot fully clothed he woke in a black mood even the beauty of the unfolding daybreak as the sinister dark crags were transformed by the young sunshine into lightgrey and dappled green failed to move him with nothing to show for their efforts there would be accusing stares on their return to penzance the searchers went early to bessys and returned while he was at breakfastemptyhanded then an idea struck one that had its roots in a messdeck yarn far away and in another time mr stirktobyive called ye here in private t ask fr help stirk said nothing sitting bolt upright his black eyes unblinking im remembering seaflower cutter in th caribbee a foul night at moorins off jamaica i think it was y had us all agog wi a tough yarn about a woman an a ghost do y remember no sir stirk answered stolidly i do t this day ill tell ye right scareful he added in as comradely a manner as he could manage an y happened t mention then that a long time ago ye may have been among the free traders o mounts bay i was just wonderin if that were so taking his time stirk considered and said slowly y has the advantage of me mr kydd an you knows it but then i has th choice as t what i says back he looked away once and when his gaze returned to kydd it was direct and uncompromising yer wants me to dish m old shipmates an thats not possiblebut i cn tell ye that the catblash about mounts bay was part o the dit t make it sound good as is allowed i hail frm romney marsh which is in kent an it may have been there as i learnt about th trade but th only time i was in these parts was in fox cutterbut north cornwall barnstaple an lundy so it had been worth a try aye thank ee toby he allowed a look of sorrow to steal across his face y see im vexed t know just where it is ashore they stowed th cargo seems a hard thing t up hook an sail away without we have something t show for our troubles there was no answering smile such a pity o course we sail back t penzance having been truly gulled an theres the revenue on th quay waitin an laughin at our teazer a squiddy kings ship as doesnt know th lay kydd waited realising he had unconsciously slipped back into focsle ways of speaking but there was no response so he rose to his feet m thanks anyway tobya rummer afore ye go its not ashore give me a boardin grapnel an the pinnace fr an hour it didnt take long under the interested gaze of teazers company the boats crew plied the grapnel near where the lugger had been until it snagged a couple of hands at the line and the first dripping tub broke surface quickly followed by more each weighted and roped to the next in a long line with a smuggling lugger prisoners and four hundred gallons of evidence a wellsatisfied sloopofwar set her sails and left chapter ill have t leave ye to yr books then nicholas kydd said in mock sorrow his friend was dipping into some musty tomes in the corner of a shop in vauxhallor foxhole to seamen street er ahyes this could take some time renzi replied absently shall we meet later plymouth was a maritime town but unlike the noisier portsmouth it held itself aloof from the immediacy of a large navy dockyard and fleet which were safely out of the way in dock across the marshes instead it was merchantship captains from the vessels in the cattewater who could be found in the inns on the heights of old plymouthbut if any would mingle with the seafarers of a dozen nations or venture into the rough jollity of their taverns and hideaways they could also be found in the rickety antiquity of cockside and other haunts around the pool kydd had no wish to be caught up in their shoreside sprees and made his way up cat street and past the guild hall to the more spacious reaches of the old town which the great seadog sir francis drake had called homehe had returned to the sound triumphant from a voyage round the world loaded with treasure loosing anchor just a few hundred yards from kydds new residence his first anxious question doth the queen still reign it was pleasant to be part of the thronging crowds to step out over the cobblestones and past the ancient buildings that gave plymouth such a distinctive character he stopped to peer into a shops windows at some gaudily coloured political cartoons why mr kydd he straightened and turned miss lockwood he made her an elegant leg a dainty curtsy his reward cynthia this is commander kydd of the royal navy and a friend of mine mr kydd may i introduce miss knopleigh who isno let me work it outa third cousin on my mothers side isnt that so my dear kydd bowed again the use of friend not lost on him miss knopleigh a pleasure t make yr acquaintancean so good t see you again miss lockwood miss knopleigh bobbed demurely to kydd and said warmly oh so this is the interesting man you told me about im so gratified to meet you mr kydd she stepped back but continued to regard him thoughtfully we were on our way to allstons for chocolatewould it be so very importunate to ask you to join us mr kydd and perhaps to tell cynthia a little of your voyages the chocolate was very good and the ladies applauded kydds descriptions of naples and nelson the summit of vesuvius and the inside of a pashas seraglio he felt his confidence grow she had called him friendand had introduced him to her cousin did this mean that was most enjoyable mr kydd persephones skin was fashionably alabaster but her hazel eyes were frank round and uncomfortably disconcerting the longer they lingered on him kydd caught a ghosting of perfume as she opened her dainty reticule i dont suppose you will be long in plymouth this time she asked as she took out a lace handkerchief ah iwe await a new foretopsail yard it being wrung in a blow no moren a sennight i should have thought miss lockwood oh its so disagreeable when that sort of thing happens then she smiled well we must go goodbye mr kydd and thank you for your company renzis quill scratching away in the quietness of his cabin intruded into kydds thoughts was he imagining it or had persephone meant something special when she spoke of him as interesting he had detected no furtive glances no betraying flush of that other kind of interestbut here he was at a disadvantage for every woman he had known was of quite another quality the loose rules of engagement with them did not apply here and if he was to press his attentions but did he want to yes she was the most attractive and accomplished woman he had ever known or spoken to and she did seem the cabin felt small and stifling er i think ill take a turn about th decks nicholas he said renzi murmured acknowledgement and continued to scribble the deck was nearly deserted standish and most of the men were ashore and kydd was left alone to pace slowly should he make his interest in miss lockwood plain what if he was completely mistaken and she had no interest of that sort in him would she be furious at an unforgivable impertinence from a lowborn or worse laugh him to scorn it was galling to be in such ignorance but he knew he was being swept into regions of desire and ambition that made resolution imperative a muffled roar of good humour came from the messdeck below jack tar would have no qualms about action in the situation cease from backing and fillingclap on all sail and fearlessly lay alongside he bit his lip renzi would be of no help he had made his position clear but there was one who might then what is it thomas thats so pressing i must make my apologies to mrs mullins at such short notice cecilia said crossly once they were safely in the intimacy of the drawing room im sincerely sorry cec t intrude on yr social situation kydd said moodily staring into the empty fireplace y see ive some thinkin t do an it needs sortin out of a kind she looked at him keenly of a personal nature id suspect aye sis private ye might say that isnot t you o course he shifted uncomfortably can y tell me true cec th answers to some questions you bein a woman and all a lady the last time i looked she said tartly what are your questions then thomas kydd mumbled if y arent goin t help me then dont be a silly of course i will although why you dont go to nicholas with your man problems i really dont know heshes set in his views is all he said embarrassed this is somethin ii need t ask you cec very well go on ahy see ii met miss persephone lockwood on th street with her cousin an she youre taken with her and against all my advice you wish to press your amours cec dont say it like that imshes er i see well do not i pray ask me she stopped at kydds expression and her manner softened dear brother its just that id loathe to see you brought low by an uncaring world tell me do you feel for her that much cec im thinkin of her all th time shes like no one ive ever metor even seen afore shes how do you conceive her feelings are for you thats what i need ye to advise me on to tell you what she feels towards you this is a hard thing thomas one womans way of showing her inside feelings will be very different from anothers and besides miss lockwood will have been brought up to control her passions strictly let me ask you was your meeting on the street by way of an accident do you think aye it must have been for then she takes you directly to a public chocolatehouse mmm how did she introduce you to this cousin cec she called me her friend an the cousin said she was pleased t meet persephones interestin man an looked at me you knowthat way i really dont understand what you mean by that thomas but it does seem she is talking about you to her friends and this is a good start tell me also does she look at youdo her eyes linger this is gettin a mort too deep fr me cec but th last thing she asked was how long the ship was t be in plymouth the ship kydds brow furrowed well yes it was how long i would be ah cecilia said fondly then i do pronounce that indeed brother she is interested in you reddening kydd gave a pleased grin what d you think of her cec ive not yet had the chance to get to know herand neither it must be said have you thank ee cec now i know whats m course kydd said happily thomas ive said it before and i wont again but after your first task to win her heart you must then start all over again to impress her family and friendsbecome part of her world kydd nodded wryly but cecilia pressed on inexorably we shall suppose you do win her what is your intent for her to debase her breeding so that she comes down to your level of politeness or should it be your duty to strive to attain her level of gentility that she must make apology for your boorishness to her friends or be proud of your accomplishments aye sis i cn see all that then first you must attend to your speech thomas it is sadly neglected after all i told you and is not at all fit for gentle company now this is what you really must do kydd lay back in his new fourposter and stared up into the darkness his talk with his sister had been hard and lacerating it was all very well to be proud and contented with an outstanding sea career but women it seemed were on the one hand concerned to discover the man that lay beneath and on the other taken up with foolish notions of what others might think whether it be in the matter of incomes or appearances of dress and manner he had no reason to disbelieve hershe had gone out of her way to express her love and supportbut her constant insistence on the niceties of polite behaviour was trying yet cecilias words about whether persephone should make excuses for him or be proud of him were unanswerable he would have to try his damnedest to wipe away all betraying traces of his past then doubts crowded inthe first of which was the loudest was all this vanity what proof did he have that she felt something for him there were signs that had been pronounced positive but just supposing she had indeed been drawn to him her feelings grewand then a passionate declaration her heart would tell her which was of a truer value and it would not be trivial details of speech and behaviour or even a humble background in fact she knew of his past and it had not in the slightest affected her addresses towards him it was possible if she really wanted him nothing would be allowed to stand in the way her parentsthe brother of a viscount and the sister of an earlwould have to be reconciled or be estranged so for appearances sake a discreet settlement would be made that would see them setting up a small estate somewhere in the country a carriage or two and ample servants and above all he could appear among the highest in the land with persephone mrs thomas kydd on his armeven at court where everyone she knew would be agog to see whom she had married damn it it was all very possible some perversity stopped kydd telling renzi when the invitation came he knew his friend would feel impelled to lecture him on deportment the graces of the table and interminable other points for this invitation to a reception in honour of some foreign grandee was a prize indeedbut it was to him alone although at short notice and thereby again implying kydds role as useful bachelor it was to saltram house the seat of lord boringdon and unquestionably the finest estate in the area whatever the reason behind the invitation he had reached the rarefied heights of society thomas kyddcommon seaman that wasmoving in such circles the rest was up to him he had been given his chance and if he performed creditably acquitted himself with elegance and wit polish and urbanity he would be noticed other invitations would come and but for now there was much to take on board the coach ground on interminably past the cattewater to the plym he had decided on full dress uniform it was expected in this age of war but also it had the inestimable advantage that he would not have to concern himself with the imperatives of high fashion or the costhe felt a twinge of guilt when he remembered how he had wheedled renzi that real bullion gold lace was crucial for a naval captains fulldress uniform his friend had glanced at him once then gone without a word to their common stock of funds still the effect of so much blue white and deep gold was profoundly satisfying and would stand against anything the haut ton could parade they crossed the plym and began the ascent up the final hill to saltram kydds heart beat faster he had devoured chesterfields guide to men and manners then consulted debrett and others in the matter of forms of address and details on european nobility as always the gentlemans magazine had provided plenty of material for smalltalk and he had gone to some trouble to acquaint himself with current plymouth gossip to mrs barguss surprise and delighted assistance in the privacy of his bedplace he had assiduously practised his vowels and constructs until renzis expression at breakfast told him that progress had been made he was as ready as he could be the spare classical stateliness of saltram was ablaze with lights in the summer dusk and a frisson of excitement seized kydd as a footman lowered the sidestep and stood to attention as he alighted in a few moments he would be entering a milieu to which he had never aspired until now and so much would hang on how he comported himself commander thomas kydd he announced to the head footman attending at the door it was the largest entrance hall he had ever seen complete with doric entablature and a roman bust set about with panels and carving the area was rapidly filling with guests of splendour and importance the candlelight and brilliance an exhilarating backdrop to the scene it had begun he took a deep breath and turned to the distinguished gentleman in the plumcoloured frock coat to whom he had just been introduced soon there was movement a general drift inside the velvet drawing room drawled his acquaintance have you been here before not to saltram kydd replied languidly i hail from surrey originally he added inspecting his cuffs in a lordly way oh really the man said interested then youd know clandon the room was impressive redvelvethung walls decorated in the italian way with giltwood and stucco and an ornately carved marble fireplace the babble of conversations rose and fell the rich foetor of candlesmoke perfume and warm humanity an intoxicating assault on his senses he accepted a tall glass from a goldfrogged footman furtively he glanced about for familiar faces in the crowded room ah yes clandon splendid place a credit to the onslows he said casually and sipped his champagne suddenly the arched double doors at the far end were opened ceremoniously to reveal an even bigger room beyond a hush descended as a wellbuilt majordomo took position his grace the landgraf karl zähringen of badendurlach there was a surge forward but kydd held back while the more lofty dignitaries went in and made polite conversation while he waited and observed it quickly became apparent that an equerry was discreetly approaching individuals to be introduced and conducting them forward when the time came then kydd spied her nearly hidden in the throng he saw admiral lockwood and his lady before he caught sight of persephone on her fathers arma vision in lemon silk and a tracery of cream lace talking gaily as though it were quite the most ordinary evening of course she would be here he admonished himself was this not her world by right they were led forward and kydd saw lady lockwood held at a fawning curtsy by a genial gentleman in a splendid hussars uniform others made their way in and then the time came for kydd he strode into the great room holding himself proud and ignoring the magnificent pale blue silkdamask walls the perfection of the italianate painted ceiling and the blaze of light from the tortoiseshell and ormolu candelabra the equerry brought him to a discreet distance but the previous couple had not yet concluded the man holding forth in florid german eventually they retired backwards the man giving three short bows and the equerry murmured sir commander kydd his britannic majestys navy commander the landgraf zähringen kydd swept down in a leg of extreme elegance practised in his cabin until his muscles ached your graceor since the happy elevation of your father the margrave to elector should this not be hoheit sir he straightened to meet raised eyebrows your grace vill do kapitan und may i say ow rare it is to meet an english who know th happening in our little kingdom his benign features creased with pleasure thank you your grace and might i desire you a happy stay in england the weather being uncommon pleasant this time of the year he dared vy thank you may the fortunes of war be kind to you kapitan kydd backed from his presence remembering to bow three times before he turned away in relief and growing exultation he was succeedingand on his own merits with earnest attention but wandering thoughts he held himself quietly while he heard of the grave consequences of the fluctuations in corn prices in the north country and their probable effect on change he looked about him discreetly and saw persephone listening politely to a voluble colonel with forbidding whiskers then her head turnedand she gazed directly at him before he could look away there was a sudden wide smile and a nod of acknowledgement covered with confusion he bowed his head stiffly and forced his eyes away from her but his thoughts raced if he had had any doubt before that he was merely a name to her it was gone now in another existence he would have boldly gone across and taken things further but now he was unaccountably hesitant the evening proceeded a light supper was brought in and everyone found a seat kydd practised his smalltalk on a ponderous gentleman and simpering middleaged lady adorned with ostrich feathers and covertly noted that persephone had resumed dutiful attendance on her parents your grace my lords lord boringdon clapped his hands for attention pray do indulge me for a moment the good landgraf has expressed a keen desire to hear our english entertainments and what better i thought than to beg miss sophie manners to oblige the goodnatured applause was redoubled when a shy young lady rose and made her way to the pianoforte there was a scraping of chairs as all manoeuvred to face her a little piece by mr purcell she announced nervously her voice was pure and sweet but the prolonged tinkling of the melody was not altogether to kydds taste he brightened when a tall soldier in scarlet regimentals joined her to sing a duet which in its pleasant intertwining of voices proved most charming after rapturous acclaim they sang another the soldier grinned broadly most kind in you he acknowledged when the clapping died and bowed to both sides then looked directly at kydd could i persuade the navy to stand up for us he called jovially kydd froze but a storm of encouragement brokethe royal navy was popular in these parts he cringed but there was no escape he stood to be greeted with thunderous applause but was rooted to the spot speechless at the sight of so many lords and ladies staring at him with expressions ranging from boredom to avidity then he felt a light touch on his arm it was persephone dont be anxious mr kyddwere all your friends here youll see she said softly and then more loudly mr kydd will now perform and i will accompany on the pianoforte she took his arm with a winning smile and drew him firmly towards the front to a very tempest of support she sat at the instrument and stretched her fingers but kydd stammered in a low voice i ddont know anything miss llockwood nonsense she whispered back this pretty piece of mozarts perfect for you youre a baritone her fingers caressed the keys in an expert introductory flourish and the room fell quiet you shall turn the page for me mr kydd will you at his stricken face she added softly dont worry ill manage just follow the wordstheyre below the stave he stared down transfixed iti cant she looked up at him with sympathy and unconcealed disappointment kydd pulled himself together thank you miss lockwood but ive just remembered oneand this ill sing on my own that is to say a solo he stepped forward and faced the august room the serried ranks of painted faces the formidable lords and gentlemen the landgrafthen filled his chest and sang it was one of the only pieces he knew well songs that held meaning and memories but that he had kept suppressed for many years on the quarterdeck it came out with deep feeling the parting of an outwardbound sailor from his true love turn to thy love and take a kiss this gold about thy wrist ill tie and always when thou lookst on this think on thy love and cry the simple melody was received in absolute quiet kydds powerful voice echoing about the room and soon a soft improvisation from the pianoforte tentatively accompanied it strengthening and growing in invention as the chorus repeated the song finished there was an astonished silence and then the room broke into rapturous applause kydd dared a glance at persephoneshe returned it with one of delight her eyes sparkling i rather think an encore is expected she said fondly shall you kydd obliged with a focsle favourite and then his lordship and a bemused landgraf heard a salty rendition of spanish ladies persephone coming in almost immediately with a daring flourish and a laugh now let every man take up his full bumper let every man take up his full bowl for we will be jolly and drown melancholy with a health to each jovial and truehearted soul while he sang out the old words heartily he saw reactions about the room ranging from delight and amazement to hostility he dared a glance at admiral lockwood and saw him pounding out the rhythm on his knee with a broad smile his lady however impaled him with a look of venom kydd finished the fine sea song to thunderous acclaim and persephone at his side bowed this way and that well done mr kydd she whispered her eyes shining you were wonderful kydds heart melted renzi was sitting by a single candle at his desk when kydd returned he glanced up and seeing kydds expression remarked drily so the evening might be accounted a success then brother ayethat is to say it passed off right splendidly nicholas he peeled off his coat and flopped into his chair wearing a broad smile that would not go away anddare i hazard the observationyou there saw miss persephone lockwood i did kydd said sheepishly and gave a graphic account of events and y should have been there t hear the thumpin applause they gave us at th end he said with huge satisfaction renzi heard him out then shook his head in wonder so by this we can see you have achieved your object you have indeed attained an eminence in society he declared and it must be admitted that at one and the same time you have been able to attract notice it seems though what a young lady of breeding will make of a gentleman who eschews mozart for spanish ladies i cannot begin to think then can i point out t you nicholas that it was this same who came an played for me in the first place an it was she who said i should do an encore kydd retorted acidly renzi stretched and gave a tired smile in any event dear fellow you are now known and talked about for good or ill the society world knows you exist and have made conquest of miss lockwood the foretopsail yard now promised for wednesday would be fitted and squared on thursday and friday of course being not a day for sailing to any rightthinking sailor kydd would begin to store teazer for a saturday departure he called purchet to his cabin to set it in train only a few days more guiltily he was finding himself reluctant to put to sea and he told himself sternly to buckle down to work renzi was dealing swiftly with a pile of ships papers his pen flying across the pages no doubt eager to dip into the parcel of books that had recently arrived at number eighteen there was now the difficult task of how or indeed whether he should open some form of address to persephone was she expecting an overture from him should he ask cecilia or was advice on the best way to woo another woman not quite what one might ask a sister a knock interrupted his thoughts as a letter for the captain was handed to him respectfully kydd recognised cecilias bold hand and smiled at the coincidence tearing open the seal another letter fell out with unfamiliar handwriting cecilia went quickly to the subject to his growing astonishment and delight and she is wondering if you would wish to accompany us i really think you should thomasit would get you out of your ship and seeing something of the moors which are accounted to be some of the most dramatic country in the kingdom a ride on the high moorthe wilds of dartmoor with persephone the other letter was from persephone in a fine round hand and addressed to cecilia whom she had met at the picnic kydds eyes lingered on the writing it was perfectly executed penmanship with few ornaments bold and confident the content was warm but practicala rendezvous at the goodameavy stables a few miles north on the tavistock road wellphrased advice concerning clothing for ladies and then in a final sentence the afterthought that if commander kydd found himself at leisure that day did cecilia think he might be persuaded to join them cecilia said little on the journey out of town and gazed from the window as they wound into the uplands it suited kydd his thoughts could jostle on unchecked would it be a substantial party the lonely moor was probably a place of footpads and robbers so he wore a sword a discreet borrowed hanger rather than his heavy fighting weapon he hoped his plain riding outfit of cutaway darkbrown frock coat and cufftop boots would pass muster with someone accustomed to the latest in fashionable wear above the trees beyond he could see the rearing bulk of the bare hills that formed the edge of the moor and his pulse quickened presently they swung into a lane and stopped in the spacious courtyard of a considerably sized riding stable the concentrated odour of horses was heavy on the air as they were handed down cecilia finding coins for the coachman there was no party waiting and he felt a stab of anxietyhis fob watch told him they were on time a groom led out a fine arab that snorted and pawed the ground with impatience persephone arrayed in a brown riding habit walked beside it her hair was pulled back severely a few chestnut wisps escaping from her masculinelooking black hat why mr kydd i do adore your taste in colour she said teasingly glancing at his coat kydd bowed deeply aware of cecilias respectful curtsy next to him miss kydd it is a pleasure to see you again persephone went on in the friendliest tone it is tiresome but the men are so disinclined to make the journey to the moor to ride and i do so love the freedom here do you ride much not as much as id like miss lockwood cecilia said carefully eyeing persephones spirited beast i do find however that a morning canter does set the pulse to beating dont you her mount was a pretty dappled mare of more docile habit than the arab and the groom adjusted the robust sidesaddle with a slipper stirrup for her kydds horse was brought out a powerfullooking mahogany bay which he approached with caution its eye followed his every motion and when he swung up it skittered and snorted tossing its head feeling the bit oh thats sultando you take no nonsense from him mr kydd sometimes he can be quite a rascal if he gets it into his head kydd strove to let the horse feel his will and after some i lltempered gyrations it seemed to settle and he brought it next to cecilia he stole a glance at persephone she looked breathtaking her handsome straightbacked posture set off by the fall of her habit there will be a hamper and champagne for us at hele tor should we deserve it she said shall we they clopped across the cobblestones of the courtyard then turned in single file up a leafy lane kydd happy to allow cecilia to follow persephone cautiously while he rode behind on his fractious steed the groom with the pannier of necessities brought up the rear it was now clear that no one else was to join them and he glowed to think that they must have been specially invited the lane stopped at a gate which kydd opened and held for the ladies it led to the open moor the vast swell of heathland romantically bleak and farreaching with only the occasional dark clusters of rocks the mysterious tors to intrude on the prospect at last laughed persephone and urged her horse straight into the wild openness kydds horse whinnied as the others went ahead and he had no difficulty in spurring it on feeling its great muscles bunch under him he passed cecilia who was concentrating on finding her rhythm and quickly came up on persephone who threw him a surprised but pleased glance her eyes sparkling have no concern mr kydd the footing here is excellent kydd was having some difficulty reining in his horse and persephone increased pace to keep with him she swayed effortlessly in her saddle round rambling patches of furze and laughed into the wind her cheeks pink with exertion kydd glanced round and saw that cecilia was trailing but the groom had stayed with her so he turned back to the reins as they cantered further into the moorland kydd was struck by its wild immensitynot a tree hedgerow or building in sight it was an awesome lonelinessnot unlike the sea in a way the rhythmic thudding of hoofs on the turf came together in a bloodrousing thrill of motion a sudden flutter of wings made kydds horse rear its hoofs flailing the whites of its eyes showing in terror he fought to stay aboard dropping the reins and seizing the animals mane with both hands as it teetered then crashed down to leap forward in a demented gallop kydd hung on in grim desperation as the horses panicked flight stretched out to a mile or more he tried to claw forward to retrieve the flying reins but in vain instead he lay along the beasts neck hoping its pace would slow as its energy gave out eventually sultans frenzy lessened and kydd dared to loose one hand to snatch at the flying reins then transferred the other his thighs gripping his mounts sides as he did so he saw a watercourse of sorts disappearing into a wooded fold and coerced the animal to head for it hoping the thicker going would slow it the first bushes whipped past then more substantial trees and the horse slowed the gallop fell to a canter and then to a trot with a sigh of relief kydd straightened only to be summarily ejected from the saddle as the horse bucked unexpectedly kydd whirled through the air and landed in a tangle of boots and undergrowth he lay on his back staring up and panting a breathless concerned persephone came into focus oh my poor mr kydd she said and knelt down her gloved hand on his are you hurt may i help you up miss lockwood kydd managed and hauled himself to his elbows that damned mutinous beast he gasped which is to say that i should clap him in irons as would teach him his manners to an officer he pulled himself to a sitting position your pardon while i recover my senses he said pulling greenery from his hair and feeling his leg cautiously of course she sat demurely next to him the groom will take care of miss kydd and i see sultan is not to be troubled the horse was browsing contentedly nearby on the lush verdancy by the edge of a stream persephone turned to face him you know i am glad to have met you mr kydd we are both she dropped her head and toyed with a leaf when she looked up kydds eyes held hers for a long moment as he helped her to her feet they found themselves together in a kiss which took them by surprise she froze then said with just the faintest quiver in her voice we must find the others now chapter get yr head down y ninny hissed stirk luke calloway crouched lower in the hedgerow as a horse and rider clopped down the narrow lane in the darkness mr stirk an were safe now isnt we calloway said aggrieved stirk listened for any others who might be coming then stood up and stretched shut y trap younker an do as i says even though they had made it this far just a mile from the tiny fishing village they were not safe yet stirk hefted his bundle and they resumed their journey it got steeper the village glimmering below was nestled in a coombe a deep valley with precipitous sides and seemed shoehorned into a tiny level area the lane had become not much more than a path when they finally reached the first houses by a little stream bless me mr stirk but th place stinks calloway protested a strong insistent reek of fish was thick in the night air stirk stopped and listened again strangers would be viewed suspiciously in this small community as possible spies for the revenue and all it needed was for some frightened widow to raise an alarm but there was no sign that the inhabitants were in a mind to roam abroad in the dark where d we kip mr stirk first we finds th kiddleywink stirk snapped th what what the janners call a pothouse lad he said looking around even a village this size should have two or three they headed towards the snug harbour and on the far side near the fishquay buildings the three pilchards was a noisy beacon of jollity stirk checked about carefully then he and calloway passed by a blacksmiths shuttered forge and hastened into the tavern it was small but snug and dark with the patina of age the aroma of spilt liquor eddied up from the sawdust on the floor and the heady reek of strong cider competed with the smell of rank fish from outside the tavern fell silent half a dozen weathered faces turned to them distrust and hostility in their expressions the tapster approached them wiping his hands where youse come frum then he demanded as is none o yr business stirk said mildly and crossed to a corner table from which he could survey the whole room but a shant o gatter d be right welcome he said sitting and gesturing to calloway to join him the tapster hesitated then went back to pull the ale one of the men sitting at a nearby table fixed unblinking eyes on stirk and threw at him e axed yez a question frien stirk waited until the ale came in a wellused blackjack a tarred leather tankard why now an isnt this a right fine welcome fr a pair o strangers he took a long pull then set it down quietly he felt in his pocket and slapped down a small pile of coins thisn for any who cn find us somewheres t rest maybe two three days nice an quiet like an then well be on our way he clinked the coins patiently after a few mutters with his companion the man came back loudly i knows what thee areyere navy deserters b glory stirk bit his lip and then said warily s whats it t you mate thinkin on sellin us out the man cackled delightedly knew oo ye was soon as i clapped peepers on yez he turned to the other and said something that raised a laugh ah but yell be stayin moren a coupla days i reckon the other added he had a milkyblue blind eye else theys goin t cotch ye stirk said nothing what they call yez then the first asked jemll do an this skiddy cock is m shipmate harry oh ayebut if y wants t stop here mr jem we cant have useless bodies atakin up room thee looks likely ladsdone any fishin mackerel floundersome hake stirks boyhood had been the hard life of an inshore fisherman at hythe in kent it seemed to satisfy davey bunt the first said jan puckey the other came in an tnight ill see y sleepin in a palace i promise ye they slept in one right enough in coarse canvas on a bed of nets reeking of fish in what the cornish called the fish pallace the lower room of dwellings turned over to keeping the family fishing gear and storing pilchards pressed into tubs stirk rolled over vainly seeking a more comfortable position and ruefully recalling that nights at sea in a small fishingboat were far worse had this been a bad mistake a decision made on the spur of the moment that he would come to regret and had he been right to involve luke the young man knew so little of the wider world stirk was under no illusions of the risk they were not yet trusted and could be disowned on the spot until they had proved themselves and in the future it was all because of what he had done at stackhouse cove that night several weeks ago mr kydd had remembered his smuggling reminiscences and seen his knowledge at first hand now he had allowed himself and luke to be landed ashore and under the pretence that they were deserting seamen they had made their way to the smugglers haunt of polperro to see if they could win confidence and discover something of the unknown genius who controlled the trade in the darkness he heard calloway grunt and turn over he must be missing his comfortable hammock stirk thought wryly for luke it had been the adventure that appealed but the only reason stirk had volunteered was the deep respect and indeed lopsided friendship he felt for his captain whom he had seen grow from raw landman to firstclass seaman then achieve the quarterdeck and now the command of his first ship it was unlikely that in trim little teazer they would achieve anything like lasting fame in their duties in the plymouth command stirk was well aware that without it the best that could be expected for kydd was a quiet retirement amid the fading glory of once having commanded a kings ship he would try his copperbottomed best to give kydd a triumph to bear back thank ee mrs puckey stirk said gratefully to the closemouthed woman after she had handed him a piece of coarse bread to go with his gurty milkthin seed gruel she said nothing her dark eyes following his every move th first time ive bin fishin mr puckey calloway said respectfully i aim t learn sir he grunted you will son he said significantly and his glance flicked to stirk mackerel y said aye well be out handlinin tonightboy cowan says hes awillin t have youse along owns th boat an we all has shares in th catch puckey said firmly stirk finished his bread no business o mine cully but we sometimes hears as polperros not a place t beat fer free tradin why then there was a sudden tension in the room puckey laid down his spoon very deliberately and glared at stirk we doesnt talk about such here cuffin ye understan me o course me bein in the trade as a kitlin an all stirk added quietly meeting his eyes there was no response and he bent to his meal again a ragged child came up and stood gazing at the strangers good day y young scamp stirk said the boy continued to stare at him then suddenly broke into a chant mother at the cookpot father with his brew waitin for the gennelmen wholl dish the revenoo mrs puckey clapped her hands and scolded him he disappeared it was bright outside as the three men made their way to the quay the earlymorning sun drying the effects of the overnight rain and setting off the little village to gleaming perfection gulls wheeled and keened about the fish quay in front of the three pilchards while boats bobbed and snubbed at their lines in the harbour on each side the land sloped up steeply with occasionally cottages perched at seemingly impossible angles it was as individual a place as could be imagined every house set to suit its tiny plot of rock and thin soil the dwellings of all hues owing more than a little to shipwreck timbers along the seafront fishermen were taking advantage of the clear morning light to mend nets and work on tackle past the tavern was a jumble of rocks and a final jagged cliff soared at the narrow but picturesque harbour entrance a short pier beyond the three pilchards gave shelter to the inner harbour well now an heres boy hisself said puckey as they reached the level area of the fish quay mornin mr cowan cowan was well into his sixties and whitehaired but had a genial manner that gave him a serenity beyond any cares jan are these th noo hands ye told me of aye jem here an thats harry yeve whiffled fr mackerel jan tells me i did an can ye tell me what yarn y used fer y snoods cowan asked casually cobblers thread mebbe gut stirk answered in the same tone an a long shanked hook if wes expectin hake cowan eased into a smile we likes horsehair in polperro jem like t bear a hand on th nossil cock you an young harry both this was a simple wooden device that twisted together yarns for greater strength into a snoodthe final length carrying the hook that stood out from the main handline calloway was set to pulling an endless cord passing over a series of whirligigs that were set into a frame to spin hooks with the yarns beneath stirk with a piece of soft leather took the strands and evened out the twists lead weights giving it all a momentum finally the nossil was detached and a hook whipped to the line with a mackerel feather there we is mate said stirk looking with satisfaction at his finished snood wheres the backin line forty fathoms of line looked an overwhelming amount lying in a heap but stirk faked it out in sixfoot coils and patiently began the task of working a figureofeight knot every half a foot needing to heave the whole length of line through for every knot these would be where the snoods would attach and it would see him occupied for hours calloway was sent away to help with the barkingdipping nets and sails into the boiling cutch a nauseating mix of burma bark and tallow cant we not fin em some breeks darlin puckey said when his wife came with the noon tea theyll be haulin fish b evenin from somewhere she found smocks knitfrocks and canvas trousers reeking with old fishslime and two seamen were translated on the spot into fishermen later the most important article appeared sea boots the like of which calloway had never seen huge and thighlength they were of hard leather encrusted on the soles with hobnails boy cowan cocked an eye skyward and with a seraphic smile pronounced mackerel or herring they agoin t be about tnight bait up boys his work finished until evening stirk decided to wander round the narrow lanes to the consona rocks where the boatyard was seeing the last touches to a repair on the skippers boat which un is mr cowans he called to an aproned shipwright working on a vessel propped up in the mud the man looked up briefly this un he said and went back to his planing polperro fancy was lettered on her square transom and she was a beamy halfdecker well used by the sea and in pristine order but so small sprit main stirk guessed noting the snotter without sails it was difficult to make out her rig beyond the single mast and long bowsprit which no doubt would sport at least two jibs for balance and speed the shipwright straightened slowly squinting up at stirk against the sun an whos askin ill be goin out wi mr cowan tnight hope theyre bitin for ye the man said wiping his forehead apparently unwilling to pursue why a complete stranger would be going out to the hard work of the fishing grounds with his client yes yere in th right of it we call em spreeties y only fin luggers at looe stirk nodded looe three or four miles away would have different local conditions different traditions of boatbuilding handed down this foreandaft rig was almost certainly to keep as close by the wind as possible when passing through the narrows at the harbour mouth he looked again there was only a tiny cuddy forward and two compartments amidships before the open afterdeck probably a fish hold and net stowage and was certainly not suited to the running and concealment of contraband how is she mr butters cowan hailed respectfully from the end of the pier opposite ready for ye an hour afore sundown the shipwright shouted back at the appointed time and replete after a meal of scrowled pilchards and backgarden potatoes stirk and calloway trudged over to their boat their hobnailed sea boots crashed on the cobbles but caused not the slightest interest as others made their way down to the harbour a busy and amiable throng the gathering sunset was gilding the hilltops and shadows were lengthening among the tightly huddled dwellings of the village as they reached their craft now afloat and nudging the quay playfully yere a puckey then i see one said to stirk as they jostled down the narrow lane stirk blinked and cowan chuckled as yere wearin a puckey knitfrock an all the women knit em in th family pattern fer their men if were misfortunate makes identifyin the bodies easier they clambered aboard the fancy and were joined by bunt and puckey who seemed to know instinctively what to do as cowan mustered his fishing gear and set the rigging to rights the two seamen tried to keep out of their way evening drew in and it was time to join the many boats heading out to the grounds cowan had a last look round then took the tiller gave the orders to loose sail and called let her go then davey the bowline dropped and the fancy caught the wind and slewed before crowding with the others through the rockgirded polperro harbour entrance most fishingboats stood out to sea towards the setting sun but cowan with an inscrutable smile put down the tiller and taking the wind astern the polperro fancy set her bowsprit for up the coast stirk tried not to show his interest from seaward polperro and its snug harbour was almost completely hidden so close to the rugged shore he could easily distinguish where run cargoes could landthe sandy coves small beaches in obscuring twists of shoreline suggestive caves no wonder the revenue was so hardpressed to cover the coast heres yourn bunt said to stirk handing him a small frame an id get y line on th cater here ready mate the beamy boat was lively even in the slight seas that evening but stirk knew that its response to every wave meant it would remain dry he wound the line ready baited round the cater frame and waited mr cowan how does y know where the fish are calloway asked noting that several of the other boats had turned about and were now following them at first cowan did not speak his face turned into the wind to sniff gently his grip on the tiller firm then as they sailed on there came quietly the distilled wisdom of the cornish fishery talk of sea marks to fix favourite subsea rocks the arcane habits of mackerel and ling conger and pilchard spur dog and dab herring shoals square miles in size rising stealthily to the surface at dusk that could be detected by bubbles fizzing upward from below and the faint smell of oil on the surface of the sea the whole to sink down again at dawns light the dexterity of the longliners and the seiners the willow withies of the crabbers the evervital pilchard fishing all were testament to the multitude of hardwon skills of the fishermen as the red orb of the sun met the horizon two lanthorns were lit and sails were lowered with a small island barely in sight in the soft dusk cowan glanced over the side once and waited for the boat to drift further the only sound the chuckling of water and creak of gear he scanned the shoreline for some sea mark then said quietly thisll do jan obediently puckey took up his cater and began to lower stirk made to do the same but cowan stopped him with a gesture after an interval puckey grunted fish is slight mr cowan small sail was shown to the wind and they ghosted inshore a little way and the sail was doused puckey repeated his work and after a longer time he showed satisfaction now will do cowan said and in the increasing darkness their lines went down stirk felt the fish strike the tugs connecting him with the unseen world far beneath which must now be a swirl of glinting silver in the blackness as the shoal orbited the unlucky ones jerking on his line just as they had in those allbutforgotten days of his youth bunt was first to haul in with a full line over the gunwale hand over hand grunting with effort until the first fish jerked into view flipping frantically there was a craning to see but cowan peered over and announced mackerel lads sure nough puckey soon followed and then an excited calloway and before long the midships was a welter of hooks line and slippery striped fish then the work started two hours later the shoal had left and aching in every bone stirk and calloway were allowed first rest in the stinking confines of the cuddy only to be woken not long after when the shoal was rediscovered further eastwards with eyes strained and sore from the effort of baiting hooks by the faint gleam of a lanthorn the lines went out againand again came the toil of heaving in and the messy work of gutting afterwards all the while they fought a clamping weariness a lull followed as the mackerel sounded deep again and then there was blessed rest but with the suspicion of luminance to the east the mackerel returned and it was to the lines again until the suns orb rose and the fish sank down once more brave bit o fish jan bunt said with tired glee as the hold showed near full it is that puckey replied and glanced at cowan aye ill grant ye cowan said cautiously shares all roun what do thee men say t these two gettin a whack the cover was placed on the hold and polperro fancy made for home stirk lay back exhausted this was a job like no other however their readiness to bear a hand must have been noted and their acceptance into this small village would be that much the closer around fifteen boats converged with them in the final entry to harbour on the flooding tide sails were brailed and they lay to a scull at the transom waiting for room at the fish quay they found a place and stirk bent his back once more in the task of keeping the baskets filled to sway up and disgorge on to the noisy quay where an auction was taking place for some reason the others in the boat were downcast and when they had finished and taken the fancy to her moorings stirk asked cowan why chancy thing mackerel fishinsome days y finds nothin other days he was without his smile as he went on well tday every soul in polperrosave ushas good luck they stopped at the edge of the fish quay and he pointed out a strapping woman with a basket on her back and voluminous pockets filled with salt thats a fish jowter sellin our fish all over th parish shes sittin pretty cos with everyone lucky the markets flooded and prices go t the devil he gave a theatrical sigh and added will we be seein ye again mr jem after crumpling into their bed of nets stirk and calloway slept until midday at which point hunger drove them to reenter the world mrs puckey had seen the boats arrive and land their catch and her lips were thin whats fer vittles darlin im gutfoundered puckey said sprawling wearily in his chair teddies n pointwhat else cn thee expect she muttered bringing over a pot ththe what mrs puckey calloway asked hesitantly puckey grinned without humour taties as we grows at the back an shell point out th meat fer thee in case y misses it after the thin meal stirk made his excuses and the two shipmates wandered down to the harbour and the outer pier where they sat leaning companionably against a pile of nets at first stirk said nothing letting the keening of the gulls wheeling over the fish quay form a backdrop to his thoughts he lay back and closed his eyes enjoying the warmth of the sun on his aching limbs he heard calloway stir what d we do next mr stirk he grunted fer now cully ill allow its toby till were back aboard but were they getting any closer to uncovering anything to do with smuggling it was odd but here the fisherfolk were clearly dirtpoor and hardworking not as would be expected if they were living high on the proceeds of smuggling aye aye toby calloway replied and went on more soberly i dont want t go back t mr kydd wi nothing y know as we both dont mate stirk muttered what d ye think hed do ifn he was here toby i dont know what mr kydd would do ifn he was here younker stirk said sarcastically but of a surety in his place kydd could be relied on to find some cunning way through if there was one thing kydd had it was a right sound headpiece that had set him apart from the start that and the sand to stand up for himself when it was needed he didnt want to let the man down what must it have cost kydd to claw his way to the quarterdeck and now be captain of his own ship in a way stirk took personal pride in this one of his own gun crew of the past reaching for the stars and getting there and besides which kydd was a right true seaman not like some he could put a name to no he had to do something luke step down t mr butters an help him see if y can hear aught o this smugglinbut steer small cuffin theys a short way wi them as runs athwart their hawse he stood up stiffly there was nothing to be gained from sitting about and waiting he would take a stroll see something of the place keep a weather eye open polperro was as distinctive a fishing village as it could be its focus was the small harbour of course and the steepest sides of the coombe were bare of dwellings but as he walked he could see that this separated the settlement into a working western side with the fish quay and humble homes and the eastern area with more substantial residences a charming rivulet ran down to the sea along which ageless buildings crowded together in a communal huddle stirk walked the narrow streets passing the chapel by the tiny green and one or two humble shops nothing in any wise betrayed the presence of smuggling folk looked at him curiously but he could detect no suspicion or hostility either polperros reputation was undeserved or the revenue was getting the better of the problem both of which contradicted what mr kydd had been told it was a conundrum and stirk knew he would have to try harder to resolve it puckey was outside his house mending nets he gave a friendly nod and stirk went inside for his bundle then he had an idea carefully he cleared the fishing gear and clutter away from the far corner exposing the dusty earth floor he found a stick and brought it firmly across feeling as he went nothing then again a few inches furtherand the stick caught he smoothed the surface and looked closely until he found what he was looking for a faint line in the dust he slipped out his seamans knife prodded and twisted until he had the disguised trapdoor free then swung it up to reveal a cavernous space below a candle stub in a pottery dish stood nearby he took a sniff this hidingplace had been used recently he replaced everything and left quickly outside puckey looked up if thee has th time m wife would thank ye well fer a hand at th taties she was halfway up the hill scraping a furrow in the thin soil of a little plot and was grateful for stirks help he didnt mind without this to sustain them in bleak times they would starve and besides it gave him time to think they worked on silently until mrs puckey stopped suddenly and listened from afar off there was a faint cryit was repeated with an urgency that set stirks hair on end its th huer she breathed god be praised th huer stirk asked in astonishment as the cry was taken up from windows and rooftops along the steep hillsides and round the harbour people hurried from their houses and fields and began to scramble for the lower parts the cry now plain hevva hevva hevva wha see she pointed down to the rocks that guarded the entrance to the harbour on the highest stirk could see a figure capering about clutching what looked like a tin trumpet through which he kept up his cry the huer hue n cry get down wi ye she shouted and pushed past him the pilchardsre here stirk looked out to sea below circling and plummeting gannets he saw a peculiar long stain of redpurple and silver in the water extending for a mile or more with the rest he scrambled and slid until he reached the path and joined the throng converging on the harbour a sharpfaced man with an open notebook sized him up in an instant pull an oar he snapped aye volyer he ordered and gestured impatiently at a curious low and broad open boat being readied sitting at his oar stirk grinned to himself a gunners mate brought to this pass but if he didnt show willing to lend a fist with the rest his chances of getting near to them would fade a net was manoeuvred into the boat and as they pulled out of the harbour the plan was explained to him the other boat had the main stop net to encircle as much of the pilchard shoal as they could at which point their boat would close the gap and assist to bring ashore the captives a third boat the lurker would bear the master seiner who would direct the operation stirk knew there would be hard skilled work before the fish could be landed they made a wide sweep carefully approached the shoal from seaward and slowed to a stop the man on the oar opposite nudged him the huer on the high rocks had stopped his cries and was now holding a coloured cloth in each outstretched hand which he wigwagged in a series of signals watched attentively by the master seiner give way y bastards he bawled throwing the tiller over their own boat followed obediently and stirk saw they were essentially being directed by the watcher high on the rocks to where the fish were and the master seiner was deploying accordingly at just the right moment and place the quartermilelong stop seine began shooting into the sea along its length in a curve right in the path of the shoal and when it was out the toil of joining the ends together in a vast circle started it was backbreaking work bringing the inert mass of seine net and the weight of uncountable thousands of fish into a vast circle but that was nothing compared to the unending travail that followed of towing the entire mass to the nearest sandy bottom lantivet bay where the fish would finally come ashore the secluded beach no more than a couple of miles from polperro was crowded with excited people the boats came closer and just when the mottled black and pale of the seabed glimmered up through the clear water the master seiner called a halt resting on their oars the men of the stop seine boat watched as stirks companions readied their own tuck net whose purpose soon became plain smaller than the stop seine it was shot within the larger then brought tightly together gathering the catch to the surface in an appalling agitation of threshing fish screaming gulls and the frantic plunging of stones on ropes to deter escape at the rapidly diminishing opening lade im yelled the master seiner pounding the gunwale of his boat with excitement everyone aboard the volyer threw themselves at the fish with tuck baskets broad flaskets and bare hands they scooped them as fast as they could into the boat ashore children screamed and frolicked women clustered with baskets and called to their men in exhilaration and when the boat was finally heaved into the shallows they too joined in the glorious mayhem the sheer quantity of fish caught was colossal tons in weight hundreds of thousands of silver shapes swirling in the stop net but the master seiner eyeing the haul stopped the tuck and declared thatll do fer now boys the rest could safely be left to mill about in the net for later well jem how d ye like our fishin sport enough heh the three pilchards was in a roaring good mood fishermen with their immediate futures now secure drinking to their good fortune stirk lifted his pot decent taut thisn he growled yell have another davey mate a glass o bright cider is jus what i needs bunt answered expansively fishin gives thee such a thirst an all signalling to the harried potboy stirk said s now ye has a right good haul then bunt leant forward and said earnestly pilchards mean a brave lot t us jem as we do say in these parts heres a health t the pope an may he repent and lengthen six months th term of his lent fr its always declared betwixt th two poles theres nothin like pilchards fr the saving of souls puckey came across and sat with them this is long tom shar jem thee should know as fer hake an conger there aint a finer hand solemnly stirk allowed himself to be acquainted as well with zeb minards and sam coad the bushybrowed blacksmith it was happeninghis work in the boats was paying off he saw calloway in one corner in close conversation with a shy fishergirl still in her pinafore stirk winked when he caught his eye and turned back to hear about the hazards and rewards of driftnetting suddenly the happy noise subsided two men had entered these were no fisherfolk and they looked about guardedly one by one the fishermen turned their backs the tavern taking on a pointed silence whore them mates stirk asked puckey leant over and in a hoarse whisper said bad cess theys revenooers jem wished on us t watch th harbour nobodyll take em in so theys forced t sleep in a boat one looked at stirk their eyes met and stirk froze he knew the man it was joe corrie in his watch on deck in the old duke william and a miserable shipmate into the bargain if he was recognised it would be disastrous stirk moved quickly dropping his head he croaked feelin qualmish mateshave t be outside sharp like and slipped away through the back door as he hurried away from the tavern he noticed that he was being followed he plunged down one of the opeways dark narrow passages between the old buildings along the rivulet unfortunately one of the dwellings had swelled with age and he found himself wedged unable to continue shamefaced he had to back out and his pursuer was waiting it was the blacksmith coad dont y worry o th revenooers frien theys up an gone but theres someone wants t see ye do y mind they returned to the three pilchards but this time to a back room where a welldressed man with dark sensitive features waited thisn is simon johns his ol man died last year n now hes lookin after the business thank you sam johns said and gestured to stirk to take a chair to be brief i was there in the pilchards when the preventives came your subsequent actions tell me that you are no friend to the revenue no roughknot sent here to spy among us and did not our mutual friend jan puckey tell me that youre no stranger to free trade yourself stirks face was impassive but inside he exulted i mayve been he said cautiously looking intently from one to the other may we know in what capacity frenchy run wi tobaccy an brandy smacksman on the marsh creepin fer tubs that kind o thing i dont think it wise at this point for you to risk the sea but we have need still of stout men on shore would you be interested t nobble a patterroller he said doubtfully waylaying an inquisitive revenue riding officer was not what he had come here for not as who should say i didnt mean that we have more than a sufficiency of men to take care of such unpleasantries no what would make best use of your seamanlike capabilities would be more the spout lantern stirk grunted this was more like itat the landing lights for the cargoes to be run ashore in the right place aye i can do it pay half a guinea on the lantern for the night another half if theres trouble done does m matey harry find a berth mmm we can find him something a skinker perhaps it was just as it had ever been the familiar tensions and short tempers suspicion and fingering of concealed weapons far out to sea there would be telescopes trained waiting for the signal that it was this night they were running in the cargo in the kiddleywink a dozen hardfeatured men sat with pots before them also waiting for the word to move stirk had been passed his instructions by coad only an hour or two before to make his way with an innocentlooking pair of farmhands driving pigs over the steep hill eastwards to talland bay and there wait in the tavern for sunset it needed brains and organisation to bring the run to a successful conclusion even with the consignment of goods assured in guernsey or elsewhere there was the hazardous journey across the channel before the landing and then the need to coordinate scores of men for the unloading and rapid carryingoff of the contraband the little taphouse was remote and near the small beach a stranger might wonder why so many along the coast were situated so suspiciously but stirk knew that in the hard life of a fisherman the ready availability of a cheering pot in close proximity to a place to draw up a boat would be appreciated outside a seaweedcutter poked lazily about the foreshore but in his barrow under the pile of kelp two spout lanterns were ready for use and the several men mowing at the edge of the field were doing so to prepare a signal bonfire the sun lowered and stirk went outside in the waning daylight he had quickly identified the best approach from seaward in the winds prevailing at the time past the inshore rocks to the small sandy strip of beach and made contact with the other lightsman together they would set up leading lights each some hundred yards above the other that the skipper of the smuggling vessel would keep in exact line to ensure a safe approach the lanterns they would use were enclosed a long spout fitted to each however that would hide the gleam from all but those on whom it was trained at last there was action a body of men arrived in a boat one had a muffled face and gave brisk orders to the others stirk had no difficulty in recognising johnss cultivated voice a young farmhand on a white horse was summoned off you go lad he was told and to subdued cheers from the men he dismounted and set off for the coast path leading it selfconsciously by the bridle it was the signal that the coast was clear of the revenue in the gathering gloom the landing party took shape stirk and the other man retrieved and lit their spout lanterns then took up their positions on the hillside a gruff man claiming to be stirks assistant stood next to himhe was being watched shouts in the twilight directed a stream of new arrivals a loose chain of men was being formed that stretched down from the woods that lay in a fold in the hills behind the tavern packhorses wound down from the hilltop and a troop of donkeys gathered on the beach then gangs of men with blackened faces set off to either side hefting clubs and the occasional steel of a weapon could be seen heaven help the revenue or excise man who stumbled upon them stirk calculated there must be more than a hundred and therefore the high stakes of a valuable cargo so far he had recognised only johns could he be the leader probably locally but not the evil genius he had been told about who was coordinating the whole coast doubts crept in this was a far larger and more detailed operation than he was used to without asking betraying questions how would he get to the central figure he glanced at the tavern it was locked and barred the landlord and tapster would later be able to claim truthfully on oath that they had seen nothing suspicious that night what was harry doing if lights get those lights going damn it lifting the clumsy lantern he trained the thing out to sea making sure it lined up with the two sticks he had placed in front of himself now that the approaches were in darkness the unknown master of the vessel would cast back and forth until he could see the lights then begin his run into the unknown being sure to keep the two lights precisely vertical darkness was now nearly complete the moon not due to rise before midnight and it was impossible to make out anything to seaward stirk kept up his vigil but if they were surprised by tipped off preventives aided by dragoons he would be taken up with the others and no mercy shown his shoulder hurt where the lantern rested but he persevered keeping the light carefully trained then a subtle thickening of the darkness ahead became evident by degrees its form resolved into a large lugger ghosting in the cargo had arrived a rising hubbub was cut short by bellowed orders as the receiving party made ready men splashed into the shallows while others drew the packhorses closer the black shape grew in detail then slowed and elongateda kedge had been dropped and the vessel rotated until it lay head to sea stirk lowered his lantern and grinned into the darkness a successful arrival it was the feeling he had experienced all those years ago now for the landinga large ships boat was in the water loading in minutes and what looked suspiciously like his volyer had emerged from behind the westward point on its way alongside it was matchless organisation the first boat stroked vigorously ashore and grounded to be instantly set upon with not a single light the waiting men were each roped up with a halfanker tub suspended from front and back and sent waddling up the hill in a line larger casks were rolled over to the packhorses and heaved into place while the donkeys took two ankers apiece the pace quickened with the tide on the ebb and the moon due to make its appearance there was no time to be lost packages probably tea and silkswere transferred to the saddle panniers of a horse and sent off into the night still the casks came ashore hundreds were taken steadily into the darkness to some hidingplace in the woods nearby farms homeseven church crypts holland gin rum the finest wines and certainly cousin jack the best cognac it was on a breathtaking scale by now the casks alone would number considerably more than a thousand and the line of human carriers still patiently trudged on by morning there would be the best part of ten thousand gallons of the finest spirit safely inland for distribution later and not a penny of duty paid the stream lessened by rise of moon the job was safely complete the line of men dissipating the lugger slipping out to sea shouts of drunken hilarity pierced the night and stirk knew that some carriers had broached a cask and were probably at that moment sucking raw spirit through straws it was time to be off with nothing whatsoever gained for mr kydd he knew now how it was done much the same as it was in kent but the times placesthey would change the figure behind itwell down by the beach he could see johns paying off the volyer crew and he strode down waiting for the right moment er mr johns a word wi ye this is no work fr a seaman i feels ready t sign fr a workin voyage can y arrange it like arent you concerned you may be seen by a kings ship well sir a smugglin voyage is always goin to be inconspictable an bsides its the only trade i knows mr johns i understand i cannot promise a berth that is not within my gift but there may be later the following evening johns took stirk up talland hill to a modest cottage where a single light showed at a window inside they were met by a kindlylooking gentleman who studied stirk with keen attention the man jem sir johns said respectfully and waited for the inspection to finish very well the gentleman said and returned to sit at his desk it was scrupulously tidy papers arranged squarely and a stand of red and black ink with quills set neatly before him you are a mariner i can see thatbut have you run cargoes cross channel his voice was oddly soft aye sir roscoff in brandy an silks afore the last wari knows th lay bless ye sir and on extended absence from the kings service im free t ship out with ye now sir if youll recall sir johns said privaulx of the flyer is still in exeter prison yes i know but i mean to make trial of master jem here first he stood up my name is zephaniah job you may believe my business interests are many and im sure we can make use of you pray wait a moment he left the room and returned shortly with a massive ledger he opened it and ran his finger down the columns ummi see we have two brothers entered for a guernsey run in spirits not four days hence you have no objection to shipping as an able seaman on good report i can promise an advance later itll answer fr now by the way simon job said quietly looking at an entry it seems mevagissey is down for the next moon fowey revenue are getting uppity and i shall want more men in the shore party see to it if you please he closed the book and looked mildly at stirk we shall discover how you well you can act mr jem youll join two brothers in looe two nights hence her skipper will have my instructions before then chapter is this the man i saw standing with bloody sword at the gates of acre steals into the enemys midst in minorca who for the sake of a romantic tryst dared the wrath of gibraltars town major renzi challenged for shame mr kydd in the space of less than a day we shall have returned to plymouth and come under notice and the object of your admiration will then be wondering whether your ardour yet burns undimmed in her absence as ladies set such store on these matters you must therefore indicate in some wise that your interest in her is unabated with sometoken of your esteem kydd continued to stare up at the deckhead from his easy chair it had been an uneventful cruise stirk was still away in polperro and there had been no sign of any privateer leaving him time to reflect on events ashore things had come to pass on dartmoor that had no explanation other than that miss persephone lockwood had formed an interest in him which was now personal nicholas iim out o soundings on these matters y see im concerned that if i press my attentions and youre on th right tack about yr ladies playin with well what im trying t say is fear not if the lady wished to toy with you then what better than before the large and distinguished audience at the princely reception no dear fellow you must try to accept that for reasons which must escape mere men you have caught miss lockwoods fancy butbut if i pursue her and it doesnt fadge then itll be so renzi snorted dear chap do you really believe that youll be the first to suffer a reverse in the pursuit of an amour if so then shall i remind you that faint heart never won fair lady he gave a halfsmile besides i believe that on this occasion you will find the logic unassailable on the one hand if you hold back for fear of rebuff then of course you cannot succeed to win her hand for the other if you are active in your addresses and are repelled then you may failbut equally so you may be gladly received and go on to a blissful conclusion therefore only one course is reasonable kydd gulped and pulled the doorbell he had never been to the admirals house before and its severe classical frontage seemed to frown at his audacity in visiting simply on a social matter mr kydd calling upon lady lockwood he said as firmly as he could to the footman handing over his visiting cardhis name in blue copperplate with an acanthusleaf border much recommended by renziand waited nervously by the rules of society he could not call upon miss lockwood directly that would never do for a gentleman he had first to navigate past her mother and he dreaded facing the formidable matriarch perhaps the footman would return to announce that lady lockwood was not at home to him he heard footsteps and braced himself the door was opened but by the admiral in comfortable morning clothes he appeared bemused mr kydd this is a pleasure of course but may i enquirelady lockwood ssir kydd stuttered it was not going according to the script that renzi had patiently laid out for him the footman should have admitted him to the drawing room where the ladies would be sitting demurely sewing there would be polite conversation before tea was proffered he would not stay less than fifteen minutes or longer than half an hour and could not look to seeing miss lockwood alone at any time t be more truthful sir it was well i was hoping to call upon miss lockwood to express personally my thanks for the reception the admirals expression eased with the glimmer of a smile heartened kydd went on an to be bold enough to ask her advice in a matter of music my profound regrets mr kydd but i have to tell you lady lockwood is at the moment somewhat discommoded he paused but then said lightly however i shall enquire if persephone is able to receive you will you not come in there was no one in the spacious drawing room lockwood turned and spoke to the footman while kydds eyes were drawn to the fine seamanlike painting in pride of place above the mantelpiece you like it mr kydd persephone presented it to me recently damn fine taste for a woman i thought see herenot many artists remember to slack the lee shrouds in anything of a blow and well you were present at the action as i remember a good likeness masters mate only sirbut this is a rattlin fine piece o work t be sure kydd agreed warmly peering more closely at it then the door opened behind him why mr kydd how kind in you to call her voice was charged with such unmistakable delight that he gave a boyish smile before he remembered his polite bow miss lockwood her hair was in fetching curls that framed her face and he found himself looking away while he composed himself er i called to express personally my sense of gratitude at your handsome conduct towards me at the reception another bow could not go amiss and persephone returned it with a curtsy of acknowledgement andan if yed be so kind yes mr kydd she looked impossibly winsome um that i can ask your advice in the article of polite music which you consider i might with profit erertake aboard lockwood had wandered to the other end of the drawing room and was absently looking out of a window music why of course mr kydd i should be glad to assist she beamed and crossed to the pianoforte lifted the lid of the stool and pulled out a thick wad of music you have a fine voice mr kydd im sure we can find something ah this will always be well received a favourite of the prince of wales she set it on the pianoforte do come and sit beside me mr kydd youll not see the music from there kydd hesitated lockwood had turned to watch but stayed near the window so he moved over to the instrument and discovered that the stool was designed to accommodate two sweet lass of richmond hill she said in a businesslike tone its in twofour time and begins like this sweeping her hands gracefully over the keys she picked out the tune and sang there shall you sing for me now sitting so close and singing to her kydd felt terror mingle with delight and wanton thro the grove oh whisper to my charming fair i die for her i love o may her choice be fixd on me mines fixd on her alone id crowns resign to call thee mine there was the sound of rapidly approaching footsteps and the door was thrown open lady lockwood hurried in her hair hastily pinned up and face with the barest dab of powder persephones playing faltered and stopped they both got to their feet oh mr kyddits kind in you to call lady lockwood said icily kydd bowed as deeply as he could returned with the slightest possible bob the admiral moved over swiftly my love commander kydd has called to tell persephone of his appreciation for the way in which she rescued him at the reception if you remember oh and if she might have any suggestion as to any music he might hoist in as it were in any other circumstance it would have been diverting for kydd to witness the look of scorn that words from his admiral received can that be so she snapped and with me lying in bed so ill and wondering all the time what the commotion was about really reginald without waiting for a reply she turned to persephone who stood with her head hung in contrition your drawing master will be here at three you will now allow mr kydd to go about his business persephone yes mama he will no doubt have a list of your suggestions and be satisfied with them good day mr kydd kydd bowed wordlessly and turned to go impulsively persephone went to him clutching the music and gave it to him do practise thisfor me mr kydd he swallowed that i will miss lockwood she curtsied deeply and ignoring lady lockwoods furious look kydd left his heart singing nicholas your notea matter of urgency concerning thomass future you said cecilia said breathlessly ignoring kydd who was rising in surprise from his favourite armchair next to the fireplace miss cecilia allow me to take your pelisse renzi said smoothly and handed it to tysoe waiting behind her yes indeed i did and i rather fear it might require some action on our part nicholas whats this y say kydd said putting down his newspaper has hedoes this concern miss persephone lockwood do i hazard nicholas cecilia asked it does renzi said solemnly oh he hasnt kydd coughed significantly cec this is all he has paid a call on the lady at her home and been received warmly cecilias eyes sparkled did shehas he hopes of a further that is the matter under discussion for which i fear i have sadly inconvenienced you in the coming here oh nicholas of course id come what must we do kydd blinked in confusion do y mean t talk about dear sister pray lets be seated theres much we need to consider they sat in the only two armchairs by the fireplace leaving kydd to hover if youre about t discuss please be quiet thomas cecilia said crossly this is important you know it was indeed the principal difficulty lay in the decorous bringing together of the couple in such a manner that would place kydd to best advantage with respect to other admirers more talented in the social graces than he so to speak not to mention the additional difficulties a protective mother might be expected to present there was much discussion of miss lockwoods probable tastes and proclivities and the delicacies of conduct that would ensue before a course of action could be decided eventually one such presented itself do you pay particular attention to what i say thomas you will be invited to tea by jane and her husband and quite by chance persephone lockwood will be present as well when you see her you will be suitably taken aback and why miss lockwood how surprising to find you here kydd said graciously fighting down his glee a warning flash came from cecilia and he turned to her companion and added quickly and its always my particular pleasure to meet miss robbins how do you do the parlour was not large and when the ladies had been seated it proved a most companionable gathering ive heard that the moor in july is quite a delightful sight jane opened with a winning smile at persephone i would imagine so mrs mullins yet i would not wish to be without a hat and parasol out in all that open persephone said politely with a glance at kydd perhaps we should venture out upon it at some time mr mullins said stiffly clearly awed by persephones presence oh no his wife said in alarm think of all the wild horses and escaped convictsit would be far too hazardous my dear for a lady of breeding cecilia turned to kydd thomas would you now please pour the tea its my own mixture of pekoe and gunpowder mrs mullins said proudly mr mullins always brings back a pound or two from twinings in the strand when he goes up to london kydd went to the elaborate brass and silver tea urn and did his duty with the spigot mrs mullins hardwon lessons on precedence were coming to the fore persephone was clearly of the higher quality but jane was a married lady persephone accepted her cup with properly downcast eyes and kydd resumed his strategically chosen seat opposite and let the prattle ebb and flow while he covertly took his fill of her a lull in the conversation had cecilia throwing a warning look at kydd who cleared his throat capital weather were having dont you think he said brightly persephone lowered her cup if we see this noreasterly veering more to the west mr kydd i rather fancy we will soon be reaching for our umbrellas do not you mariners so rightly declare when the wind shifts gainst the sun trust it not for back twill run she asked sweetly kydd took refuge in his tea mrs mullins and cecilia exchanged a quick look pay no mind to we ladies mr kydd we do like our gossip jane said in a determined voice er why dont you show miss lockwood the new bougainvillaea in our greenhouse you having been in the caribbean yourself of course in the expectant hush kydd stood heart bumping but was so long in choosing his words that persephone rose and offered id be very interested should you be able to tell me more of such tropical blooms mr kydd they entered the small garden together and kydd steered his way through the vegetables and ancient fruit trees into the greenhouse and said in as light a voice as he could manage this is your bougainvillaea miss lockwood an i well remember seeing it in jamaica and barbados as well and but something was distracting her and she was facing away not hearing his words kydd made a play of looking closer at the plant then offered his arm to escort her back had he done something to offend then she turned towards him and asked did mrs mullins marry in the caribbean er yes miss lockwood and my sister was at the wedding he cast about for something else to say but no words came and she went on ahead they wandered a few more steps kydd following helplessly before she stopped and said quite casually your perceptions of society might lead you to suppose that i should marry as bade but i can assure you mr kydd i shall only wed one i care for and i cherish an odd notion dont you think was she saying ii admire you for it miss lockwood kydd replied hoarsely as she lifted her eyes to his her expression softening unbearably he took a deep breath and said in a voice that came out harsher than he had intended if you married aa man who followed the sea by profession would yewould you expect him t leave it th sea i mean she waited until his eyes held hers no mr kydd i would not the silence thundered in his ears until she turned and walked slowly to a little grotto of seashells set in the shady side of the wall she looked back at him once and stooped to pick up a shell which she admired in her cupped hands i believe i will take this to remind me of you mr kydd renzi scrambled to his feet when kydd returned eyes shining an unmistakable air of excitement about him nicholas yed never smoke it she was there anwe walked together an talked and id lay out a sack o guineas t say before ye that sheshe has a takin for me he was touched that his friend was so evidently sharing the same soaring elevation of spirit felicitations then brother but i trust you will hope to remember your speech in her presencei am obliged to remark that at the moment it sorely betrays a lack of delicacy kydd grinned she was wearing such a fine dress nicholas was it just fr me an her hair she had renzis voice was oddsomewhat charged with emotion dear fellow do you know what i have here he held up a grubby piece of paper covered with crabbed handwriting er no nicholas pray do tell me this renzi said this dear friend is the firstthe very first evidence from the world that my humble conjectures in ethnical philosophies might indeed possess some degree of merit this brother is a communication from count rumford himself praises me for a new insight and encourages me to go further he sat down suddenly and blinked rapidly andand wishes that when in london i might consider attending with him at the royal institution in albemarle street to kydd the name reminded him more of fireplaces but there was no doubting the effect it was having on renzi why thats thumpin good news indeed m friend count rumford himself there was just sufficient cognac to steady them both then renzi was able to say to kydd i am forgetting myself brother do tell me more of your happy situation well ive been givin it a deal of thought im t call on miss lockwood i believei have t return her music y see he said smugly but not afore i ask mrs mullins if shed help me learn it i saw a pianoforte while i was there he added kydd pulled the doorbell ceremoniously and waited he was in his most elegant attire a darkgreen morning coat over buff waistcoat and cream breeches with a painstakingly tied cravat and the sheet of music tied with a ribbon sir it was the same footman but he gave no sign of recognition mr kydd to call on lady lockwood thank you sir he said with a bow and went back inside closing the door gently in kydds face his heart bumping he heard the footsteps die away it seemed an age before the footman returned lady lockwood is not at home sir he announced fixing a glassy stare over kydds shoulder kydd had seen the carriage in the mews and knew that she had not left the house thenthen miss lockwood he asked miss lockwood is not at home either sir er then please to give this to miss lockwood kydd said handing over the music realising too late that he had just lost his best excuse for calling in the future he turned on his heel and walked off thoughts churning furiously cecilia dismissed his fears this is lady lockwood being protective i do believe thomas we shall have to find another way now let me see jane is being so obliging i think we can ask her to invite miss robbins and friend once againthis time to a cards evening she has some tolerably highplaced acquaintances who are martyrs to the whist table it cost kydd a notable effort to ingest the finer points of whist the mysteries of the trick the trump suit and the potential for delicious interplay between the partners but he was determined to reach the point at which he would not disgrace persephone time dragged but eventually the appointed evening arrived and kydd found himself making inane conversation with a young army lieutenant while the guests arrived at last he heard miss robbinss silvery laugh in the doorway and forced himself not to look round ah miss robbins came janes loyal cry kydd could bear it no longer and casually manoeuvred round until he could see her she was with her frienda diminutive soul with an irrepressible giggle not persephone a little later miss robbins slipped him a note and whispered archly i rather think youll want to see this the rubber went on interminably but at its conclusion he was able to excuse himself he feverishly took out the noteit was to miss robbins thanking her for the invitation to a card evening but saying my engagements at present are such that i find i am unable to accept any invitation for some time to come cecilias frown as she scanned the words was telling but kydd chuckled its naught but someone tryin t flam me is all see this is not persephones handwritin her expression did not lift that is not the point thomas its almost certainly from her mother and it tells me that she has set her face against you for whatever reason she bit her lip it will require some thought i believe i will need to consult mr renzi is he at liberty to return to land do you know kydd thought guiltily of renzi in teazer not at his precious studies but loyally accounting for stores come aboard and other ships business as captain kydd had a perfect right in port to allow the ships routine to continue in his absence but his appearances on board were now minimal he knew however that renzi would send for him if there were difficulties hes t come for dinner tonight cec do y not think no thomas we three will discuss this together it was sobering to find renzi in so solid agreement with cecilia on the gravity of the situation her mother undoubtedly in matters of this kind her wishes will prevail of course it will be difficult indeed to formulate any plan that might mollify evoke a contrary tenderness cecilia asked troubled shall he withdraw his attentions for a space do you think allow time for lady lockwood to come to anan appreciation of his qualities in the absence of any communication between them there will be nothing at work that will tend to ameliorate her position i fear at the moment dear sister i am without inspiration kydd got up and paced angrily up and down belay that wry way o talkin she told me to m face as how she would not marry as shes bid only t one she cares for let her lay course where she will an be damned renzi steepled his fingers brother if she goes against her mothers desires in the matter of matrimony then without question she will lose her portionher dowryand your expectations for your position in society will er necessarily require revision and think this thomas can you conceive that with her breeding she will be content to live the life of aa sailors wife cecilia said softly kydd stopped and looked at her yes i do sis he paused then said forcefully an i will show you im going toto invite her here and then th world will see renzis face softened and he said gently dear fellow do you think this wise her mother will its t be a musical evening an therell betherell be grand coves attendin who itll be unfortunate t ignore ill be askin miss lockwood if shed assist me with the musical entertainments fr these important guests even her mother cn see shell have to come grand coves asked renzi and a lavish therefore expensive evening there was no dissuading him however and kydd would only hear those whose contributions were in some wise positive towards midnight the main elements had been hammered out and on the next day cecilia began the delicate task of sounding out possible luminaries it was not to be a naval occasionat his rank kydd could not command the presence of flagofficersbut at the same time there were those in the wider community who would be flattered to attend a fifth anniversary dinner of nelsons battle of the nile hosted by one who had been present well before noon cecilia was back with the satisfying information that should he be favoured with an invitation the worshipful lord mayor of plymouth himself was in a position graciously to accept as were the colonel and the adjutant of the mighty citadel that guarded the entrance to old plymouth it was time to set in train the events of the evening but not before the most important detail of all cecilia had demanded the right of wording the invitations which she insisted must be properly printed on stiff card albeit at a ruinous price they were sent out promptly and kydd tried to contain his impatience this would be a most splendid occasion and one that even the most suave and accomplished of the ton would not be in a position to mount he swelled with happiness as host it was the pinnacle of his achieving in society and to think that she would be here to witness it the military acceptances were prompt and officerlike the lord mayors not far behind but one seemed to have been delayed kydd reasoned that persephone regularly attended such functions as his and must have many in hand to balance he waited as patiently as he could as the day neared with no word from her he began to fret and to take to his ship as a familiar refuge it was not until the day before the event that the mateofthewatch handed him a sealed message the handwriting he recognised instantly for some unaccountable reason he was reluctant to open it on board his ship he slipped the precious missive into his pocket and ordered a boat in the privacy of his drawing room he dismissed the flustered becky sat in his armchair and opened it as if by dictation the words repeated what he had seen once before but now undeniably in persephones own strong handthat she was not able to attend and further that she was unable to accept any invitation for some time to come he folded the paper mechanically and placed it in the centre of the mantelpiece there was no evident compulsion no form of words that left any room for hopeand no trace whatsoever of the feelings he had seen in her the last time they had met there was something at the bottom of it all he was surebut what had she changed her mind reconsidered what it would mean to live in greatly reduced circumstances had an unknown suitor cunningly turned her against him with evil words was there something in the byzantine society code that he had infringed and thereby earned her contempt he would hear it from her own lipsby confronting her when next she rode on the moor shameless bribery of the stablehands would ensure the time and place kydd heard her arrive skulking at the end of the line of horseboxes he listened to her cool voice greet the groom and dismiss her carriage her firm steps on the cobblestones approached and kydd stepped out she was on her own dressed in her usual immaculate fashion and looked at him in shock recovering quickly she said politely mr kydd what a surprise youi hadnt thought to see you here why miss lockwood i did so enjoy our ride together before do you mind if i join you ii do not believe you should sir kydd felt the warmth of a flush rising to his face and said huskily then i should ride alone as you will sir it can be no concern of mine she took the reins and prepared to mount ppersephone kydd blurted wwhy she paused then looked away suddenly then turning to the groom she ordered garvey i shall walk on ahead for a space do you follow on discreetly if you please without waiting for kydd she began to walk rapidly out towards the moor kydd hurried until they were side by side not daring to speak you will have received my regrets for your interesting evening she did not look at him i understand miss lockwood it won him a glance they walked on in silence the pace not slowing i do hope it goes well for you mr kydd she said eventually in a neutral manner iwe shall fin someone else t entertain us im sure he said stiffly his hands in his pockets so she would not see that the fists were clenched she said nothing but after a few moments slowed mr kydd she said turning to him i dont think i ever mentioned my friend to you confused kydd muttered something and let her continue shes quite like me in a way she said lightly stooping to pick a furze flower the same age as it were oh he managed but at the moment she has a problem she said in a light tone which she seems to have resolved i believe kydd said nothing guessing where this was leading and dreading the outcome you see she met an amiable enough gentleman who might have been considered as a possibleconsort however her condition of life is such that her family felt he did not answer their expectations his connections being decidedly beneath her own she flicked at an errant stalk of furze with her ivory whip and went on she foolishly allowed her feelings to lead her to behave in an unseemly manner and was taken to task by her mother who forbade her to continue the association then youshe she loves her mama and would not go against her mr kydd that you must believe she said looking at him seriously his gut tightened can y say to meis there another man payin his addresses tot your friend she replied instantly there is none of any consequence who may stand against him kydd swallowed then youll let me say miss lockwood that i think your friend isis a shab indeed if she had said t him afore that shed not be wed t any except she cares for him she stopped her face white and rounded on him mr kydd you cannot know what you are saying do not speak so an if she puts the comforts o life before her hearts be silent sir i will not have it said persephone i she took a deep breath and held it for a long moment then continued sadly mr kydd sheshe loves her mother and would not grieve her but this is not the issue she turned away from his gaze and went on softly mama is right but not in the way she intends shall we suppose they marry even that her parents are reconciled can you conceive what it must cost as she divides her social acquaintances between her ownwhen she will be constantly in need of explanation for the lack of his own connections at the highest leveland his where daily he must find excuse for her airs her manner she could not bear to see him put upon so oh nicholas its you ii expected thomas er is he out cecilia however unlaced her bonnet and gave every indication of wanting to stay though that was contrary to the rules of polite society which frowned on unmarried young ladies attending on gentlemen unaccompanied good evening miss kydd renzi said quietly rising but remaining by his chair i see then you have my sincere regrets sir should any now think you to be so far in want of conduct as to entertain the female sex alone but it brought no returning smile and cecilia paused concerned may i sit mr renzi she asked formally if it is your brother you are intending to visit then i have to tell you that he has not set foot ashore for the last three days and the vessel due to sail on monday he is in a state of despondency poor thomas cecilia sighed twisting a ribbon it did seem so possible did it not renzi resumed his chair and blinked i rather think now it was not a deed of kindness to encourage him to believe there could be any favourable conclusion to the affair his lack of connections damns him in her mothers eyesan ambitious creature i believe persephone lockwood is much attached to him cecilia said thoughtfully they would make a fine pair togetherif only she stood up and paced about the room she will not go against her mothers wishes that much is sure therefore this is the problem we must address i can only agree in the heartiest manner with your observations on such a match but it is not to be do you not consider that perhaps with some reluctance you should cease from matchmaking in his case why mr renzi i do believe you have no romantic inclinations whatsoever renzi held still his eyes opaque i shall certainly do what is needful to assist thomas to a blissful destinyif i can think of any such cecilia said with spirit and picked up her bonnet settling it thoughtfully then she stopped there is but this will require that the gods of chance do favour us in the timing and that when asked a certain person will grant us a particular kindness she frowned prettily and left a footman entered noiselessly with a note on a silver tray the admiral at breakfast was often irascible and the man spoke diffidently for your immediate attention sir what oh give it here then damnit lady lockwood sighed and continued her criticism of her daughters needlework but at her husbands snort of interest she looked up what is it dear well now and youll clear your engagements for tonight m love it seems the marquess of bloomsbury is giving me the favour of an at home didnt know he was in plymouth you remember i managed an introduction for you at court a year or so back oh lady lockwood said in sudden understanding the marquess of bloomsburythis is interesting reginald isnt he high in the diplomatic line as i recall yes indeed discreet sort of cove gets all about the world but likes to do his work in the strictest confidence now i happen to know he has the ear of billy pitt himselfand i dont have to tell you my love that if im to get a sea command hes the kind of man i need to keep well in with yes you must reginald wasnt he married to the earl of arundels eldest charlotte i must look it up well satisfied she turned to her daughter now persephone the marquess is very important you will come and be introduced and remember my dear the men will be making high talk and we should never speak unless addressed directly yes mama your tamboured cream muslin will do and do try to bring those curls more into controlyoull be under eye tonight the lockwood carriage rumbled grittily to a stop the footmen hastening to hand down the party not grand at allbut so in keeping with the man chuckled the fulldress admiral as he took his wifes arm consults his privacy always i know hes only passing throughi wonder whos his host may need to make his acquaintance after hes gone they were greeted at the door by a distinguished butler you are expected sir he was told and they were taken up the stairs to a small but discreet drawing room outside lady lockwood did a lastminute primping of her ostrich plumes and surveyed persephone once more before they entered remember child a warm smile and special attentions to the host and hostess were ready now reginald admiral sir reginald lockwood lady lockwood and miss lockwood the butler announced wearing her most gracious smile lady lockwood advanced to be introduced sir may i have th honour t introduce sir reginald an lady lockwood and their daughter persephone their host intoned sir he said turning to the gaping admiral and wife please meet th most honourable the marquess of bloomsbury and his wife th marchioness the marquess bestowed a smile and perhaps i should introduce you all to my friend he indicated the genial man standing to one side who is the baron grenville foreign secretary of great britainif that will be allowable william why thank ee frederick i think it unlikely that addingtons shambles of an administration will survive the winter and when pitt takes power again well i stand ready to take up the burden once more hey lady lockwood rose from her deep curtsy struck dumb with the effort of trying to come to terms with what she was seeing while the charming young hostess took the arm of the marchioness and drew her aside lady charlotte i can never thank you enough you and she stammered nonsense cecilia dear so good to see you again and of course were delighted to offer cupid a helping hand that grenville happened along was the merest chance of course she gave a fond smile and continued but then with frederick having succeeded his father it seems they have plans in mind for him in the new year and that will mean i do hope you will not refuse another engagement with us my dear cecilia blushed to be so honoured by one whom as ladys companion she had always known as lady stanhope it will be my pleasure and duty finally lady lockwood came to herself and hissed at the host mr kydd why on earthwhat are you doing here lady lockwood this is my house and i believe i may entertain whom i will it was worth every minute of his recent torments to see her resulting expression a fine part of the country the admiral said respectfully to the foreign secretary no doubt admiralbut later im with child to find out from mr kydd himself if its true that he once told frederick in a boat to pull on a rope or be keelhauled come sir tell me the story he accepted a glass of constantia and took kydd to one side to hear of stirring events long ago in the caribbean a bemused admiral turned then to the marquess sir may we know if this is your first visit to the west country but the marquess had turned to greet an exquisitely turnedout gentleman who had just descended hesitantly from the stairs why its mr renzi well met sir ive heard that your thoughts on the ethnicals of the cannibal islands have met with some success youve heard well yes sir i have been fortunate enough to secure the approbation of count rumford of the royal institution who seems to consider my small musings of some value the marquess turned confidingly to lady lockwood mr renzi a very learned soul mark well what he has to say madam for his wisdom in matters academical is only matched by his experiences in the wider reaches of the planet lady lockwood could only curtsy mutely tell me renzi where are you at present mr kydd has had the infinite goodness to afford me lodging at his own residence sir fine fellow an ornament to his service the marquess agreed then called across to the foreign secretary i say grenville this is renzi do you remember him hatchards in piccadilly and the occasion need not trouble this gathering why yes indeed good day to you renzi have i by chance yet won you to a proper appreciation of the grecian ode perhaps sir renzi chuckled and the three laughed at remembrances of former times and past perils while kydd had eyes only for the soft and very special look thrown to him by miss persephone lockwood chapter in barn pool not half a mile south from the pleasant walk round devils point at precisely ten in the forenoon hms teazer went to stations for unmooring on her pristine quarterdeck commander kydd took position legs braced astride trying not to notice the promenaders gathered to watch a kings ship outward bound to war everything about the morning was perfection the deep colours of sky and sea the verdancy of the countryside in the languid sunshine the easy southwesterly breeze the fine seamanlike appearance of the ship he commanded and the incredible knowledge which he hugged to himself about persephone take her out ltenant he ordered you have th ship even with the small craft lazily at their moorings in barn pool and ships passing to and from the hamoaze it would not be an onerous task to win the open sea aye aye sir standish said smartly and stepped forward lay out n loose topmen manned the rigging and climbed out along the yards sail blossomed and caught teazer swayed prettily as she got under way leaving devils point to larboard but kydd knew he could not snatch a look for she was watching possibly even now his image was being scrutinised through a powerful naval telescope rounding drakes island teazer heeled to the sea breeze and made splendid sailing south to the wider sea this time there would be no sordid grubbing about after smugglersthat could wait for now today it was a more serious matter kydd was to go after the privateer bloody jacques who had appeared off the coast again and slaughtered more innocent men in his predations teazer was under orders to look into every bay and tiny cove even the lee of islands from rame head westwardseverywhere that the privateer with his uncanny local knowledge might conceivably hide himself kydd vowed that when they came upon the rogue he would make sure his career was ended then and there but it would be without their gunners mate stirk had not yet returned from his mission to polperro just before they sailed luke calloway had straggled back with a painfully written note dere mr kydd agreable to yr order i hav enquyered of the wun you seek and fownd him owt and now i sayle to fynd the hevidance i may be gon won or weaks yr obed tobias stirk did this mean he had uncovered something kydd felt misgivings at the thought of the open and straightsteering shipmate from his days on the focsle trying to act the spy in the company of a villainous and ruthless gang but if any had the brute courage and strength of mind to see it through it was stirk course sir standish asked oher to weather the rame he replied coastwise navigation did not require elaborate compass courses and it would exercise standish to judge just when to put about to fetch the headland in one board orders passed standish returned to stand by kydd um might it be accounted true sir what they are sayingplease forgive the impertinence if it were notthat er you have made conquest of the admirals daughter kydd looked at him sharply but saw only open admiration miss lockwood has been handsome enough t visit he said regretting his pompous tone but finding it hard to conceal his feeling otherwise in company with her parents o course and if my sources are correctand theyre all talking about italso the highest in the land now it was to be hero worship that is t say i knew the marquess before as lord stanhope but his particular friend the foreign secretary lord grenville this was only making it worse kydd glanced aloft is that an irish pennant i see at the foretopsail yard mr standish he growled and while it was being attended to he made his escape below nicholas he sighed as he sat to stare moodily through the stern windows at the dissipating wake it seems th whole world knows what will i do renzi put down his papers with a halfsmile it is what i shall do that preoccupies my thoughts dear fellow in a short space you will be joined to a family of consequence be in receipt of a fair dowry that will in the nature of things have your lady casting about for an estate of worth kydd beamed the thought of himself as one half of two was new and wonderful i rather fear renzi continued my arcadia in urbes at number eighteen will be a lonely one even supposing i am able to find the means to nicholas kydd interrupted warmly y will always find a place with us never fear i thank you brother but i am obliged to observe that when the head of the house proposes it is always the lady who disposes they sat in companionable stillness until renzi asked may i be informed of the progress of your attachment have you made her a proposition kydd eased into a deep smile there will be time enough fr that after we return nicholasan ill be glad of yr advice in the detail if y please it will be my pleasure you will follow the polite conventions of coursefirst to seek a private interview with your intended to secure her acceptance followed by a formal approach to her father requesting approval of the match there will be some negotiations at which various matters relating to your postnuptial circumstances will be suddenly kydd felt restless with all this talk he could contain himself no longer and got to his feet belay all that m friend i have a cruise t command wheres that poxy boatswain that night under easy sail from the southwest kydd crawled into his cot and composed himself for sleep he tried to shut out the crowding thoughts but they kept coming in different guises different urgencies it was now clear he would wed soonpersephone had made plain that her father had always approved of him and lady lockwood would come round to it given time therefore in the next few months his life would change to that of a married man with a defined and highly visible place in polite society cecilia would be so proud of him and when he visited his parents in guildford it would be in a carriage with footmen and a bride of such character and qualityit was such a dizzying prospect that his mind could hardly grasp it but what about persephone would he match up to her expectations be a proper husband with all the trappings of dignity and wisdom refined tastes ease of manner in high society damn it was he good enough for her it had happened so quickly was he ready to exchange selfreliance and the freedom to choose a course of action that had been his way of life until now for the settled certainties of an ordered prescribed daily round would living graciously and the delicacies of polite discourse begin to pall and he to harbour a secret longing for the plainspeaking and direct pleasures of his old way of life would persephone understand or would she be wounded by the betrayal he slept restlessly their task was clear and unequivocal find and destroy the privateer it would involve a slow cruise westwards searching thoroughly as they went while bazely in fenella sailed in the other direction east from plymouth staying close in with the land would be tricky work each night they would remain resolutely in the offing and resume in the morning there would be no crossing of bays headland to headland only a long tracking round keeping as close inshore as prudence would allow with rame head left astern there was now the sweeping curve of whitsand bay under their lee and with all plain sail they set to work they passed the occasional huddles of dwellings whose names kydd now knew well trewinnow tregantle portwrinkle all would have their sturdy fisherfolk their reckless smugglers and local characters who one day would be worthy of renzis ethnical study towards the afternoon they had raised looe kydd toyed with the idea of going alongside in the harbour overnight so that renzi could see the medieval sights there but decided to keep to sea for freedom of manoeuvre besides which the admiralty frowned on captains incurring unnecessary harbour dues checking on looe island just offshore he shaped course to continue along the coast the hore stone asops bed talland baya wearisome progress with the ship cleared and half the company at the guns at all times polperro udder rock round the questing pencarrow head and to anchor in lantic bay it was going to be a long haul in the early morning they weighed and proceeded once more kydd sent standish in to fowey for news but there was none st austell bay saw them in a slow tacking south to the dodman mevagissey gwineas rocksall had such meaning now mile after mile of rugged coastline lonely coves rockbound islets inshore coasters luggers and yawls wended their way between tiny ports each vessel a potential enemy until proved innocent occasional flecks of sail out to sea could be any kind of craft from a deepsea merchantman inwardbound to a manowar on her way to a rendezvous off the enemy coast at falmouth kydd went ashore to see if there was word but again it seemed that bloody jacques had an uncanny knowledge of suitable boltholes and had simply vanished between pillagings wearily he put back to sea down in long tacks towards the famous lizard he decided to wait out the night in its lee for if there was one place more likely than any other for a privateer to lurk it would be at the end of england where shipping bound upchannel diverged from that making for the irish sea and liverpool the next day however the summer sunshine had left them for a grey day and whiffling fluky winds backing south and a dropping barometersure signs of a change in the weather after rounding the lizard kydd was troubled to find the seas far more lively and on the back of an uneasy westerly swell he had no wish to make close search of wolf rock and the outlying isles of scilly in thickening weather penzance knew of the privateer but could contribute little to the search kydd had half expected parlby in wyvern to be there for he had been sent to the northern coast and might well have put into penzance kydd had his duty however and pressed on instead of waiting dutifully heading for wolf rock teazer taking the seas on her bow in bursts of white and an awkward motion in the gathering misery of greying skies teazer found the lonely black menace set amid seething white cautiously felt her way past and onward into the wastes of the atlantic kydd was determined to clear the isles of scilly before the blow really set in it was getting more serious by the hour the wind was foul for rounding the isles of scilly from the south which had the sloop staying about twice a watch in the difficult conditions but this was not the worst of it they could not set a straight intercepting course for the islands and because of the resulting wide zigzags against the wind they lost sight of them for most of the time with the danger of an unfortunate conjunction on the next board seamanship of the highest order was now required usually a mariners first concern was to keep well clear of the deadly rocks but kydd knew their voyage would be in vain unless they not only made a sighting of the isles of scilly but searched closely this would involve the careful reckoning of each tack such that the last leg would place them precisely and safely to westward of the scattered islands the weather was sullen but still clear however this could change in minutes it was now not navigation by the science of sextant and chronometer but the far more difficult art of deadreckoning leeway resulting from the winds blast the mass movement of the ocean under tidal impetus contrary currents from the north the master stood grave and silent his eyes passing ceaselessly over the whitetipped rollers marching in from the open atlantic rain arrived in fits and blusters settling to drenching sheets that sometimes thinned and passed on leaving the seas a hissing expanse of stippled white that curiously took the savage energy from the waves and left them subdued rounded hillocks rather than ravenous breakers then the first islets formed alarmingly close out of the hanging rainmist it was vital to make landfall with precision and there was only wind direction to orient them the master told kydd this is yr pol bank sir an bishop rock somewhere there there was no disguising the relief in his voice the western extremity of the isles of scilly the low anonymous grey rainslick ugliness was probably the worst sea hazard in this part of the world here less than a century before an admiral of the royal navy and near two thousand men had died when the association and most of a victorious returning fleet had made final encounter with these isles nornoreast t crim rocks sir the master murmured by now kydds dreamlike memories of beauty and gracious living were fast fading the present reality was this wasteland of sea perils and cold runnels of rainwater inside his whipping oilskins thankfully teazer was now able to bear away round bishop rock for her return and wallowing uncomfortably she passed close to the deadly scatter of crim rocks the sight of the dark gashes in the seething white caused kydd to shiver to weather of the isles of scilly they could now look into the few possible hidingplaces most likely were crow sound and saint marys road near the settlements if the privateer was riding things out there they were perfectly placed to pouncebut a fresh gale was threatening and the master had said that with a sandy bottom both vessels were unsafe in heavy seas and the bird might well have flown they had their duty however and despite boldering weather strengthening from the westward kydd looked into every possible anchorage wary of the baffling complexity of the offshore tidal streams which if the master was to be believed varied by the hour as they wound through tortuous channels and shallows when the fat mass of round island was reached it was time to return with winds abaft a straightforward run to lands end and the shelter of penzance but the bluster from the southwest was undeniably stronger and the swell lengthening causing a wrenching wallow as the seas angled in from the quarter by the time lands end had been reached few aboard did not relish the thought of a quiet night in harbour a cessation of the endless bruising motion penzance sir the master enquired gripping tightly a line from aloft kydd thought for a moment then answered no mr dowse ill ask you t mark the winds direction if it backs more into th south well be held to a muzzler if we sight that frenchman no we press on t the lizard and anchor fr the night in its lee his task was to return back up the coast continuing on past plymouth into the eastern half of his patrol area no doubt passing bazely as they crisscrossed up and down to the limit of their sea endurance bloody jacques had proved himself and could not be underestimated keeping the seas was their first priority thus prudently maintaining a good offing teazer spent the last few hours of the day crossing mounts bay passing the imposing monolith of st michaels mount sheeted in misty spray and shaping course for the lizard the seas were now combers ragged whitestreaked waves that smashed beamon in thunderous bursts of spray and made life miserable for the watch on deck at last lizard point won they slipped past and fell into its lee the worst of the wind moderated and they anchored under steep forbidding cliffs teazer slewed about the moment sail was off her and bow to waves eased thankfully to her cable kydd waited until the watch on deck had been relieved then went below there was no hope of any hot food and as tysoe exchanged his sodden clothes he chewed hard tack and cheese pondering what constituted sea endurance the ships state for sea or the mens willingness to endure such punishing conditions in this fresh gale a stately shipoftheline would snort and jib a little but would essentially move much more ponderously and predictably a small brigs endless jerky rearing and falling however taxed the muscles cruelly it was physically exhausting to maintain for long and he hoped the gale would blow itself out overnight the morning brought no relief the gale still hammered with ragged waves trailing foamstreaks in their wake but teazer had her duty and the anchor was weighed at first light falmouth sir the master asked kydd knew that the men at the conn were listening to every word it was tempting falmouth was but several hours away only and offered spacious shelter in carrick roads however in these seas no boat could live and for teazer to enter the harbour with its single southfacing entrance would be to risk finding themselves bailed up with foul weather clearing the seas of prey the privateer was probably waiting it out in some snug lair which if kydd came across it would find him helpless it was worth cracking on we sail on mr dowse this is a hard man were after but hes a prime seaman he wont think aught o this blow at his bleak expression kydd added an then o course we can always run in t fowey the master said nothing but turned on his heel and went forward kydd gave orders that saw them bucketing northwards past the lethal sprawl of the manacles and into the relative shelter of falmouth bay they kept in with the coast past the greeb and discovered that in its regular northeastward trend the inshore mile or two under the rocky heights was providing a measure of relief and teazer made good progress kydds thoughts wandered to a way of life that was so utterly different from this one where the greatest danger was the social solecism the highest skill to turn a bon mot at table and never in life to know a wet shirt or hard tack he crushed the rebellious feelings there would be time enough to rationalise it all after he had settled into his new existence and had the solace of a soulmate a series of whipping squalls chasing round the compass off the dodman had teazer fighting hard to keep from being swamped by the swash kicked up over the shoaling bellows but she won through nobly to resume her more sheltered passage northward the gwineas rocks and mevagissey on the outward voyage they had seen these in calm seas and balmy sunshine now they were dark grey and sombre green edged with surf from the ceaseless march of whitestreaked waves they left par sands well to leeward there was most definitely no refuge for a privateer worth the name beyond tiny polkerristhey would round gribbin head for fowey easing out to seaward their shelter diminished gribbin head itself was near hidden in spume driven up by the combers smashing into its rocky forefoot and teazer rolled wickedly as she passed by but was this the right decision should they continue as with so many havens in cornwall fowey was southwesterly facing which was perfect for entry but dead foul for leaving it would be nothing less than a token of surrender to the elements should kydd cause teazer to run for shelter unnecessarily he sent word for the master mr dowse whats your opinion o this blashy weather will it blow over do y think dowse pursed his lips and studied the racing clouds there was a line of pearlescence along the horizon to the south in dramatic contrast to the dour greys and blacks above glasss been steady these two watches he said carefully an its been an uncommon long blow fr this time o the year we go on then kydd decided but mark you the glass hasnt risen worth a spit an the winds still in the souwest could be it gets worse afore it gets better so y think itll stay like this mr dowse m advice t ye siran it not bein my place t say sois to bide a while in fowey an see what happens tmorrow to continue would be to set out on a long stretch of coast exposed to the full force of the gale and a dead lee shore before reaching rame head but if they did they could round the headland and enter the security of the enfolding reaches of plymouth sound itself and with its capaciousness be able to tack out and resume their voyage whenever they chose yet if they set out for the rame and the elements closed in there was no port of consequence before the sound to which they could resort and there would be no turning back to beat against the gale to fowey it all hinged on the weather thank you mr dowse but i believe well crack on t the eastd ill be obliged for another reef if yplease kydd turned to go below this stretch would be the most extreme and he wanted to face it in a fresh set of dry clothes as he passed down the hatchway he heard the quartermaster above comment wryly always was a foulweather jack our tom cutlass his unseen mate answered savagely yeah but it sticks in me gullet that we has t go afloggin up the coast in this howler jus so he cn be with his flash dolly kydd stopped in shock it wasnt the resurrection of his old nickname or that his romantic hopes were common knowledge but the wounding assumption that he would have another motive for doing his duty he hesitated then slipped below by pencarrow head the force of the seas was noticeably stronger but kydd put it down to their more exposed position and pressed on it was unlikely in the extreme that the privateer would choose this open stretch of coast to lie low but he had his duty and with lifelines rigged along the decks and several anchors bent on they took the seas resolutely on their quarter and struck out for rame head it seemed that the weather was not about to improveindeed within the hour the master was reporting that the glass was falling once more and the wind took on a savage spite spindrift being torn from wavecrests and teazer reverting to a staggering lurch it was getting serious the rapidity with which the change had occurred was ominous for the immediate future and extreme measures for their survival could not be ruled out stand us off a league kydd shouted to dowse above the dismal moan of the wind and the crashing of their passage it was the one advantage they had that essentially they were driving before the wind with all that it meant for staying a course they laid looe island to leeward nearly invisible in the flying murk and began the last perilous transit of whitsand bay which was in the worst possible orientation for the weather completely open to the rampaging gales direct from the atlantic and virtually broadside on to the driving surf but blessedly the grey bulk of rame head was emerging from the clamping mist of spray aheadand directly beyond was plymouth sound at this rate they would make the security of the sound well before dark teazer was taking the pounding well and under closereefed topsails was making good progress they could always goosewing the fore and hand what remained of the main topsailthey were going to make it safely to port a confused shouting sounded from forward it was a lookout now on the foredeck and pointing out to leeward kydd saw a lonely sail deep into the sweep of whitsand bay he pulled out his pocket telescope and trained it on the vessel if it was the privateer he could see no way in which he could join actionthe seas alone would prevent the bulwark gun ports opening and on this horrific lee shorebut the snatches of image he caught were sufficient to tell him it was not as closehauled as possible the vessel was nearly up with the first parallel line of breakers hes taking a risk by glory standish said dowse came up and shook his head seen it before he said sadly the rame mistook fr bolt head an now embayed all the time th winds in the souwest the ship had realised its mistake too late put about into the windand found that it was too deep into the bay squarerigged and unable to keep closer to the wind than six points off the master had no alternative other than to claw along on one tack as close to the wind as he could get the vessel to lie inching her seaward and when the end of the semicircular bay was reached be forced to stay about and on another reach do the same until the opposite end was reached then the process would be repeated yet again as kydd watched the drama intensified by the cruellest stroke the southwesterly was exactly at rightangles to the bay and leeway made by the forced putting about at each end was remorselessly matching the small amount of sea room gained on each tack the vessel was trapped they were doing the only thing possible and it was not enough but if they did nothing they would quickly be driven downwind on to the pitiless shore with a stab of compassion kydd realised that this cruel state of balance had probably begun at first light when their situation had become clear and therefore they had been at this relentless toil all daythey must be close to exhaustion knowing that if they fumbled just one going about their deaths would follow very soon th poor bastards breathed dowse staring downwind at the endless parallel lines of combers marching into the last broad band of surf standish seemed equally affected sir can we not he trailed off at the futility of his words it was plain to everyone watching that teazer could do nothing for if they turned and went in they themselves would be embayed and any boats they sent would be blown broadside and overset oars no match for the savage winds kydds heart went out to the unknown sailors they must have been in fear of their lives for hours how they must have prayed for the mercy of a wind changeonly a point or two would have been enough to escape the deadly trap he turned on the master lie us to mr dowse he snapped this would see them hold teazers head atry with balanced canvas and going ahead only slowly keeping her position the poor devils in the other ship would see this and at the very least know that there were human beings in their universe who empathised with their fate the afternoon wore on the wind stayed unwavering in the same direction and the desperate clawing of the other ship continued it could not last some time during the night its crews strength must fail and the sea would claim them it was so unfair two ships separated only by distance one to sail on to safety and rest life and future but the other condemned to death in the breakers shes struck someone called kydd whipped up his glass and caught flashing glimpses of an old merchantman no longer rising with the waves or her seadarkened canvas taut to the wind now she was in the lines of breakers slewed at an angle and ominously still the foremast had gone by the board its rigging trailing blackly in the sea and as he watched the vessel settled taking the merciless seas broadside in explosions of white whitsand bay was shallow the seas therefore were breaking a long way from shore the figures that could be seen now crowding up the masts to take last refuge were as doomed as if a cannon was aimed at them pity wrung kydds heart more ships were lost to the sea than to the enemy but here it was playing out before their eyes it was hard to bear but ifmr standish im goin t have a try pass the word fr any whos willin to volunteer his lieutenant looked at him in astonishment sir how mr dowse lay us in the lee of th rame close in with th land an anchor the master did not speak for a moment his face closed and unreadable aye aye sir he said finally close to rame head was a colossal near conical monolith its weather side a seething violence of white seas but miraculously as soon as they rounded the headland the winds were cut off as with a knife here mr dowse a rocky bottom sir the master said impassively then well heave to mr purchet away boats crew o volunteers an well have the pinnace in the water directly dowse came up and said quietly i know why yere doing this mr kydd but were hazardin th ship as if to add point to his words teazer swung fretfully under wild gusts volleying over the heights they were only yards from the line of windtorn seas coming round the point im aware o that mr dowse kydd said briefly standish approached he had found a young seaman native to the area sawley says theres a scrap o sand inshore where you may land the boat kydd nodded were going t try to get a line out to the poor beggars ill need as much oneinch line as the boatswain cn find his plan was to cross the rame peninsula on foot to the other side whitsand bay and by any meansboat manhauling swimmingget a line out to the wreck the oneinch was necessarily a light line for they faced carrying it the mile or two to the beach over precipitous inclines after were landed recover the boat and moor the ship in cawsand bay well be back that way this was the next bay round with good holding and a common resort for menowar in a southwesterly aye aye sir standish said uncomfortably once more kydd blessed the recent invention of davits making it so much easier to hoist and lower boats than the yardarm stay tackles of older ships in the water the pinnace jibbed and gyrated like a wild animal the men boarding falling over each other oars getting tangled and water shipping over the gunwale gear was tossed down and when the men had settled kydd boarded by shinning down a fall they cast off and kydd called to sawley the young seaman surrendered his oar and made his way to kydd the boat rose and fell violently in the seas and at the sight of the steep sides of the rame plunging precipitately into the sea it seemed utter madness to attempt a landing wheres th sand kydd wanted to know ill go forrard sir an signal to ye at kydds nod sawley scrambled down the centreline and wedged himself into the bow he glanced aft once then made a positive pointing to starboard follow th lads motions kydd growled bucketing madly the boat approached the dark seaweedcovered granite the surge of swells an urgent swash and hiss over the wicked menace of unseen rocks the hand went out again and kydd saw where they were headed an indentation so slight that it was unlikely that the boats oars could deploy but there was a strip of sand at its centre a small kedge anchor was tossed out and the boat went in grounding hard it floated free and banged even harder go y lubbers the men tumbled over the side and crowded on to a tiny strip of bare sand kydd dropped into the shallows and followed sir how wes agoin t get up there one man croaked gesturing at the nearvertical slopes covered with thick dripping furze kydd had counted on at least sheep tracks through the impenetrable thickets sawley can we get round this he called but the lad was already disappearing into the brush kydd waited impatiently then he suddenly emerged and beckoned kydd over sawley fished about in the undergrowth and came up with the knotted end of an old rope the smugglers sirtheyd parbuckle the tubs up to th top wi thisn he said with glee you first younker show us how t do it sawley tested it with jerks then began to climb clearing the rope of vegetation as he went if it was for parbuckling there must be another near kydd found it and followed the wind with cruel cold finding his wet clothes the men came along behind it was hard going the furze prickling and gouging and his upper body having to remember longago skills of ropeclimbing eventually he reached a rounding in the hill a saddle between the continuing slopes inland and the higher conical mass of rame head dramatically set off in the stormy weather with a ruined chapel on its summit he mustered his men together far below teazer was moving away to the safety of the next bay out to sea there was nothing but a whitelashed wilderness gets better now mr kydd sawley said brightly eight men would it make a difference they would damn well try kydd set off following a faintly defined track up the slope pressing on as fast as he could the ground strangely hard and unmoving after the wildly heaving decks they reached the summit of the hill and were met with the renewal of the winds blast in their teeth and the grand unforgettable sight of whitsand bay curving away into the misty distance with parallel lines of pristine white surf the grounded merchantman was still out in the bay her foremast gone sails in hopeless tatters her men unmoving black dots in the rigging scanning the horizon kydd could see no other sail they were on their own he humped his part of the long fake of rope and moved off again their way along the long summit now clear he bent against the pummelling wind trying not to think of the stricken vessel below as they reached a fold in the hills that hid the scene were goin t wiggle sir sawley panted wha aye sir its a place above th hard sand they came from behind the hill and looked directly down on the scene numbers of people were on the beach watching the plight of the hapless merchant vessel would they helpor were the lurid tales of cornish wreckers true reaching the beach and shuddering with cold kydd tried to think it was heartwrenching to see how near yet how far the vessel was at this angle only ragged black spars were visible above the raging combers perhaps a dozen men clutching at the shrouds the wreck was bare hundreds of yards off but in at least ten feet of water enough to drown in every sailor knew that if run ashore their end would not be so mercifulthe rampaging waves would snatch them and batter them to a choking death as they rolled them shoreward their only hope a quick end by a crushed skull the onlookers stood still looking out to sea dispassionately kydd pulled one round to face him arent ye goin to do something the man looked at him theym dead men he said dully whats to do kydd swung on his men standing behind he quickly worked a bowline on a bight at the end of the line you he said pointing to the tallest and heaviest with me he lunged into the water feeling the strength in the surge of the next wave hissing over the beach he splashed on until another foamed in its impact sending him staggering recovering he thrust deeper into the waves feeling them curiously warmer out of the winds chill the rope jerked at him he turned and saw that all eight of his men were floundering behind him bracing when one was knocked off his feet then stumbling on a lump grew in his throat with these men he could a foaming giant of a wave took him full in the chest and sent him down in a choking flurry handling him roughly until he brought up on the rope and finally found the hard sand under him when he heaved himself up he saw that only two of his men were still standing the rest a kicking tangle of legs and bodies flailing forward kydd tried again feeling the spiteful urge of the sea as it pressed past him at the next wave he gritted his teeth and forced himself to stand firm while the force of the water bullied past him unmercifully as it receded he saw another beyond even bigger the breaker tumbled him down and when he rose his forearm bore a long smear of blood trembling with cold and emotion he had to accept that he and his men were utterly helpless he turned and staggered back to the shore teeth chattering along the beach some fishermen had launched a boat but as kydd watched it reared violently over the first line of surf the oars catching by some heroic means by the third line though it had been smashed broadside and rolled over and over in a splintered wreck a strange writhing in the surf caught his eye an unravelled bolt of some workaday cloth the ship was breaking up and the cargo was coming ashore with other flotsam the silent groups of watchers came to life and began wading about after itthis was what they had come for thought kydd with a surge of loathing his heart went out to the black figures in the shrouds of the doomed ship giving their very lives for this cargoand as he watched one plummeted into the sea without resisting the last pitiful remnant of his strength spent in exhaustion and cold kydd closed his eyes in grief a fellow sailor had now given everything to the sea perhaps an individual whose laughter at the messtable had lifted the hearts of his shipmates whose skills had carried the ship across endless sea miles a jumble of casks appeared at the waters edge and were immediately fallen upon but evening was approaching and the light failing another figure dropped kydd turned away when he looked again the mainmast had given way and now many more lives were reaching their final moments his eyes stung there were only three left in the mizzen shrouds when the first corpses arrived untidy bundles drifting aimlessly in the shallows the ragged remains of humanity that had been so recently warm and alive as soon as the first body had grounded an onlooker was upon it standing astride and bending to riffle through its clothes checking the fingers for rings it was too muchkydd fell on the looter shouting hoarsely until his men ran over and pulled him off when he had come to his senses the mizzen was empty thank ee you men he said gulping i dont think we cn do any more here not a word was spoken as they trudged up the windblown slopes not a glance back after wiggle the hill descended the other side into the fisher village of cawsand and out in the bay was hms teazer the lump in his throat returned as kydd took in her sturdy lines her trim neatness they made their way to the little quay and signalled even this far round the rame the swell was considerable there were still combers leaving white trails in their wake but here the sting had been taken from the storm and the boat stroked strongly towards them renzi was there to greet him as kydd climbed aboard when he saw kydds expression he offered a wet of brandy may answer but kydd brushed him aside mr standish i want a double tot fr these hands now he stopped at another thought but there was no need in rough camaraderie their shipmates would certainly ensure that each one would be found a dry rig but one thing at least was in his power an theyre t stand down sea watches until tomorrow forenoon an allnightin was a precious thing at sea but if any deserved it he climbed wearily into his cot and slumped back closing his eyes and hoping for sleep it was not as if the evenings drama was unusualit was said that the wild west country had taken more than a thousand wrecks and would claim many more why should this one touch him so it was not hard to fathom head in the clouds with his recent good fortune and new prospects for high society he had lost touch with the sterner realities of his sea world the fates had warned him of what might befall his command should he fail to give the sea the attention it demanded a fitful sleep took him troubling images flitting past could he be joined to persephone in marriage and stay faithful to a puissant jealous sea would she understand if he awoke and sat bolt upright his senses quivering in the darkness he felt the hairs on his neck rise in supernatural dread something was very wrong he tumbled out of the cot and stood motionless listening acutely then it happened the entire framework of his world was thrown into madness teazers deep regular sway and heave had stopped for seconds at a time the deck was frozen at a canted angle his body unconsciously adapting to the slope the deckhead compass gimbals quite still then with an overloud creaking the sea motion resumed as though nothing had happened dumbfounded kydd threw a coat over his nightgown and ran for the deck it was teeming with rain solid blinding sheets in the darkness of the night he heard shouts and running feet it happened again this time preceded by a sickening thump and longdrawnout groan of racked timbers in horror kydd stared into the night trying desperately to make out the vessel that had driven foul of theirs but saw and heard nothing men came boiling up from below eyes white and staring as they tried to make sense of what was happening dowse came on deck also in night attire and hurried over sir were in dire peril this is a ground sea sir when the height of a wave exceeded twice the depth of water a vessel in its trough could actually touch the seabed in the gale such a swell had developed and now with an ebbing tide they were being dumped bodily against the bottom of the sea no ship could take such punishment for long before it was racked to pieces turn up th hands roared kydd all hands on deck he looked at dowse t sail her out or warp but he knew before the words were out that warping or kedging off without boats that could live in white water was not possible they had to get sail on and very quickly the men began to assemble at their partsofship the petty officers loudly taking charge standish and then purchet came to kydd their faces white and strained sir get the carpenter t stand by the wells an sound em every ten minutes hes t send word instantly theres sign of a breach he snatched a glance into the dark rigging teazer had already snugged down for the blow rolling tackles reeved and double gaskets passed round the courses this meant that seamen had to move up into the pitchdark rigging and out along the yards in the driving rain to cut away the gaskets by feel alone a desperately dangerous thing where a misplaced handhold on an invisible rainslick spar would mean a sudden fall and all the time their whole world would be jerking and swaying in crazy motion across the sky it was kydds duty to order the men aloft there was no alternative too many lives depended on it he did not hesitate mr standish the carpenter t take his axe an stand by the cable id be obliged should you take charge in th foretop while ill take th main mr dowse will remain on deck an give orders fr a cast t larbd and out he demanded of a dumbfounded seaman his belt and knife then filled his lungs and roared all handslay out an loose lunging at the main shrouds he swung himself up and began to climb into the blackness and rain shaking in the ropes told him he had been followed now mainly by feel he found first the catharpings then the futtock shrouds calling on skills that had lain dormant for years he swung himself up and into the maintop then stopped for breath not far behind him others came crowding up with him into the top it was madnesshe had no call to risk his life up here with the topmenbut it was one way to deal with his feelings topsails he bawled and reached for the weather topmast shrouds but stopped to peer at the figure first taking the leeward it was too familiar it couldnt bebut it was nicholas youwhy are ye should we not mount the vaunting shrouds renzi yelled his face streaming with rain the barky will not wait i fear overcome kydd ducked round and began the climb to the remote topmast tops far above the unseen deck below he fumbled for the footrope that must lie below the yard and inched his way out on the thin rope elbows over the sodden bulk of bunched canvas atop the yard more men came and jostled next to him the footrope jerking over empty space as he worked free his knife the gaskets on the main topsail were plaited and he sawed at them awkwardly while the angle of the wind gradually changed below they must be bracing the yard round as they worked those on deck would be seeing only jerking shadows and would have to judge as best they could the right moment to set the sails a harsh judder nearly toppled them from the yardarm if they could not get away they would be beaten to pieces very shortly and themselves be taken by the sea off th yard he screamed for he had noticed the halliards shake if the newfreed sails took the wind it would be sudden and uncontrollable they scrambled for the shrouds and kydd made his way thankfully to the deck as teazer leant to the blast then miraculously got under way for the outer sound mr kydd sir the carpenter anxiously touched his forehead an i have t say were makin water badmoren two foot in th well it was too much after all they had endured and done that day thank ye he said mechanically and tried to reason against the cold and tiredness without doubt it would be due to seams opening under the crushing punishment of the mass weight of the ship bearing down on the curve of the hullor worse whole strakes giving way and the sea rushing unchecked into teazers bowels to founder out in the sound in the anonymous nightit couldnt happen but with no idea where the leaks were and no way to find out in the pitch dark of a flooding hold mr purchet he croaked well fother this would involve passing sails under the hull in the hope that it would staunch the inflow the whole length o the ship he turned to dowse were not t make harbour i believe is there any cove any landingplaceanywhere in th sound as we cn find the masters face was pinched er no sir entirely rockbound t the cattewater he hesitated then said but there is if we stays this side a mite taking in water all the time teazer staggered along before the gale at a little after four in the morning she rounded to and flung a rope ashore to waiting soldiers then slewed about close to the little quay of humble fort picklecombe as if tiring of the fight she gently took the ground and creaking mightily settled into a final stillness chapter renzi held up his plymouth dock telegraph with an enigmatic smile dear fellow theres an item here thats of some interest bearing as it does on kydd began to read what looked suspiciously like a gossip column our doughty spy lookout once again mounts to the crows nest in his tireless quest for items of value to pique our readers interest he raises his powerful glass and begins his search and it is not long before he spies a particularly gratifying sight it is none other than that of our beautiful and accomplished miss persephone l the cynosure of every gentlemanly eye the acknowledged catch of the season and the adornment of every gathering of the quality who is seen to be promenading yet again with the same fortunate gentleman lookout strains to make out his appearance but is unable to distinguish at such a distance beyond noting that he is in the character of a naval person and has an unmistakable air of command about him can this be indeed the notorious captain kidd boarded and taken a prize knowing his duty lookout instantly sends a messenger posthaste to the telegraph offices advising that space be immediately held over for it seems the society columns will soon be echoing to the sound of wedding bells he does however beg the dear reader to consider now the plight of the legion of the disappointed he threw down the newspaper what catblash is this he growled secretly delighted that he and persephone were now so publicly linked they even have m name wrong the swabs after teazer had been towed to the dockyard for repairs he had called on persephone and found that she and lady lockwood had gone to bath to take the waters the admiral had advised him gruffly that it would not serve his case to go in pursuit and that in the meantime kydd must bide his time patiently the difficulty now was to find some occupation that did not bear too heavily on the purse in the coming weeks on persephones return there would no doubt be a considerable strain on his means as if sensing his dilemma renzi got up and stretched if you are of a mind dear fellow there is some small diversion in prospect that might serve us both he went to the table and picked up a letter i have had the singular good fortune to meet a personable young man named jonathan couch who seems to be somewhat enamoured of our piscatorial cousins hes shown a gratifying degree of interest in my study and advises that to the enquiring mind there is no need to travel to the cannibal isles to observe man in nature this may all be got in a wild and picturesque setting not so very far from here in short he suggests that i base myself there and make my observations at leisure in the countryside round about he promised to speak to a local squire he knows in the matter of our lodgings and by this letter i find a most generous and open invitation for us both to stay at polwithick manor it seemed an agreeable enough plankydd could relax in the quiet and leisurely country surroundings and from time to time assist in whatever ethnical studies renzi had in mind er where is this wild place oh did i not mention it it is polperro polperro kydd gave a wry smile at the thought of staying in a smugglers den polwithick was set halfway between crumplehorn and landaviddy with a fine view far down into the steep valley and compact huddle that was polperro elizabethan do you think renzi mused as they dismounted from their horses their baggage would follow by packhorse over the rutted tracks that went for roads in this cornish interior the charming manor did seem of an age a stout jumble of ancient mullioned windows and grey moorstone from the time of the first george set among ancient yews and hawthorns blossoms from the neat kitchen garden softening its bluff squareness come in come in come inyere both most welcome gentlemen squire morthwen was jolly and redfaced nicholas renzi sir and this is my friend and colleague mr kydd a pleasure t have ye here it was er something in the philosophical line ye wish to study in these parts was it not sir indeed and im sure youll prove of sovereign worth in directing me to wherebut this can wait until later sir were under no rush of time they were ushered into a small drawing room where the whole family was drawn up in a line this is m brood gentlemen whore very curious t see what kind o visitors come all the way t polwithick now this is edmund the eldest a tall young man with a studied look of boredom bowed stiffly m daughter rosalynd a delicate pale maiden with downcast eyes curtsied but when she rose it was with a startlingly frank gaze and titus th youngest a tousled youth grinned at them i know town folk take y vittles late but in the country we like t have ours while theres still light t appreciate em shall we the meal in the darktimbered dining parlour was unlike any kydd had experienced before it wasnt just the massive oaken furniture or the rabbit in cider or even the still country wines but the warmth and jollity in place of the cool manners and polite converse he had grown used to the squire it seemed was a widower but the table was kept with decorum the visitors were spared close interrogation and afterwards the gentlemen repaired to a study for port and conversation well mr renzi y mentioned in your letter about ethnical studies in th west country i dont think i can help thee personally with that but youll find some rare fine curiosities hereabouts renzi was able in some measure to indicate his requirements but was interrupted by a wideeyed face peeking round the door oh papa do let us stay titus pleaded the squire frowned church mice he roared not a squeak mind with three solemn faces hanging on every word renzi continued it transpired that they were well placed to make comparative study between the way of life of the fisherfolk and that of the country yeomen and indeed if renzi were not of a squeamish tendency the tin miners along the coast would afford much to reflect upon renzi beamed my thanks indeed sir this will provide me with precisely the kind of factual grist i shall needdo you not think so brother kydd er yes o course mr renzi an ethnical harvest o some size id believe plans were put in train at once there were horses in the stables for their convenience and the squire allowed he was modestly proud of an orangery which being southfacing was eminently suited to a learned gentlemans retiring with his books friendly goodnights were exchanged and kydd and renzi took possession of their bedrooms in each a pretty fourposter waited ready warmed with a pan it was going to be a fine respite from their recent trials after a hearty breakfast renzi drew kydd aside there is a matter that is causing me increasing unease in fact it concerns yourself my good friend it i lay awake last night and could find no other alternative even as i fear you may feel slightedand indeed cheated puzzled kydd said nothing as renzi continued you came with me to this place to contribute to the sum of human knowledge in an ethnical examination it is the first such i have undertaken else i should have realised this before but in actually contemplating my approach to the persons under study it seems that while i might over time be considered a harmless savant the two of us together could well be accounted a threat of sorts looking decidedly uncomfortable renzi went on therefore if i am to observe their natural behaviour it rather seems that it were better you remain behind kydd snorted m dear fellow if you feel able t manage this all by yrself then i must find m own amusements renzis face fell but then kydd chuckled pay no mind t me nicholas if im t be truthful id say that theres nothin in the world more congenial t me right now than settlin t both anchors in as quiet a place as this it was particularly pleasant to sit in the orangery a small table to hand with a jug of lemon shrub and let the beaming sunshine lay its beneficent warmth upon him he had brought with him chesterfields advice to his son and the polite philosopher which was in its turgid phrases agreeably closing his eyes in mortal repose the peace and warmth did its work and the memories of the recent past began to fade outside birds hopped from branch to branch of the orchard trees their song so different from the sound of the seas rage his mind drifted to a more agreeable plane what would persephone be doing in bath did taking the waters imply a communal bath somewhere or would someone of her quality be granted private quarters no doubt lady lockwood would come round to things eventually particularly with persephone there to explain things meanwhile oh i didnt mean to disturb you mr kydd a timid voice called from the door kydd opened his eyes and rose no no please dont get up i only thought youd like tea andand i see you already have something her voice was shy but appealing in its childlike innocence although rosalynd was plainly a young woman thats kind in ye miss rosalynd kydd said with finality hoping she would go awayhe was enjoying the tranquillity and those pale blue eyes had an otherworldly quality that unnerved him but she remained quietly watching him y see im in deep study with m book he explained stiffly she approached shyly and kydd became uncomfortably aware that she had a startling natural beauty of which she seemed unconscious im so curious mr kyddive never met a learned gentleman before do forgive me but ive always wondered what they think on when their mind is not in a struggle with some great problem those eyes er im really no scholard miss fr that you need t ask mr renzi im only hishis assistant he fiddled with his book oh well if theres any service i can do for you gentlemen thank you wed most certainly call on ye she hesitated then with a smile and a curtsy she left it was no good she had ruined his rest so he took up chesterfield the latin tags annoyed him and the convoluted prose of half a century before was tedious yet if he was to hold his place in the highest society he should know the rules by heart and soon he sighed and ploughed on renzi returned in high spirits such richness of materialits striking to see the variation in responses and the philologyit would give you pause should you see what ive gleaned from their rustic speech a splendid day and tomorrow im promised an old man of a hundred and five years who can remember queen annes day at the evening meal kydd left it to renzi to deflect the polite enquiries concerning where they had come from it would probably cause alarm and consternation if ever it reached down to the nest of smugglers below them that an active commander royal navy was taking his ease so close and of course he did not want to hazard the trust renzi had established with the local folk in the morning renzi was off early leaving kydd to his orangery once more just as he had settled in his easy chair there was a shy knock and rosalynd entered then stood before him mr kydd i dont believe youre a learned gentleman at all kydd blinked and she went on i saw you last night when mr renzi was telling about his word fossils and i could swear you had no notion at all of what he was saying ah well y see im a friend of mr renzis who assists when called upon kydd said weakly she laughed prettily you see i knew you werent youre much tootoo er may i be told who it is you are sir it was unsettling but her innocence was disarming and he could not help a smile no one of significance youll understand im just a gentleman o leisure is all miss rosalynd looking doubtfully at him she said i do believe youre teasing me sir you have the air ofof someone of consequence whom it would be folly to trifle with youre a soldier mr kydd a colonel of some high regiment kydd winced not really he muttered but youre strong your look is direct you stand so squareit must be the sea youre a sailor an officer on a ship he could not find it in him to lie and answered with a sigh miss rosalynd you are right in th particulars but i beg do not let this be known ive just endured a great storm an desire to be left to rest of course mr kydd your secret shall be ours alone she said softly in quite another voice she continued i really came to tell you that the first friday of the month is the fair and market in polperro if you like id be happy to take you of course billy will come with us she added quickly dropping her eyes billy thats what titus wants us to call him he hates his name a country fair it had been long years since he had been to onebut chesterfield beckoned sadly miss rosalynd i have m duty by my books an must decline that is a great pity mr kydd for your friend left before i could inform him of it and now there is no one to tell him about what he might have seen kydd weakened mr renziyoure right o course it would be a sad thing should there be no one t report on it i shall come wonderful she said with a squeal well leave after i put on my bonnetwill that be convenient to you mr kydd they set off for polperro on foot i hope you dont mind the walkingwe should take a donkey shay but i do so pity the beasts on this steep hill the landaviddy pathway was a sharp slope down and kydd thought of their return with unease its so lovely in polperro at this time of the year rosalynd said wistfully she went to the side of the path and cupped her hand just look at these yellow flowers it is the biting stonecrop come to bloom and your yellow toadflax over here will try to outdo them we call it butter and eggs she added shyly titus hopped from one foot to the other in his impatience to get to the fair they descended further the rooftops below now in plainer view i do love polperrotheres so much of natures beauty on every hand a rustle of wings sounded on the left and a small bird soared into the sky a swiftwe must make our farewells to him soon do you adore nature too mr kydd the wide blue eyes looked up into his er at sea its all fishes an whales really miss rosalynd kydd said awkwardly wishing they were closer to their destination she stopped and gazed at him in open admiration of course you will have been all round the world and seenyoull have seen so much i do envy you mr kydd he dropped his eyes and muttered something turning away from her to resume walking he had no wish to be badgered by this slip of a girl when his thoughts were so occupied with the challenges of high society well before they reached the village kydds nose wrinkled at the unmistakable stench of fish workings but rosalynd seemed not to notice the muffled sound of a band mingled with excited voices floated up to them and when they reached level ground a glorious fair burst into view there were stalls with toys and sweetmeats penny peepshows the usual storytellers holding audiences agog with lurid tales despite himself kydd felt a boyish thrill at the gaudy scenes the village lads decorated with greenery and the lasses in their gay ribbons and gowns then preceded by terrified children a bear lurched down the street and round the corner a dragon breathing real fire progressed opposed by brave boys baying at it with fishermens foghorns titus ran forward the gaberlunzie man he shouted the cloaked performer was executing risky tricks with sulphur matches while a tumbler and juggler tried to distract him to the green urged rosalynd touching kydds arm theres always a play the village was a dense network of narrow streets and they emerged suddenly on to a tiny open area nearly overwhelmed by closepacked buildings there on an improvised stage a seedy band of players declaimed to a rapt audience on the way back kydd paid twopence to a fiddler for a gay twosome reel danced by a masked youth and maiden while the three each ate a filling cornish pasty to keep hunger at bay a quick visit by the goosey dancers ended the day and they wended their way back up the steep pathway they walked slowly titus going ahead its been so good to have visitors rosalynd said quietly we dont get many youll understand kydd murmured something and she gave him a quick glance you may think us simple folk here mr kydd but we are blessed with many things she bent and picked a flower hereso many pass by this it is the bridewort and is provided by nature to give us an infallible remedy against the headache she pressed it on him her fingers cool he lifted it feeling her eyes on him as he smelt it mr kydd its been such a lovely dayi do thank you renzi seemed strangely unmoved at the news of what he had missed his notebook was clearly of compelling interest and kydd left him to his aggregations for himself he could feel the sunshine and placidity working on him and the trials of the recent past were fading but something was unsettling himthe girl rosalynd was at odds with any other he had met and he was at a loss to know how to deal with her otherworldliness her communing with nature the innocence born of the seclusion of this place from the outer world and her ethereal loveliness what about her was so different an only daughter in a household of men her detachment from the usual cares and preoccupations of the world he checked himself this was no fit subject of concern for one about to be wed he declined her invitation to explore the village and buried himself in a book then found to his surprise that he felt put out when she accepted his refusal without comment on the next day when titus came to extend her hesitant offer to accompany them on their visit to the fisherfolk he accepted instantly she was wearing a plain linen morning dress and bonnet and carried a basket this is so kind mr kydd im going to visit mrs minards you see we lost a boat in the big gale and her husband was not found the poor soul kydd winced if teazer could find herself between life and death then what of the little fishingboats they have such a hard life mr kydd you have no idea hurry please billy mr kydd is waiting it was the landaviddy path again but this time they stepped out purposefully when something like this happens its so difficult to know what to do that theres somebody in the world who knows an understands will be comfort enough kydd said warmly she flashed him a look of gratitude it was a pretty village the small harbour was central with its piers and little fishingboats in rows on the mud however the nearer the fish quay they went the meaner the cottages at the edge rosalynd stopped to fasten on pattens overshoes that would protect her own from the fishslime good mornin miss rosalynd a buxom lady with a fishing basket hailed looking curiously at kydd and a good morning to you mrs rowett she called back gaily with a wave they reached the open space in front of the three pilchards and squeezed down a passage to the rickety cottages behind a dulleyed woman came to the door of one then broke slowly into a tired smile why rosalynd m deary theres no need to nonsense mrs minards im only come to make sure theres enough to go round a child wandered in lost and bewildered kydd felt an intruder the thin cobb walls two rooms and pitiful furnishings spoke of a poverty he had never been witness to the calm acceptance by this new widow of the seas pitilessness and her future of charity shocked him after they left kydd asked rosalynd what will she do now dye think he was startled to hear a sob before she answered toto know your love will not ever return to you in life is the cruellest thing mr kydd they walked out to the brightness of the day and she said with an effort i suppose she will go woolwashing at crumplehorn it pays quite well although the work is dirty at a loss kydd kept pace with her she stopped suddenly and turned to him with a smile mr kydd im going to show you my most favourite place in polperro come along she hurried to the corner of the row of cottages and found a neat but narrow path winding up high in the rocks oh do we have to billy said yes we do now get along up there if you please kydd however found sixpence for him to spend afterwards as he liked which won him a firm friend when they had toiled up a short slope and reached a spur of rock they were rewarded with a dramatic view the length of the harbour with its impossibly narrow entrance the two mighty formations of rock like a gigantic lizards spine and stretching in a vast glittering expanse to the distant horizon the sea there she breathed all the rest of the world is out there the elephants of india the palace of the king even that horrid napoleon all you have to do is get on a ship and you can go thereanywhere kydd was touched for him the far horizon was a familiar sea highway to every adventure and experience of significance in his life so far and he had perhaps taken for granted the freedoms it gave she pressed him what was life like for one who sailed away over that horizon what changes in character what deep feelings were involved kydd hesitated at first but he was soon opening to her parts of himself that had remained closed to everyone else including it had to be faced persephone rosalynd was reaching him in a unique way renzi arrived back late and somewhat rumpled gurry butts and arrish mows he sighed such a richness in diversity to the same urgent imperatives youll recall the islands of the great south seasthe savages there please know that this is proving a most satisfactory first expedition as i cn see nicholas kydd answered over his port an i wish you well of it all renzi looked at him fondly i am aware dear fellow that this is hardly an enthralling adventure for your good self and it is on my conscience that no no nicholas i am findin th peace an tranquillity a fine solace he said and th family is er takin good care of me renzi would probably not understand if he mentioned his pleasant walks with rosalynd you should ask them to show you about polperro renzi said encouragingly i passed by yesterday a most curious place he accepted a restorative drink and continued some might find its fragrance less of sanctity and more of fish but i was amused to read a most apposite inscription above the door of one such pallace dulcis lucri odor or this be the sweet smell of lucre kydd grinned your ovid then perhaps not the wit who placed it there was probably thinking of vespasian that most earthy of emperors who actually said pecunia non olet money does not reek a most practical view in my opinion the next day kydd and rosalynd visited jan puckeys fish pallace it was diverting to see the speed and skill with which the women balked the pilchards they were placed in an earthenware bussa tails in and heads out in an endless spiral of salted layers two thousand for the puckeys winter consumption alone with the oil pressed from them fetching a good price afterwards they took a picnic atop the medieval ruins of chapel hill rosalynd spread a cloth and took out country goodies from her basket i do hope youll have thesei dont know really what you like she added shyly with mutton pies and saffron cake happily tucked away kydd lay back contentedly on the grass and closed his eyes in the warm sun waiting for yet another question about the wider world but none came she sat close to him but seemed quiet and affected staring away over the sea at last she broke silence when will you leave mr kydd she asked in a small voice oh er i suppose thatll be when nicholas has had his fill o things t see he said offhandedly oh an awkward silence grew kydd got to his feet wed better be back he said dusting himself down ohnot straight away please she cried do you see there she said pointing to the cliff edge its a path that follows all the way to fowey and there are enchanting prospects to be had well wheres billy absent frm place of dutywell keelhaul him but she had already moved away he hurried after her across the grass and on to the narrow track that found its way along the ragged edge of the coast the sea beating against the rocks a precipitate hundred and fifty feet below rosalynd he called she did not stop until she had reached a fold in the cliffs he caught up and said miss rosalynd you should she turned slowly and kydd was astonished to see the glitter of tears mmr kydd she choked i bbeg youplease dont forget me wha i ddo assure you i will never forget you kydd was unable to think of anything to say youyouve changed me she said choked i cant be the same person any more ii its not your fault mr kydd ive been living here quietly and thinking its the whole world and then her hands twisted together you see its nothing youve doneits all my fault bbut ive found i care for you more than is proper and now youll get in your ship and sail away from me and she buried her face in her hands and wept struck to the heart his hands went out to her she reached for him with a tearing sob and clutched him fiercely weeping into his chest appalled but deeply touched he stroked her hair finding himself whispering meaningless phrases while the storm of emotion spent itself then she wrenched away from him and sought his eyes i love you mr kyddi love you so much it hurts me there its said her fingers dug painfully into his arms until the moment passed she kept his gaze then added with a shaky laugh and i dont even know your name kydd stepped back in dismay caught up in his own chaos of feeling he turned away and saw billy standing staring they made their way back in an uncomfortable silence at the manor squire morthwen was waiting for them and seeing his daughters condition demanded an explanation he listened stonily as she declared she had been upset at billys absence thinking he had taken a tumble over the rocks and been swept away the squire looked sharply at kydd rosalynd excused herself from dinner kydd endured until he could get away to the privacy of his bedroom then flopped on to the bed his thoughts running wild by morning he knew what he had to do no decent man could stand to see such sweet innocence betrayed he had been blind and stupid not to realise that what had been to him a pleasant time in the company of an enchanting young woman might mean rather more to her it had to end nicholas i do think i should go back an see how teazer is at the dockyard renzis face fell that is t say it will only be me o course you should stay an take aboard a full cargo o your ethnical facts afore returning you are bored and vexed by idleness while i garner my harvest of particulars renzi said suspiciously no no nicholas its just m duty is all there was no prospect that teazer would be away to sea in the near future a survey had found started strakes and displaced frame timbers nothing that could not be put right but the drydocks were occupied by important units of the fleet and teazer would have to take her turn kydd returned to number eighteen sending mrs bargus and becky into a fluster but found it the worst of places to be he sat alone in the drawing room staring into the fire with nothing to divert him from his brooding thoughts it was unfair rosalynd had invaded his consciousness and threatened his ordered life but now her image seldom left him the wide innocence of those dreamy blue eyes her beauty her direct even intimate way of talkinghe was tormented by her and he had to do something about it time was not the answer after several days her presence was as real as ever why could he not put her from his mind it was not his way to shy from a difficulty the only way to deal with the situation was to confront it he would ride out to polperro and dispose of it once and for all by the simple device of seeing her again then he would surely realise she was a pretty slip of a country girl whom he had found it agreeable to pass the time on a leisure visit nothing more that would finally lay to rest his unreal images of a girl who never was his knock at the door was answered by the pleasant maidservant no the squire was out at this time every day he visited his tenants mr renzi he was chasing his ethnicals again ill wait fr the squire kydd said and was ushered into the snug drawing room where he had first set eyes on rosalynd he pulled himself together and settled in a chair to await the squires return as in all politeness he was bound to do the door squeaked and rosalynd hurried in incredulous mr kydd she cried her face lighting with joy you came back you came back for me she flew across the room and embraced him my dear man my dearest sweet man kydd looked into her brimming eyes and his arms went round her to hold her close his hands caressing cherishing his eyes pricked and a lump formed in his throat for now it was plain that he was facing the greatest trial of his life so youve done well by yr particulars in polperro i see said kydd eyeing renzis careful piles of notes indeedand enough to keep me in thought for a long time to come such variance i would never have conceived it that nicholasum might we talk for a spell talk oh yes fire away old fellow he left his notes reluctantly and came to sit with kydd nicholas there iser that is to say i have a problem an i was hoping youd give me a course t steer oh please tell well its all shoalwater navigation fr me but y see nicholas um dear fellow do clap on more sail or well not make port by dinner er you see nicholas ii find my affections have er been engaged by miss rosalynd renzi sat bolt upright as though his hearing was in question do i understand you correctly you have formed some species of taking after squire morthwens daughter aa lusting for her kydd reddened i cant keep her out of m mind no matter what i do then you had better find a way my good friend this is my problem nicholas is it right t wed a lady while thinking of another are you telling me in all seriousness that you are allowing a casual obsession of the moment to interfere with your marriage to one of the most eligible scions of society this is nothing but rank idiocy and if its more thana passing fancy what then good god man renzi spluttered i do believe youve taken leave of your wits he quietened with an effort be advised my friend that if you still hanker after the woman in higher society these matters can be arranged discreetly enough your prince of wales enjoys the attentions of his paramour where he will and kydds face tightened damn it nicholas youre so high on morality an conduct wheres your advice t me now renzis expression hardened youre forgetting yourself a gentleman by definition is concerned with graces and appearancespoliteness and urbanity above all if its the case that youre unable to control your coarser spirits then the least you can do is conduct yourself with discretion kydd fought back anger an ill remind you were talkin of a fine lady herewhat of her she will accept it in courseas one of breeding she will be first concerned with the respectability of her family and heirs you will not find a difficulty there i believe youfor th sake of appearances youd take a wife an lie with another kydd choked then i pity my poor sister renzi went white let me remind you sir he said dangerously it is you who are discontented with your lot i do strongly advise you consider your position carefully and put an end to this ridiculous posturing thomas my dear so good to see you again how are you cecilia poured the tea and regarded her brother with undisguised affection the talk in town is all about your brave deeds in the storm you really should take more careits so very dangerous in a gale yes sis kydd said accepting his cup and hows nicholas youve both been gone for so long on your expeditions hes well cec but why im here is er i need yr advice oh dont worry about it a wedding is really the concern of the womenfolk theyll see everything is right on the day no itsits not that y see um somethings happened cecilia saw his set face and sat up then youd better tell me about it thomas she said quietly in the bare telling it sounded so thin and illogical when he had finished cecilia said nothing staring at him troubled now let me be clear about this thomas in just a week or so you have discovered deep feelings for this rosalynd that cannot be denied aye kydd said miserably it happened so quick cec an its knocked m feelings askew this is very serious thomas i know he whispered can i ask it sisis it right to marry one while thinkin on another cecilia looked at him sharply then melted leaning to clasp his hands in hers you dear sweet boy you know the answer to that she drew out her handkerchief and wiped a tear then continued in a practical tone so now there are decisions to be made and these are it seems to me one of three cast rosalynd out of your mind and marry persephone continue with the wedding to persephone and make other arrangements for rosalynd and the last is to cast out persephone and be wed to rosalynd kydd said nothing gazing at her as if mesmerised you might consider delaying in the hope that your feelings change ii feel it worse every day i see then we must find a resolution and for this i believe i must ask you some hard questions kydd nodded and braced himself do you love miss lockwood shes the most handsome and intelligent woman ive ever met an thats the truth do you love her wretchedly kydd tried to escape cecilias accusing eyes look cec its not that itsits that when i see rosalynd shes such a tender innocent an i want to love her an protect her but persephone sheshe doesnt need me t protect her shes strong an knows things and the lump in his throat made it difficult to carry on and rosalynd is carefree an loves simple thingsi dont feel i have t be polite an play a part all th time tears pricked she talks t me and i cn feel her words inside me sobs choked him thomas listen to me theres a terrible flood coming and you must save one and lose the other only onewho is it to be kydd shook his head in anguish you must answer she demanded forcefully soon one will vanish from your life for everfor ever which one will you miss the most the tears were blinding but cecilia spared him nothing which one rosalynd he shouted hoarsely its rosalynd i cant bear to leave he stood in agony tears coursing down his cheeks i cant help it god help me cecilia i cant help it she held him while the storm passed saying nothing but rocking him slowly when it was over he stood away from her his fists bunching helplessly as he fought to regain his composure iim sorry cec he gulped wewe men are a lubberly crew when it comes t this sort o thing dear sweet brother please dont say youre sorry this is all because youre such a good manyou see she sighed and looked at him lovingly youve answered your own question and to be frank its not altogether a surprise to me kydd swallowed yesdo you mind if i say something very cruel to you thomas if y must cec i do believe that youve been infatuated not with persephone lockwood but with what she is the world she comes from all that pomp and finery and the pity of it is that of a certainty she loves you there was nothing he could find to say she went on gently this is why you must tell her yourself thomasshes a fine woman and at the least deserves this i will he agreed so now we must consider the future she got up and began to pace up and down the room i gather you have not spoken to her father yet no he said huskily have you an understanding with persephone i was t ask for her hand when she returned from bath very well then there is no question of a breach of engagement but the world will believe there is an understandingyour attachment was much talked about she stopped do you intend to marry your rosalynd kydd gave a shy smile if she will have me cec the idea broke on him like thunder and he felt nothing but a soaring exhilaration his elation seemed to vex cecilia i dont believe you can conceive what an upset this will cause thomas she said with the utmost seriousness it will be gossip in the salons for ages to come can you not see the daughter of a family of the first quality and known at court an acknowledged beauty and turned down by a penniless commander for a simple country girl kydd still stood in an attitude of the greatest happiness while cecilia continued grimly her family will be mortifiedthey will seek to destroy you in society they will have you damned at every polite gathering in the land no one will dare invite you for fear of offendingyoull be an outcast just as youre about to enter at the highest level and your sea careeryou cause mortal offence to your admiral and he will take his revenge id believe it stopped kydd but only for a moment he cant turn me out of my ship sis ive now got someone t care about and im going to do m copperbottomed best t see shes proud o meand be damned to any wholl stand athwart m hawse an in the meanwhile cec ill be with my rosalynd an raising our family the hoofbeats of his horse thundered in kydds ears as he tried to grapple with the enormity of what he had just done immediately on her return from bath he had requested an interview alone with persephone shocked by the reversal of what she had expected she had nevertheless remained calm and controlled standing nobly to hear what kydd had to say he had spoken woodenly forcing himself to look at her while he delivered his words and then had been nearly undone by her calm reply as she had before answered his own challenge truthfully she now simply wished to know if another had secured his affections his face was streaked with tears at the memory of her parting words to the effect that she understood and was grateful for his frankness for she could never have given her heart to one who could not promise his own he had fled it was now a completed act with dread and joy he was riding across the hills to polperroto rosalynd out of one world and into another he had propped a note to renzi on the mantelpiece and had left the storm to break without him a straight stretch of road opened ahead and instinctively kydd whipped his mount into a frenzied gallop needing the wild motion to work on his emotions whatever else in the world happened he was now riding to lay his heart before rosalynd morthwen and seek her hand in marriage in a flood of feeling he brought the exhausted horse to a crashing stop before the manor and slid to the ground at the old windows faces began to appear but kydd would not have been stopped by the devil himself and strode forward mr kydd the squire himself answered the door and eyed kydds dusty wild appearance apprehensively a manservant and stablehand hovered protectively behind him kydd made a short bow sir my business is brief i beg th favour of some small time with yr daughteralone as the import of his request penetrated a disbelieving smile appeared then by degrees it spread until the squires face grew red with heartfelt pleasure by all means m boy he chortled do wait a moment if y please inside excited shouts were urgently shushed and there were sounds of running feet then the squire appeared again at the door do come in sir kydd entered and stopped she was standing rigid in the centre of the little drawing room her eyes never leaving his miss rosalynd he said in a voice charged with emotion i come to speak with yr father on a matter of the highest importance y see ive come to see that um m feelings for you are er he was reddening and the words he had prepared fled at the reality of the impossibly lovely creature before him there was nothing for it he flung himself on to one knee and choked out rosalyndwill ye wed me its an oxroast ill stand for nothing less the squires roar cut across the excited babble with rosalynd sitting shyly beside him his hand securely over hers kydds heart was full to bursting tears only a whisker away he endured the friendly jests of her brothers and dared to steal another look at her it was beyond mortal belief that this sweet creature and he would go forward as one for the rest of their lives rosalynd suggested they take a walk together however it seemed that the proprieties were still to be observed and titus was called to accompany them in the event the embarrassed lad went on ahead until he was all but out of sight they walked slowly together in silence kydd anxious that the magic spell might be broken and rosalynd by his side with a soft dreaming look ii believe we must make some plans he said finally in a low voice yes mymy dearest she whispered if it does not inconvenience you i would wish to be married as soon we may banns will be called for three sundays at the parish church and itit would make me very happy if we could be wed on the fourth she bestowed on him a look of such love that it quite unmanned him he crushed her to him we shall he croaked in a daze of happiness he walked on the world in a blur reality at his side their steps had taken them down to the villageto polperro which to kydd now was more dear than anywhere on earth why miss rosalynd mrs puckeys dour face was now wreathed in smiles i never did wem all been wonderin who yed end with she looked with keen interest at kydd this is my intended mrs puckey hes mr kydd she said proudly news must have spread in the village at breakneck speed others arrived to share in the moment bejabers mr kydd but ye be one of us now then mr bunt please he only asked me this morning laughed rosalynd and i did so accept him she said softly with a sideways glance at kydd they moved on noting the makings of a huge driftwood fire even now enthusiastically under way on the foreshore of the harbour before the three pilchards and continued through the streets a small shop caught kydds attention it offered the services of a shademaker my dearest if you would indulge me i have a yen he said each in turn sat in a darkened room beside a paper screen and candle while the artist went laboriously round the shadow with a pencil afterwards a dextrous flourish with the pantograph saw their silhouettes reduced magically to black miniatures then charmingly encapsulated in two giltedged lockets kydd slipped his into the inner recesses of his waistcoat where it settled in a glow of warmth my lovedo let me show you talland bay its so enchanting rosalynd urged then as they passed a modest cottage on the hill she propelled him towards it this is someone id like to meet youa man whos been so good to the village he came as a schoolteacher and since hes been here hes prospered in business but hes always helped people in trouble taken care of those on hard times andoh do come the kindly old gentleman blinked with pleasure at meeting rosalynds chosen and pronounced words of benevolence upon them its good t meet ye mr job kydd said sincerely they left the village by the warren and followed a girdling cliff path far above the sea and right down into the next bay there she said as their shoes crunched in the sand kydd couldnt help but note it was a very secluded beach ideal for landing contraband in the navy polperro bears a reputation for smuggling as hard as any he murmured i know dearest but please believe me the fisherfolk and villagers are not your smugglers they only fetch and carry for small coin and who can blame them when the fishing is so uncertain nothe villains are those who put down fifty pounds to invest in a cargo from france and pay others to face the danger kydd said nothing thinking of stirk somewhere at sea in a smuggling lugger on his dangerous mission to find evidence see here rosalynd said stooping to a pile of misty dovegrey and violet pebbles she lifted one up to show him arent they lovely not as fair as you my dear rosalynd he said and kissed her tenderly talland church was a little further on up a remarkably steep hill which left them both panting at the top this is where well be married she breathed holding both of his hands and the fishermens choir will sing for me and the bells will ring so loudly it was a striking church with a wondrous view of the bay mellow with age it nestled into the cornish hill as though it had grown from it the belltower set apart from the main edifice but linked with a coachroof and there they would be joined together for ever as they returned kydd found it hard to deal with the forces pulling on his soul here was his futurethere lay his past a gathering black cloud of social ruin was waiting and this simple sweet soul knew nothing but her newfound happiness she stopped at the seas edge and turned to him with a smile when will you take me to visit your ship ill be so proud will the captain allow me do you think she added anxiously he will i promise kydd said softly then the dark clouds returned to edge about his happiness who knew what lurked in wait for him er th ships in dock for repair after th storm well have time later but there was a larger issue that had to be faced she had the right to know what hetheywere headed into the unjust social retribution that would be visited on her innocence the friendless harsh new world after polperro rosalynd my very dearest i have t tell you something as will touch on our future he swallowed and continued before i met you there was a lady called persephone an she and i chapter kydd could not throw off his sense of foreboding as the coach drew closer to plymouth rattling along the last mile it curved round to stop on the foreshore which had once been a favourite sight with the long spread of the dockyard on the opposite shore and sail on the river now as he waited for the torpoint ferry it seemed hostile and foreign he gazed over the halffinished vessels and the ships in for repair to his astonishment he saw teazer with just her lower masts but to all intents and purposes out of dock and in completion hailing a returning wherry he hurried out to his ship standish was there impassively at the salute but with few others about the decks how is th ship kydd asked him standish doffed his hat formally and said coolly wanting masts and stores only sir the implied rebuke was barely concealed kydd turned abruptly and went to his cabin ah nicholas were afloat again have you your sufficiency of ethnicals do y think renzi rose from the table his manner cold and detached here are the returns for stores demands you should be aware that in your absence eleven men have deserted and we have received an instruction from admiral lockwood that the instant you returned aboard you were to present yourself at his office immediately thank you kydd said with as much dignity as he could muster i will go now o course get out lockwood roared at a frightened clerk when kydd had been announced you too he savagely snapped at the flaglieutenant lockwood strode across and slammed the office door how dare you sir how dare you show your villainous face in public after your unpardonable behaviour towards my daughter sir kydd said stiffly there was no engagement but there was an understanding lockwood shouted his face white with fury as well you knew sir you have been dishonourable in your intentions she is upsetquite undoneand i will not let it pass as god is my witness i will not let this go kydd swayed under the blast suddenly lockwood turned and stamped over to his desk he waved a copy of the telegraph at kydd have you any conception of the ruination you have caused my family the distress this has caused my beloved wife no then read this sir read it kydd took the newspaper our intrepid spy lookout climbs aloft to the crows nest in his unceasing quest for those furtive proceedings of the world most likely to surprise and concern the public he trains his powerful telescope and before long a most lugubrious sight catches his eye readers of a delicate disposition should now avert their eyes for what must follow is a heartrending tale of desolation and woe a comely maiden stands weeping and to lookouts astonishment and anguish he sees that it is none other than our fair miss persephone l who when she last graced this column was expecting the joyful sound of wedding bells what is this he asks bewildered and turns his glass around and about aha can this be the reason the dashing and notorious captain kidd has vilely abandoned her and is now making wicked advances to another and who is it for whom he has spurned our lady of quality miss l none other than a simple country girl with no prospects but a saucy figure can it be believed we can only beg our readers to contemplate the feelings kydd reddened sir this is no youve shamed us to the whole world sir bellowed lockwood and cast my dear wife to her bed with mortification and i can assure you ill see you in hades before i let it rest kydd stood rigid as he continued and when im finished there wont be a soul in the land wholl think to let you pass their door and as for your sea service i promise you my report to their lordships concerning your fitness for command will spare not a single detail none sir sir this is monstrous unjust kydd said thickly your ship has been at moorings these last two days awaiting her commander this is intolerable and demonstrates to me a complete and utter contempt for your position as a commanding officer permission to sleep out of your ship is therefore revokedyou understand me sir yes kydd ground out what was that i understand sir kydd said suppressing his anger savagely then if you find the time perhaps you might bring your command to sea readiness i have a special service in mind the midshipman of the boat quailed under his captains fury and as they returned to teazer boyd gave his orders to the crew in a hushed voice kydd had come to a cold hard understanding of how things now were he had chosen his pathand it had cost him dearly the dreamlike past with its promise of elevation to the heights of gentility and aristocratic privilege was now but a memory all he had to look forward to was the remainder of his commission in teazer before the admirals malicious actions took effect at the admiralty then gentle penury for the rest of his life but it would be with rosalynd he clung to the radiance of her laughing image his eyes misting be damned it was worth ita hundred times worth it um sirwere alongside the midshipman said uncomfortably i cn see that blast you he said and clambered inboard over the bulwark send fr the sheer hulk were taking in masts he snapped at standish now sir he plunged below and sat in his chair breathing heavily tysoe he roared brandy renzi glanced up from his quill face blank kydd glowered at him as y said an ill thank ye not t preach it renzi looked at him for a moment then said coldly im sorry to hear it i dont think you are kydd said venomously youre satisfied t see me on a lee shore now ive made m choice i take no pleasure from your predicament then why the wry looks since you ask it i believe you have done yourself a grievous harmno hear me out for i shall say this once only kydds expression tightened as renzi went on remorselessly it has been too rapid too precipitate it is my firm belief that taken as you no doubt are by one of natures children you have progressed too far in your acquisition and appreciation of the higher arts of civilised conduct and later you will find yourself quite unsatisfied and morose with your lot shackled to one for whom the graces will mean so little and why you have seen fit to throw over without thought a gentlewoman of such incomparable quality as miss lockwood with all it means for your hopes of entry into society i simply cannot conceive kydd glared at renzi have y finished that is all i wish to say then hear me now fr tll say this only th once he tossed back his brandy in one i dont expect ye to reckon on it but when i came up wi rosalynd all m world has gone likelike a dream a wonderful dream he saw renzi wince at the return of his old ways of speech but didnt care ii love th girl he gulped i didnt know love would be like thisn its wonderfulan so terrible he grabbed the bottle and splashed more into his glass an this ill tell ye today its rosalynd an no other so help me renzi spoke in an icily neutral tone then there seems no point in continuing this conversation you are besotted of the moment and will take no advice from anyone we are of different minds on the issue and i for my part can see no reason to change my view of your unfortunate situation he took a long breath therefore i offer the termination of my services aboard teazer if you so desire i shall shift my berth out of this vessel tonight kydd felt stifled by the ship he knew the signs the sly looks seamen listless in their duties the lack of respect in their eyeshis men had taken against him it could be anything there would be lofty criticising on the messdeck arguments but counting heavily against him from the point of view of the seamen before the mast was teazers conspicuous lack of victories in battle was he unlucky a jonah but the real reason he knew was deeper he had had the chance of marrying into the world of the aristocracy with all the prestige it would have given the ship and had somehow botched it settling for a simple country lass it brought into question his judgement as a manand by implication as their commander two more had gone over the side as they were getting in the masts knowing that no one could be spared to chase after them teazer would be putting to sea in the next few days and she was falling apart standish was cool and aloof and the master had retreated into monosyllables even tysoe was reproachful and distant clearly put out because his hopes of a prestigious situation in the future had been dashed it had cost kydd dignity and patience to beg renzi to remain and there was no guarantee that it would last but with renzi set against him he had now not a single friend or confidant to whom he could turn he burnt with the injustice of it all but he was helpless forbidden to sleep ashore there was however nothing to stop him setting foot on land for a little while so he ordered his boat at the hard he saw two lieutenants in conversation on seeing kydd they stopped then deliberately turned their backs to continue their exchange it would demean him to take them to task and he passed them wounded were the officers of the fleet now taking sides a casual naval acquaintance in plain clothes stopped and looked at him with frank curiosity and a pair of ladies in durnford street passed him primly enough but then broke into excited chatter number eighteen was no longer a snug haven his estrangement from renzi cast a pall over their lodging and when mrs bargus came in to find whether to set the fire it was with a disapproving air but there was one who would understand kydd hoped his spirits returned as he summoned the housekeeper here mrs bargus find a boy an tell him t deliver a note this hour a reply came back by return dear brother i have to get this off so please do forgive if im short im so truly sorry to hear of your trouble but right at this time i dont think i can be seen with you mrs mullins taking on so you will understand wont you and i dont think i want to go on board your ship and see mr renzi there until things are settled do keep well and next time i see you i hope it will be with rosalynd kydd felt the world closing in on him the only thing now in his universe that had any meaning was rosalynd her softness the clear sweetness of her voiceonly she mattered he sat back and let warm thoughts of her take him away it was getting towards dusk and as he readied himself to return to the ship there was a hesitant tap at the door below and voices as mrs bargus answered i um was passing bazely s kind in ye please draw up a chairbrandy not now thank ee he said without his usual breeziness i cant stop for long fenella puts out on the morning tide to the eastd he added well now kydd tried to think of talk but bazely cut him short i came er to see if theres anything i can do for ye he said uncomfortably do for me now youve come up against things an all youll know what i mean kydd was touched beyond measure bazely had risked the admirals displeasure and his career by visiting him thats so good of ye bazely it seems theres not s many wish t stand as my friend im sorry we didnt find time ever fr a rantan ashore one of us has to keep the seas while the other sports it in harbour m old cock its the way of it i recall y took a hammering off whitsand while we was snug at two anchors in tor bay aye well its right good of ye t call i might yet have a need a soft look spread on kydds face as he added an ill have ye know wherever rosalynd and i fetch up youll be first across th threshold m friend hms teazers orders were waiting for her captain when he returned aboard a single page delivered by a lieutenant under signature it was far from elaborate the special service was nothing more than the instruction to resume smugglerhunting to remain on station without leaving at his peril it was a cynical move by one easy stroke and appearing to be in earnest about a serious problem lockwood had ensured that kydd would find neither glory nor notice it was a sentence of sea toil and drudgery flogging up and down the coast after fast and elusive smugglers who seemed to have second sight when teazer finally put to sea it was with a scratch company the impress service finding seven resentfuls a new gunners mate with stirk presumed lost and discontent rippling out from the quarterdeck after their fate was revealed how things had changed teazer his fine ship of which he had been so proud was now the focus of his troubles and she was not the lovely creature she had been he had not been able to find the funds to smooth away the raw marks of damage and repair with expensive varnish and had had to accept the utilitarian dull black of the dockyard which disfigured and besmirched her brightsided hull they rounded the rame westwards past whitsand bay they were the same places as before but now they seemed indifferent going about their unseen everyday business while teazer sailed endlessly offshore but one held special meaning almost hidden from seaward the snug village of polperro came up under their leehe would have given almost anything to land there but even the most compelling reason would be misinterpreted and as he could not travel from plymouth and return in a day and was unable to sleep out of his ship it would be impossible to visit rosalynd kydd had to possess himself in patience for the twentyfour days that remained before they would be finally together and be satisfied with the precious locket polperro was left gradually to sink astern days followed other days renzi had retreated into formality and spent time in kydds cabin only on ships business standish affected a cynical correctness that preyed on kydds nerves but he hugged to his heart the knowledge that now every day was one closer he took advantage of a mild southeasterly to call on the collector of customs at fowey as usual he heard a litany of missed landings fruitless swoops the outrageous ease with which operations were coordinated and views on the complete uselessness of the royal navy but nothing to help his quest the gig set off to return to teazer and kydd spotted seamen crowding together at the foremast about one man it wasnt until he was aboard that he could see tobias stirk was at the centre of attention only standish knew the real reason for stirks absence and kydd took savage delight in not asking him to the cabin to listen to any adventures instead ordering him to take the ship to sea good t see ye right fine it is kydd said in unaffected pleasure th best sight ive had fr a sennight y must believe an its right oragious t be back mr kydd stirk growled kydd felt a rush of warmth yell have a rummer for yr bones he said then found glasses and a bottle he saw stirk looking up at him with his steely eyes as he poured and for some reason felt defensive not as whos t tell toby but its been a hard beat for me these last weeks he tried to say lightly only t say theres been a mort o trouble over me bein spliced t the wrong lady and er y may hear rum things about me he finished lamely stirk watched him levelly as he took a pull at his drink then set the glass down and said carefully sorry t hear of it sir aye kydd said there had been a time when he could have unburdened his soul to this man but that was far in the past and they were separated in any friendship by the widest gulf that could exist in a ship he topped up stirks glass then ill be pleased t hear of yr adventuring now mr stirk there was a glimmer of a smile and yell be interested in these stirk grunted as he tugged off his shoes and retrieved some folded papers frm guernsey kydd scanned them quickly one was a form of cargo manifest but in essence showed orders to tranship specified freight to an english ship openly listed contraband it was countersignedby the guarantor its zephaniah job o polperro stirk said bluntly runs it all even sets imself up as a bank t guarantee to the mongseers which supplies th run goods kydd brought to memory the kindly face of the mr job he had met could he really be the same man he looked at another paper a letterofcredit with the same beautifully executed and perfectly readable signature with an ornate flourish in the exact centre below it zephaniah job a very fly gennelman mr job has s much ridin on the cargoes hes taken over th business o gettin it ashore himself organises th lot frm a master book e keeps so that was how now mr kydd if ye has th book an matches it there t the sailin times even a blind dutchman ll have t say as how he must by y man how thats cos i know where e keeps th book its in his house fr i seen him get it quick like so it must be there an if yed rummage his house why kydd sat back in admiration then he said this letterocredit its worth a bucket o guineas an im thinkin th owner was vexed t lose it may i know did er y come by much trouble in th gettin of it stirk said nothing fixing kydd with an expressionless stare come now mr stirk y must have a tale or two t tell there was no response and kydd knew he would never learn what had taken place stirk stood ill go now sir he growled this is a great stroke an therell be a reward at th back of it ill see y square on that mr stirk kydd said warmly no mr kydd i doesnt want any t knowever if y unnerstands me stirk had done what he had for kydd but he was not proud to have deceived those who had befriended him and luke kydd bounded on deck the sunshine felt joyful on his face standish looked at him curiously did the rascal find out anything of use sir kydd smiled a rare enough set of adventures ill grant but nothin o value ha i didnt think it hes had a holiday on the kings account and lines his pocket in following his old ways that sort dont know the meaning of honour kydds smile vanished thats as may be fr now we have a pressing task ive had intelligence frm the collector in fowey that will mean we cn lay our hands on this smugglerinchief why sir if thats so then we crack on all sail conformable im not goin t miss the chance to settle th rogue he could have alerted fowey to send a revenue party to arrest job but this opportunity was too good to miss when he succeeded where all others had failed lockwood would be furious but would have no alternative but to thank him publicly and release him from this drudgery er where no moren a league ahead mr standish polperro hms teazer rounded to and anchored in four fathoms off the little fishing village much too big to enter the tiny harbour she made a fine picture so close in and kydd thrilled to think that rosalynd might be among the curious sightseers come to see why a kings ship had disturbed their morning but they were there for a stern purpose eight menpoulden in charge cutlasses two muskets he did not expect difficulties but if job had men of his own it would be prudent to mount a show of force the pinnace stroked for the harbour entrance eyes turning at the dramatic flare of rocks that was the peak ashore people hurried to stand along the rugged heights to watch the drama th fish quay kydd ordered his coxswain a small boat scrambled to get out of the way and people crowded there when it could be seen where they were headed hold water larbd give way stbd the pinnace swung and headed in toss yr oars looms were smacked on thighs and oars thrown vertical as the boat glided in to the quay excited faces peered over the edge and kydd adopted a suitably grave expression as he climbed up to the top his men behind him form up he snapped clapping his cocked hat firmly in place shoulder yr arms there were gasps from the jostling onlookers as the seamen drew their cutlasses and rested the bare blades on their shoulders the crowds noise died as they watched wideeyed there was a jostling movement and suddenly rosalynd was therefear and delight in her features thomas she called and flung herself forward hey miss y cant do that poulden said scandalised thats the captain the captain she squealed eyes shining but hes my captain er hmm kydd said gruffly m dear i have m duty t do if y please he was conscious of a growing hubbub as he was recognised under his gold lace and there were open grins among his men if yed wait fr me ill be here for you my very dearest she breathed a hug turned into a kiss before kydd crimsonfaced could march the men off the crowd surging after them he knew the way they swung across the little bridge and up the pathway the nervous agitation of the throng echoing in the narrow lane as they speculated loudly on their destination at the modest cottage he hammered on the door open th door in the kings name open unrest spread as the people realised what was happening job was popular in polperro kydd raised his hand to knock again but the door opened and a bemused job emerged blinking in the sun gentlemen ah mr kydd is it not kydd felt a wave of misgiving at seeing him again a powerful smuggling gangmaster if stirk was wrong lets be inside sir he said firmly there were angry shouts from the crowd but poulden and one other entered close behind and shut the door ive reason t believe kydd began it sounded so theatrical and the mildmannered job stared at him in alarm right poulden y know what yere lookin forgo to it what you cant do that sir what are you doing job shrilled as poulden went into the room described by stirk theres the accounts of years in theretheyll be sent all topsyturvy oh do stop him mr kydd i beg but it was too late poulden came back with a great volume and placed it on the table in front of kydd behind th dresser sir neat columns names dates cargoes consignees special instructions ships times places it was more than enough zephaniah job i arrest you frfr doin smugglin contrary t the law yell come with us t foweynow iron handcuffs were produced job was now calm almost serene this is my home village mr kydd it would oblige me extremely should you permit me to go on board your vessel unfettered sir your word my word there was something disturbing about his imperturbability but kydd allowed his request and they stepped outside the crowd was restless shouts and jeers met them and a stone whistled past kydds head go he told poulden and the party set off quickly for the quay seamen with naked blades to each side of him and the prisoner catcalls sounded above the tumult cries of anger and betrayal they reached the quay and the pinnace made ready rosalynd stood back her face pale with shock bliddy spy thats what y came ere for screamed mrs minards in kydds face aye not fit fr a polperro lass he aint spat puckey and the mob took it up grimfaced kydd told job to get into the boat and turned to face the crowd seeing rosalynd tear free and run to him sobbing i had t do my duty he said huskily fish entrails slapped against his coat soiling rosalynd as well she composed herself you must always do your duty my love go now and ill be waiting for you sir poulden said anxiously ssoon was all kydd could trust himself to say to her before he turned abruptly and went down into the boat give way he said in a low voice and as they made for the open sea he twisted round to keep her in view as long as he could he should have considered it more kydd thought bitterly job was a benefactor to the village well liked and most importantly a regular employer of tub carriers and lookouts kydd had angered the folk of polperro antagonised the very place that had made him so welcome and now his world of happiness had contracted to just one personwhom he had unthinkingly made an outcast among her own people sir standish entered unsure ah mr job is asking for a word with you in private sir i did tell him it was improper but it is where is he now in irons sir i thought it in bilboes a mort hard on a man o years mr standish bring him t me ill hear him out for some reason he had an odd regard for the man i do apologise fr my lieutenant mr job hes zealous in th kings service y must understand now what cn i do for you job settled himself you will believe that my course is finished commander but i should like to say to you here that there is a service i can yet do for my fellow man which it would render me much satisfaction to perform kydd kept a noncommittal silence and it has to be admitted its doing must stand me in good stead for anything that must follow for me yr service yes you will no doubt have heard of that vile privateersman bloody jacques the hairs on kydds neck pricked i have what can y tell me of the villain i want you to remove this evil creature from the high seas sir your jest is in bad taste mr job kydd said let me explain job said evenly you may have noticed that his knowledge of these coasts is exemplary this is no coincidence i can tell you now that i know him well but as michael haws resident as was of looea species of turncoat as it were in his own interest in the past i have had occasion to employ him and his lugger inin trading ventures but since the resumption of war he has taken the character of a french privateer in order to prey more profitably on our richer trade in short a pirate owing allegiance to none it was incredibleif true he wears a dark beard adopts a rough manner all this is to hide his identity of courseand the selecting of victims on the deck of captures to run them through as an example to the rest why this is nothing more than disposing of those he knows and fears might later bear witness against him this is fine information mr job but i i will lead you to him the rest i leave to you well gentlemen kydd said with relish unfolding the chart of st austell bay on the table thanks t our guest mr job were at last one jump ahead o mr bloody jacques we have th same information that he hastheres t be a landing at pentewan sands this next night he let the news sink in and went on the villains goin t be waitin to take th smuggler an when he makes his move we want t be there to make ours on him and mark this if y please im not goin t spare this poxy villain hes not y usual privateersman hes a mad dog an must be put down standish looked grave the others remained impassive hes not about t give up without he takes it out of us i dont need t say it but hell not be offerin quarter an therefore i do see it as a fight t the finish im sorry t see teazers company put t hazard in this way but i know youll see th need now i dont want t lose this chance so ive given it a lot o thought id like yr comments afterwards he glanced at renzi sitting at a small table and taking a record but he realised there would be no discourse in the old way with his friend however kydd was satisfied he was thinking as bloody jacques was the smuggler would be running fast and direct across the channel for with every sail hostile there would be no point in prolonging exposure therefore his course would be generally from the southeast given the easy westerlies that had prevailed these last few days but it would be in the last few miles only that the smugglers position would be guaranteed where could a privateer lurk unseen in the almost northsouth trend of st austell bay to the dodman with pentewan in the middle one place stood out above all others black head to the north this looming mass of granite standing well out could comfortably conceal a dozen vessels within a mile or so of the sands not passed from the southeast and with all attention in the smuggling craft on the dangers of the landing the privateer could close in from behind with deadly ease so its t be black head are we agreed a murmur about the table he took to be consensus and went on then i want t be in position close in to charlestown harbour at dusk t be ready to drop down on em at th right time from seaward kydd hoped that hms teazer at anchor looked for all the world like a merchant brig waiting out the tide to enter charlestown but aboard her preparations for the night went on apace it was going to be that hardest of battlefields the sea at night with all that it meant for the accuracy of gunfire and distinguishing friend from foe in combat on a strange deck in the pitch dark with most certainly a larger crew in the privateer the odds were shortening fast but their duty was plain and there could be no hanging back there would be many sailors along the cornish coast who would bless their names before the night was outor not should they miss this chance sunset sir standish said in a low voice very well kydd said briskly hands t quarters and prove th lookouts it was not impossible that bloody jacques could arrive at black head from the north it was now just a waiting game the run ashore was timed for after dark and before the moon rose the land in shadows lost its character and faded into gloom lights began to wink on ashore kydd lost sight of the tip of black head it was time to get under way it seemed so at odds with the lovely scene it should have been a time of serenity perhaps a promenade in the warmth of the evening hand in handhe thrust away the thoughts tysoe brought his treasured fighting sword he acknowledged curtly and fastened it on man th capstanquietly now the anchor broke ground and they ghosted out into the blackness the tension began to work on kydd but at the back of them was the thought that he so much needed this success for rosalynds sake the pirateprivateer captured as well as the smuggling chief it would secure his standing no matter what lockwood could contrive still absolute silence in th ship somewhere out there was the bloodiest foe on the coastor not if this was nothing but a wildgoose chase he would have job back in irons instantly sir andrews whispered urgently the midshipmans more acute hearing had picked up something kydd strainedthen heard a regular series of tiny wooden squeals precisely as if the yard on a lugger was being hoisted up the mast and the sound came from closer in to the land if this was the privateer he must have superlative knowledge of the coast they rippled on through the calm water trying hard to catch a betraying clue knowing bloody jacques would be keeping his own silence but if that was indeed yards being swayed up the pirate was hoisting sail to make his lunge a sudden thickening in the gloom to starboard was black headthe lugger was not there damn the blackness to hell from about a mile ahead kydd heard a sudden cry of alarm then a ragged chorus of shouts carried over the water followed by a pistol flash or two kydds heart leapt as he willed teazer on in an agony of impatience he heard more shots and the clamour of edged weapons rising then falling away it wasnt until long minutes later that they could see dark shapes on the water two close together kydds strategy had been simple he would close on the privateer fire and board in the smoke and surprise the one thing he was relying on in this risky attempt was that half of the enemy would be away subduing the smugglers on teazers deck the boarders were ready with bared steel standing next to the wheel kydd tried to make out the situation then he saw movement separation the larger vessel was detaching from the smaller there was a crythey had been seen a swivel gun banged uselessly at them into the night then a larger carriage gun was fired the vessels angular lugsails were sheeting round urgently to the light westerly but at this point of sailing a luggers ability to sail closer to the wind was of no advantage since it was boxed in to the land and teazer was no mean sailer on a wind as they drew nearer the shape foreshortened as it bore away south for the open sea the smaller was endeavouring to make sail as well but the smuggler could be dealt with later if it was still thereafter they had put paid to bloody jacques the wind freshened as they plunged south all to teazers favour exulted kydd for they were only a few hundred yards astern a conclusion was certain if it held or strengthened a little after midnight the moon rose its silver light picking out the lugger in pitiless detail teazer grew nearer and kydd realised that with a reduced crew his opponent had no scope for fast manoeuvre the dodman stood stern and massive in the moonlight when they forereached on the lugger if only rosalynd could be there kydd thoughtbut this was his world not hers she would take no pleasure in seeing him about to hazard his life it cooled his battlefever from now on he realised he had to consider two not one but had not her last words to him been you must always do your duty stand by forrard he roared the carronades were loaded with alternate ball and canister there could be no reloading in this dark teazers bowsprit inched past the luggers stern beside him standish was watching his hand working unconsciously at the hilt of his sword fire a split second later a twentyfourpounder carronade blasted its gunflash overbright in the gloom at thirty yards range there was no missing and in the moonlight leaping splinters could be seen as the ball struck home we have him damme standish yelled in glee if they could do their work before the dodman and the open atlanticbut then without warning it all changed there were frightened shouts in the lugger and it sheered up into the wind sails banging and ropes all afly then the yards began to drop it made no sense standish looked at him sir i do believe he wants to yield it was impossible but the lugger had doused all sail and lay submissively to await her conqueror board an bring that rogue before me mr standish kydd ordered his lieutenant returned quickly sir im so sorry to tell you but this is the smuggler the other the privateer many smuggling craft were luggerrigged as well and often of sizeable proportions in the heat of the moment kydd had forgotten thisand he had lost bloody jacques my commiserations on the events of the night said job smoothly not at all disobliged to be summoned before his captor at such an hour t damnation with that do you check yr book an tell me where theres t be another landing hell want t satisfy his crew after tonight ill believe kydd handed over the heavy tome job adjusted his spectacles why theres a landing tomorrow at portloe around the dodman only so well be there as well kydd said with satisfaction job looked up with a small smile and at the same time anotherat praa sands it would be impossible to watch two separated locations at the same time seems t me youre in a fine way o business so many cargoes t land kydd growled not so much mr kydd job came back these few days of the month are the choicest for running goods a smugglers moon one that does not rise until the work is done and with a good flood tide to bear it ashore kydd made up his mind praa sands is nearly up with falmouth ill choose yr portloe as is now so convenient fr the scrovy dog overcast with the same westerly veering north it was a perfect night for free trading in veryan bay and thus portloe but there seemed nothing close to the little port that would serve to conceal a predator the jagged hump of gull rock to the south probably being too rockgirt to lie close to they tried their best but their long and stealthy creep from seaward was in vain with not a sight of their prey either they had chosen wrongly or after his recent experience the privateer was more than usually vigilant and had slunk away and it seemed there were no more landings in prospect their alternatives were now few the scent run cold job was summoned once more there was just one question kydd wanted answered if bloody jacques is not a frenchy as y say then tell me this wheres he get his ship refitted after a fight wheres he get his stores an such an what im asking is he must have a base where is it then a fair question job said since guernsey wont have him hes taken to seizing whatever he wants from small fisher villages simply appears at dawn sends a band of ruffians to affright the people and takes a house while his men do disport aboard go on kydd said grimly he chooses carefullyonly those villages far from others with poor roads out so hes no worry of the alarm being raised quickly and a sheltered anchorage for his vessel stays for only a day or two then disappears again it was getting to be near impossible to lay the pirate alee but kydd was resolved to put an end to him he dismissed job and sat down to think he had now come up with bloody jacques twice and had always found him a cool and reasoned opponent the violence and cruelty in no way prevented him being an able resolute seaman and enemy so what the devil would he do now lie low out of the way and wait for teazer to tire of the chase where beyond her normal patrol limitnot to the east and the old wellserved and prosperous ports but to the rugged and remote west beyond falmouth and even penzanceto the very end of all england lands end where he had given kydd the slip so easily before or perhaps further beyond the chart gave few details of the region for its wild majesty was of no interest to seafarers who feared the ironbound coast he peered closerno ports to speak of he remembered the precipitous cliffs the dark menace of subsea rocky ledges and the rolling waters of the atlantic meeting stern headlands further round was cape cornwall with offshore banks and shoals aplenty but before that a long beach was marked surely the fisherfolk had a village somewhere along it they had and it was called sennen cove round the coast from lands end it was tucked into the end of the beach under high cliffs and guarded from sea intruders on one side by the sprawling cowloe reef and on the other an easy escape to the north with these westerlies the nearest authority of any kind was miles away over scrubland ideal in fact for such a one as bloody jacques in some way kydd was sure that this was the placehe could feel it and this time there would be no mistake he could crowd on sail and bring teazer round the headland then fall on the privateer but what if they were seen by a lookout atop the cliffs and bloody jacques slipped to sea again it couldnt be risked a night attack problematic and there was the hideous danger of the cowloe reef in darkness boats swarming round the point just one gun in the lugger would cause horrific casualties before they could close and in any case they would find themselves hopelessly outnumbered this needed thoughtthe kind that was generally sparked when he and renzi talked together but renzi was not available he would have to find a plan on his own it was something job had said bloody jacques practice was to go ashore and take a house that was the answer kydd knew he could not simply sail in and send a boat ashore with the lugger crew looking on but there was another way and he set teazer after her quarry as long as the weather held if there was even a slight heave one of the more common atlantic swells rolling lazily in it would be impossible on this day mercifully there wasnt and mere waves would not worry them with teazer safely at anchor bare yards south of the extreme tip of lands end her cutter pulled away by the last light of day with as many men as it could hold those at the oars cramped and swearing but it was less than a mile they had to pull close in with the rearing crags gulls rising in screaming clouds at their intrusion they stroked northward with wicked rock formations standing out into the sea from the precipitous heights kydds eyes were scanning urgently before it got dark he had to find a place on this utterly rockbound coast to land and discover a means of ascending the cliffs no one but a madman would think to land here at the base of the rockface all along the shore there was a narrow ledge of tumbled boulders and searounded stones washed white by the slight seas they proceeded just off the line of breaking waves the cliffs prettily redtinted by the setting sun with occasional deep shadowed caves and natural archways the pungent smell of rotting seaweed wafting out then he saw it a deep cleft between two bluffs hold water kydd said in a low voice while the boat rocked he examined it as closely as he could it was probably eroded by water runoff from above and therefore a possible way up bringing the cutter about he took it as close as he dared to the shore with little swell there was no real danger of the boat rising and falling on to the rocks waiting under it he splashed over the side into the water and stumbled ashore over the mass of stony boulders towards the cleft it was in the sunsets shadow but nearer to it he could see that even though it was choked in places with loose stones it wound up steeply out of sight and as far as he could tell to the top it would do he brought his men ashore and sent the boat back there was nothing more to do but wait for the dawn shivering stiff and conscious that he had spent a night under the stars on unyielding stones kydd awoke others stirred nearby it was calm and with a slight mist impatiently kydd waited for the light to improve so they could make a move but when they did reach sennen cove would bloody jacques be there ill be first mr stirk kydd called quietly looking back over his men as he hurried past they were not many but he was relying on the likelihood that only a few would be trusted ashore from the privateer if any words were to be said now was the time but kydd could find none in the face of what they were about to do lets finish th job he said and began to climb it was hard going a scramble on loose pebbles and dust then hardedged rocky shards they heaved themselves up like topmen shifting hand or foot only when the others had good purchase all the time the light strengthened allowing them to see the appalling drop that was opening beneath them to the sea below then the cleft angled to the left and shallowed the going was easier and almost before they knew it the slope gentled and the ground levelled out kydd moved cautiously there was every reason for bloody jacques to post a lookout here there was a view both to lands end on the one side and the broad sweep of beach on the other and there was indeed a sentry he was sitting on a ledge of rock gazing out to sea a clay pipe going peacefullywith a musket across his knees kydd dropped to the ground the man had to be silenced the musket would sound the alarm but in a paradoxical way kydd was comforted this was proof that he was right bloody jacques was here stirk slithered up next to him mr kydd he whispered hoarsely gesturing to himself and then to the lookout kydd nodded and stirk scrambled to his feet he stood swaying for a moment his hands clamped piteously to his head as though it were about to burst then fell to his knees there was a shout from the man but stirk shook his head and crawled further then stopped to dryretch into the dust the lookout shouted again thinking him another of his crew betwaddled after a riotous night he put down his musket and came over irritably stirk exploded into life barrelling into the unfortunate man and with a snarl lofting him over his shoulder the sentry crashed on to the edge of the cliff his fingers scrabbling hopelessly and slithered over with a despairing cry now they had only to cross a quartermile of barren heathland then descend into sennen cove they hurried along silently and emerged on to the bluffs overlooking the neat little village and the beach there nestling within the flat blackness of the reef was the threemasted lugger they had sought for so long there was no earlymorning activity aboard and indeed none in the village from what could be seen if bloody jacques was in a cottage which one was he still aboard his luggerand preparing to sail a track led at an angle to the side which soon wound into thick concealing furze kydd plunged down surprise was their only advantage they did not carry muskets which would have hindered them on the climb and pistols in the belt could well work loose and drop they were going into the attack armed only with bare steel it seemed impossible that their awkward skidding haste down the track had not been heard in the huddle of cottages just below but kydd could detect no alarm should they risk everything on a mad dash to the centre of the village or keep out of sight of the lugger and search the houses one by one as they came upon the first dwelling he could see that this was no longer an alternative there were men untidily asleep on the sand others no doubt elsewhere should he spread out his own men in a search or keep them defensively together stay with me he hissed and stalked out into the narrow street sword in handhis precious fighting blade which had been at his side on countless occasions of peril a fierce comfort standing foursquare his men behind him he bellowed bloody jacques i have ye now come out an yield yself to me his voice echoed off the silent buildings commander kydd in th kings name surrender yself there were tiny movements at the windows of some cottages shouts rose from the beach how many were there we have ye surrounded y villain come out an show yself sirth lugger shes gettin a boat wi men ashore they would soon be overwhelmed kydds men could barely hold their own against those who had come up from the beach y last chance afore i come in an tear ye from y bedmick haws behind him a door crashed open and kydd wheeled round with an animal roar a giant of a man in shirt and breeches threw himself towards him a monster claymore in his fist kydd braced himself his sword at point the claymore came down in a mighty sweep meeting kydds blade with a jarring smash numbing his arm but he was not intimidated such a heavy weapon was unwieldy and slowthe fight would be over soon however it had been a blindbloody jacques held a smaller blade in his other hand which swept round in a savage thrust to kydds groin he parried awkwardly the action bringing them close and caught the other mans rank stench he became aware that the fighting round him had become general clashes of weapons cries of pain but he dared not lose concentration he tried to turn his parry to a tierce but it was savagely deflected more sounds of fighting blade on blade pistol shots kydd felt his opponents desperation but what if the lugger crew reached them before however calloway had kept a cool head and when bloody jacques had been flushed out he had done his duty with a sudden hiss and whoosh kydd heard their signal rocket soar skyward there was a groan of pain more shrieks from his men it was only the fine balance and superbly tempered steel of his weapon that enabled him to withstand the savage battering that followed the demented onslaught with which bloody jacques was trying to overwhelm him but suddenly the tide seemed to have turned cheers and jeering broke out strengthening as the sounds of battle diminished clearly the privateersmen had realised the significance of the rocketthat a kings ship was in the vicinity they were throwing down their weapons which no doubt were swiftly snatched up by kydds men if yed stand clear sir kydd could not afford to take his eye from his opponent but he knew what stirk intended to do however a musket ball to the throat was too easy an end for this man belay that he called breathlessly between blows hes t pay at thend of a rope that goaded bloody jacques into a furious reckless assault that sent kydd stumbling then falling fulllength backwards in an instant the man threw himself forward but kydd had sensed this coming and thrust out with his foot bloody jacques fell squarely on to kydds waiting blade it was all over in seconds kydd drew himself to his feet and looked around breathlessly in the mêlée the men of teazer had suffered lightly bloody jacques and several of the privateersmen lay still the others huddled together in meek submission well mr job and as youve been of such rousin assistance to us im sure that ah mr kydd ive been meaning to talk with you about this you seeand please forgive if im brief in the article of explanationsthere may be reasons why it should be more expedient for you to set me at liberty as it were kydd slumped back amazed at the mans effrontery pray why should i do that he said im sure this will go no further mr kydd then i should inform you that my business interests are nearand far if youre thinkin t offer me sir i shall speak more clearly in my trading ventures smugglin job allowed a pained expression to appear in which it is plain i have made my mark and thereby gained the respect and trust of many disparate parties which necessarily includes the french authorities it would appear that his majestys government has found me of some utility in actions of a clandestine nature these might include the passing of agents and others into and out of france in the character of smuggling crewdo not i beg press me for details go on i cannot go further apart from suggesting that your admiral in the strictest confidence consults a mr congalton at the foreign office as to whether in fact it is a good idea that i be taken up as a common smuggler if i am unsupported i may of course be instantly taken and cast into prison his confident smile implied there was little danger of that and dare i mention it sir your reputation with your admiral afterwards will be as high as if this were public knowledge to put before lockwood that not only had he laid hold of the smugglerinchief but that he was privy to secrets at the highest level would be sweet indeed ill need y word on it you have it commander then ill take ye back to polperro while we check th details kydd chuckled drily i may be wrong in th particulars but i have th feeling that this day i may have destroyed bloody jacques but ive also got rid of a business competitor for ye renzi sat in the boat next to kydd on the other side job was serene and confident renzi had agreed to come to polperro only because kydd was in such fine spirits and had begged that he pay his respects to rosalynd he did not dislike the girl it was not her fault that kydd had been so hopelessly lovestruck it was simply such a waste and one that so obviously kydd would come later to regret they reached the fish quay renzi stood back while kydd helped job up and sent him on his way lay off an wait kydd ordered the boats crew and with a broad smile added we wont stay nicholas dont y worry they stepped off briskly for the landaviddy path instinctively renzi felt uneasy it was peculiar that so few people were about they walked on and even the few seemed to be scurrying off did they think kydd was looking for someone else a fisherwoman stopped a set expression on her lined face then she turned and hurried away it was deeply unsettling in a low voice renzi said theressomething afoot i dont know kydd looked about with a frown wheres th people they were both unarmed should they return immediately to the boat had there been a french landing it could be anything then there was movement down the path titusbilly whats happenin y rascal called kydd the lad approached unwillingly his face white and strained kydd stiffened somethings happened he said something bad he added with a catch in his voice and forced the lad to look at him shes gone mr kydd kydd froze rigid wewe buried her yesterday for long seconds kydd held still then he stepped back his face a distorted mask no no tell me iim ssorry no it cant he turned this way and that as though trying to escape and an inhuman howl finally erupted no noooo dear god in heaven why the sexton was at the church gate he gestured across the graveyard to the freshly turned earth kydd stumbled there blindly and dropped to his knees at the graveside damnedest thing the sexton confided to renzi in a low voice on passage to plymouth for t get her weddin riga fine day an out of nowhere comes this black squall an they overset over in minutes it were renzi did not reply he was watching kydd and as his shoulders began to shake he knew that the man was as alone in the world as he had been when they had first met a desperately unhappy pressed man in the old duke william and now he needed his friend without a word he went to him authors note as i began to gather my thoughts for the authors note for this my eighth book i could not help but think how lucky i am to have tom kydd because of him and his wonderful world of the sailing manowar so many aspects of my life have been enhanced becoming an author has meant that i have met people from many walks of life all over the worldcertainly in my previous profession as a computer software designer it would have been unlikely for our paths to have crossed there are far too many new friends and acquaintances directly attributable to thomas kydd to acknowledge here but i know im enriched by them all then there is the location research each january for the upcoming book this has taken me to locales ranging from the caribbean to gibraltar and further i visit each country with the specific goal of stripping away the trappings of modern life and building up a picture of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centurythe particular sights smells colour the food ways of life there in general some places still retain much of what kydd would have seen in others it is more difficult to peel away the layersbut that is the challenge to my surprise i realise that this is the first book set in home watersi hope ive been able to do justice to what ive found to be as wild and exotic a location as any and with spectacles then such as the incredible complex of the plymouth naval base and dockyard certainly in those prefactory times it was the wonder of the age employing many thousands of men when most industries counted their workers in scores no one in england lives far from the sea and a strong and abiding relationship with neptunes realm is a national characteristic but it is perhaps in the west country where the maritime heritage is strongest since time immemorial the sea provided food and transport links between isolated communities and with hundreds of miles of rocky coastline and winter storms equal to any it has also been the graveyard of so many ships as usual i owe a debt of gratitude to the many people i consulted in the process of writing this book probably foremost among these is my lifes partner kathy as well as her professional input at all stages of the books she functions as a reality manager keeping the trials of everyday life at bay and enabling me to immerse myself in my research and writing space precludes mentioning everyone but i would particularly like to convey special thanks to the people of the picturesque fishing village of polperro in cornwall notably exfisherman bill cowan former harbourmaster tony white and historian jeremy johns i was honoured when the trustees opened the polperro museum especially so that i could view the wonderfully intricate models of local fishing vessels under sail crafted by shipwright ron butters my thanks too to richard fisher who organised a special tour over stonehouse royal marine barracks the long room where kydd attended the ball still stands tall within the complex and lastly as always i must acknowledge the contributions of my literary agent carole blake marine artist geoff hunt rsma editorial director jackie swiftand all the team at mcbooks press long may kydds voyages continue
