wounds of honour anthony riches preface november ad a brisk autumnal breeze stirred the leaves lining the forest floor the sharp gust lifting a handful of discarded foliage into a brief dancing spiral before leaving it to flutter its way back to the ground padding softly over the shadowdappled ground a small hunting party advanced slowly out of the forests gloom with spears held ready to throw the men stepped with deliberate care each foot lifted slowly and placed back on to the leafy carpet with smooth delicacy their movements were unconsciously coordinated each man obviously familiar with his fellows actions from long practice calgus tribal leader of the selgovae and undisputed ruler of the free northern tribes was doing what he usually did to relax when he wasnt roaming the lands north of the roman wall pushing forward his preparations for the coming war accompanied by his fiveman bodyguard calgus was hunting wild boar while his rule of the land to the north of the roman wall that split britannia into two halves was absolute by right of both blood and simple domination of the other tribal leaders the presence of his closest protectors was an obvious necessity with a brooding imperial presence barely fifty miles to the south it was prudent to assume the worst even in something as simple as a days hunting the pigs seem to have our scent my lord either that or something else has put them to fright the speaker spat his disgust into the leaves another man stepping softly across the leafy ground beyond him nodded keeping his eyes fixed to their front aye if this carries on well be reduced to roasting hedgehogs calgus chuckled softly hefting his spear as if rediscovering its balance you know the rules fael we eat only what we kill in open hunt if you want to put meat on the fire this evening then keep your wits about you and your spear ready to throw you might offer a prayer to cocidius while youre at it pray for a big stag to wander our way and you caes for all that the local animal population isnt jumping on to your pigsticker you wouldnt want to be anywhere else on a fine crisp day like this now would you caes grimaced making a stabbing motion with his spear to emphasise his point id rather be hunting romans my lord fael smiled across at calgus raising his eyebrows into his here we go again face they were used to the bodyguards bloodthirsty hatred of their former overlords calgus winked at him before speaking taking his eyes off the surrounding forest for a moment yes caes as you never tire of telling us when we finally get the tribes to go to war with them ill free you from this tiresome duty and put you in the front rank of the warband give you the chance to swing an axe with the other champions and caes turning to reply with a wry smile lurched backwards with the sudden impact of a hunting arrow which punched its vicious barbediron head into his chest with a sound like a spear driven hard into a boars ribs he stared down stupidly at the arrows protruding shaft for a moment before dropping first to his knees then on to all fours beyond him fael toppled backwards into the leaves with an arrow through his throat a bright fan of blood spraying across the forest floor calgus turned back to his front and hefted his spear aware that he was hugely vulnerable whether he fought or ran the hidden archers loosed another pair of arrows into the men to his left while the remaining bodyguards were still looking for targets for their own spears his last companion fell as he bounded forward to defend his king his spear arcing uselessly into the trees in a last desperate throw as he went down with a pair of arrows in his chest the king waited for a long moment for his turn to come bracing for the arrows impact but none came thrusting his spear defiantly into the soft earth he drew his sword the scrape of metal loud in the sudden silence he called out into the forests deadening gloom lifting the weapon into a fighting stance come on then lets get this done sword spear or bow it makes no difference to me i can go to meet cocidius knowing that whoever you are however far you run my people will hunt you down and gut you slowly for what you do today after another moments silence with the only sound his own harsh breathing figures broke from the cover of the forests scrubby bushes four men stood two slinging bows across their backs and drawing swords two carrying spears ready to throw the latter advanced to within easy throwing range and halted keeping him under constant threat while the other two men followed with more leisure one of them his face obscured by a deep hood spoke out while the other a blackbearded athlete with a long sword at his belt stood impassively beside him so calgus it seems that we have you at something of a disadvantage his latin was cultured almost urbane the briton laughed disturbingly relaxed in the face of levelled spears so roman youve come to talk and there i was bracing myself for your blade the hooded figure nodded slowly oh yes youre just as the stories tell ive just slaughtered your bodyguard well most of them he pointed to caes still helpless on hands and knees a thin line of bloody drool trickling from his mouth finish that one his companion flashed out his blade and stepped forward stabbing down into the helpless britons exposed neck then stepped back with the sword held ready calgus stood completely still watching the act impassively the hooded man spoke again better and yet there you stand as relaxed as if we were your oldest friends and not foreign assassins with your life at the points of our spears and your brother warriors dead at our hands well calgus for all your obviously genuine bravado whether you live or die is as yet not clear not even to me a word to my rather roughedged colleague here will have your guts steaming in the leaves without very much thought and certainly without any remorse at all you can be a problem removed for rome in the blink of an eye or an ally for one particular roman over the next few months choose the former and youll end your days here with minimal honour and no dignity choose the latter and youll stand to win a prize beyond that of any king of this land over the last hundred years the briton narrowed his eyes seeking to discern the truth in his ambushers eyes what prize an eagle calgus an imperial legions standard and quite possibly the head of that legions commander to boot so king of free britannia are you minded to discuss a bargain with me or would you rather negotiate with this barbarians blade you seem to leave me without much of a choice what token do i have of your sincerity if this is a deal to be made at the point of your sword and how do you know ill keep it the hooded man nodded to his companion who struck at the nearest of the spearmen with unexpected speed and dropped him into the leaves with his throat opened then reversed his sword and ducked under the others spearthrust he punched his blades point through the mans ribs with one powerful thrust then twisted the sword quickly and ripped it free the open wound spraying blood across his booted feet as the man fell helplessly to the forest floor and started to bleed out youll be needing some sign of your victorious struggle with your wouldbe assassins if your people arent to smell a rat i trust you can spin a colourful yarn to explain how you cheated your killers and i know youll keep the bargain if you make it the inducements im offering are too strong for you to do anything else now make your mind up calgus shall we be partners in your longplanned war on my people calgus spat into the leaves for all the bad taste in my mouth i will entertain your scheme good now give me that flashy brooch thats holding your cloak closed dont worry youll see it again in another place calgus unpinned the brooch an intricately worked gold replica of a shield decorated with a swirling pattern a polished piece of amber in place of the shields metal boss dropping it on to the outstretched palm the hooded man turned away calling back a parting comment over his shoulder while his companion backed away beside him sheathing his sword and taking the bow from its place on his shoulder he nocked an arrow and lifted the bow in readiness to shoot deterring any thought of pursuit you will see me again calgus but not before you have your people in the field with death in their hearts the two men merged with the forests shaded depths and were lost to the kings eyes he stood staring after them for a long moment before turning back to his fallen companions death in their hearts roman that wont be hard to arrange februarius ad one of the front rank spotted them first a good three dozen men silhouetted against the afternoons bright skyline where the road rose to surmount a ridge that crossed their path in its long descent from the pennines eastern shoulder he shouted a warning in a voice made hoarse by urgency the small detachments commander a veteran watch officer with a face seamed by experience stopped in midstride and followed the mans pointing arm taking a moment to measure the depth of their predicament when the road had risen to its previous vantage points hed seen no other troops in front or behind them just the plodding mule cart theyd passed an hour ago now far behind them that many barbarians would make short work of his sixteen men and the legionaries heavy armour ruled out any chance that they could outpace their ambushers back down the road to the south dropping his pack on to the verge he drew his sword and pointed with it towards the distant enemy unless he kicked his dithering troops into activity quickly the tiny unit would shatter before the barbarians got within spearthrow piss buckets and shields form a line he kicked one of the nearest men in the backside to reinforce his point hard fucking move the legionaries shed their pack yokes at the roadside and fumbled to free shields slung across their backs with fingers turned numb by fear quickly forming a thin line across the road helmets previously hanging round their necks were slid over their heads the cheekpieces adding a muchneeded martial brutality to faces suddenly pale with terror the watch officer stalked out in front of them sword still drawn eyes on me on me the legionaries unwillingly dragged their gaze away from the advancing barbarians now streaming down the shallow slope a few hundred paces away dont worry you lot are so pretty compared to the local girls this bunch are probably looking for a shag rather than a fight one or two of them smiled wanly which was better than nothing and they fucked up by giving us time to get dressed up for the party so when i give the order throw your spears air your blades and get ready for them to hit your shields use your shields to throw them back dont leave the line they want you to fight alone outnumbered three to one or to run sos they can spear you in the dog blossom your best chance he slapped a man whose eyes had wandered back to the advancing britons on me your only chance is to stay in the line and keep parrying and thrusting like youve done a thousand times in drills they will give it up once they know we wont be a pushover i will be behind you and i will step in for the first man that falls spears ready stalking round to the lines rear he looked at the ground gauging from the number of spreading dark patches in the roads dust how many of his men had already lost control of their bladders there was enough piss steaming in the winters chill air that their ability even to wait in line for the barbarian charge was hanging in the balance they would all be dead inside of five minutes he realised mentally shrugging his shoulders and getting ready to give a decent account of himself the men that the detachment was escorting had dismounted from their horses the stocky veteran and his younger taller companion something of a mismatched pair bloody civilians at least they had a means of escape if youre going to ride for help this would be a good time the older man a legion veteran if the watch officer was guessing correctly simply smiled back green eyes twinkling out of a weatherbeaten face still ruddy despite the prospect of imminent death he was evidently in his late forties and from the quality of his clothing comfortably well off cloak pulled across his chest and draped across one shoulder in the military style while the younger civilian had accompanied the detachment since leaving the fortress at dark pool three days march to the south the older man had ridden into the small fort that had sheltered them the previous night arriving well after the suns setting his apparent lack of concern at the danger of meeting robbers on the road had caused more than a few raised eyebrows among the more experienced troops despite the chainmail vest beneath his cloak the short infantrypattern sword hanging at his waist and the purposeful way in which he conducted himself im rufius formerly an officer with the imperial sixth legion i never ran away from a fight in twentyfive years of service and i wont break that habit now besides well see this lot off easy enough the watch officer nodded slowly fair enough what about you the younger man shook his head grimly too tense for humour drawing a longbladed cavalry sword with a glimmer of polished iron the watch officer wondered just how much use that was going to be given that its owner seemed to be barely out of his teens his voice when he spoke was strong enough though without any hint of the quaver that might have been expected given the circumstances marcus marcus valerius aquila i wont be running away either the veteran soldier alongside him nodded approvingly unsheathing his sword and gestured to the legionaries line shall we the watch officer shrugged turning back to face the oncoming warband its your funeral stay with me youre now my reserve when a man goes down you go into the line in his place right detachment spears ready to throw wait for it the barbarians trot had become a run now closing the remaining distance between them quickly half a dozen of them were carrying axes great treecutting blades that would cleave a man down to his waist or lop off a limb armour or no armour they were close enough for details to stand out now limewashed hair standing stiff from their heads blue patterns swirling across their faces and jewellery flashing brightly in the afternoons pale sun close enough for their harsh battle cries to raise his neck hairs this was no chance encounter but a tribal warband dressed and tooled up for a fight probably fired up by the local beer too eyes wide and teeth bared in snarls of eager anticipation the detachments line shivered more than one man starting to shrink backwards at the prospect of imminent brutal death before their collective breaking point was reached the veteran stepped up to their rear dimpling the skin of the rearmost mans neck with the point of his sword he spoke in a matteroffact tone loudly enough for the detachment to hear him above the growing din of the approaching barbarians back in line sonny or those bluenosed bastards wont get the chance to do you more than one man looked round at him wide eyed while the legionary in question inched forward again one or two of the older salts the men that already knew and with grim resignation accepted that their lives were about to become short and interesting whether they fought or ran smiled in quiet recognition and raised their shields slightly in unconscious reaction to the voice of command the watch officer nodded his head with respect keeping his eyes on the charging barbarians and raising his voice to be heard above their harsh cries wait for it spears as the watch officer opened his mouth to order the spears thrown in the last seconds before the britons would career into the flimsy shield wall a sudden flurry of movement at the forest edge fifty paces to their left caught his eye he snapped his attention back to the more urgent events happening less than twenty paces from his mens shields throw throw the legionaries hurled their spears into the oncoming mass of men dropping two of them in screaming heaps and dragging down the shields of half a dozen others then drew their swords and braced to receive the charge with a clash of metal on steel the barbarians rush collided with his mens defence sheer weight of numbers forced the line back half a dozen steps before the desperate legionaries managed to absorb the momentum only the slight slope favouring their defence had saved them from being overwhelmed by the impact the watch officer estimated he stepped back behind them to keep his position watching with amazement as armoured men started to emerge from the trees behind their attackers the initial screaming and shouting of the charge and contact had died away and both sides fought in almost total silence broken only by the rasp of laboured breathing and the occasional grunt of exertion or scream of pain to his front a man staggered dying out of the line a twostepper if ever hed seen one his throat ripped out in a fountain of hot blood whose coppery stink filled his nostrils the men to either side of the sudden gap in the line inched together unable to properly fill the dying mans empty place as the casualty sprawled full length on the roads cobbled surface twitching out his life in a quickly spreading pool of his own blood rufius shouldered his younger companion aside grabbed the fallen shield and stepped into his place battering aside a vicious axe blow with the shield he stepped forward with a speed and grace that belied his grey hair to gut its owner with a swift twisting stab of his short sword as the tribesman struggled to regain his balance clutching at his steaming entrails the barbarian fell to his knees staring with horror at the horrific wound with a rising wail of distress another of the small detachment went down an axe buried deep in his shoulder while its bluepainted owner wrestled frantically with the handle trying to prise the blade free in a second marcus valerius aquila was in the gap stooping to grab the fallen mans infantry sword with his left hand even as he slid the cavalry sword up beneath the axemans ribs in a perfect killing thrust getting a face full of blood as the price for his successful attack chopping away a spearthrust from his left with the borrowed weapon he swiftly kicked the dying barbarian off his sword using the freed blade to hack off the spearmans hand at the wrist before turning his wrist over to swing the long sword backhanded and neatly sever the head of another attacker on his right stepping back into the line to regain his balance the borrowed infantry sword held forward in his left hand the longer sword held farther back to level the points of the two weapons he paused for a moment breathing hard with the sudden effort his eyes wide with the shock of combat but still seeking new targets the barbarians closest to him edged cautiously back from the fight almost comically wary of the sudden threat from the twin blades from the rear of the warband a guttural voice shouted harshly in broken british over the clash of steel a sword pointing at the retired officers place in the line kill officer kill him distracted from his openmouthed appraisal of marcuss swordplay by movement in the periphery of his vision the watch officer found his attention dragged back to the detachments left where the newcomers from the forest were advancing quickly to combat the barbarian flank and rear the ten men ran quickly to within a dozen paces threw their spears into the unsuspecting enemys rear then drew their swords and screaming bloodlust went to work on their unprotected backs seizing his fleeting chance with both hands as the tribesmen closer to his men started looking back over their shoulders in bewilderment at the screams from their dying comrades the watch officer gave the only command possible counterattack boards and swords punch and thrust get into them you dozy bastards the response was almost uncomprehending the product of a thousand mindless practice drills the legionaries punched hard with the bosses of their shields at the britons faces then stepped forward a pace with a collective thrust of their short swords two of the distracted tribesmen went down screaming while several others edged back allowing the line time and room to repeat the attack the warbands leader turned to face their new assailants spearing one of them with a powerful throw drew his sword and roared defiance as he advanced into their line a massive soldier with a crested helmet stepped out to meet him slapping the swordthrust aside with an almost casual flick of his shield before lunging his own weapon deep into the barbarians chest in one swift flowing movement twisting it to free the blade as he brutally stamped the dying man off its length a lone tribesman turned and ran at the sight joined a second later by another like the gradual collapse of an overloaded dyke another two ran after them then five at which point the remainder simply turned and fled they left a dozen dead and dying men on the ground the surviving romans half of the legionaries sporting a wound of some kind or other leant breathless on their shields and watched them run happy enough to let their enemy escape unhindered when a minute before they had been facing impending death the watch officer walked across to the newcomers followed at a discreet distance by rufius while marcus dropped the infantry sword beside its dead owner and wiped the drying blood from his own weapon suddenly exhausted the other detachments leader a darkbearded athlete of a man with the horsehair crest of a chosen man on his helmet was staring after the retreating warband with a look that seemed to combine disgust and regret whoever you lads are you have the thanks of the sixth legion if you hadnt come out of the trees we were dead meat you must have balls the size of apples to do what you just did with the watch officers flow of gratitude dried up as he realised that the other man wasnt paying him any attention but was still watching the retreating britons after a moment the chosen man spoke flicking indifferent eyes over the legionaries youd better tell your officers to stop sending anything smaller than a full century up the road to yew grove next time you wont be so lucky he turned to his own men take heads then get ready to leave well march to the fortress in company with this lot you two you didnt kill anyone that i saw so you can make a sling to carry hadrun up to the fort well put him underground somewhere he cant be dug up again rufius caught his arm stepping back with open palms as the heavyframed man swung back to face him with an angry look no offence chosen but were only trying to thank you for what you did most men in your position would have given serious thought to letting us get on with things on our own marcus overcame his momentary exhaustion to raise his head and study the other detachments leader and his troops carefully in the moments silence that followed intrigued by his first sight of native troops in the field they wore chain mail unlike the plate armour protecting the legionaries and their weapons and clothing seemed of a lower quality he noted nevertheless the same hardedged efficiency in their movements the same lean wiriness like their legion colleagues these were men that had learnt the hard way not to waste energy on nonessentials the chosen mans eyes narrowed his face expressionless were tungrians grandfather and we were doing our duty nothing more nothing less we were moving quietly through the forest and found that lot waiting by the road before they saw us after that it was only a matter of pulling back and waiting for someone to come along when we saw the size of your party it was obvious that we would have to help you out although i doubt it was worth the loss of one of my men rufius smiled crookedly at the bald statement i understand better than you might imagine and nevertheless from one fighting man to another you have my respect he turned away clapping an arm round the watch officers shoulder and as for you my friend id call that a nice little action ill be sure to mention your name to my friends in the camp see if we cant get you a brush for the top of your piss bucket for now wed better get the wounded sorted out and then push on to the grove dont you think sorting the wounded out was easy enough despite the only bandage carrier in the party having lost three fingers of his right hand to a barbarian sword which made him of use only in directing treatment rather than providing it two men were dead the twostepper and the axe victim the latter with the huge blade still embedded deep in his upper chest they were stripped of their weapons armour and boots and hidden from casual view in the trees to await collection by cart the next day the tungrians meanwhile with pointed remarks about leaving no man behind on a battlefield ostentatiously rigged a sling with which to carry their own casualty away with them of the remaining troops three were incapable of walking but by putting the lighter two on one of the civilians horses and one with a nastylooking axe wound on the other they were able to resume their march the barbarian wounded were finished off without ceremony by the watch officer his swift economical swordthrusts removing any chance of their survival at length marcus and rufius fell in behind their legionary protectors for the remaining march while the tungrians several with freshly decapitated heads dangling jauntily from pack yokes by their knotted hair in turn fell in behind them marcus coughed politely and turned his face to rufiuss after a moments march he was tall overtopping the veteran by a full head slightly stringy in build but with the sinewy promise of muscle to come yes my friend id be grateful to better understand a thing or two if youd be willing to talk something in the younger mans voice made rufius look at him properly the taut line of the young mans jaw muscles betraying the fact that he was still dealing with the aftermath of the skirmish mars forgive me but im an unfeeling old bastard this was your first proper fight the younger man nodded tautly gods below how quickly the habits of command leave a man i always made a point of grabbing the firsttimers after a fight to humour or slap them out of their shock at tasting another mans blood on their lips for the first time and to congratulate them for surviving with the right number of arms and legs although i am forced to point out that for a firsttimer you did better than just survive you made a mess of more than one of our attackers without even the benefit of a shield for protection those skills wont have come easily above his smile he raised an interrogatory eyebrow noting that the younger mans jaw relaxed a fraction you can tell me more about your prowess with two swords later i believe you had a question i was wondering why these other soldiers didnt take all of the barbarian heads if thats the local custom the veteran glanced back at the auxiliary troops behind them the tungrians when you know more about the local troops youll understand better legions get moved around they stay in one place for a year or even ten but they always move on again theres always a campaign that needs another legion a frontier to be shored up or just some idiot with a purple stripe on his tunic who wants to be emperor that means that the legions never stay anywhere long enough to settle into the local traditions so its judaea one year germania the next besides serving in a legion is like being a priest for a particularly jealous god complicated rites special sacrifices and offerings your own way of doing things in a legion the senior officers the camp prefect and the senior centurions they make sure that their way of doing things always comes first auxiliaries though they stay put where theyve been based for the most part unless theres a major campaign on and even then theyll usually come back home again they put down roots soak up the local lore start worshipping local gods basically they go native now those lads they were originally recruited in tungria across the sea but theyve been here on the wall since it was built sixty years ago more or less so now theres no real tungrians just a lot of their grandsons mixed in with the local lads they take heads because thats local tradition too but they also have a code of honour that would shame a sixbadge centurion and they dont ever take the head of a man they havent fought and killed face to face anyway enough about the tungrians im sure youll learn all about them in due course tell me what brings you to the forsaken northern wastes of this cold wet pisspot of a country he looked calculatingly at the younger man as if assessing him properly for the first time despite the fact that they had ridden side by side for half the day albeit mostly in silence brown eyes black hair a nice suntan id say you were roman born and bred and yet here you are in britannia getting cold wet and bloody with the rest of us your name again marcus valerius aquila and yours quintus tiberius rufius once a soldier now simply a supplier of fine food and superiorquality equipment to the northern command soon enough youll be chewing on an especially nasty piece of salted pork and thinking to yourself jupiter i wish i had a jar of rufiuss spicy fish pickle in front of me right now anyway now were introduced he raised a questioning eyebrow the younger man shrugged in apparent selfdeprecation theres not much to tell in all truth im travelling to yew grove to join the sixth legion for my period of military service rufius smiled wryly exciting stuff for a man of your age id imagine cut free from the tedium of your life at home to travel across the empire to the edge of civilisation and the chance to serve with the best legion in the army to boot youll look back on these as the best days of your life i can promise you that much im sure youre right what i know for a fact right now is how much im looking forward to my first proper bath since we left dark pool this country has altogether too much rain for my liking and the wind chills the bones no matter how a man wraps his cloak rufius nodded no one knows that better than i twentyfive years i humped up and down this damp armpit of a country in the service of the emperor getting wet and freezing cold living in draughty barracks and kicking disgruntled native recruits into shape for the legion i should mention that i served with the sixth second cohort first century the younger man inclined his head respectfully first century you were the cohorts first spear i was they were the happiest four years of my life all things considered i had six hundred spears under my command and absolutely no one to stop me turning them into the best troops in the whole of this miserable country i was master of my chosen trade and no one got in my way no tribune or quartermaster had the balls to disagree with me thats the truth he tapped the younger man on the shoulder to reinforce his point but let me warn you this country grows on a man like fungus on a tree slowly stealthily until suddenly you cant imagine life anywhere else i had the chance to head back home when my term was up but i just couldnt see the point of having to adapt to a place without a perpetual covering of cloud and a population of bluepainted savages this place has become my home and if youre here long enough itll be the same with you perhaps your family has a history of service hereabouts my father has rufius raised an eyebrow smiling connections history in this part of the world my grandfather commanded the legion for three years before he came back to rome and my father was a broad stripe tribune on the sixths staff military service runs in the family all the way back to the republic although my father wasnt really a military man even by his own admission and much to my grandfathers disappointment hes a man of words not action mind you ive heard that he can reduce a man to silence without even raising his voice when he speaks on the floor of the senate i wish i had the same eloquence rufius nodded sagely two senior officers in the family and both of them served with the best legion in the empire youre a young man of even greater privilege than was at first apparent which reminds me yes i caught a glimpse or two of you back there in between fighting off pissedup barbarians who were convinced i was still under the eagle im still curious as to where you learned to throw your blade around like that marcus blushed slightly when it was decided that i would serve with the sixth almost before i can remember my father decided to make sure i wouldnt make a fool of myself with a sword in my hand he paid a freed gladiator to teach me a few things rufius gave him a sardonic look a few things eh well new friend if we get any time to spare in yew grove you can teach me one or two of your few things just over an hour later they marched through the fortresss town across the river bridge and stopped in front of the massive main gate standing to one side to allow the wounded to be lifted groaning from their horses tiberius rufius exchanged a few words with the gate guard then took marcus firmly by the arm you cant report to the legatus yet hes out on manoeuvres with part of the legion why dont we sort the horses out then visit the bathhouse get a decent meal and see how much the local food has improved since i was last here on me as celebration of our survival this afternoon well stay in an inn owned by an old friend of mine like me discharged and unable to leave the place after so many years he joined all the other poor bastards that have taken root here for want of anywhere better to be and now he runs the best guest house in the yew grove vicus he smiled easily with the memory petronius ennius was standardbearer of the second cohort when i was first spear built like a fortress latrine just like most statuewavers we made a fine pair when we could work a leave pass at the same time had the women squirming in their seats when we passed by i get the time to stay in his inn all too rarely these days come on lets go and get the blood washed off these chariotpullers and see theyre fed and watered i feel the sudden need for a bath and a drink the innkeeper greeted rufius warmly clapping him on the back with a hand the size of a dinner plate back already tiberius rufius only a few days ago you were telling me that the quality of my wine was only fit for removing rust from armour now you cant stay away from the place although i can see from the state of your tunic that someones upset you recently well then whats the story he listened intently to rufiuss retelling of the ambush laughing quietly when his friend recounted having to threaten the sixths legionaries to keep them in line nothing changes does it i remember you having to do much the same thing to keep one or two of our weakerkneed sisters in their places when the bluenoses had their last little revolt at the end of the story he pursed his lips whistling to show his appreciation of their escape you were lucky old friend very lucky if that tent party of auxiliaries hadnt chanced on you rufius nodded sagely a dark look in his eye i know we were carrion mind you if that was good fortune i still wonder just what chance put those tribesmen in our path yes well enough of your boasting you havent introduced me to your bloodstained young friend this is marcus valerius aquila a fellow traveller from the south and soon to be a brother in the service of mars all the way from rome itself and despite the slightly travelworn appearance of his clothes not to mention the fine pattern of dried blood across his face a man of influence promised a position on the sixths staff the innkeeper turned back to marcus with a gravely inclined head my apologies a young gentleman so will you both be staying sirs rufius pulled a mock grimace despite the hideous expense of your lodging the mediocre quality of your board and the watery nature of your wine yes we both need lodging for the night excellent my man justus will see to your horses and take the baggage to your rooms you take a couple of hours to sweat out that blood and ill have two of my very best roasted duck waiting for you cooked in their own fat and served with a sauce of wild honey red wine and herbs and for you rufius because i know your needs of old ill crack open my last amphora of a rather special iberian red how does that sound as the pair made their way through the town towards the fortress baths clean tunics under their arms the familiar sound of hobnailed boots clattering against the roads surface swelled behind them echoing through the narrow streets until the sound and its reverberations merged into a constant roar the windows of the buildings to either side of the road shutters closed against the cold were quickly opened to allow the curious to look into the street several of the female onlookers obviously shared a keen professional interest in the arrival of a body of soldiers at the fortress to judge from the way that hair was hastily let down and in at least one case breasts placed on open display the standardbearer and leading century of a legion cohort swept around the corner behind them at the march heading for the fortress gates in the dying light of dusk rufius pulled marcus into a doorway and off the street as the leading troops poured past rank after rank of soldiers pounding up the street with their heads back to suck air into their bursting lungs belting out a bawdy marching song my brother keeps a restaurant with bedrooms up the stairs but none of them will talk to me cause im a legionnaire rufius smiled with fond memories his lips moving to the song as the legionaries kept coming in a seemingly unending column centurions and chosen men stalked alongside their centuries shouting commands at their men to carry their fucking spears straighter and stop eyeing the bloody prostitutes while century after century pounded past as had been the case with the troops who had escorted him up the road from dark pool marcus found their appearance disappointing after the spit and polish hed got used to in the guard shields were clean but not shining armour and weapons lacked the finely detailed workmanship to which he was accustomed and their clothing was utilitarian rough leather boots heavy woollen tunics and coarse woven leggings all spattered with mud from the road his eye was caught by a group of horsemen however whose equipment looked every bit as fine as that he was used to their polished cuirasses tied together with clean ribbon tiberius rufius pointed at them and put his mouth close to marcuss ear to shout over the din coughing at the dust kicked up by the units passing it must be at least half of the sixth out for fitness training thats the legatus and his staff with an escort from the legions cavalry theyre drafted in from an asturian cohort from up north on the wall but most of them are german funny how the roughest barbarians always look the smartest once theyre given uniforms marcus nodded distractedly watching the legions commander ride past in the midst of his staff tribunes grimfaced cavalrymen to their front and rear the mans head turned as his horse passed the doorway and he nodded recognition at tiberius rufius as he passed out of sight marcus looked at the older man his eyebrows raised you know the legatus ive sold the sixth locally bred cattle and given him a little information about the border region what else can an old soldier do but help out his former mates they stood in silence as the rest of the column ground past waiting until the last century had passed over the bridge and into the fortress before leaving their doorway and stepping out into the neardark street and continuing on their way the garrisons bathhouse was as large as was necessary to cope with the cleansing and leisure needs of several thousand legionary infantry the imposing halls lit with hundreds of large torches changed out of their battlestained clothes the two men oiled their naked bodies and slipped on woodensoled bath shoes to protect their feet from the hot floors they went through the chilly frigidarium and into the steam room finding seats among the dozens of soldiers who sat perspiring in the clammy heat tiberius rufius pointed to a floor mosaic depicting mars in full armour and brandishing an infantry sword thats your first god for the next few years who were you brought up to respect the most the household shrine is dedicated to mercury so thats who i always prayed to first a good choice in a merchants house mercury wont begrudge mars your attention while youre in the service though always be sure to seek his blessings before you embark on any course that may end in battle jupiter its hot i can feel the dirt being forced out of me scraper over here boy they endured the clammy heat for another fifteen minutes luxuriating in the pleasure of a good sweat and the chance to get the last of the barbarian blood out of their skins climbing into the hot bath for a moment to remove any residue they went through to the hot room and settled down again tiberius rufius bought them a small flask of wine and a small cake apiece just to get our appetites up and they sat in companionable silence watching offduty soldiers some lifting weights in one corner of the room others content just to play dice and drink wine each man loudly invoking fortunas divine help before tossing the bone cubes almost dozing in the oppressive heat marcus opened an eye lazily as a magnificently muscled blackbearded man walked across the room settling on to the bench opposite their resting place he nudged rufius with his elbow isnt that yes our saviour from this afternoon dubnus wasnt it he looks like an ugly piece of work rufius frowned i suspect theres more to the man than youd guess from his outward appearance you might find a chat with him educational perhaps hell join us for a cup he beckoned the other man to come across and join them the briton rose padded across the floor and settled on his haunches facing the two his thick black eyebrows raised in question above hard grey eyes marcus estimated his age to be about twentyfive years the briton nodded to rufius acknowledging his presence but gave no sign of greeting to the younger man rufius returned the compliment gesturing to the wine flask alongside him on the bench chosen we were wondering if you would be willing to join us in a cup of wine as recognition of your actions of this afternoon the briton regarded the pair with a level gaze before replying i will not drink with a roman to marcuss surprise tiberius rufiuss face muscles did not move as much as a twitch you disappoint me but it is your choice tell me what is it that you have against my friends illustrious city the britons face twisted at the question your question surprises me youve been here a while to judge by your appearance surely you can see what theyve done to this country taken our lands killed our forefathers and fucked our women so why do you serve in our army the words were out of marcuss mouth before he could control his reaction the briton swivelled his head to face him i serve in the first tungrian cohort not in your army i defend my people from attack by the northern tribes my people have no defence against them without the presence of the auxiliary cohorts no defence with three legions within a few days march the man facing him smiled without mirth your legions defend romes interests your mines your farms everything which makes your people rich my people have grown soft in the time since you conquered us and become used to living on the scraps from your table without men like me on the wall the northern tribes would raid our settlements many times in each year your legions wouldnt lift a sword until roman interests were in danger my thanks tiberius rufius but i will not drink with you today rising smoothly from his squatting position the briton walked back to his former seat settled on to the bench and closed his eyes tiberius rufius watched him for a long moment cocking an eyebrow at marcuss pale angry face hmmm that is an interesting man and i think we can now officially discount any possibility that hes stupid come on lets drown that irritation in another cup of wine their bath complete the two men dressed in their clean tunics and walked back to the inn for dinner the duck promised by ennius was brought to their table roasted to perfection and coated with a delicious sauce and the red wine he poured for them was of the quality marcus had become used to drinking at his fathers table rufius poured cup after cup for him until with a belated realisation that his face was suddenly feeling numb and that he was losing the power to string together a coherent sentence the younger man decided it was time he was in bed as he staggered unsteadily up to his room half carried by his new friend he recalled with the needlesharp random insight of the truly drunk a comment his companion had made hours before rufius you said that mercury was a good houshold god for a merchan i didnt tell you father was a merchan the fact that he got no answer seemed to be of little importance at the time after putting the drunken marcus to bed rufius having deliberately rationed his wine intake to keep his wits intact slipped back down the stairs he handed ennius a coin and left strapping on his sword and taking up his pack he walked through the torchlit streets to the river bridge and across to the fortresss main gate challenged by the gate guards he stood his ground confidently in the teeth of their levelled spears youd better fetch the duty centurion boys and look lively about it ive got an appointment inside and it doesnt pay to keep calidius sollemnis waiting the duty officer marched up took a look at the veteran and waved him through the gate raising a sardonic eyebrow to his deputy at the entrance to the headquarters building he was brought up short at the main entrance by a tall blond man dressed in mudspattered armour coming out past the sentries his plumed helmet dangling by its chinstrap rufius stepped back inclining his head with careful respect tribune perennis salutations youve had a full day on the road it appears the other man dropped his hands to his hips in a confident stance tiberius rufius well dont you always manage to turn up when things get interesting doubtless merely coincidence just as always seems to be the case and yet we never see you out in the countryside no matter how carefully we look rufius smiled gently keeping his face neutral yes tribune well i like to move around with a degree of caution you can never be sure just whos waiting to jump out on you in these troubled times only today i heard a man with a surprisingly german accent exhorting a bunch of drunken brits to carve out my liver the officer laughed quietly with a faint smile that failed to touch his eyes german eh how very interesting well never fear senior centurion my asturians will take care to look out for you on the road our paths will cross one day soon of that im quite certain goodnight rufius watched him walk away with hard bright eyes muttering so quietly under his breath that even the sentries straining ears were frustrated not if i see you coming first you cocky young bastard a beaker of water in the face served well enough to wake marcus from a seemingly endless nightmare of roads and hills rough hands pulled him from the bed still dressed in the tunic and leggings hed worn the previous night putting him on his feet and holding him upright while his head swam a disgusted voice cut through his daze pissed throw some more of that water over him the sudden cold sting shocked him into a degree of consciousness a pair of armoured and armed legionaries were holding an arm apiece to keep him vertical while a centurion watched impatiently from the doorway an oil lamp in one hand throwing unsteady shadows against the walls he considered vomiting but fought the impulse down after a moment of awful physical indecision waking up are you you little shit good youve got two minutes to pack after that anything you havent stowed gets left behind you take that sword and make sure he doesnt get a chance to grab it off you hes dangerous behind a blade from what ive heard the marblehard face left no room for argument stuffing his travel clothes left dirty on the rooms chair for washing in the morning into his saddlebag marcus checked that his purse was still in place at his belt ready right his voice returned hoarse from the wines bite wait where are you taking me the centurion stepped across the tiny room to put his face close to marcuss close enough for his sour breath to register and for grey whiskers to stand out of the black of his beard he reached out a hand and with cold hard fingers took the younger mans jaw in a firm grip for a short and painful interview with the legatus cumstain after which id be happy to go a round or two with you in a closed room you fucking traitor what shut your face bring him the innkeeper was waiting grim faced outside the room the centurion nodded to him pay your bill marcus numbly dropped coins into the outstretched palm petronius ennius my friend rufius ennius shot him a hard stare his mouth set in a grim line left straight after dinner and well away from you from the looks of things the soldiers hustled him from the inn moving briskly through the towns dark streets across the river bridge through the main gates mansized wicket gate and into the fortress they marched past sentries waiting at the parade rest for their dawn relief a building loomed out of the torchlit gloom the door watched by another pair of legionaries inside there was warmth and light a mosaic floor and painted walls pleasant enough to take the chill away from marcuss skin in the few moments that he waited still under close guard in the houses hallway waiting for the officers return he spent several moments examining the quality of a wall painting representing the goddess diana hunting with two dogs but all the while he stared at the artists handiwork trying to affect an indifferent air his mind raced frantically trying to account for the sudden turn of events that saw him under armed guard where he should have been greeted as an equal it was a circumstance for which he was completely unprepared and he was sure that his disquiet was showing beneath the attempted veneer of confidence resolving to remain silent as to his mission for the time being although the desire to end the charade pressed heavily on him he awaited the officers return concentrating on a studied ignorance of the guards curious stares the centurion eventually returned motioning the soldiers to stay where they were keep his belongings here and dont touch them they might contain evidence against him you come with me he followed the officer past yet another guard into a large office hearing the door shut behind him the centurion pointed to a spot on the rooms floor sliding his sword from its scabbard stand there and dont move if you do move ill put my iron through your fucking spine and dont speak unless youre asked to seated at the heavy wooden desk was a tiredlooking man in his midthirties his white tunic edged with the thick senatorial stripe his black hair cut somewhat longer than was the formal military style marcus found his face strangely familiar for some reason and wondered distractedly whether they had met before another younger man whose tunic bore the thinner equestrian stripe lounged against the rooms far wall casting a calculating gaze over marcus blond hair and piercing blue eyes hinted at northern european ancestry somewhere in his not too distant past the seated man sat in silence for a moment then spoke with a swift and practised formality marcus valerius aquila i am legatus gaius calidius sollemnis of the sixth imperial legion this is titus tigidius perennis my senior tribune who ive asked to attend this interview to act as a witness to my decisions ive had you brought to my residence since i didnt want to do this in the headquarters building too many eyes and ears im afraid before we go any farther in this matter i will declare an interest in your case i was at one time a close friend of your fathers although we havent spoken for some five or six years now you look very much as your father did at your age he raised a hand in preemption of any question no youre here to listen marcus valerius aquila do you know why i ordered you to be brought here at this time the opportunity was irresistible to a young man in desperate need of reassurance no sir i the flat of the centurions sword slapped his arm hard in admonishment answer the legatuss questions with a simple yes or no no so you have no idea of events in rome of the past weeks the urge to be sick returned held in check only by the sudden return of the concerns he had managed to put to the back of his mind over the weeks of travel no i see then i must inform you that your father was arrested three weeks ago for the crime of plotting to assassinate the emperor when did you leave rome marcuss skin crawled with the revelation and with the equally sudden realisation that he was in desperate danger it was time to shed the deception that had accompanied him from rome to reclaim his identity before this went any further the fifteenth day of the month of januarius sir i have the blow fell again harder this time silence i see you arrived here only a day after the courier bearing the news of your fathers crime good timing for the legion though to have the opportunity to arrest a traitor arrest marcus thought he saw a brief narrowing of the legatuss eyes but the mans face itself was set hard against him indeed the son of an old friend you may be but an enemy of my emperor is an enemy of mine i have no choice but to send you back to rome to beg for the mercy of the throne do you have anything to say yes sir sir i am a praetorian officer on detached courier duty bearing a private dispatch for you from the emperor himself i have been instructed to travel incognito in order to ensure that the message remains confidential my saddlebag contains a message container bearing the imperial seal to be opened only by you i know nothing of the events you describe and have been following the direct orders of my superior officer in making this journey the tribune leaning against the office wall spoke for the first time his voice heavy with irony correction citizen you were a praetorian the praetorian prefect rescinded your commission as soon as your absence without leave was linked to your fathers crime your tribune was interrogated and admitted taking money from your father in return for sending you away from rome on a false errand a very large amount of money as it happens he has already paid the appropriate penalty for consorting with enemies of the throne the seal on your message container is nothing more than a good fake and the container itself holds nothing more than a last letter from your father thank you tigidius perennis the legatus fixed the tribune with a darkeyed silencing stare he held the stare until the younger man looked down at his boots clearly intending to win the brief clash of wills with his junior perhaps your father expected that i would be in a position to protect you but if he did it was a misguided expectation in the light of his crime you must return to rome immediately to face trial in connection with his offence you will be escorted to the main gate where your horse will be waiting for you you are instructed to return to rome by the most direct route deviating from that road for no reason failure to present yourself at the praetorian camp by a date no more than six weeks from now will result in your immediate loss of senatorial rank and the declaration of your entire family as proletarians to the most distant cousin with confiscation of all assets ill send a message back by fast courier warning the praetorians of your return and when they should expect your arrival that is all the centurion sensing the numbness of shock in the young mans hesitation grasped marcus firmly by the upper arm leading him out of the office and back to the waiting escort they marched back out to the main gate where the watch was being changed with all the usual noise and disturbance the centurion looked around him at the ordered chaos and then pulled marcus into a small guardroom dismissing the legionaries inside with the order to go off duty with their fellows in the meagre yellow light of the oil lamps that lit the stonewalled room he seemed larger than he had in the brightly lit commanders residence squat and menacing in the bulk of his armour marcus found his voice at last slowly starting to recover from the initial shock and finding anger where there had initially been only fear is this where i get the beating you promised me earlier dont you need your men with you to make it completely one sided the other man swept his helmet off dropping it on to the table with a clatter running a hand nervously across his balding scalp button it weve got less than five minutes before your horse is ready and ive had to bribe the stable master to get that much time the sudden change in his tone put marcus who had been readying himself for a fight off balance once more what the centurion prodded a broad finger into his chest urgency fuelling his irritation shut up and listen youre being turned loose alone before dawn to make your disposal as easy as possible you think its usual for enemies of the state to be sent back to rome alone no matter what threats might be made to their families most criminals would think of their own necks before those of their loved ones this is just a setup to get you out of the way out into the dark you were supposed to get killed on the road yesterday but the locals apparently managed to cock that one up the men waiting out there for you now wont make the same mistake you ride out of here alone and youll be lucky to get five miles before that bastard perenniss tame cavalry cutthroats take you and slit your throat steal your purse and your horse and leave you in the dirt for the morning patrols to find do you fancy that for an epitaph killed by robbers no well thats a start you know how to use a sword and shield on horseback yes i was trained in i know listen half a mile down the road youll come on a stunted tree growing over a large rock on the right look behind the tree and youll find a cavalry sword and shield ride on as fast as the moonlight lets you and stop for nobody at the twomile marker youll be met by a solid knock rattled the rooms wooden door centurion the traitors horse is ready the officer nodded at marcus grabbing his helmet and replacing it on his head before replying good ill bring the little turd out he cocked a solidlooking fist youll be met by friends sorry but this needs to look like the real thing the swift punch stung marcuss right eye the heavy slap that followed cut his upper lip against his teeth the officer pulled him to his feet whispering urgently in his ear stop for no one until the twomile marker but whos meeting me youll know when you get there and once were outside keep your mouth shut unless you want me nailed up alongside you he paused to fill his lungs right you bastard traitor lets be about it he slammed the door open propelling marcus through it with a hefty shove in the back here he is take a good look at a traitor the incoming watchs centurion goggled at marcuss face youve had a go at him yeah but it was no fun all he did was beg me to stop even you wouldnt have enjoyed it at all the other man put his hands on his hips and laughed uproariously i see what you mean i doubt hell offer any fight to the first robbers he meets yeah and since those asturians are bum boys to a man it might be quite a morning for our friend here he reached out pushing marcuss saddlebag at him go on take your bag itll be a small compensation for the boys that have been out half the night waiting for you now get on your horse and bugger off open the gate marcus climbed on to the beasts back eyeing the soldiers that surrounded him with a sense of complete powerlessness a scent of violence filled his nostrils the energy generated by men eager to deal out pain the main gates opened with a ponderous swing as half a dozen legionaries strained against their weight the centurion pointed out into the darkness beyond the gates flickering torches right piss off i only hope they get the time to do a proper job on you go he slapped the horses rump and the gate towers were suddenly behind marcus as the animal bolted out into the predawn gloom across the bridge past the houses and shops of the town and away down the dark road pursued by the shouted insults of the gate guard out on the open road even without the magnifying effect of the tightly packed buildings the sounds of marcuss horses hoofs on the road sounded deafening he steered the animal on to the softer grass verge diminishing the staccato clatter to a gentle patter when the stunted tree loomed out of the slowly lightening murk he dismounted finding the promised sword and shield hidden in a tangle of roots that curled sinuously over the massive boulder around which the oak had flourished his father he mused would have paid a fortune for such a decoration in the houses courtyard his father the swords edge glittered slightly in the moonlight marcus touched the blade his fingers snagging against a razorsharp line of minutely ragged steel roughsharpened for combat rather than the smooth steel of a peacetime weapon hed heard of the practice from old soldiers but never seen it carried out someone expected him to need every small advantage that could be put his way he remounted riding cautiously on with an ear cocked for trouble holding the reins with the hand that gripped the swords hilt shadows moved and swirled in his vision purple and black each eddy in the nights mist taunting his senses at the onemile marker he thought he could just make out the distant sound of horses hoofs in front of him he halted his own mount to listen in silence but could hear nothing other than the winds moan another five minutes of uninterrupted progress relaxed him a little and he started to worry more about exactly who he would find waiting for him at the twomile marker than what might happen in the intervening stretch of road he reached down to pat the horse with the back of his sword hand as much seeking as offering reassurance looking up he saw them materialise out of the mist to either side of the road a pair of horsemen with swords held upright like cavalry troopers on parade wanting him to see the weapons he guessed he started as a voice spoke in the murk behind him the latin made crude by the edges of the mans german accent give up now and well make it easy for you run and these two will have their fun with you before you die three or more marcus let the sword and shield already held low from stroking the horses mane slip down against the animals flanks hopefully invisible in the dim grey light of approaching dawn curiously unafraid although his heart was pounding at his ribs with the force of a blacksmiths hammer he gently spurred his horse with his bootheels riding steadily towards the horsemen he allowed his body to slump in the saddle reassuring them that he was already in their grip behind him hoofs clattered on the roads surface a fast trot designed to close the distance and put the third man within striking distance marcus kicked the horse hard shouting encouragement into its ear as it surged forward into a gallop he lifted the sword and shield from their resting places on the beasts flanks and into the positions his fathers bodyguard had made him practise thousands of times hes armed bracing himself against the saddles projecting horns and clamping his feet to the horses flanks he pulled the beast towards the man on the right flinching as something flicked past his head with a vicious whirr the arrows passage was close enough for him to feel the wind of its passing the men to his front spurred their own horses forward but his burst of speed caught them by surprise closing the gap before they could manoeuvre to meet him as they might have wished punching out with the shield at the man to his left he felt the jar of a heavy sword blowhammer his left arm into numbness his own weapon the point thrust forward towards the centre of the other horsemans indistinct mass as they came together rang with contact on metal the swords hilt moved in his hand as the blade struck something softer the pain of the wound was enough to make the horseman wheel his mount away with a shout of anger leaving a gap through which marcuss steed burst with its gathered momentum too swift for the other man to get in a second attack he rode for his life now crouching low to avoid any more arrows looking back for any sign of his pursuers in the greyness behind him a frantic clatter of hoofs behind convinced him to keep the horse at the gallop angry shouts lending urgency to his efforts the shield fell from his numb left hand its layered wood and leather deeply scarred by the swordblow without its protection the blade would almost certainly have taken his arm off the horse was starting to pant heavily with the exertion when a figure appeared out of the dawns murk at the roadside in a second marcus pivoted his mount to put the new threat on his righthand side within his swords striking arc he pulled the blade back for the sweeping cut hed been taught up on the wooden practice horse in the villas sunny courtyard almost a decade before high above the rooftops and fume of the city marcus he allowed the weapon to drop from its slashing path pulling the panting horse up with a hard pull at the reins rufius he jumped down from the saddle following the older mans frantic beckoning to bring the horse into the deeper shadow of a small copse that crept close to the roads edge the animal unimpressed by the events of the previous minutes baulked at moving into the trees threatening gloom marcus dug his feet in and pulled and for a second it looked as if they might succeed in finding cover but the horses resistance had removed the slight time gap between him and his pursuers the two horsemen who had attempted to block his path before rode out of the darkness as the two men hesitated between fight and flight into the trees marcus grabbed for his saddlebag releasing the horses bridle as his hand gripped the oiled cloth allowing it to bolt into the darkness tossing the bag aside he dropped into a widelegged fighting stance with the cavalry sword extended ready to fight rufius stepped to his side unsheathing his shorter infantry sword and lifting a round gladiators shield from the ground where he had let it fall the horsemen slowed their advance and crowded in closer leaning out of their saddles with swords held ready to strike down at the two men at the last moment something flew past marcuss head thudding into the nearer mans chest and pitching him prone on to the dark road a moment later a spear arced out of the trees forcing the other rider to twist in his saddle in desperate evasion his horse hesitating as the trees shadow loomed as the rider wrestled with his mounts reins a powerful figure stepped swiftly past an amazed marcus swinging a heavy sword in a single brutal blow at the animals legs with an awful scream the animal fell to its knees hurling its rider untidily on to the ground where the horses assailant finished him with an efficient thrust to the throat another blow silenced the animals agony in a steaming flow of its blood the silent attacker stepped back into the trees vanishing wraithlike into their dark shelter the third rider trotted slowly out of the slowly departing night an arrow ready to loose from his taut bow the arrows point arced slowly across the bloodied scene in search of a target marcus shrank back towards the trees rufius pulling him into the shields inadequate protection but the archer saw their movement while they were still a good ten feet from the deeper shadows straightening in his saddle he swung the bow to bear on them bending the bow the last few inches before loosing its arrow with a berserk howl their rescuer broke from the trees again at a dead run throwing himself into a forward roll as the mounted archer loosed the arrow at him in a splitsecond reaction as the riders left hand plucked another arrow from his quiver his attacker rolled out of his dive and sprang forward with his sword gutting the horse with a single turning thrust the rider went down under his screaming dying mount trapped beneath its dead weight the massive figure stepped over the dying animals trembling neck lifting his sword for the final kill dubnus no the sword froze in midstrike and then withdrew tiberius rufius strode across to the man slapping him on the back in congratulation excellent work man worthy of celebration by mighty mars himself what a sacrifice you have made to him marcus come and renew your acquaintanceship with my good friend dubnus marcus walked across the road to where rufius and his companion stood over the fallen horse and rider the other man turned to face him one hand exploring the muscle of his forearm and the arrow shaft that protruded from it the tungrian indeed it is and isnt he magnificent i told you that this was a man who knew how to fight but i had no idea that he would be so good marcus looked into the britons eyes seeing there a wary expression but one lacking the hostility hed noted there previously youre wounded dubnus shrugged impassively it didnt hit anything important or thered be more blood he grasped the arrow and adjusted his big fingers experimentally around its shaft taking a steadying breath a swift push tore the arrows head narrow but evilly barbed through the undamaged skin at the back of his arm the arrow protruding from both sides of the limb the briton growled at the pain a rivulet of blood snaking down his arm to drip from the spread fingers with a casual twist of the shaft the arrow broke into two easily removable halves i wiped the point with my shit all three turned to look at the fallen horseman panting for breath as the injuries inflicted by his dead horses weight tightened their grip on his life dubnus laughed at him pulling a bloody finger across his throat youre a dead man ive already killed you i can clean this wound use herbs and maggots to remove any poison but your leg is broken badly broken probably bleeding inside ive seen it happen before takes an hour or so perhaps i should help you to die fuck you bluenose his eyes found marcus widening with recognition you traitor marcus stepped forward the long cavalry sword still hanging from one hand you were sent to kill me wouldve been easy except for him keep looking over your shoulder no hiding place for you rufius gently pushed marcus to one side dubnus do what you must to make your wound safe for travel we have to be away from here in ten minutes no more take him with you he squatted down next to the trapped horseman i need a few minutes with my friend here he waited until the briton had shepherded marcus away before slipping an ornately handled dagger from its sheath and addressing the fallen rider in a quiet conversational tone yes were old friends all right im the officer you were shouting for those bluenoses to kill yesterday on the north road and in fact for a long time i was an officer and a good one too i spent several very nasty years patrolling the tava valley up past the northern wall before you idlers gave up our hardwon ground and moved back south to old hadrians wall one of the things i learnt to do with complete expertise during my time in that forsaken place was to persuade the local tribesmen we captured to tell us the things they didnt want to tell us and now before you die im going to share that skill with you so where shall we begin dubnus dropped a heavy hand on marcuss shoulder pulling him farther away from the scene you dont want to see that stay here and watch my pack he drew his sword and walked to the closest of the fallen horses pausing to wrest his throwing axe from the chest of his first victim before turning to the mans horse practical necessity overrode any qualms he might have felt about either the mans death or the use he was about to make of the dead horse from the moment hed agreed to do what the former officer had asked of him hed been working out how to make good their escape once the roman was safe from the threat of murder the veteran officer had disturbed his sleep earlier that night with the request one that had made him laugh out loud with its audacity once his irritation at being awakened before the dawn call had worn off hed stopped laughing when a bag full of gold had landed on the bed in front of him the former officer it seemed was determined to have his help and was willing to pay handsomely it was enough money tiberius rufius had told him to buy every man in his cohort a decent coat of mail hed stopped laughing all right but the look on his face had made it clear enough to the veteran centurion that he wasnt going to pick the money up from where it had landed at least not without a good reason which rufius had proceeded with a halfsmile that signalled how well he understood the briton to matteroffactly provide his task complete dubnus returned to find marcus waiting where he had left him he stuffed the carefully wrapped bundle into his pack and then led the way deeper into the copse searching in the halflight until he found what he was looking for the plant glistened in the grey light woundwort good he ripped a handful of the plant away from its stem squeezing it hard in a straining fist until a milky fluid dribbled from between his fingers on to the arrow punctures then reached into his pack hidden at the foot of a tree for a strip of cloth the juice will help to stop the bleeding help me to tie it dubnus wound the cloth around his bulky forearm and allowed marcus to knot it a slow red stain seeped through the layers tighter good a shrill scream made marcus start the soldier shrugged regarding the temporary bandage with a professional scrutiny from beneath his heavy eyebrows a slight smile crossing his face hell talk soon that german its inevitable our friend rufius will offer him either a quick death or a slow one any man that runs from a fight before it is lost will take the easy way out when theres a knife probing the root of his cock a flush of anger ripped through marcuss body part reaction part frustration at the uncontrolled spiral of events and part hot burning disgust at what rufius was doing to the fallen rider spinning he thrust his face into the soldiers snarling his anger into its indifference why did you come here why save me you hate romans youre an outlaw now the german called you a traitor youre not one of them any more the simple reversal of judgement infuriated marcus as much for the smug simplicity of its verdict as its perpetuation of the injustice done to his family i am not a traitor dubnus pointed into the darkness to where the screams had sounded german or not hes a roman a cavalryman one of their elite why was he hunting you he must think you are a traitor the briton watched marcus as he frowned at the simple verdict attempting to gauge the mans mettle whether he would stand up to the rigours of the coming days hed wondered whether the roman would even be able to make effective use of the weapons theyd hidden for him by the roadside after they had slipped out of the fort through a hidden door concealed in the wall the thick oak door had answered the first of his objections as to how they were going to get out of the fortress without word getting back to titus it was faced in stone to match the walls around it with heavy stone slabs inside the wall poised ready to fall and block the tiny entry if small wedges restraining them were knocked away he would never have known it was there if he hadnt been guided to its precise location its designed to allow troops to get out and attack besiegers or messengers to leave in secret tiberius rufius had told him as they forded the river between the fortress and its town on carefully placed stepping stones that lay beneath the rivers slowmoving surface but its a good thing it hasnt rained hard for a week or so or the river would be trying a lot harder to pull us off this little bridge they had skirted the town and headed down the road to the twomile marker while he hefted his spear and thought darkly about what he was going to do to the german cavalryman if he got the chance tiberius rufius had made the connection for him pointing out that the man shouting orders to kill him over the din of their little battle could not have been a tribesman with an accent like that it had been all the bait needed to get the big briton off his bed and into his mail coat intended murder in his heart revenge for the man hed lost the previous day in the event seeing the asturian decurion trapped beneath his horse had put out the fire of his bloodlust in an instant knowing that the man was doomed to die in agony his leg shattered under the horses massive dead weight had been enough for him he had still smiled to himself when the screaming started though a man made his choice and lived with the outcome tiberius rufius appeared out of the dawns murk wiping his dagger with a tuft of grass pulled from the roadside well at least that was easier than it might have been we must leave this place and quickly dubnus we need to make good speed but be well away from the road before the first patrols get this far lead us if you will the briton nodded turning away towards the indistinct hillside above them and picking up his pack pole and spears come for a wounded man he made good time grinding across the hard winter ground at a pace that had marcus breathless inside ten minutes their path climbing steadily up and away from the road he glanced back at rufius bringing up the rear with an alert eye to all sides to find that he was striding out without any sign of trouble returning his energy to putting one boot in front of the other time after time after time he concentrated on the britons muscular back weeks of travel by sea and on horseback had done little to help his fitness after about fifteen minutes of increasing physical torture dubnus stepped off the line of their march leading them into the shade of a small huddle of trees a patch of scorched earth in the middle of the tiny grove showed where a fire had burned quite recently dawn had come and gone and the first glint of sun was edging the horizon below them the road was still trees along its verges casting stripes of dark shadow across the landscape the briton gestured down towards the road this is a good place to camp the fire shows as much a moving man is easily seen from here in the dusk or dawn his shadow will stretch across the land it is a good defence for us but will make us vulnerable if we move any farther until the sun gets higher well have to wait here until the sun clears the horizon marcus stood with his head back sucking in the cold morning air with his eyes closed somewhere in the gloom a crow cawed hoarsely echoing his mood dubnus prodded him in the stomach youre soft a soldier has to march all day then dig out a camp before eating or sleeping marcus opened his eyes and grimaced in return looking up at the britons relaxed posture only the slight rise of steam from his skin in the halflight gave any hint of his recent exertion i am a soldier ive just been without real exercise for too long rufius raised a sympathetic smile almost hidden in the dawns meagre light if it helps my legs ache too its been too long since i had to cover country at that pace but dubnus has got us away safely and thats what counts now lets talk you and i dubnus do me a favour and keep watch the briton took the hint moving quietly away to the edge of the small copse to watch the road below their hiding place tiberius rufius took marcus by the arm pulling him down into a conspiratorial squat the roman huddled into his cloak shivering as the sweat cooled on his body you met with the legatus i presume marcus snorted his lip curling the legatus yes he had me thrown to those wolves tiberius rufius nodded his head indeed he did and he no choice in doing so calidius sollemnis did no more than he had to in order to be sure that he looked the model servant of rome in all truth it was his tribune perennis who set the asturians on you the same way that he ordered the attack on us yesterday i would have been sure of that even if our deceased asturian friend back down there hadnt just confirmed it forget the carefully posed interview consider what else has happened in the last few hours the legatus had a trusted centurion pick you up from the inn and stay with you all the way to the gate without that safeguard its likely that you would have been conveniently knifed before getting anywhere near your horse sollemnis also had me leave you the weapons that saved you from the asturians and wait for you down the road at a place where we might escape into the forest and evade pursuit he knows what perennis is capable of and he took every step possible to fend off the mans efforts to have you killed and the briton the first time he saved your life was pure luck and fortune of the finest quality given the fact wed have been dead men without his intervention id say fortuna smiles on you marcus valerius aquila the second time well that was my own doing people who plan for the worst have a tendency to survive when it actually happens so i took steps to make sure that i was using my own dice for the game he paused for a moment and looked the younger man square in the eye as if weighing up his state of mind and now centurion there are things you have to know before we leave this place none of them are pleasant but then you find yourself in a difficult place with very limited options you must fully understand your situation before you can decide how to face it marcus met his gaze with a level stare ive been sent across oceanus to the very edge of the world on a fools errand ambushed twice in two days by men i do not know intent on my murder and informed in casual terms of the downfall of my father previously a respected senator of rome im not sure you can make that picture very much bleaker tiberius rufius but if theres more to tell then i am ready bravely put valerius aquila and you can drop the formalities my forename is quintus and id be proud to count you as a close enough friend to use it now then where to start legatus sollemnis received a message from your father twenty days ago stating that he feared for your familys safety in the current political climate in rome the senator wrote to warn sollemnis of his decision to have you sent as far away from rome as possible he asked sollemnis to hide you away from his enemies as a last favour to a friend this of course was no idle request he was asking his friend to defy the throne and harbour a man who would swiftly be named as a traitor when i met with sollemnis last evening it was already clear to him that tigidius perennis would be his main problem youve probably guessed by now that hes the son of your praetorian prefect a man closer to the throne than you may know what you dont know is that his appointment as a tribune on the sixths staff was imposed on sollemnis last year at the time he took it as a clear signal that emperor commodus or at least the men who stand behind him intended to be assured of his loyalty after all three legions and a dozen auxiliary cohorts is a lot of spears the biggest single concentration of troops in the entire empire and that could be an irresistible temptation to a man of the senatorial class with ambition sollemnis mistakenly thought that perennis had simply been appointed to spy on his actions but since his arrival this new tribunes actions have gone well beyond simple spying hes subverted the asturian cavalry to do his dirty work and sollemnis is convinced that hes planning to take command of the legion if ever he gets the chance marcus raised a sceptical eyebrow a tribune unseat an imperial general officer how likely is that with the right authority with a scroll of authority embossed with the correct seals and with the legions most senior officers in no doubt as to their fate if they jumped the wrong way easier than you might think id say when at the right time tigidius perennis brings out his letter of authority complete with the imperial seal half a dozen men find themselves harking back to quiet conversations with the man flattery offers of promotion and veiled threats to loved ones from a clever young man of the highest influence and absolutely no scruples id put good money on sollemnis finding himself at the wrong end of the spear very quickly in such a situation he knows that he has very good reason to behave in a manner that provides no opportunity for perennis to make his move so the legatus originally thought that it would be relatively simple to send you across to the twentieth legion at deva under the supervision of their legatus if he could just keep you from perenniss attention the twentieths man owes him a favour or two apparently a second messenger arrived two days ago an urgent dispatch from rome and carried by a courier ive met a few times before once i got a few drinks into him he was happy enough to discuss the stories hed heard around the palace before he left your father had been arrested for the crime of conspiracy against the throne and was questioned on your disappearance but even in extremis refused to give any clue as to your whereabouts all they could wring out of him after days of suffering was that hed sent you to the ends of the empire out of their reach his remains were scattered for the crows denied the burial rites to avoid there being any rallying point for your familys supporters you should be proud of him marcus valerius aquila by dying in such ignominy but with such dignity he brought great honour to your name but suspicion obviously fell on your tribune and he told commoduss men everything they wanted to know as soon as they came for him hoping to save himself from torture it seems fool it would have been easier on him if hed just fallen on his own sword while he had the chance the elder perennis was so furious that you slipped from his grasp just as he was ready to move on your family he had his thugs torture tribune scarus to death just trying to prove his story false the instructions from rome were simple enough as far as sollemnis was concerned you were to be detained and returned to the capital at the first opportunity day or night a private message for perennis was delivered by the same courier and it wasnt too hard to guess what orders that contained once the senior officer at dark pool fortress reported you as being on the road to yew grove i was sent south in secret to find you i was to provide you with whatever protection i could until you reached the city in the meantime sollemnis decided to take five cohorts out into the country on a nowarning exercise to avoid your walking into the fortress before he was ready to receive you he knew id keep you out of trouble until he got back when he arrived back at yew grove late last night sollemnis had no choice but to deal with you and provide clear evidence of his loyalty to the throne but he had time to set me to work again preparing your escape from the death that titus tigidius perennis had planned for you rufius looked at him for a long moment before reaching out a hand patting his shoulder in a gesture of reassurance that was not mirrored in his troubled eyes marcus there comes a moment in every mans life when he must shoulder the full burden of his fate accept his own death or worse the death of those he loves this i regret is your moment read the scroll you were ordered to bring here marcus cut away the protective wax seal and opened the box containing his fathers last message turning the unrolled parchment to the mornings slowly brightening eastern horizon my son may the gods have remained with you you are by now safe in northern britannia and far distant from the thrones vengeance you are reading this message at the suggestion of the man to whom i have entrusted your fate by the time you reach britannia i expect that commodus and his supporters will have laid formal charges of treason at our familys door i will have been tortured for information as to your whereabouts then killed without ceremony or hearing i can only hope that my persecutors will have been kinder with your mother and our other children and relatives although i doubt it this emperor brings evil out from under the stones that have long concealed it and few men display less honour in their deeds than your praetorian prefect perennis whatever the ugly detail of their ending our kindred will be taken and killed out of hand our honour publicly denounced and our line almost brought to an abrupt full stop you are almost certainly all that remains of our blood my purpose in bribing your tribune to send you to my friend is a simple one he will i am confident undertake to send you deeper into that harsh and difficult country and hide you among his friends out of sight of the thrones hunting dogs i apologise gravely for not sharing my intention with you as should have been the case between men your sense of honour so carefully instilled by years of patient teaching would only have tripped you before you could fly our conversation on the night of your sisters birthday proved to me that you had no comprehension of the fate looming over our proud house i chose therefore to make your flight one that required no such understanding so now you are in britannia if all has gone well you must think hard now despite your sorrow and act with decision and courage you are the last of our line the only blood left unspilt from a once distinguished family your task now must be to preserve that blood to hide it from the hunters until the chase is abandoned perhaps even until the man on the throne has changed you alone must judge the right time to emerge from hiding and how much vengeance to seek at that point depending on your circumstances remember my son revenge is a morsel best savoured at leisure rather than hot from the oven lest you burn your own mouth in truth it would be enough for me to know that our blood will be passed on to later generations for our honour to be restored would be more then i could expect i only ask for your grandfathers sake if not for mine that you do not despair of this last request i know that you loved the old man and would like you to know that your military training and position were mostly at his request a promise i gave him on his deathbed certainly i had no will to resist the last desire of a dying man as i hope will now be the case with this request i make of you since i am most certainly doomed i wish you and the future of our line the best of luck may mercury guide your steps and mars strengthen your swordhand your father appius valerius aquila marcus looked up from the scroll and stared bleakly at the older man rufius took a deep breath before speaking again sollemnis tells me that your father had the misfortune to be both wealthy and a man of honour and intelligence at a time when both made him a target no emperor can afford to leave any survivors when he removes a perceived threat to his greatness for the fear of their becoming a rallying point for discontent worse most guard commanders will tell you that almost anyone can be killed if the assassin has no concern for his escape once the deed is completed if he has nothing left to live for its a usual precaution for the emperor to order the death of all males in any family he moves against an essential task of the praetorians im afraid im sorry but your father is almost certainly dead did you have any brothers the younger man nodded swallowing painfully a younger brother hes was ten im sorry so you see this is that moment of which i spoke you are the only surviving male of your family the last of your bloodline if you die your father and grandfathers line will be snuffed out for ever but youre going to have to take a part in your own protection neither i nor dubnus can run around looking after you for the next ten years and so marcus nodded his understanding took a deep breath and got to his feet stooping to pick up the razorsharp cavalry sword and i certainly wont knowingly endanger either of you any further youve both already done more than enough ill find some way to escape the pursuit rufius looked up at him with a gentle smile shaking his head in bemusement brave enough talk my lad but likely to see you dead before dusk tonight whats needed now isnt nobility but mobility you need to be somewhere else as far from here as can be managed and much as it pains me to tell you this you must also become someone else another man entirely and take on a name as far removed from the one youve used with pride all these years as possible dubnus turned to face them across the grove marcus met his frank stare with a shrug youre right this is your country not mine so tell me where should i go rufius exchanged glances with dubnus and then continued what i was going to say was that neither dubnus nor i can be absent from our usual routines for long i would quickly be missed and suspicions about my role in all of this will already be high enough and dubnus is expected back on duty with his unit on the wall in a few days we do however have an idea of how we can spirit you away from under your enemies noses and hide you in a place theyd never consider your part will be to do everything and anything dubnus tells you to from now until he delivers you to your destination perhaps you can find a way of repaying him he lowered his voice although id advise against offering him money marcus nodded slowly his face still white from the shock of reading his fathers message i will do whatever i have to i have no choice my name rufius grimaced its never easy to jettison something as close to your identity as the name your father gave you especially under such circumstances but you have no choice you need a simple name one to let you fade into the background of this bloody story and be lost to view from rome your forename should remain the same theres no sense in risking your being caught out in your deception when theres no need as for clan and family he pursed his lips in thought for a moment then thrust a hand into his bag for a clan name i suggest this resting on his outstretched palm was a device constructed of four metal spikes heatwelded together their points bright iron teeth its a tribulus strew a few thousand of these in front of a cohort and youve removed any danger of cavalry or chariot attack see no matter how you drop it to the ground theres always one nasty little point sticking up to wreck a horses hoof and itll make a mess of a bluenose foot too marcus picked up the vicious device its bent rufius nodded taking the tribulus and wrapping his fist around it my own modification see a small change to the spikes angles makes it the perfect closecombat weapon if you lose your sword a single spike protruded from between his fingers two more poked out from either side of his fist while the last stuck straight out from his palm however i choose to punch a man with this ill always have a nice length of iron in front of my fist this ones yours ive got another one in my bag and you never know when you might find that little toy your only weapon so for your clan name i suggest tribulus seems quite appropriate given the way you keep fighting back no matter which way up fate throws you as for a family name the distant crow cawed again its harsh call cutting through the crisp morning air marcus lifted his head looking out across the bleak landscape laid out below them theres your answer corvus it will serve to remind me how my father was mistreated even after his death and its as good as any other name if i have to abandon the one my ancestors have used with pride since the expulsion of the ancient kings from the city rufius put a hand on his shoulder youre not abandoning anything just burying it here for a while along with everything else that can betray you to your pursuers work the new name through your mind until you consider yourself as marcus tribulus corvus if the right gods smile on you youll be safe at the hill in a matter of days and once there youll have to be comfortable with your new identity the hill wheres that rufiuss face creased in a rueful grin wheres the hill at the end of the world thats where dubnus its time for you both to leave the briton pondered for a moment to their west rose the pennine mountains still snowcapped with retreating winter a bleak killing field with little cover if the inevitable searching cavalry patrols came upon them a long climb would take them to the peaks another days march would drop them back on to the lowlands on the far side there they would find safer ground another legions territory although he knew that the ripples from the slaughter hed inflicted on the romans pursuers would still spread wide taking the fugitive to the north on the other hand would take them off the road but into the forests dangerous beyond belief for a pair of men one in the hated armour of rome the other very much an unknown quantity even if the cavalry sword in his grip was edged with blackened dried blood i will take him over the mountains to the west rufius nodded agreement and i need to be back about my business away from the pair of you at least for now he embraced marcus briefly stepping back to appraise the younger man one last time farewell then marcus tribulus corvus well meet again in the north mars willing my horse is safe in the woods below so ill leave you to it he nodded to marcus clasped hands with dubnus and started back down the slope the briton turned to face marcus unwrapping a bundle that rufius had left behind clothes and boots as worn by my people rufius bought them for you in yew grove lets hope they fit also a blanket and a nice heavy hooded cape to keep you dry in the rain fit they did although they were a rude surprise to marcus after the quality of his own clothing rough material and illmade boots that chafed his feet before hed even started walking they buried his tunic cloak and boots to prevent their discovery wrapping his gold cloak pin and the message from his father in their folds and marked their position with a small pile of rocks dubnus strapped the cavalry sword to his right hip better i throw it to you if it comes to a fight what would a roughly dressed peasant like you be doing with such a fine weapon you can have it back when we reach the hill he wiped mud across the younger mans face to complete the transformation standing back to admire his handiwork youll pass your hands are too soft you need to get some dirt under your nails and your hair is too short but well cut it even shorter once weve got the time make it look military youre a tribesman now my nephew in fact and im taking you to join my cohort at the hill cocidius forgive me anyone talks to us you keep your mouth closed your head down and you let me do the talking very well lets march he turned to leave shouldering his pack pole and spears marcus tested his new boots by walking a few paces grimacing at their fierce grip on his feet so how far is it to the hill one hundred and fifty miles seven days march for a legionary were going to march at that pace like legionaries your legions use the roads they build to move fast and concentrate dispersed forces to gain superior strength before they attack its their strongest weapon against the rebel tribes because it multiplies their strength now were going to use their roads to get you away from their patrols marcus nodded his acknowledgement of the point im impressed with your knowledge dubnus snorted his nostrils flaring as he looked at the bedraggled roman you look at me and see a barbarian in roman armour you view me with romes contempt or something close to it because thats what youve been taught im an educated man and a soldier in a country where soldiers are guaranteed to see action several times over their term of service even if only in dirty little skirmishes with locals let me tell you you can die in a skirmish just as easily as in a fullscale gang fuck unless youre trained and ready i will start to train and ready you as we travel north marcus smiled wanly at the speed you promise to travel you may kill me first the briton shook his head slightly the ghost of a smile touching his eyes far from it instead ill give you the stamina of a tungrian by the time we reach the hill marcus rolled his eyes to heaven in mock despair or kill me trying gods help me dubnus unable to retain his outrage replaced it with an evil smile roman gods wont save you now you belong to me and youre just a recruit as far as im concerned and therefore subject to a new god my god cocidius a warrior god a hunter god so run master recruit run they ran marcus gulping the cold upland air deep into his bursting lungs between education and exercise it threatened to be a long week that evening as the sun dipped slowly towards the horizon dubnus broke off the line of their march and climbed a short distance into the forest before lowering his pack to the ground the fugitives had avoided the road for much of the day moving crosscountry on game paths that threaded through the thin scatter of copses decorating the mountain slopes having avoided the first angry heat of the inevitable cavalry sweep for the murderers of perenniss men they had returned to the road when the sun was quite low in the sky the briton gestured to the small hollow he had found sweeping his arm in around to indicate the sparsely wooded land around them we need to light a fire it should be safe enough here hidden from the road you look for some kindling dead stuff only mind you we dont want to make smoke and stay out of sight of the road keep within shouting distance there are wolves in these hills by the time marcus limping from the pain of his blisters had found sufficient wood to make a goodsized pile of dry twigs and sticks the briton had cut and lashed branches to form a spit above the spot where the fire would burn a large chunk of meat was in place ready to cook he examined the wood carefully nodding sagely good enough if youre wondering what the meat is i cut it from one of the horses i killed this morning if that bothers you you have a choice eat horse or go hungry tonight and tomorrow i took two pieces like this while you think about that you can go and find twice as much wood again well need to burn the fire through the night in this temperature thicker branches mind you to last longer dubnus had the fire glowing hot by the time marcus returned with his last load of wood his boots were off and he had the horsemeat turning over the flames they sat a while in the evenings peace while the meat started to cook drops of fat falling on to the flames and burning in bright flares the aroma tormented marcuss empty belly until he broke the silence as much to distract him from his hunger as from any desire to talk dubnus who taught you to fight so well my father he was a hunter killed animals for food and skins then traded the skins with roman traders like rufius former soldiers usually he taught me to fight and to track and hunt how to live off the country for months with no need go back to our village the land has everything required for survival if you have the right tools here take a spell turning this meat marcus shuffled over to the fire to do as he was asked so why did you join the army the other mans eyes clouded for a moment you ask a lot of questions im sorry i had no intention of i joined the army because my father sent me to the tungrian fort when he was dying told me to ask the recruiting centurion to take me he said that the army would be the best place for me when he was gone were you sad to leave home sad yes i was sad leaving the land was difficult life in the army was very different hard no nothing they could throw at me bothered me my centurion beat me with his vine stick to get my attention and drum in the lessons i told him to keep it up told him i loved it he broke it on my back and called for another one the big man sat in silence for a moment it wasnt any harder than what i was already used to it just wasnt home marcus fell silent eyeing the meat critically he could imagine the huge briton as a younger man little different from how he was now silent and proud every inch warrior blood what a challenge to his first centurion a man expected to turn him from barbarian into trained soldier the meat was starting to crisp above the fires heat almost ready to eat dubnus yes what will i do when we reach the hill rufius has a plan hell tell us when we meet when will we meet again the briton shrugged indifferently somewhere on the road north lets eat that meat before it burns he scraped the horsemeat from the spit and on to his wooden plate with a swift movement of his dagger dividing it equally before passing one portion to the roman marcus nodded his thanks his nostrils flaring in anticipation of the meal as he gingerly sank his teeth into the hot meat eating the first mouthful open mouthed to avoid burning his palate the taste was divine after a days hard exercise without food fat ran down his chin unnoticed as he ate he nodded at dubnus in between mouthfuls i never expected to be eating horse or for it to taste so good the briton swallowed a mouthful of his own portion youll be surprised what you can do when you have to now its your turn to speak of your past tell me about your father marcus thought for a moment chewing reflectively on his meat he was a good man i think but he never learned how to keep his thoughts private even when they were a danger to him not even when my mother threatened to take the children to her sisters house in naples if he didnt stop goading the emperor his views were dreadfully old fashioned he believed that imperial rule was a dead end for rome doomed to produce ever more feeble leaders until the whole thing came crashing down he believed that a republic and rule by the senate voted into power by the people was the only answer my uncle condianus once told me that his brother was too liberal with his opinions too quick to share his beliefs he told me that my father mistook the indulgence of the last emperor for approval and mistakenly believed that the old man would come to renounce the throne and restore the republic which of course was never going to happen uncle condianus feared it would lead to all our deaths but i suppose i could never quite believe that his fears were justified he paused for a moment remembering all the time the storm clouds were gathering over us and i never knew it was happening or wanted to know i suppose i did try to speak to my father a few days before i was sent away on this fools errand after a dinner to celebrate my sisters birthday we sat down for a cup of wine together after the meal and it all came out again his disgust for the emperor his hopes of restoring the republic i warned him to be more careful with his views that the new emperor wouldnt necessarily share his fathers tolerance i told him that he certainly shouldnt be speaking ill of the throne to a man sworn to protect its occupant with his life but of course he wouldnt listen all he would say was that he thought it was a bit rich for me to be warning him about loyalty to the emperor when it was his money that had put me in my fine uniform and that was that dubnus nodded snorting quiet laughter past a mouthful of meat fathers they always have a way to put you in your place no matter how big your boots get they shared a quiet moment before dubnus broke the spell by pointing to marcuss feet show me your blisters marcus put down his plate and examined the sores swollen with fluid from the days friction against rough footwear you wont be able to walk tomorrow unless we do something with these here marcus looked at the knife questioningly do what the legionaries do pinch the blisters slice off the top and expose new skin beneath itll hurt for a moment or two once you get walking then youll feel nothing much after a day or two youll start to grow leather then get some sleep well watch for two hours at a time and keep the fire burning marcus did as he was bidden smarting as the raw flesh beneath his blisters protested at its exposure he curled up in his blankets underneath the heavy cape and lay for a moment listening to the howling of distant wolves hunting in the hills about them there was comfort to be taken from the fires protective circle of light and from dubnuss reassuring bulk as the briton sat out the first watch before sleep took him when his time to watch the fire came it was uneventful enough apart from tossing the occasional branch on to the blaze and fighting off his urge to sleep he was petrified that he would make a fool of himself in front of the briton at dawn the next morning they were ready to move dubnus carefully brushed the fires ashes away into the grass with his feet before spreading fresh earth over the burnt ground cautious despite his eagerness to move on he made one last critical examination of their surroundings then turned away satisfied with his precautions we werent here march marcus forced his protesting leg muscles up to dubnuss speed realising with dismay after a moment of torture that while the other man was setting a slow pace he was gradually accelerating their rate of progress gritting his teeth and digging into his willpower to match his stride he searched for something to distract him from the physical torment memories of rome that he had previously suppressed flooded back to fill the emptiness created by exhaustion and he stopped in his tracks resting his hands on his knees as the memories cascaded out from the place into which he had roughly pushed them in the aftermath of his arrest and escape his older sisters taking turns to amuse him with rag dolls as a toddler his younger brother gaius playing with the cup and ball hed given the tenyearold as a present turning excitedly to grin his thanks the girls would likely be dead by now according to rufius quite possibly horribly so and it was inescapable that the boy would have been killed out of hand a family traceable back to the time of the second punic war simply expunged from existence a pair of booted feet appeared in his vision he spoke without raising his gaze kill me now briton save us both the trouble of dragging my weary body across this ghastly land i have little enough reason to live a powerful grip took marcuss rough shirt pulling him up to stare into the warriors grey eyes dubnus held him there for a moment looking deep into his soul through its only window on the world you grieve for your family i told you before its right to grieve at the right time grieve now and say farewell now im marching north whether you come or not grief and rage tautened marcuss jaw making him force out his words between gritted teeth theyre all dead dubnus my father my mother sisters my little brother so rufius told me was your father stupid what when you talked about your father last night it was clear that he couldnt betray his principles but was he a stupid man unwise lacking in intelligence marcus thought hard grateful for something other than death on which to ponder on balance while being the first to accept that he was not the soldier his grandfather had been his father had been no kind of fool bribing a praetorian tribune to send his son away before the impending storm broke proved that no i believe he was not he sent you to safety perhaps he did the same with his other children marcus felt his heart lift a little at the possibility perhaps but but but i have to assume that my entire family is gone now and that im all thats left so you are the family now youre the only keeper of your familys blood and so and so i must do whatever i have to if i am to keep that name alive the briton nodded his head gravely placing a hand on marcuss shoulder for a second in a halting effort at comfort yes you do whatever you have to do and the first thing you have to do is to march now in a moment wait for me please he walked away from the path feeling the barbarian leggings rubbing against his legs a sore patch was developing between his thighs skin unaccustomed to the contact of the rough homespun cloth at dubnuss suggestion he had rubbed fat from their meal on to the sores which would harden given time and the discomfort would have to be borne in the meantime as he mused brokenly would his hearts pain at the presumed loss of all he had loved in his past what he wondered would his father and grandfather both soldiers in their time have expected of him the answer came without conscious thought as if familiar voices spoke in his memory take the chance youve been given survive continue our proud line he turned back to the road his heart lighter than it had been five minutes before dubnus poked him in the chest hooking a thick thumb over his shoulder in the direction of their route good now well march no stopping until midday and perhaps well buy food at a village even praetorians need food smiling at the britons attempt to lighten his mood marcus stepped back on to the track ignoring the pain in his calves and thighs another thought sprang unbidden to his mind alongside the nobler concepts of protecting the familys survival revenge he marched away to the north behind the seemingly tireless briton savouring the thought of making the men who had destroyed his family pay in blood for their crimes no matter how long his wait for that revenge might be he muttered the word quietly to himself savouring its implications what he smiled bitterly at dubnuss back his thoughts suddenly washed clear by the heat of the new emotion just something i was thinking about a morsel best savoured at leisure and i have plenty of leisure it would seem every step that the pair took to the north through pale sunshine frequent rain and once through an eerily quiet day of gently falling snow made a tiny reduction in the likelihood of their being taken by the units searching for the murderers of the rogue cavalrymen still even as they drew nearer to the wall that divided empire from barbarian waste and farther from likely pursuit dubnus remained cautious what sustenance he took for them from the land was supplemented with food purchased with marcuss money from the farms and villages they passed dubnus skirted round each settlement with great caution leaving marcus in cover while he went to make their purchases as they went north the briton quizzed marcus as to the nature of his military experience before long he had evidently decided that while the roman clearly knew how to run a century the lack of any combat in his short career other than the brief skirmish on the road to yew grove greatly diminished any value that experience might have had youre a barracks officer this place needs a man who can face the tribes with a drawn sword not just a head counter no amount of argument or attempts by marcus to discuss the great campaigns of history and show his understanding of either strategy or tactics could change the britons gruff opinion as far as dubnus was concerned his new companion was quite simply not a fighting man praetorian or not at least not until hed proved otherwise the skirmish on the road to yew grove apparently didnt count the strangely matched pair reached the wall late in the morning of the ninth day of their march a morning of fitful rain from a uniformly grey sky having given way to intermittent gloom and sunshine while towering walls of cloud rolled west in stately procession the road from the south ran to the walls of a fortress set a mile back from the wall before forking past its walls to the east and west they halted a little way from the imposing structure while dubnus drew a map in the dust with his dagger pointing to each fort on their route in turn this fort is the rocks home to the hamians the next fort to the west is high spur thats the thracians to the east theres ash tree thats the raetians and fair meadow is next again set back behind the wall home to our sister cohort the second tungrians then well reach the hill the last fifteen miles of their journey took them along roads busy with military traffic and for a while marcus quailed at the appearance of each new patrol he soon realised that the troops they passed recognising the colour of dubnuss tunic were more interested in passing snide comments than looking for fugitive romans another tenman patrol passed in the opposite direction one brave soul calling out whos your girlfriend chosen once the distance between them was sufficient for safety and his fear evaporated replaced by a sudden feeling of superiority i dont see much discipline here dubnus laughed over his shoulder oh theyve got discipline theyre tough better than most legionary soldiers better trained harder trained all they know is fighting unlike the legions where every man seems to have a trade first and a sword as an afterthought they have to be ready to fight at any time since their enemy is everywhere around them he was silent for a moment their enemy is their own people can you imagine what that feels like knowing that you might have to put your own brother to the sword if it came to war youre not a fighting soldier you wouldnt understand marcus closed his mouth considering the statement perhaps the other man was right the only soldiering hed known was in barracks the continual watch over rome that was intended to keep a boot on the citys throat rather than to protect it what would it be like to face enemies both outside and inside the empires walls a situation perhaps as confusing for the local troops as it was dangerous a mile later they saw more troops marching towards them a full century in campaign array each man with a heavy pack on his carrying pole and two spears dubnus stopped in the road putting his hands on his hips and smiling broadly those men are the best soldiers on the wall those men are tungrians their centurion was marching at the head of his men with his helmet buckled to his belt a big scarfaced man with a full black beard a distinctive white streak ran from forehead to collar through his wiry black hair he recognised dubnus at some distance and trotted forward from his place clasping arms with him as if he were an equal before turning and barking orders at his own chosen man to halt the column and give the men a fiveminute break they talked animatedly for a moment or so in their own language before dubnus turned to marcus this is clodius centurion of the third century the other man nodded carefully taking in both marcuss native clothing and his distinctive physical appearance with a glance eyes hard with suspicion momentarily bored into marcuss before he turned away to his men the soldiers treated dubnus with respect during their brief halt their body language betraying his apparently dominant position within their small world marcus tried to fade into the background conscious of the troops inspection of him he wondered what they would make of his worn boots and rough local clothing his jetblack hair and darker complexion most of them had the fair local colouring while only a few had black hair like dubnus and clodius the century marched away to the east after a few moments leaving them to resume their own journey they had passed fair meadow a mile south of the wall by midafternoon its whitewashed stone sides standing out from the country around like a ship at sea turning north for a short distance they climbed a shallow ridge at the top of which the fort for which they were heading came into view shaped in the usual rectangle it butted up to the white line of the wall at the top of the next ridge an untidy cluster of town buildings huddled against its lower rampart the hill dubnus confirmed at the gate he was greeted with the same mixture of respect and deference that marcus had noted on the road and told the sentries to call for the officer of the watch the centurion arrived quickly listened to dubnus for a moment and then apparently expecting the arrival led marcus away to the headquarters building in the centre of the fort dubnus nodded farewell turning away to rejoin his own unit without any show of emotion at the entrance to the headquarters marcus was delighted and relieved to find rufius waiting for him well young corvus here you are then looking a little thinner if thats possible although it suits you well enough makes you look more determined and thats no bad thing in your situation he dragged the younger man into the entrance hall away from the sentrys straining ears pulling a wax tablet from his tunic i have a formal request from legatus sollemnis to the prefect here backed up by a quite astonishing amount of gold for the cohorts burial fund asking him to take you in no dont smile yet man thats only a start even if he says yes which i believe unlikely i expect his first spear will fight the idea tooth and nail i know i would in his place so before we go in to see the prefect here are the two rules that you must follow if we are to see you safe one keep your mouth shut and let me do the talking as much as possible i know these people and you do not two if youre asked a question keep your answer direct and simple if you strike them as anything other than what ive described you wont get past the door understand the cohorts prefect was a darkfaced man from the north coast of africa by marcuss best guess and looked to be in his early thirties he kept a remarkably straight face when rufius handed over his message from sollemnis scanning the tablet for a long moment before tossing it back on the desk in front of the retired officer one hand distractedly teasing his thick brown beard rufius stood impassively in an unconsciously adopted parade rest uncomfortably aware of both the mans stare and his unquestioned power inside the garrisons small world he made no move to retrieve the message after a long pause the prefect shifted his gaze from rufius sizing up marcus in a single glance of his dark brown eyes before speaking in a welleducated and reasonable tone so its better if i dont know his real name hes officially declared traitor his family are either all dead or in hiding and yet the commanding officer of the sixth still sees fit to send him into my care and invites me to betray the empire alongside him he looks like all the other failures my first spear rejects each year during recruitment and yet gaius calidius sollemnis commends him as intelligent and resourceful and asks me to take him under my wing as a centurion im not sure i have sufficient education to express my amazement rufius having taken pains to convince marcus to remain silent no matter what the provocation had the luxury of time in which to draw out a carefully calculated silence of his own before responding prefect equitius this man is a trained praetorian centurion he and i fought together on the road outside yew grove when tribesmen surprised our party and i saw no lack of courage in his eyes on that day he also wounded an armed horseman in mounted combat during his escape from an ambush outside yew grove he also marched from yew grove to this fort in nine days thirty miles a day yes he is tired dirty and footsore but he has courage and determination that you and i should be grateful to call our own with the right guidance he the prefects calm voice trampled over his sentence used to being heard with deference under most circumstances guidance and that would be imparted by whom in your opinion ive got a civil war brewing to both north and south of my sector of the wall and only four of my centurions with recent combat experience ive got problems enough without having to nursemaid an untrained officer besides my first spear would laugh in my face just as you would in his place rufius shifted his position slightly weighing his last weapon of persuasion before throwing it your chosen man dubnus seems to think reasonably well of him equitiuss eyes narrowed at the name he stood and walked around the desk stopping in front of rufius to speak softly into the retired officers right ear dubnus now you do trouble me what part does our very own brigantian warrior prince play in this tale rufius thought quickly praying that marcus would remain silent dubnus and his tent party intervened to save our lives when the barbarians attacked us on the road then he chanced upon me and the young man as we were being hunted through a murky dawn by killers hired by the imperial appointee at yew grove only his impressive skills in combat saved us both from swift and ignominious death at the hands of those heartless mercenaries i was coming to that and you can keep the fancy language for the next time you want to overcharge annius for a consignment of fish pickle as ive received the news a decurion of cavalry from the second asturian horse at cauldron pool and two of his men part of a detachment serving with the sixth on attachment were ambushed by this man and his cronies murdered before they had time to arm themselves all three of them were left dead at the roadside apparently and to add insult to injury two of their horses were butchered for their meat youre telling me that dubnus was a part of that rufius allowed himself to bridle slightly that he defended our lives at the risk of his own taking us for innocent travellers beset by robbers yes that he attacked defenceless cavalrymen no these men were without uniform or insignia and attacked us without hesitation your excellent chosen man saved both of our lives equitius stared hard at the retired officer his face set hard the decurion in the reports i received showed signs of torture a small blade had been used to inflict severe pain upon him as he lay trapped and dying underneath his dead horse the asturians have sworn bloody revenge on their altar to mars you wouldnt know anything about that i suppose rufius shrugged his face remaining impassive more robbers would be my guess prefect desperate to have the decurions money perhaps he made the mistake of abandoning his uniform and since he looked like any other traveller he paid a severe price the other man turned away his face shadowed by disbelief hmmm and dubnus brought him here only as the result of a request from legatus sollemnis passed on by me i work for him in a minor capacity the prefect spun back to face rufius speaking into his ear so quietly that marcus could barely pick out the angry tone of his voice i know the capacity in which you work tiberius rufius assessing the wall units readiness and reporting on the situation beyond the frontier to northern command dont assume that everyone this side of the wall is simple minded enough to mistake you for a trader you should beware your secret reaching the wrong ears on the far side he paced away to stare out of the rooms open window his hair ruffled by the fresh breeze very well ill accept your version of these unfortunate events despite the fact i dont trust a single word ill also try to accept gaius calidius sollemniss request of me since i do trust his judgement and since i still owe him a very substantial debt of gratitude as for the money he sent you to offer ill use that to buy my men some decent equipment if those incompetents over at noisy valley still have anything worth bribing out of their stores quite how i am to discharge this responsibility is at the moment however beyond me he sat down behind his desk surrendering to thought idly pulling at his beard again rufius craned his head around giving marcus another warning stare of instruction to remain silent at length the prefect spoke again his sharp eyes boring into marcuss i presume that you are an educated young man yes prefect and i presume that you speak little or none of the local language very little prefect what weapons training have you received ten years training with the sword and general skill at arms six years horsemanship and seven months as a praetorian centurion prefect the officer got out of his chair again and walked round the desk to look yet more closely into marcuss eyes young man while i respect the guards renowned abilities on the battlefield im not stupid enough to suppose that you actually learnt any of the art of modern warfare during your time in their ranks i hear that it is the practice these days for a certain number of the sons of the aristocracy to be bought positions as praetorian officers each year i hear that they serve with the guard for a period usually in ceremonial roles and are shepherded at all times by experienced subordinates shepherded young man to ensure that they do nothing to degrade their units fighting capabilities marcus winced inwardly at the memory of his clashes with his former chosen man apicius who he had often accused of being too harsh a disciplinarian in return they earn the right to enter the army as senior centurions usually over the heads of men with much greater experience and ability and can then return to rome after a short period of service lucrative positions are open to such men in the urban vigiles or even as praetorian tribunes often it is said such young men do more harm than good in their first years of command and keep more capable men out of the positions they have earned by their efforts and successes to be blunt marcus tribulus corvus and trust me i really dont want to know your true name you have been trained to perform the tasks of a ceremonial officer you know how to ensure that your men look smart on parade you know the etiquette to be observed on palace duty doubtless you know how to address the emperors favourite mistress should you chance upon her being serviced by a gladiator during your rounds of the palace i doubt very much however that you have the first idea as to the requirements of an officer on active service hmm to rufiuss relief marcus kept his eyes firmly fixed on the wall in front of him and said nothing do you really want to make the attempt to gain a centurions rank in this unit do you want it badly enough to accept any terms i place upon allowing you to convince my first spear to accept your candidature marcus hesitated for a moment sought rufiuss eye and receiving a nod from his friend took a breath before speaking prefect my family is destroyed my honour stolen and i am declared traitor this is my last chance to save myself and be of service to rome if i fail to convince you to let me have this chance i will have little option except that of suicide equitius laughed softly but without malice hmm stirring words but im really not the person you need to convince the cohorts first spear was adamant in his refusal turning to glare out of the offices window at the rolling hills beyond the distant parade ground in the atease position as if addressing a gathering of his centurions the individual rings of his mail shone with a high polish across his broad chest while his moustache curled in a magnificent glossy arc down his upper lip he ran a hand across his head reflexively seeking to smooth hair which had long since fallen out or been shaved close to his skull to leave him almost perfectly bald a large man but constant exertion ensured that his body was all muscle given no chance to run to seed no prefect no man in this cohorts onehundredandtwentyyear history has ever attained the rank of centurion without first serving in the ranks as a soldier usually for at least ten years often a good deal longer i have no intention of changing a tradition that has served us well for that long i sir with respect ive seen combat beyond the rampart i know what its like when the bluenoses charge into the shield wall with their swords swinging we never stop telling those boys about the superiority of our way of fighting about the fact that they only need to jab the point of an infantry sword in four inches at the right point of the body to kill a man in seconds we train them day after day to do just that until theyll kill and kill again on instinct alone in the horror of a battle and it still scares the shit out them to have some hairy great bastard swinging a battleaxe and running at full speed into their line the main thing that stops them from running when theyre blasted from head to foot with blood when the man to each side has been either killed or is trying to hold his guts in is me and the other ten officers they know will fight alongside them to the death will stand and fight even if they do turn and run even if only to cover their backs they hate us and they fear us in equal portions but mainly they respect us very few men of nineteen summers have that kind of leadership potential praetorian or not he turned back to face his superior determined to give no ground to the suggestion equitius stared back at him his expression unrepentant as i was trying to say i agree with you completely then why ask me even to speak to him the prefect stood up walking around the desk to join his senior centurion at the window three reasons sextus firstly i took that rascal quintus tiberius rufius to one side once the boy had said his piece and asked him why the sixths commander was willing to risk his life for this matter and the young man doesnt know it but the legatus is his real father nor in my opinion must he find out after the shocks hes had apparently our colleague in arms and the senator were friends in the service tribunes in one of the hispania legions and when sollemnis got a local girl pregnant it was valerius aquila and his new wife who took responsibility for the child and as youll be aware every time you look at the equipment our troops use we owe him more than one favour secondly if we dont give the man the chance to try hell walk out into those hills and fall on his sword ive seen enough men in that situation and he has the same look in his eyes he paused for a moment staring into space at nothing in particular without hope beaten down by circumstance but still determined to stay in control of his destiny i have some respect for that attitude as you may be aware a long silence ensued until the centurion spoke again and your third reason prefect equitius paused for a moment his lips pursed in thought i just wonder if there isnt more to the man than we might suppose youre the judge of men you decide and if i still decide against then tribulus corvus will have to work out his preferred means of taking his own life marcus and rufius jumped to their feet at the sudden opening of the prefects office door the senior centurion stepped through the frame stopping in front of the younger man and looking him up and down with slow care he saw through the shadows of exhaustion a hard face with a determined set its hawkish aspect enough to make a stranger approach with care are you tired candidate yes first spear sir will be enough for the time being yes sir do your feet hurt yes sir are you hungry yes sir could you march another ten miles if your life depended upon it yes sir very well well march the officer accepted his cloak sword and helmet from a soldier who had run to fetch them handing over his vine stick while he buckled the weapon to his body he looked inside the helmet to check the position of the woollen cap that nestled inside the bronze dome catching marcuss sideways glance my one concession to advancing years the old pot can be painful to wear in the absence of hair even with the issue liner and we dont wrap rags round our heads under the helmet in this cohort he secured the helmet by its chinstrap taking his vine stick back from the waiting man dismissed soldier i believe your century have drawn duty cleaning the bathhouse they walked up the forts slope past barrack buildings and staring soldiers to the wall itself towering twelve feet above the forts stone roads first spear frontinius led the way up the ladder of one of the two gate towers bringing marcus out on the rampart the sentries looked on in surprise while he gestured for the roman to look out over the scene beyond the wall a hundredfoot drop almost sheer fell away from the walls base to the plain below a mighty natural defence that must have made the military engineers salivate with its potential when the ramparts line was first planned the escarpment ran in both directions as far as the eye could follow its sinuous path the whitewashed wall that topped its line clearly visible for miles below the wall the ground was more or less flat until it swelled into shallow hills a mile or so distant their slopes heavily forested we cleared away the trees from the land in front of the wall marcus nodded his understanding such open ground would make any covert approach to the fort almost impossible a fairsized lake fed the forts bathhouse the water flowing down from its location on the higher part of the plain a notch had been cut in the escarpment by the stream over the ages and here a hundred yards past the eastern wall of the fort and behind the wall he could see the highdomed roof of the bathhouse frontinius tapped him on the shoulder recapturing his attention this view shows our place and role here more clearly than any speech i might make on this side of the wall there is order order discipline cleanliness the right way of things on the other side there is nothing better than barbarism surly tribesmen with an appetite for roman goods but little desire to enter our society the tribes to our immediate front the selgovae votadini and dumnonii number at least a hundred thousand the tribes from beyond antoninuss wall farther north maeatae and caledonii barbarous tattooed animals all of them as many again even the people to our rear carvetii and brigantes would cheerfully put a dagger between our shoulder blades given half a chance for all their veneer of civilisation we on the wall are ten thousand men in a sea of hostile spears even the northern legions are several days march distant if the natives decide to fight which currently seems inevitable given that their leader calgus has spent most of the last year whipping them up for it well have to face down several times our own number until the legions can get forward and they wont get here at all if the tribes in their own operational areas decide to join the fun life here is as dull as it gets most of the time but it could quickly become a lot more exciting than any of us would wish he led marcus back down through the fort out of the massive southern gate and through its small collection of houses and shops women and children in the street stood respectfully as the officer passed even a couple of hardfaced prostitutes favouring him with smiles they depend on us for their livelihood if the prefect decided that the hill would be more secure without the hangerson they would be destitute mind you there are so many men with women and children in the town now that i suspect they form no risk to our security they marched over a bridge spanning the massive ditch that separated the civilian and military zones marcus readjusting to the renewed pain in his feet the road fell away steeply towards the parade grounds expanse across which several groups of men were training with swords and shields the older man marched briskly past them barking directions to individuals whose performance caught his eye you yes you with the red hair lift your shield higher youre supposed to be stopping bluenose spears not protecting your bloody ankles chosen man show him what i mean he clearly cant understand well done that man excellent sword work they passed the final group and left the parade ground behind before he spoke to marcus again talking at the air in front of him rather than turning to face the younger man recruits in two months well have knocked them into rough shape and toughened them up enough to give them a good chance of surviving a battle and in six theyll be every bit as good as any legionary weve got men serving with ten and twenty years with the cohort some who fought in the last uprising what im being asked to do is put you in command of eighty of those men all of whom since they grew up playing at soldiers in the woods and fields of this area have more idea of real soldiering than you do the very idea of it makes me feel sick this is my cohort my fort and my parade ground i was passed the leadership of them all every man that serves here by my predecessor and when i retire ill bring the best centurion in the cohort down to that parade ground ill make him promise me and the shrines of cocidius jupiter mars and victory to maintain the traditions we live and die by im responsible for those traditions now and for making sure that my decisions are made in the best interests of the unit my cohort he turned his head to look at marcuss face for a moment checking for any reaction the road ran arrow straight up to the next fold in the land making marcus open his mouth to increase his air intake but he kept his eyes fixed on the horizon the prefect knows very well what his role here is and so do i hes here for two or three years to represent rome and make decisions as to the course of action the cohort should follow in romes service ive been here for my entire adult life and ill stay here until i retire or die in combat my word as to the ways in which those decisions are carried out is final although since we respect each others judgement he will usually issue orders upon which weve agreed jointly i also make all decisions as to who is allowed to enter service based on what centurions tell me and on what i see with my own eyes and from what i see and hear you represent a good deal of trouble to both the prefect and this unit if it were a simple yes or no on those grounds i wouldnt even be taking this trouble to understand you better he fell silent for a moment as they marched on side by side and then spoke again the prefect however sees something in you that he encourages me to consider before making that decision your threat of suicide found a chink in his armour you may not have appreciated his uncle fell on his own sword after losing most of a cohort just like this one in the german forests twenty years ago but not before writing to tell his nephew why he was doing it prefect equitius still has the tablet consequently his sense of honour is his prime motivation when he considers your case would you do the same marcus blinked for a second at the unexpected question yes sir i would have no other remaining choice very well frontinius stopped walking under the shadow of a lone tree growing by the roadside and drew his gladius with a swift movement holding it towards marcus with the hilt foremost the sun eased one corner of its disc out from behind the cloud that had obscured it for much of the day caressing the landscape with a slender strand of light take the sword marcus did so with a sudden feeling of utter detachment hefting the weapon with one hand judging the weapons fine balance and razorsharp blade it goes with the responsibilities i bear passed from each first spear to his successor its an old weapon forged in the year of the four emperors over a hundred years ago and it belonged to a prefect who rewarded an act of bravery in battle which saved his life with the gift of his personal weapon the courage youve shown to get this far entitles you to fall on a blade whose honour is indisputable he stood in silence on the empty road watching marcus intently his body taut in its readiness for action with one hand resting lightly on his daggers ornately decorated handle marcus looked at the weapons blade for a long moment before speaking his senses sharpened perceptibly the tiny sounds of bird calls and the breezes ruffling of his hair suddenly catching his attention although the colours of grass and sky seemed to fade to dusty washedout shades thank you first spear for at least providing me with a dignified exit i must now look to find revenge for these wrongs in the next life clamping his mouth firmly shut he steeled himself for the act placing the swords point firmly against his sternum and taking a last deep breath before throwing himself forward a strong arm whipped out and grabbed his rough shirt as he fell towards the ground turning him in midair he hit the roads surface hard on his back losing his hold on the swords hilt and letting it fall frontinius looked down at him holding his hand out with a new respect in his eyes you meant it thats something marcus reached up and took the hand offered by the officer climbing back on to his feet the officers sword was already back in its scabbard im sorry that was deliberately cruel but i had to know if you had the stomach for what you threatened frontinius was intrigued by the look he received in return for his apology the dark eyes seeming to skewer his soul perhaps if the man were trained to use that ability what would you have done if i had failed to use the sword or turned it upon you a laugh cracked frontiniuss face despite the gravity of the situation id have cut your throat with this he pulled the dagger cocked his wrist and threw the short blade putting it cleanly into the centre of a truncated branch that projected a foot out from the trees trunk at head height lopped off by a work gang when it had grown to obstruct the road he reached to retrieve the knife speaking over his shoulder theyre not made for throwing but when you practise enough anythings possible as you may discover now march they walked on along the roads arrowstraight path passing an eightman detachment patrolling back towards the hill keep marching the older man turned back for a hundred yards marching alongside the detachment and studying each mans uniform in turn before turning once more calling over his shoulder to the tent partys leader a very good turn out young man well make a chosen man of you yet thank you first spear he jogged back along the road to catch marcus barely breathing hard with the effort slowing to a brisk walk he resumed the conversation my cohort less than a thousand men is expected to keep the peace along this sector of the line out to a range of fifty or so miles either side of the wall we are the only law this country has both in front of and behind the rampart we control two tribal gathering points the only place those peoples are permitted to come together and then only under the supervision of an officer of this unit they hate us with a passion more so since we are their own people turned to the empires purpose and within our area of control there are fifty of them for every soldier within our walls our strength the thing that counterbalances that disadvantage in numbers is our discipline the strength of our resolve we dominate the ground we know its secrets and we own every fold and seam they know that know that well die to keep it ours but that many more of them will have to die to take it from us yes there are legions within a few days march but well have to meet any attempt to dislodge us alone most likely us and the other ten thousand or so men like us along the frontier men join this unit at an average age of fourteen summers serve most of their adult lives in the ranks most of that time doing boring or dirty jobs unless they get the chance to become an immune with a few hours of death and terror thrown in every few years some of them the better soldiers rise to command tent parties or if theyre really effective to the position of watch officer and even fewer to chosen man deputy to their centurion responsible for keeping the century aligned and pointing the right way in battle the best of them the boldest and the bravest ten men in eight hundred reach the position of centurion with their own rooms high rates of pay but most of all with the privilege of leading their century into battle in the proud traditions of the tungrians what makes you think you can live up to their ideal marcus took a moment before replying weighing his words carefully to avoid his earnestness being mistaken for desperation i cant promise you that i will but i can promise you that i will do everything in my power to make it so the older man stopped trying hard to suppress a smile as he cocked a sardonic eyebrow so well do for you for now will we until the issue of your legal status is forgotten what then i wonder marcuss nostrils flared with his anger and he turned swiftly making the other man tense involuntarily and extend a stealthy hand towards his swords hilt as a dirty brokennailed finger tapped his armoured chest enough ive been hunted across this country questioned by you and your prefect as if i were a criminal instead of an innocent man whose entire family has been slaughtered and had my honour and my ability doubted one time too many ive put up with it all because ive been in no position to argue with the men judging me and perhaps thats still the case but for now ive tolerated just as much as i can so make your mind up first spear either give me the chance i crave or cut my bloody throat but you will stop playing with me one way or another folding his arms he glared back at the officer clearly at the end of his patience frontinius nodded slowly walking around him in a slow deliberate circle until he once again faced the younger man so there is anger in there it just needed a spark to light the tinder just as well too youd be no good to me if you didnt have fire in your guts although youll be sorry if you ever speak to me that way in front of any other man very well im decided ill go against tradition break the rules and offer you a bargain ill give you a position as centurion probationary mind you and with the decision as to your suitability entirely mine on the condition that i get something i need something my cohort needs more than anything else right now youve accepted him equitiuss eyes widened with genuine surprise yes hes being issued with his equipment now the prefect smiled quietly thank you youve allowed me to discharge a debt to sollemnis the senior centurion grimaced well see all ive agreed to is to give him a chance one i fully expect him to fail to grasp in return i get two centurions for the price of one or more likely one very good centurion and a corpse for quiet burial equitius stared at him questioningly his first spear smiled grimly in return well you didnt think i was going to let a fully trained legion centurion slip through my fingers did you i had a quiet chat with tiberius rufius earlier today and he made me an interesting proposition given our current dearth of trained centurions its a deal i resolved to accept only if there was a hint of talent in young corvus which to be fair there is your friend the legatus gets a hiding place for his son and in return i get the use of his man rufius until the first snowfall of next winter sounds like fair barter to me marcus didnt realise how his place with the tungrians had been secured until the soldier ordered to take him to the forts stores for equipping pointed him through the door into their twilight world quintus tiberius rufius stood waiting for him beside the long wooden counter a pile of equipment and clothing stacked next to him marcus paused in the doorway for a moment adjusting to both the gloom and his own surprise quintus what are you the older man grinned sheepishly clearly torn between his pleasure at being back in uniform and what his presence said for the provenance of his friends recruitment ive taken the salt again lad accepted the offer of a centurions berth for a year or more if it works out well marcus made the connection and his face creased with sudden anger so i get a chance to make a new start at the cost of your service well it isnt going to he stopped speaking brought to a halt by rufiuss raised hand just a moment lad you come here the stores clerk detached himself from the rack of spears behind which hed been lurking and unwillingly presented himself at the counters far side rufius shot out an arm grasping him firmly by one ear and dragging his head across the broad expanse of agepolished wood interesting was it our conversation the head shook vigorously or as much as possible with one ear pinned to the counter rufius drew his dagger and slid the point under the pinned ears flesh allowing the steel to caress its curve good lets be clear if i hear anything about the last minute of my private conversation with my friend here repeated ill have this ear off your head within the hour you might be an immune but it wont protect you from my blade got it the head nodded frantically good now go and hide in the back of this shed and dont come back out until i tell you to the clerk vanished into the gloom without a backward glance rufius turned back to his friend with a wry smile one thing you learn early on everything you say in a cohorts stores is public property just as sure as the stores officer is the richest man in the fort if he has an ounce of wit about him now you were in the middle of telling me how you werent going to tolerate such treatment my being blackmailed to serve with the cohort in return for your safety i rufius raised his hands again silencing the other man one moment before you say any more i think i should make my position clear when sollemnis asked me to bring you here he warned me that prefect equitius is desperately short of experienced officers he cautioned me that equitius or more likely his first spear might try to induce me to serve here and do you know when he told me that my heart fairly leapt in my chest you think im being blackmailed and yes frontinius thinks that hes extorted a bargain from me that serves him well but the real winner here is me marcus frowned his lack of understanding but why surely youve earned an easier time after twentyfive years of service rufius reached into the pile of his new kit pulling from it his vine stick the twisted wood shiny from years of use see this a simple piece of wood with no more value than kindling for a fire until i pick it up in my hands however it becomes the symbol of my authority for fifteen years i carried another very much like this all over this country until it was like part of my body it was the first thing i reached for in the morning and the last thing i put down at night and let me tell you i loved that life and do you want to know the worst day of my twentyfive years under the eagle marcus nodded his anger fading to a sad resignation rufius gave a faraway look his eyes seeing something other than the storehouse walls my worst day it wasnt the first one at the recruiting camp in gaul where i joined up where they cut off all my hair and my new centurion chased us round the parade ground until we puked our guts up it wasnt the day when my century was ambushed in the tava valley and seventyseven men became fiftythree and a collection of dying men and corpses in less than ten minutes brigantia forgive me it wasnt even the day that my wife died before her time taken from me by the cold and the damp although its a closerun race he took a deep breath no my very worst day in all that time was the very last one when i had to hand my vine stick back to my legatus it was a misty day and the entire legion was on parade centuries stretching away into the grey until they were invisible all i had to do was march up the line of my cohort take their salute march to the legatus hand him my vine stick salute aboutface and watch the legion parade off it seemed to take for ever and yet it was over in the blink of an eye i stood there beside him as the legion stamped off the parade ground watching my cohort under the command of another man a friend that id been grooming for the job for years chosen from among my centurions it was like watching your wife on another mans arm he turned from the memory fixing marcus with a serious stare so centurion when sextus frontinius smiles at you and you know full well that hes thinking that hes got an experienced officer at the expense of your troubling him for just as long as it takes to find a reason to declare you a failure heres what you say to yourself quintus tiberius rufius is as happy as a pig in the deepest shit he can find and you my lad are not going to fail not with me here to keep you straight got that marcus nodded blowing out a pentup breath got it good now have they told you who your chosen mans going to be i only ask because frontinius made a special point of telling me on the way down here he seemed to think it was quite funny marcus nodded again his lips pursed with foreboding so would i if i didnt think it was going to be so damned difficult to the romans huge surprise dubnus took the news of marcuss appointment as centurion to the cohorts th century with himself as the new chosen man with perfect equanimity he waited until they were alone in his centurions quarters before tackling the subject head on dubnus looked at him without any obvious emotion shrugging his shoulders youre worried that im angry about this but you dont need to be im not angry and i dont want to talk about it now get into uniform and lets go and look at what weve got here marcus persisted not willing to believe it could be that simple from the big britons perspective we need to talk dubnus and it wont wait i youre a centurion im a chosen man ill do as you command this is not a problem but youre a warrior a true soldier i walk into your fort already owing you a life and get promoted to centurion just like that you should want to put your fist through my face how can you take this so easily perhaps youll be a real centurion i content myself with being the best chosen man in the cohort instead better than half of the officers and they know it but ill never be a centurion ive already been told as much marcus realised in a flash what was holding the man back stunned both by the insight and the way the other man had been held from his potential youve been told that you wont be an officer so many times youve stopped even trying what my father used to call a selffulfilling prophecy look the first spear told me all about your father and how he was deposed from his throne when you were still a boy how he sent you here when he was dying he told me that he doesnt believe youll fight your own people when the time comes that he believes youre the best soldier in the cohort to satisfy your wounded pride not because you want to serve he doubts your commitment dubnus not your abilities the other man just shrugged marcus smiled giddy with relief at making the mental leap to see through the bluff soldiers reserve and hes told you youll never make it to centurion so many times that youve started to believe it i can change that you can be a centurion if you want to dubnus stared into his eyes for a long moment testing the sincerity of the words youll help me to become a centurion why marcus took a deep breath dubnus youve said it a dozen times in the last week i was a praetorian officer but i never saw action so it was just a ceremonial job looking good in uniform knowing what to say to whom im going to need you to help me be a real officer a warrior leader what else can i give you in return i make you a warrior youll make me a centurion not a warrior i may yet surprise you in that respect a warrior leader its what ill have to achieve if im to survive here or die trying perhaps marcus noted that the briton wasnt smiling the centurys barrack block was primitive in comparison with the facilities his men had enjoyed in rome but marcus ignored the condition of his quarters as he got into his new uniform the red tunic was savagely rough in comparison to the fine white cloth hed worn as a guard officer thick woollen leggings tickled his legs and made him sweat in the buildings shelter although he guessed that their warmth would seem little enough on a cold winter morning he bent to examine his armour and weapons laid out across his bed noting with dismay the patina of rust that dusted the mail coats rings his helmet was slightly dented on one side pulling his sword from its scabbard he peered closely at the blade blunt dubnus nodded unhappily annius keeps his best equipment for those willing to pay you get second best it was true the clothing hed been issued was on closer inspection well worn i see first things first inspection they marched into the first of the eightman rooms troops scattering with surprise from their game of dice attention the soldiers froze into ramrodstraight poses at dubnuss bellowed command shuffling to make room for marcus to walk into the cramped room he looked slowly around taking in the dirty straw scattered haphazardly across the barrack floor and the poorly stacked weapons and shields in the outer room noticing the squads food ration for the day waiting next to the small oven in and on which all cooking was done for the eight men he turned to shout through the open door chosen sir dubnus stepped into the room looking at the food to which marcus was pointing with his vine stick a couple of the men cast him sidelong glances of amazement nobody had warned them that they had new officers never mind that one of them was the man they called the prince when they were sure he wasnt listening is that quality of food normal for this cohort the salted fish looked green in parts the fresh vegetables riddled with holes from the attentions of parasites only the bread fresh from the forts oven invited closer attention no sir i see chosen whats the normal size of tent party in this cohort eight so why are there nine men in this barrack dubnus growled a question at the nearest soldier in his own language he says that one soldier has taken a whole room for himself theyre all scared to fight him including the acting centurion marcus stiffened with anger as much at the acquiescence of socalled fighting men with this act of bullying as with the offence itself so a man has to sleep on the floor take me to that barrack they marched down the line of doors the frightened soldier pointing to the offending door dubnus put his long chosen mans pole down on the floor flexing his powerful hands and clenching them into fists he spoke to marcus without taking his eyes off the barracks door ill do this it was a statement rather than a request a baldly stated invitation for marcus to step back from the physical side of his role and it tempted him more than he had expected it would be so easy to let the briton pull this miscreant from his room and discipline him shaking his head in refusal marcus pushed him gently but firmly aside rapping on the door with his vine stick inspection open this door a clatter sounded from inside the door bursting open to reveal a halfclad man wielding a wooden stave long hair hung lank across his shoulders pale blue eyes staring insolently from a hatchet face you tosser trajan ill what surprised by the appearance of an unfamiliar officer at his door he hesitated the crucial second that marcus needed taking a quick step forward he jabbed the sticks blunt end forcefully into the britons sternum dropping him to the ground in writhing agony dubnus stepped forward collecting the stave with a sideways glance of surprise at his new centurion before effortlessly lifting the soldier to his unsteady feet marcus tucked his stick under one arm forcing himself to give off waves of confidence with an audience of a dozen or so of his new commands rank and file he couldnt afford to get this wrong name the soldier his initial shock starting to wear off glared at him from beneath heavy black eyebrows dubnus still holding him up by one arm flexed his fingers and squeezed the bicep hard communicating without words antenoch ah centurion chosen do you know this man a good warrior a poor soldier he lacks discipline the soldier sneered at his face disregarding the pain in his gut what i lack dubnus is any vestige of respect for your authority and even more so his he nodded in marcuss direction the roman raised a hand to dubnus preventing the explosion of rage he saw building on the big mans face keeping his voice dead level like it or not im your new centurion soldier so youll follow my instructions to the letter which begin with my telling you to return that barrack to the men you evicted to take possession and return to your given tent party if you dont like taking orders from me you can try to take it out on me on the practice field tomorrow morning but until then move your gear now the other man locked eyes with him momentarily found steel in their gaze and shook his arm free slouching off into the empty barrack chosen which of this disorganised rabble was responsible for discipline until our arrival the briton turned pointing to one of the men gathered in silent amazement at the turn of events his face blank with the shock chosen man trajan in temporary command of the century while theres no officer available marcus swivelled to regard the man with a glare of contempt trajan step forward centurion the man stepped white faced from the throng coming to attention and pushing out his chest this century is a disgrace to the cohort you are hereby reduced to the rank of soldier chosen find this soldier a tent party you might also want to discuss the matter of the quality of the centurys rations at some length along with the possibility of a donation to the funeral club perhaps you could take him over the wall for a short patrol in the forest later now i want a full parade of the century here centurion dubnus strode away beating at each door in turn and shouting parade at the top of his voice men flew from each barrack pulling at hastily donned items of clothing as they fell in to the rapidly swelling unit within a moment the parade was complete the demoted trajan pushed carelessly into the line to more astonished glances while marcus stood in front of the wideeyed soldiers biding his time several window shutters on the quarters facing the ths barrack quietly opened just enough for their occupants to peer through the gaps but remain out of view hidden from dubnuss searching eyes once dubnus had commanded the gathering to shut your fucking mouths marcus gave a cursory inspection noting the poor repair of almost every mans tunics and boots and the generally unkempt and undernourished look that predominated returning to his place in front of the parade he called to dubnus translate for me chosen lets make sure everyone understands centurion soldiers of the ninth century i am your new centurion marcus tribulus corvus from this moment i formally assume command of this century and become responsible for every aspect of your wellbeing discipline training and readiness for war he paused looking to dubnus who drew a large breath and spat a stream of his native language at the troops one fucking smile cough or fart from any one of you cock jockeys and ill put my pole so far up that mans shithole that it wont even scrape on the floor this is your new centurion and you will treat him with the appropriate degree of respect if you dont want to lead short and very fucking interesting lives he turned to marcus and nodded indicating that the roman should continue i can see from the state of your uniforms that youve been neglected a state of affairs that i intend to address very shortly i have yet to see your readiness for battle but i can assure you that you will be combat ready in the shortest possible time i do not intend to command a century that i would imagine is regarded as the laughing stock of its unit for any longer than i have to dubnus cast a pitying sneer over the faces in front of him before speaking again watching their faces lengthen with the understanding of his methods passed by whispered word of mouth from his previous century youre not soldiers youre a fucking waste of rations a disgrace to the tungrians you look like shit you smell like shit and youre probably about as hard as shit that will change i will kick your lazy fucking arses up and down every hill in the country if i have to but you will be real soldiers i will make you ready to kill and die for the honour of this century with spear or sword or your fucking teeth and nails if need be marcus cast a questioning look at him half guessing that the chosen man was deviating from his script but chose not to challenge his subordinate youll have better food uniforms and equipment and soon your retraining starts tomorrow morning so prepare yourselves life in this century changes now dubnus smiled broadly showing his teeth with pleasure your hairy white arses are mine from this second get ready to grab your ankles marcus turned to dubnus once youve had a conversation with soldier trajan you are to ensure that all barracks are cleaned out fresh flooring is distributed and that all men have practice equipment ready for morning exercises ill see you on parade in the morning dismissed sir dubnus turned on his troops spitting a stream of orders in all directions marcus walked away towards his quarter only a tremor at the corner of one eye evidencing the exhaustion washing through his body sweeping the equipment off his bed he collapsed gratefully on to the lumpy mattress closed his eyes and slept later that night as equitius settled into bed alongside his wife he replayed the days events in his mind a rueful shake of his head caught her attention well then youve been in a world of your own all evening what is it eh oh nothing i received a replacement officer this morning well two although one of them is a nineteenyearold aristocrat fresh from the grove a gift from our good friend gaius calidius sollemnis really did they bring news of the legatus and his family paccia was a close friend of the legatuss wife and missed her visits to yew grove recently made impractical by the growing enmity of the local brigantians equitius was already wondering whether he shouldnt pack her off down the north road to the fortress and its relative safety from the border areas uncertainties again of a sort look these new arrivals arent good news not for sollemnis and not for us he sent them to us as a means of hiding a fugitive from the emperor his wife propped herself up on one elbow her forehead furrowed but why thats treason septimus exactly the lads his son and thats a pretty good reason for sollemnis not to want him delivered for justice plus hes the adopted son of a roman senator who was unjustly accused and executed by commoduss cronies as a means of appropriating his land and wealth and therefore the son of a declared traitor and youve agreed to harbour him inside this fort ive made him a centurion actually paccia sat up in bed her eyes wide with fear and anger he raised a hand to forestall her outburst listen to me paccia and listen well ive served the empire in a succession of commands in places that neither of us really wanted do you remember syria that heat the sand that got absolutely everywhere the rain in germania and the cold no man can accuse me of ever stinting in my loyalty to the throne even when i could just have walked away to relax as a civilian the boy is an innocent victim of imperial greed and the gods know that should be enough for us he is also the son of a man to whom i have a sworn debt of honour hes also a trained officer praetorian in fact and he brought an experienced legionary centurion here with him as well that could be invaluable in the next few months septimus i no paccia and ive never done this to you before but no the decision is made when men in authority turn a blind eye to the iniquities of a misguided ruler all hope will be lost for the empire he stays he turned away on his side setting his face obdurately against any further protest and prayed to his gods that this was not a decision for which he would pay with both their lives in the noncommissioned officers mess dubnus was sitting in a dark corner nursing a leather cup less than a quarter full of the thick sweet local beer morban the th centurys standardbearer and in both age and rank his superior came through the door his squat frame filling the frame for a moment while he searched out his friend finding his man he raised an arm in salute grasping the passing mess steward by his arm propelling him towards the serving counter with a command for two beers and make them full to the brim this time before waddling across the room to plump himself into the chair facing dubnus together they represented the ths heart and soul morban as the centurys standardbearer was also the treasurer of the funeral club that ensured each man a decent burial whether serving or retired squat and muscular ugly balding and approaching the ripe age of forty with twentytwo years in the cohort morban was at the same time the ths greatest cynic and the fiercest protector of its currently flimsy reputation among the other centuries more than one soldier had found his head locked under morbans thick arm while the big man went to work at a brief but effective facial rearrangement dubnus you great oaf good to see you back not so good however after a long day locked away in an audit of the funeral club records to find that spotty little oik of a trumpeter waiting as i came off duty whats so urgent that i didnt even have the time to nip over and see my lad on guard duty not that i mind the chance to put a beaker or two away the steward ambled up with full beakers managing to spill a good splash down morbans tunic in the process of handing them over the standardbearer gripped him by the front of his own tunic pulling him down to face level almost bent double very fucking funny these just became free beers or you can clean my tunic with your tongue the retired soldier scuttled away cursing under his breath morban scowled after him to reinforce the point tipping his beaker back for long enough to put half its contents down his throat right lad whats your problem dubnus drank from his own measure setting the beaker down and staring at his friend for a moment before he spoke in his own language youve not heard then heard what i told you ive been knee deep in records scrolls all day dubnus took a drink drawing the moment out youve got new officers morban a chosen man and a centurion chosen man and centurion whos the chosen i am the burly standardbearers face lit up with pleasure as he leaned over the table and slapped dubnuss shoulder in congratulation excellent best news ive had all day be good to have a real soldier stood behind the ninth for a change his face became sly sudden realisation dawning and i presume this means that halfwit trajan got his marching orders dubnus smiled evilly dropping a bag of coins on to the table soldier trajan has declared his eagerness to make a donation to the funeral club as atonement for all the money he fleeced from the ninths rations budget in league with that greasy storeman annius our new centurion actually ordered me to take him over the wall on patrol and give him the choice cough up the cash or take the consequences at which point he coughed up quickly enough a pity really i wouldve enjoyed cracking his nuts morban drained his beaker waving imperiously to the sulking steward for a refill well dubnus lad you as our chosen trajan back in a tent party which one by the way second the second perfect i imagine hes biting on the leather strap even as we speak now make my day complete chosen and tell me who our new centurion might be eh dubnus drank deeply again eyeing the other man speculatively over the rim of his beaker then put the drink down and took a deep breath that morban is the bit i need your help with marcus woke at dubnuss rousing before dawn the next morning blinking into the light of a small lamp placed next to his bed you report to the first spear at dawn with all the other centurions ive got your report here for you the briton watched while he washed in a bowl of cold water in the lamps tiny bubble of light dragging a sharp knife across his stubble to reduce the growth to a tolerable shadow you dont have to fight antenoch ill talk to him tell him it wouldnt be wise hell see reason soon enough marcus paused in his shave cocking an eyebrow at his friend and when none of them respect me seeing me hide behind your strength what then i have to do this and i have to win if im to command here all of the other centurions rose from the ranks took their beatings and gave them back with interest frontinius made that perfectly clear to me yesterday i have to prove that i can control my men by my own efforts not simply through yours but thank you dubnus shrugged slapping a writing tablet into marcuss hand your choice now get dressed tunic armour and weapons and go to the principia make your report ill wake the century outside the cold dawn air was freckled with drizzle a swirling curtain of windblown moisture soothing the heat in his recently shaved face the headquarters building was quiet a pair of soldiers standing guard at the entrance beneath the usual reliefs of mars and victory inside at the far end of the basilica stood another pair keeping the eternal vigil over the cohorts inner sanctum the chapel of the standards behind their swords lay not only the cohorts battle standards its very soul but the units pay and savings chests heavy with the accumulated coin of the soldiers spending money and burial funds following the sound of voices marcus found the space outside the prefects office crowded with uniformed officers bearded faces turning briefly to regard him with combinations of indifference and hostility probably noting the threadbare nature of his tunic and the poor condition of his mail coat before turning pointedly to ignore his presence rufius emerged from the group clearly already at ease among men whom he would naturally consider his equals and walked across to marcuss side morning lad ready with your report marcus showed him the tablet good speak up nice and loud dont let this lot put you off you cant expect them to accept you overnight now i hear that youre intending to demonstrate some of those few things again this morning marcus nodded glum faced making the veteran officer smile despite himself dont look so worried all youve got to do is imagine that hes a bluenose looking at you down three feet of iron and im sure that the rest will come to you easily enough just remember keep it simple no fancy stuff mind you just put your toy sword into his ribs nice and hard and teach the stupid brit some respect he smiled encouragement before sidling back towards the group of centurions nodding at some comment marcus was unable to make out one man his hair and beard equally bristly in appearance favoured him with a tight smile and seemed about to open his mouth to speak when sextus frontinius stepped out of his office and called the gathering to attention unit reports gentlemen first century one of the throng considered his writing tablet solemnly intoning his report first spear first century reports seventyseven spears three men on annual leave nine men detached for duties beyond the wall two men sick and sixtythree men ready for duty second century first spear second century reports seventynine spears five men on annual leave one man sick and seventythree men ready for duty with the exception of the th century which had a detachment of fifty men escorting a delivery of weapons in from the main depot at noisy valley on the north road fifteen miles to the east the reports were much the same marcus managed to stammer out his report when the time came attracting more hostile glares from the other officers then waited with burning cheeks for the session to end and allow him to escape when it did the centurions milled about in idle conversation in the few minutes before the morning parade leaving him to stand awkwardly to one side like the proverbial spare guest at a wedding for a moment before walking quietly away from the gathering whatever hed expected a friendly welcome did not seem to be on the agenda and rufius had clearly decided that he must find his way into the group without any obvious help centurion corvus he stopped and turned back coming to attention as he recognised the first spears booming voice first spear the other man walked up to him ignoring the curious stares of the other officers standing almost toe to toe in order to speak in quiet but fierce tones i hear that youve invited an enlisted man to try his luck this morning marcus swallowed more afraid of the other man than of the mornings coming events yes sir a troublemaker called antenoch hell get his chance to see what his new officers made of frontinius stared at him without expression gauging his new centurions composure as will we all it was bound to happen of course since theyve no way to measure you against their own standards i wasnt expecting it quite so soon though he turned away leaving marcus uncertain as to whether he should wait or walk away frontinius turned back nodding his head slightly at least you had the sense to call his bluff one piece of advice though centurion yes sir win half an hour later the cohorts centuries marched out into the dawns growing light down through the tight little township that clung to the forts skirts dressed in their training rig of tunics leggings and boots they carried shields and wooden swords in readiness for the mornings training exercises a few windows opened to allow curious children to peer out at the marching men searching for the men their mothers had pointed out to them on other occasions the drizzle was still falling whipped into misty curtains of tiny silver droplets by the eddying wind making the air both cold and damp rufius strolled alongside his century conversing with his standardbearer with a carefully calculated indifference i hear that theres a score being settled on parade this morning the muscular standardbearer nodded quickly keeping his eyes fixed firmly to his front so we all hear centurion apparently the other new officer has decided to let one of his men try to take him down with sword and shield rufius stole a sideways glance at the other man really and who is this soldier thats so keen to test my colleague a snorted laugh gave him a clue as to the mans likely loyalties test antenoch will break his ribs and send the boy packing back to mummy in under a minute the mans a lunatic except he doesnt need the full moon to release his madness half the time your young friend had better know what hes getting into rufius lifted an eyebrow my young friend all i did was arrive here at the same time he did besides if he cant look after himself the standardbearer nodded approvingly at the sentiment and rufius pressed on with his gambit i also hear that a man can place a wager with you and expect the bet to be honoured the other man looked at him warily taking his eyes of the road for the first time no man im not about to interfere with your business far from it i just wondered what odds youre offering this morning the standardbearer frowned at him almost tripping over a loose cobble in the road odds you want to place a bet on another officer getting a beating rufius grinned at him in reply i think youll find standardbearer that im a little more financially aware than the average officer now odds unless you want to find your opportunities to fleece your fellow soldiers somewhat more restricted than they are now the standardbearers eyes narrowed im offering five to four on the lunatic five to one the centurion and hows the betting so far heavy on antenoch which is no surprise and not a single coin on the boy rufius nodded no surprise at all i think i ought to have a small sum on my colleague show my solidarity shall we say a nice discreet twentyfive denarii on the officer the standardbearers eyes widened and rufius stared back at him levelly and before you blurt out anything we might both regret the deal is this you dont tell anyone i wagered with you to avoid spoiling my reputation while i keep my bet strictly between us to avoid spoiling your odds you still make a nice profit you keep your business intact and i might just make some money it might be an idea to ease the centurions odds in a little though just in case he should actually be quicker with a sword than youve given him credit for and smile man if im right ill be the only person you pay out to today marcuss th century was at the rear of the column under the watchful eye of the first spear who marched this morning alongside dubnus in the chosen mans place at the centurys rear marcus winced inwardly as the briton cursed his way down the hill sufficiently enraged by the poor standard of marching discipline to dive into the ranks and pull one offender out to walk alongside him slapping the miscreant with every misplaced step reaching the parade ground spread across the floor of the valley below the steep approach to the fort the cohort broke into centurysized groups as the centurions and their senior soldiers marshalled the troops into their parade positions marcus stepped out in front of his century suddenly calm in the moment of decision turning he found dubnuss face looming over the century in his accustomed place to the rear of the ranks of soldiers his long brassknotted chosen mans pole shining dimly in the early mornings pale light and took strength from its stolid set a shouted command floated down the ranks of men ordering the unit to commence the set routine of warmup exercises that would prepare them for their morning training session grateful for the distraction marcus watched the centurions to either side carefully copying each new bend and stretch taking pleasure in the physical exercise his new command he noticed were less enthusiastic after fifteen minutes the order to commence training was passed down the line marcus braced himself and stepped forward closing to within a few paces of his front rank meeting the suspicious and hostile gazes of those of his men that he could see with a careful mask of indifference good morning gentlemen normally well start the morning by rotating the tent parties between sword spear and shield training today however since im new to most of you well start with a demonstration of the kind of swordsmanship im going to expect from you do i have a volunteer to help me demonstrate antenoch shouldered his way to the front rank his long plaited hair matted by the falling drizzle he stepped out in front of marcus his mouth set in an implacable whitelipped slash i volunteer for that privilege marcus ignored the sneering note in the other mans voice taking his wooden practice sword from its place at his waist then called for another hefting the practice weapons as if testing their relative weights his lips were suddenly cold in the chill air and his fingers slightly numb as theyd been that afternoon on the road to yew grove and then in the instant of settling the swords into their accustomed positions at his sides ready to lift into the longpractised fighting stance having the handle of a weapon in each hand was suddenly mercifully the most natural thing in the world he felt an almost blissful return to the simple disciplines drummed into him during the thousands of sunny afternoons of his childhood and a moment of simplicity in the heart of his personal confusion i can do this he suddenly thought to himself and the spark of belief lit a cold fire that ignited in his belly something deeper than anger calmer than rage cold rational calculating purpose filled the place where doubt and confusion had circled each other events slowing to a more relaxed pace as his brain adjusted to its unexpected confidence i can do this he told himself with surprise i grew up doing this antenoch took his weapon and shield wristing the sword in blurring arcs clearly calculated to impress the watching troops dropping into a brief leg stretch before jumping back to his feet looking to his right marcus could see that half of the neighbouring century was watching with poorly disguised excitement antenoch threw him a mock gladiatorial salute pulling his shield and sword into position ready youd better find a shield centurion or this will be even quicker than were all expecting marcus stepped into sword reach unconsciously adjusting the swords positions until the points of the practice weapons were aligned rock steady less than a foot from the britons shield the soldiers watching stirred at the sight their first intimation that all was not quite as they had expected and a ripple of whispered comments like wind through tall grass spread through their ranks marcuss eyes stonelike in their concentration locked on to antenochs the way hed been taught watching the eyes not the weapon for the first signs of an attack ill stick with the swords if its all the same to you we dont use body protection for sparring i see antenoch smiled sourly from behind his shield half turning his head to share his ridicule with the ranks of silent soldiers no sir this isnt rome this is a real fighting unit marcus shrugged without visible emotion oh im not concerned for myself i just dont want to injure you too badly guard your chest what the enraged briton sprang in to the attack swinging his sword in a brutal overhand chopping blow down on to marcuss quickly raised lefthand sword the defending weapons edge splintering slightly at the blow marcus allowed the sword to give downwards with the blow absorbing its force and stepped back to further soften the impact encouraging antenoch to strike again rather than punching with the shield again the sword chopped down at marcuss raised defence and again he retreated lowering the sword slightly more this time and once again antenoch lifted his weapon to strike sensing the romans apparently feeble defence beginning to fail under his sword blows as the sword reached the zenith of its attacking arc marcus dropped his rear leg a little farther back turning the foot to gain maximum purchase on the parade grounds hardpacked surface while the other sword stirred stealthily in his right hand easing back into position for attack antenoch chopped down again exerting his full strength in a blow intended to smash the left arm down and open marcuss defences the roman met the descending sword with a suddenly rigid defence braced off his extended back leg to stop the blow dead simultaneously he threw the other sword in backhanded smashing aside antenochs almost disregarded shield and opening the soldiers body to attack the momentary gap in his adversarys defence was enough for marcus to strike again with his righthand weapon chopping mercilessly at the other mans right wrist and sending his weapon tumbling from suddenly nerveless fingers on to the wet ground before hammering the left hand sword into the britons ribs the counterattack left antenoch clutching at bruised ribs while marcus stepped back keeping the twin swords raised he watched antenoch trying to both cradle his wrist and rub his stomach for a moment calling softly to the briton i told you to guard your chest enough the other man glared back at him hefting his weapons back into their positions fight taking the initiative marcus stepped back into his opponents sword reach and went to work with clinical skill and speed his swords a sudden whirl of blurring arcs as he attacked with pace and technique for which the briton had no answer half a dozen swift strikes put the other man off balance allowing marcus to smash at his shield with each sword in turn until the third blow delivered with his lefthand sword wrenched the shield from antenochs hand and left him unable to defend himself as the other wooden blade smacked across his back dropping him to his knees with sudden agony in his kidneys marcus stepped away from the writhing figure and turned to address his troops noting that more than a few were watching the squirming briton with the slackjawed look of men who were finding it hard to believe what they saw dubnus stared over their heads one eyebrow raised in silent comment farther down the line he could see rufius out in front of his th century his fist held clenched below a smile of congratulation disappointing gentlemen if thats the best we have you evidently need a great deal of training speed and technique will disarm the strongest and bravest of opponents you will have noted that the use of the shield in attack is as important as the sword you will learn to fight this way as well as in the standard formations and drills you will be the best century in this cohort with your personal weapons or i and my chosen man will want to know why he dropped the practice weapons to the ground reaching to collect his vine stick bastarrrrrd marcus swung quickly to face the shout taking in a splitsecond image of antenoch his face distorted by rage charging at him with a flat dagger held out towards him held ready to strike holding his ground he waited until the last possible second before sidestepping the blade pivoting on his left foot to swing his body away from the thrust at the same time he lifted his left arm bent double to point the elbow at antenoch gripping his left fist in his right hand as he leant back to avoid the knifes point as the blow went past his neck he stepped smartly back in jabbing his elbow into his onrushing assailants face and stopping his charge dead following up with a viciously powerful sidefisted hammer blow that spun the reeling briton on to his back his eyes glazed out of the corner of one eye he saw the first spear moving from his position at the far end of the line of centuries at a dead run his clerk trailing in his wake he crouched close to the other mans head bending over to whisper urgently into his dazed face stupid with the first spear watching now decide do you want to live eh the britons eyes struggled to focus and for a second marcus was afraid hed done too good a job of stopping the attack and left antenoch without the ability to save his own life everyone dies you have the opportunity to cross the river this morning or stay a while longer decide which you want now he prised the dagger from antenochs unresisting hand and stood up to meet the first spear as he arrived on the scene allowing the weapon to dangle casually at his side frontinius looked livid his eyes wide with shock and anger i was watching from the review stand centurion and i clearly saw this man attempt to strike you while you were disarmed he pointed down at the prostrate antenoch whose wits were returning as the threat he was under became clear sir shut your mouth ill have your head on a pole above the main gate for this you scum attempting to strike a superior officer carries the death penalty which i first spear with respect frontinius turned on marcus his eyes narrowed with premonition centurion sir i asked soldier antenoch to attempt a surprise attack upon myself to show the rest of my men the standard of ability and speed ill be expecting from them and why did he call you a bastard at the top of his voice while doing so enthusiasm id expect sir enthusiasm very likely centurion he felt enthusiastic about the idea of putting a knife between your ribs an illegal weapon too id say not our standard issue although no doubt you lent it to him youre defending this man from a charge of assault upon you the watching soldiers tensed visibly waiting for the answer yes sir i believe that soldier antenoch is a valuable member of the century hes agreed only this morning to act as my orderly and clerk and to provide advice as to the best way of getting things done in this cohort isnt that right antenoch the briton started up open mouthed at his officer realising with sudden resignation that hed been backed into a corner that had only two exits acceptance or death yes centurion frontinius smiled then without mirth his eyes locking with antenochs good very good i shall look forward to hearing reports on your progress soldier antenoch let us hope that you demonstrate your abilities sufficiently well that i forget all about this interesting episode in the meantime ill keep a pole sharpened above the gate he turned to return to his place brushing close to marcus in the process and hissing a whispered comment at him dont push your luck centurion marcus turned back to his men squaring his shoulders and glaring across the lines of suddenly fixed faces very well antenoch back into rank we can discuss your new duties after morning exercise now lets examine what happened there there are a couple of basic techniques for close combat that i want us to practise this morning morban smirked up at the lanky soldier standing next to him enjoying the sick look on his face i believe thats fifty you owe me sonny did i forget to mention that our new centurion was a member of the imperial bodyguard before he asked the emperor if he could come and see the bluenoses at first hand never mind since youd only have spent it on whores at least itll end up in the same purse even if theyll have a harder time earning it off parade dubnus drew antenoch into marcuss quarters with irresistible force pushing the defeated soldier into the room in front of him marcus waiting in his chair with his sword unsheathed across his knee nodded to the chosen man who pushed the soldier into the middle of the room with the shutters closed against the rain and cold and the room only dimly lit by a pair of oil lamps the young centurions face looked brooding lit with menace antenoch turned and glared at him putting his hands on his hips in carefully calculated insult the big chosen man bared his teeth in a halfsnarl halfsneer pulling the dagger from his belt ill go and sharpen the stake over the main gate itll be waiting for you he looked over at marcus as he turned to leave shaking his head do not trust him keep your sword ready when the door was closed marcus reached into his tunic holding out the other mans knife antenoch took it from his outstretched hand looking closely at the blade for a long moment staring past it at marcus wondering if itd be worth another try at planting that thing between my ribs the briton said nothing for another moment pursing his lips as he slipped the weapon back into its familiar resting place no because i spared you even after you tried to kill me no then why because i dont think id get close enough theyve got a nickname for you those cattle out there they always do with officers it was going to be wetnose until this morning now its two knives he spat the words out marcus smiled levelly two knives like the gladiator it could be worse for a man in my situation antenochs eyes narrowed the rumours are that youre the son of a rich man just stupid enough to want to slum it with us for a while rumours youll encourage if you want to be my clerk the briton bristled at the suggestion want to be your clerk fuck you marcus sat back laughing gently at the incensed soldier tapping the hilt of his sword sit down antenoch and think for a moment he waited until the other man had slumped gloomily on to his bed before continuing youre obviously an educated man well spoken in a language which is not your native tongue you should be an administrator to some local official or a trader not a common soldier on the wall miles from anywhere with decent food and women you dont have to pay for what happened mind your own fucking business come on man what can it hurt to tell me i wont be sharing the story with anyone else youll tell dubnus and hell tell morban and hell you have my word ive little else of value so it should be of some note the quiet response silenced antenoch far more effectively than a bellowed command might have strangely his face softened as if with repressed memories i was adopted by a merchant in the wool trade when i was young after my mother died and raised as his son alongside his own boy i never knew my father although i often wondered if i was actually the merchants bastard child taught to read and write and to speak well i imagined that i would find some place in his business until my brother took it into his head that i was supplanting him in his fathers affections he poisoned the old man against me slowly but surely and i ended up on the street with a handful of coins and their best wishes so i decided to earn the one thing they never could buy for all their money and become a roman citizen i planned to go back to them after my twentyfive as an officer of course and snap my fingers at them as secondclass citizens in their own country cocidius help me i was so stupid and now youre stuck here antenoch looked up his eyes red and youre so clever the only difference between us seems to be one of rank centurion since you apparently have nowhere better to go than the arseend of your own empire again marcuss response was instinctively gentle defusing the britons anger and that should make us more likely allies than enemies will you work with me or against me youd make a firstclass centurions clerk and with a little polish you could be one of the best swordsmen in the cohort besides i could do with someone to watch my back he tailed off his persuasive skills exhausted and wisely waited in the unnerving silence rather than spout nonsense to fill the silence antenoch levelled his stare his face set hard and if i wont youll set that bastard frontinius on me what choice do i have marcus shook his head emphatically no the choice has to be yours besides nobody does my dirty work for me any more look i need a man i can trust behind me in a knife fight not one waiting for the chance to carve my shoulder blades apart what do you need the response was slow and measured the briton thinking through his position aloud i need a chance to be something other than the wild man those fools have labelled me id like to learn some of those fancy tricks you pulled on me this morning i want that bastard dubnus to speak to me with a little respect rather than looking at me as if i were something he scraped off the bottom of his boot he looked up at marcus calculation written across his face whats the pay standard pay but ill make you an immune youll never have to shovel shit away from the latrines again just as long as youre my man antenoch pulled a face and nodded very well we have a deal but you should beware one small fact centurion two knives marcus grimaced in his turn and that is i promise always to be honest with you always to speak my mind whatever my opinion whatever the likely effect you may find my views hard to accept but i wont spare you them and your view as of this moment you look too young for credibility with men who dont happen to be looking down the length of your sword put into frontinius for permission to grow a beard you can grow a beard rufius came through the storehouse door first impaling the clerk with a fierce glare and gesturing with a thumb over his shoulder the soldier remembering his close encounter with the veteran officers dagger the previous day made for the door finding himself restrained by a muscular arm as the centurion bent to whisper in his ear were all going to have a little chat with annius about the quality of his rations youre going to stay outside and keep nosy people from trying to interrupt us if anyone does disturb our discussion well set him on you antenoch stood in the doorway locking his cold bruised eyes on the clerks for a moment before turning away to lift an axe handle from the wall hefting it experimentally to test the woods weight behind him came dubnus in turn momentarily filling the doorway his eyes flicking across the clerk without any recognition of his existence before he strode into the store released the clerk bolted for the door willingly enough annius never cut him in on any of his swindles so there was no reason to argue with anyone in his defence much less that lunatic he almost ran into the other new centurion in the entrance shrinking back again to let the holloweyed officer walk through the man not even seeming to notice him which suited the clerk well enough what a combination the freshly recruited veteran centurion he had already learned to fear and an officer the forts collective opinion had suddenly decided probably was man enough for the job after all he closed the door to the stores building and leant on it in what he hoped would appear a nonchalant attitude rufius walked to the counter dropped a bundle of equipment and clothing on to the wooden surface and smacked his hand down with a flat percussive crack storeman annius bustled out of his office looking about him for his clerk then pausing uncertainly at the sight of the new centurions pasted an uncertain smile across his features and advanced to the counter his jowly face and high forehead glistened minutely with pinprick beads of sweat centurion rufius what a pleasure always good to have experienced officers join the cohort and centurion corvus all of the camp has heard of your prowess with the sword this morning quite remarkable how can i be of service to you and your er colleagues finding his bonhomie unrewarded by rufiuss stern expression he looked uncertainly to marcus found no comfort there and returned his regard to the older officer his instincts muttering loudly in his inner ear to play things very carefully with this unknown quantity how much could the man have discovered in less than a day he cursed his own stupidity for letting that fool trajan convince him to push the usual rakeoff to such a high percentage to his surprise it was the younger man who stepped forward raising a patrician eyebrow and curling his upper lip to complete the air of dissatisfaction this equipment quartermaster issued to myself and my colleague tiberius rufius yesterday is quite clearly defective in numerous regards the mail is surface rusted the sword is blunter than my grandmothers butter knife and even the tunics seem to have seen better days i trust that youll want to remove them from service after what has clearly been a long and illustrious history to judge from their condition oh and im used to a longer sword than the infantry gladius so see what youve got thatll suit my style better eh annius swallowed nervously feeling a trickle of sweat running down his left temple he scuttled back into the store returning within a minute with two sets of officers equipment his best he would usually charge a new centurion two hundred and fifty for their full rig unless they wanted somebody elses leavings but this was an occasion he judged to forget to mention payment i hope that these meet with your approval centurions and solve the problem youll understand that errors sometimes occur but thats soon amended ill have to discipline that blasted clerk issuing such shoddy gear to an officer he reached a hand out to take the bundle of rejected kit only to find marcuss hand there first closing over his podgy fingers in a firm grip rufius leant on the counter resting his chin on a bunched fist a halfsmile playing on his lips his eyes boring into anniuss behind them antenoch lounged against the wall pointedly studying his fingernails for dirt while dubnus prowled around the room casting dark glances at the stores officer the younger man spoke again his voice quiet and yet shot through with steel if only it were that simple you see when i discovered the poor quality of my own equipment issue i was prompted to check on the welfare of my men youll be as surprised as i was to learn that i found many of them apparently undernourished their food is both insufficient and of a disgusting quality and has been so im told since soldier trajan was appointed temporary centurion several months ago interestingly when my chosen man offered to take trajan out over the wall for a short patrol into the forest last evening he insisted that this purse of gold be a contribution to the centurys funeral club he released the other mans hand pulling a leather bag from his tunic and spilling its contents carelessly across the counter watching the fear grow in the other mans eyes the coins rattled on to the wood each spinning gold disc reflecting tiny flickers of yellow light as it sank into stillness across the flat surface a long silence stretched out as both men stared at the small fortune lying across the counter apparently he wanted to make amends for his previous greed it seems he was foolish enough to have participated in a scheme to make money by supplying his men with substandard rations and sharing the profits with somebody in your department annius shifted uncomfortably opening his mouth to deny any knowledge i no dont tell me you dont want to incriminate any of your staff we understand completely any good officer would wish to protect his men from bad fortune even that of being caught committing a capital offence of course if i were to discover the identity of that person id have them in front of the first spear the same hour and see them pay the maximum penalty possible dont you agree chosen man dubnus spoke over his shoulder while he leaned over the counter to examine a mail shirt hanging from a rack close to the wide desk fingering the leather jerkin to which the rings were fastened no itd be too quick just to have his head lopped off id take him into the great forest give him a onehundredcount start and then hunt him down through the shadows id pin him to a tree with my throwing axe and leave him there to die annius looked from marcus to his men realising with horror the game they were playing with him not doubting for a second any of the commitment behind their words thats still too good came a voice from behind them id just break the bastards arms and legs and leave him out there for the animals the wild pigs would make a mess of him before he finally died antenoch flipped the heavy axe handle as he spoke juggling the threefoot length of wood with impressive nonchalance as he shot a hard stare at the stores officer annius had heard about the way the young officer had turned the mans rage to his own advantage on the parade ground and suspected that he had a good deal of frustration to unleash upon the first convenient target he looked away attempting to feign an indifference that he was far from feeling the young officer smiled down at him without mirth his jaw set hard so you see feelings are running high soldier trajan is already feeling the wrath of his former subordinates by all accounts although i suspect that a protracted revenge holds more savour for the troops than anything hasty of course he was only the dupe of your man from the relatively small amount of money he handed over to us an opening i could pay you to keep my clerk out of trouble the four men stared at him in silence waiting he plunged on i could take the mans profits give them to you for use in making amends with your unit of course gods the fool might have made as much as five hundred from his illadvised swindle rufius leant across the counter putting his face close to anniuss three thousand now you can reclaim the money from your man at your leisure annius stared at the officer aghast that was almost twice as much as theyd actually raked off perhaps we could suit yourself pay now or ill put the matter in the hands of less forgiving judges you know the story new officer finds evidence of fraud and feels compelled to take the proof to his superior officer frontinius might turn a blind eye to your profitmaking activities i never yet met a senior centurion who didnt as long as there was a healthy contribution to the burial club every month my last camp prefect used to call it balancing the books said some men were born to make money some to lose it and this way at least he could guarantee every man a decent funeral what he couldnt ignore though would be the brandnew wet behind the ears centurion who had discovered how his men were being fleeced and who would of course be filled with righteous anger so the price is three thousand pay up or suffer the consequences you can think while my young friend buckles on that nice new sword ive seen him take a mans head off at six feet with one just like it annius hesitated weighing up the alternatives he saw in rufiuss pitiless stare a simple death sentence was his only choice apart from cooperating without question none of his men would hesitate to lay out everything they knew of his various business activities if required to do so by frontinius no matter how well they had been paid to take part of course to spare a good if misguided member of my department i could probably find the money rufius flipped the hinged section of the counter and walked round behind him get the money ill come with you unable to argue without running the risk that hed end up face down in the deep forest with a spear between his shoulder blades annius huffed into his office prising up the floorboard beneath which he kept his money three of the five leather bags went into the centurions waiting hands the other man sneering his disgust into anniuss face out in the storeroom he was alarmed to find that marcus and antenoch were on the wrong side of the counter and were examining his inventory with considerable interest the centurion lifted a mail shirt from its hanger holding the rings up to a windows meagre light and rubbing the soft leather undershirt between his thumb and forefinger youre right chosen man this is very nice mail much better than the standardissue rubbish annius you must have enough here to equip a whole century i i have to keep enough stock to supply each new intake of troops and spares dubnus loomed over his shoulder he keeps the stock all right but only sells good mail shirts to men who dont want to repair their own or want softer leather i see how much the businessman in the stores officer took over not seeing the trap into which he was running one hundred each hmm a fair price would be sixty antenoch fifty very well annius lets call them forty sesterces apiece as my discount for bulk purchase ill take your whole stock and tunics lets say two apiece for my century at five apiece now what else do you have for sale before we discuss how youre going to make sure that my men eat like prize gladiators from now on he turned away from the dazed quartermaster threading his way deeper into the darker recesses of the store regaining his equilibrium annius weaved after him panting his petulant outrage oh no centurion youre not going to steal my stock as well as my money thats just not fair and quailed back against a rack of spears as the roman spun his sword flashing from his waist and arcing up to rest against his neck marcuss face scared him more than the weapons fierce bite against his flabby throat even rufiuss eyes widened momentarily before a wolfish grin crept across his face not fair storeman not much is in these days my men probably werent too impressed at the way you and trajan fed them shit every day for the last three months your choice one youre lucky to have is to bite on the leather and take your punishment of course you could go to the prefect and see if hell accept your word against mine shall we go to him now it might be entertaining to see which of us appears the more credible annius shrank farther into the forest of wooden poles his face red with fear but said nothing the sword swung away from its harsh grip on his life dropping back into its place on marcuss belt rufius pushed him out of the way the smile on his face broadening as he headed for the rear of the store i spy amphorae back here how much for the wine storekeeper annius smiled through the pain knowing he lacked any choice in the matter if the young bastard chose to shit on the store floor and then ordered him to clean it up with his tunic he would have to do as he was told later however he promised himself when the new centurions had taken their leave of him probably in possession of half his stock bought at knockdown prices with his own money he would sit silently in his office brooding over his revenge that and the ways in which he might learn more of the enigmatic new arrivals past rufius opened the door of the centurions mess an hour later meeting the stares of the officers present with a careful smile gentlemen he waited in the doorway marcus stood in view behind him both of them acutely aware that they had to be invited in for their first visit the shortest of the cohorts centurions a bristlyhaired man whom marcus recognised as the least unfriendly of the gathering for morning report had apparently just reached the punchline of the joke he was telling he turned back to the others so the centurion says well prefect normally we just ride the horse to the whorehouse he turned back to rufius come on then grandfather in you come rufius winced giving marcus a dirty look as the younger man hid a smile behind his hand the speaker beckoned again looking over rufiuss shoulder and you young two knives and lets have a proper look at you one of the speakers companions snorted derisively turning away to study the wine jug behind the serving counter one hand teasing at a knot in his heavy beard the man next to him appraised rufius and marcus through eyes that seemed permanently half closed peering down a nose that had clearly seen better times their host smiled openly showing a selection of crooked teeth in the bristly thicket of his beard dont worry about our colleagues here othos wondering whether he could take either of you in a fair fight as opposed to the knifeinthedark methods that got him to where he is today the battered face split into a happy grin while my good friend julius already knows from your performance this morning that hed have no more chance against you than i would his good friend julius snorted his disgust again peering disdainfully down his nose pretty swordsmen dont necessarily make good officers especially when they have no idea about soldiering hell give up soon enough once the ninth sees through him he sized rufius up with a swift upanddown glance nodding with some measure of respect i hear youve done your time with the legions come and see me in my quarter if youd like to talk soldier to soldier he strode from the mess slamming the door behind him marcus swallowed his anger forcing himself to smile again this morning i was lucky that antenoch was stupid enough give me a warning im still rusty from too long on the road the bristlyhaired officer raised an eyebrow at him still rusty eh in that case old otho had best jump you while youre still polishing up im caelius by the way centurion of the fourth century although my men call me hedgehog when they think im not listening he paused and stroked his prickly scalp for effect cant imagine why otho here also known as knuckles although you might have guessed that from the state of his face has the eighth julius not unreasonably known as latrine since he is as you can see built like the cohort shithouse has the fifth your chosen man was his chosen man until you arrived hence his sulking demeanour hes having to work for a living now instead of lounging around here and letting the prince get on with doing the hard work for him he waved an arm around the other centurions as for the rest of your colleagues theres milo or hungry since hes forever eating and still skinny as a spear hes got the second and clodius the badger both for his hair and his temper he keeps the third in a permanent state of terror the centurion marcus and dubnus had encountered earlier on the road inclined his head in an impassive nod brutus has the seventh and has seen more action than the rest of us put together with never a scratch on his babysoft skin which is why he answers to lucky lastly theres titus or bear hes got the tenth which is our century of axemen when were in the field they specialise in treefelling and field defences and they fight with their axes like barbarians so they all have to be great big brutes like him uncle sextus has the first century but you already know that anyway introductions made will you join us in a drink wine was procured by the steward which rufius tasted and instantly judged to have come off second best to the long journey from its birthplace actually it was wine i came to discuss with you apart from making our introductions you see we made a deal with your deeply unpleasant storeman just now included in which were a dozen large jars of a rather nice red from hispania perhaps the mess could use them as a gift from the new boys you understand caelius smiled at them with renewed warmth knocking back a large swig from his own beaker and wiping his moustache with the palm of his hand well after six months of drinking this issue filth your gift would be as welcome as bread to a starving man that slimy bastard annius never even told us he had anything of the sort now one good turn deserves another so heres a word of friendly advice for you young two knives he paused significantly if you want to keep the cold out up here and look like an officer he paused again portentously making it clear that he was about to do his new colleague a great favour rufius raised a cautionary eyebrow over the mans shoulder what you need to do is grow yourself a nice thick curly beard you can grow a beard the cohorts long stay in winter quarters began to draw to a close a fortnight after their arrival the onset of warmer weather heralded the opening of springs campaign to revitalise the land the change was much to the relief of officers at their wits end with containing the fallout of boredom and indiscipline that the winters long inactivity had bred in their troops marcus had already had one case to deal with from within the th a tall darkly surly oneeyed soldier who went under the official name of augustus and the unofficial title of cyclops it seemed that the name had as much to do with his poor temper as any more obvious reason called out in the early hours by the duty officer he found the man slumped bruised and still bleeding from his nostrils in a headquarters holding cell the duty centurion with some good fortune caelius who rufius excepted was still his only real friend among the officers shook his head more in sorrow than anger hes known for it im afraid all it takes is for someone to find the right lever to tug at the right jibe to set him off and he goes off like a siege catapult hes been warned fined beaten put on punishment details for weeks nothing works if this goes to uncle sextus hell get another beating a really bad one this time perhaps dishonourable dismissal too marcus looked in through the thick bars weighing up the man slumped before him while hed learned a few names and the characters behind them the man was no more than an imperfectly remembered face in the cohorts second rank on parade and what was the lever this time we dont know he wont say and the men that beat the snot out of him are sticking to a story that he jumped them in the street outside the tavern theyd been drinking in without warning or reason which is probably at least half true you might not be surprised to learn that theyre both latrines men hmmm open the door and leave me with him caelius shot him a surprised look are you sure he broke a mans arm the last time he was in this state and you think i couldnt handle him a sheepish grin spread over the other mans face he took a leadweighted rod from his belt tapping the heavy head significantly against his palm no well when you put it that way just shout if he gets naughty and ill come and reintroduce him to the night officers best friend he opened the door drawing no reaction from the prisoner marcus leant against the door frame waiting until caelius was out of earshot in his tiny cubicle in the guardroom next to the office a dozen men were dozing sitting up on their bench packed in tight like peas in a pod the building was quiet eerily so when it was usually so vibrant with activity during the day soldier augustus the words met with no reaction cyclops the soldier started at the name looking up at his officer he stared for a moment and snorted before putting his head down again how many times is this soldier three four six six centurion what punishments have you suffered as a consequence the recitation was mechanical the question often answered ten strokes twenty strokes twentyfive strokes and two weeks pay thirty strokes and two weeks free time fifty strokes fifty strokes and three weeks free time fifty strokes a months pay and a months free time centurion his head came up while he recited the litany of punishment his one eye previously dulled by pain seeming to regain some of its spark none of which has stopped you from fighting so then cyclops why do you fight the other man shrugged without expression almost seeming not to comprehend the question i take no shit from no one from what ive heard you take shit from almost anyone you let them get under your skin and goad you to the point of starting a fight at which point you usually get both a beating and a place at the punishment table for starting the fight marcus shook his head in exasperation so what was it this time augustuss eye clouded with pain again and for a moment marcus thought he was going to cry phyllida a woman my woman she left me went to a soldier from the fifth him and his mates took the piss out of me mainly because it gives them an excuse to batter you id say did you give some back i hit them a few times want to hurt them some more cyclops looked up at him again suspicion in his good eye how simple just tell me who else witnessed these men baiting you i wont speak against them i guessed that already ill deal with this my way unofficially but i need a name to start with cyclops paused for thought as much to consider the request as to recall any detail at length he spoke manius of the fourth he was in the tavern hes from my village marcus went to wake up dubnus waiting until the man had splashed cold water on his face before detailing the problem the britons response was simple leave him to rot let uncle sextus deal with him the mans a liability bad for discipline marcus leant back against the small rooms wall rubbing his stubble wearily no leaving him to the first spears discipline says we have no ideas of our own that we dont look after our own how well do you know this man cyclops well enough his heart is poisoned full of anger is he a warrior hes fierce enough in a fight but he lacks selfcontrol so if we could make him behave hed make a good soldier yees marcus ignored the grudging tone of agreement good in that case i need your help lets give him a real chance to change his ways this time the briton looked at him with a calculating expression you want to wake up grandfather for this marcus shook his head no although id dearly love to have his advice he has to be neutral in this and if he knew about it hed find it hard not to get involved in some way this is a ninth century problem and the ninth will handle it our way which is first we have to talk to a man in the fourth its a good thing caelius is captain of the guard tonight saves us waking him up too julius was woken from sleep by a hammering at his door climbing bleary eyed from his bed to answer the insistent banging his badtempered scowl became a snarl of distaste when he saw marcus in the doorway just recognisable in the nights bright moonlight what do you want puppy marcus gestured to an unseen person to his right and then stepped aside dubnus stepped into view a semiconscious soldier grasped firmly under each arm his biceps bulging with the effort one of his eyes was slightly closed but otherwise he appeared undamaged he dropped the men on the ground between them making the centurion step back as they crumpled at his feet and spoke for the first time i must be getting slow a year ago neither of them would have laid a finger on me julius spluttered with fury stepping out into the cold air without noticing its icy grip on his skin and squaring up to dubnus what the fuck have you done marcus stepped in alongside his chosen man his eyes narrowed with anger what he did brother officer was exact a very precise retribution on the men that beat up one of my troops earlier this evening i have a witness who has sworn to me that augustus was provoked just as they knew he could be from happy experience all weve done is even the account if you attempt to take any further action on this matter hes promised to come forward and tell his story youre bluffing no man in this cohort would inform on another your choice the only way to know is to try me it can stop here julius this quiet war on my century and your attempts to make them turn against me from now everything you start comes back to you twofold no matter what it is however many of my men suffer twice as many of yours will receive the same punishment the younger man stepped in closer putting his face into juliuss the set of his jaw and flare of his nostrils rooting the older man to the spot and if you want to make it a little more personal ill see you on the practice ground for a little exercise with or without weapons if you have a problem with me you can take it up with me he turned and stalked away dubnus raised an eyebrow in silent comment and turned to follow leaving the ths centurion for once lost for words the next morning after early parade prefect equitius and the first spear sat to judge cyclopss case running through the facts with the offender standing to attention in front of them with the bare facts of the case established frontinius asked cyclops whether he wanted to make any comment before sentence was passed the soldiers response was mumbled at the floor but no less of a surprise to officers used to the mans customary stony silence at the punishment table sir i ask my centurion to speak for me prefect and first spear exchanged glances very well soldier augustus centurion marcus stepped forward helmet held under his arm and snapped to attention prefect first spear my submission on this mans behalf is simple he claims provocation to fight but that is beside the point he has a worse record of indiscipline than any other man in the ninth and ive already told him that i wont tolerate it i believe that he can make an effective soldier but only if he can learn to control himself my recommendation therefore is this no beating no loss of training time in fact nothing that will keep him out of training instead take away as much of his pay as you see fit and as much of his free time as appropriate if he offends again dismiss him from the cohort hell be no use to me or any other officer if he cant control his temper frontinius mused for a moment before turning to the tribune i agree ive seen enough of this man at this table for one lifetime soldier augustus you are hereby fined one months pay deprived of one months free time with bathhouse duties as further punishment and restricted to the fortress for three months unless on duty with your century one more appearance here for any reason and i will accept your centurions recommendation without hesitation do you understand cyclops nodded curtly very well dismissed outside the headquarters dubnus collared cyclops poking a long finger into his chest for emphasis lapsing into their shared native tongue to be sure he was understood that was the officers version heres mine the centurion put his balls on the table for you in there made his prestige with the first spear a matter of your behaving yourself in future you make one more mistake you wont just embarrass my centurion you might be the reason he gets kicked out of the cohort so if you do fail to change your ways it wont just be you out of the service if that happens ill boot your punchbag so fucking hard your balls will never come down again do you understand me the oneeyed soldier stared back at him with an expression dubnus found hard to decipher ill be a good boy from now but not for you dubnus im not scared of you ill do it for the young gentleman he turned and walked away towards the baths to start the first day of his punishment work routine leaving dubnus standing hands on hips watching him with a thoughtful expression with the beginning of the gradual change from winter into spring the cohort accelerated its training programme sextus frontinius listening to the reports of a slow flame of resentment burning steadily brighter in the northern tribes was keen to get his men into the field and training towards peak fitness ready for the campaign he made no secret of believing they would fight that year twentymile marches became a thriceweekly event rather than the freezing misery inflicted on the cohort once a fortnight marcuss and rufiuss centuries the former properly reequipped and both suddenly the envy of the cohort eating the best of rations and appropriately vigorous responded to their commanders different styles of leadership well whether it was marcuss blend of humanity and purpose or rufiuss legion training methods quietly imparted to marcus in conversations long into the night when their duties allowed both centuries grew quickly in fighting ability and selfconfidence the th were driven relentlessly by dubnus and his two new watch officers handpicked older men who understood what would be required of the century if it did come to war with the open backing of the influential morban the th quickly coalesced from a collection of indifferent individuals into a tightly knit body of men and set about rediscovering the pleasure of testing themselves alongside men they were coming to regard as brothers rufius had put the idea to his friend in the officers mess one evening after their days duties otho and brutus were playing a noisy game of robbers in another corner of the room on a blackandwhite chequered board painted on to their table lucky was failing to live up to his title as the boxer chased his few remaining counters around the board he was picking them off one by one and laughing hugely with each capture rufius tipped his head towards the two men lowering his voice conspiratorially and let that be a warning to you our brother officer might be called knuckles but dont ever think he might be punch drunk thats the fourth game in a row hes taken off brutus and theres no sign of the streak being broken a good game for the military mind is robbers teaches you to think ahead all the time the only mistake dear old luckys making is to worry about where his counters will go next not where he wants them in three moves time he plays aggressively pushes for the straddle while knuckles he knows the art of steady play how to gently ease the opponents counters into position for the attack there are lessons for life in the simplest game but some lessons are harder won he took a mouthful of wine savouring the taste for a moment with a sideways glance at his friend which leads me to a subject ive been pondering the last few weeks watching you and dubnus turn your lads from a rabble to something more like infantrymen i dont doubt for a second that youll teach your boys enough about sword and board work to make each one of them an effective fighter but i can tell you from grim experience that isnt the key to fielding a century that will grind up anything thrown at them and come back for more let me tell you what happens when we fight the bluenoses before the battle when our men are trying to keep from soiling themselves with fear the barbarians stop just outside spearthrow and start shouting the odds like vicus drunks how theyre going to carve off our dicks and wave them at our women before they fuck them to death how well soon be staring at our own guts as they lie steaming on the turf all that rubbish however take note of a man thats been there it works theres a natural reaction ive seen in many a century and cohort when the barbarians are baying for blood and thats for each man to sidle to his right just a little looking to get just a little more protection from his mates shield before you know it the lines half a mile farther to the right than the legatus wants it and the fights half over before it begins just from sheer fear he drank again signalling to the steward for a refill the secret to winning battles my friend isnt fancy sword work or how well your boys can sling a spear important though those skills are its actually much simpler than that but harder to achieve all you have to do is to make the lads love each other he sat back cocking a wry eyebrow at the roman and no before you laugh at me i dont mean all that arsepoking in greek pornography i mean the love a man has for his brother he paused again judging the moment theres only one way to explain this to you and i apologise for the necessity you had a brother in rome right marcus nodded soberly finding the memory painful but less so than before well what you would have done had you been in a position to fight his killers the younger mans nostrils flared with remembered anger i would probably have died with a bloody sword in my hand and a carpet of dead and dying men around me exactly and that friend marcus is the love we need to get into the hearts of our lads when one of your tent parties is in trouble whether its a punchup in a vicus beer shop or a desperate fight against hordes of bluenosed bastards their mates to either side have a choice to look to their front and ignore their mates peril or to dive in to the rescue orders dont make that happen and you cant teach it on the parade ground but if you get them to love each other they do the rest for you without even thinking about it when you get it right a man will use his shield to protect the man next to him when he falls and ignore the risk he runs in doing so knowing with complete certainty that his mate would do the same for him without a seconds thought he smiled conspiratorially at his friend and to be honest when me and my lads are knee deep in guts and shit with the spears all thrown and our shields splintering under bluenose axes i want your boys to be straining at their collars to be looking to you for the command to take their iron to our enemy just for the love of my lads if we can achieve that well both have a better chance of seeing next winter the ths tent parties exercised and practised against each other each time striving to win for some inconsequential reward or other their bonds growing stronger with each victory or defeat vowing to do better in the next contest the weaker helped and cajoled by the stronger the trick was repeated with multiples of tent parties the groupings changed each time and soldiers judiciously exchanged to equalise their relative strengths until each octuple was used to fighting alongside every other and knew their abilities in the evening watching their men down in the vicus dubnus and morban reported back a new spirit the other centuries quickly coming to recognise that taking on a single man from the th was offering a fist to every one of them no matter what the odds the respect in which they were held rapidly increased to the point where it was rare for fights involving the ths men to be anything other than between themselves combat quickly over and insult swiftly forgotten as they closed ranks marcus and rufius who had played exactly the same game he had preached with his own men repeated the trick with their centuries again exchanging soldiers ostensibly to add strength or skills where they were needed but in truth to build the same spirit of comradeship between the two units at length one night in early may a tent party from rufiuss th waded into an unfair fight on behalf of a pair of beleaguered th century soldiers it was the first sign for the two friends that they had achieved the breakthrough they were looking for prefect equitius returned to the hill from a senior officers conference in cauldron pool that same evening he called for the first spear to join him in his office shortly thereafter its war sextus theres no longer any doubt sollemniss spies tell us that the call has gone out for the tribes to mass north of the wall probably within a short march of three mountains fort from there its only about two days march to the wall and the bluenoses can knock over two more single cohort forts on the way just to get their spirits up hes not interested in defending the outlying forts against a force of between twenty and thirty thousand men since thats clearly what calgus will be hoping for our defence will focus on holding the wall while the legions from fortress deva and the far south slog their way up the country to join us frontinius nodded reflectively so the outlier cohorts march back behind the wall in good order rather than being slaughtered to no purpose at least our leader seems to be taking a practical approach to the situation does that mean we get the dacians from fort cocidius joining us not this time despite the fact it seemed to work well enough in last summers exercises no the dacians will make a temporary camp down at fair meadow and form a twocohort force with the second tungrians ready to reinforce any of the western wall forts that get into trouble perhaps some of their professionalism will rub off on the second and how long does the legate reckon it will take for the second and twentieth legions to reach us that depends whos asking to anyone else in this cohort up to and including the officers the answers fifteen to twenty days for your information only i happen to know that sollemnis called them north nearly two weeks ago and asked his brother officers not to spare the boot leather so they ought to show up within a week with any luck that will give calgus a nasty shock and put fortuna on our side rather sooner than he might have expected sixth legion is already deployed of course although he was pretty tight lipped as to exactly where they are whether its accurate or not the rumour in cauldron pool is that hes got them camped fifty miles back at waterfall fort to give him the flexibility to move to the north or west as the situation develops the first spear shook his head in exasperation west calgus isnt going to make a push for fortress deva the legion should already be in position to defend our supplies at noisy valley mind you rather them than us if there really are thirty thousand men massing under calgus equitius nodded silently reaching for his cup well be moving inside the week id guess theres no point leaving the wall units all divided up into cohorts when we can form a legionsized battle group with two or three days marching so first spear are we ready frontinius nodded ready enough theres still the question of completing the assessments but i think well have time enough for that if i pull the schedule forward and our new centurions frontinius stretched out his legs pursing his lips in consideration a timely question rufius is everything i expected tough professional more than up to his task a gift from cocidius as for the corvus boy the prefect took another sip of wine raising an eyebrow yes to be honest hes surprised me in the last few weeks he seems to have an excellent grip on his century prince dubnus is backing him to the hilt hes converted more than one complete waste of good rations into an effective soldier and his reputation in the cohort seems to be stronger than i could ever have imagined hes a cunning young bastard too cunning not quite what id expected nor i but i cant find any other way to describe a man who hides his mens abilities from his brother officers his men run faster than any other century in the cohort certainly faster than i can keep up with he hides this however with overlong rest breaks to hold down their average speed or else he takes them on detours to make their performance look slower than it is i find that very interesting and so do i i wonder what else he has hidden away from view the first spear reached for his helmet exactly i think its time to give him a chance to show us ordering the guard centurion to assemble the officers frontinius installed himself in the principia to wait their arrival mulling over his thoughts on the subject of his youngest officer while the two men standing guard over the cohorts treasury stared uneasily at the wall above his head he was still brooding when the officers started to enter the praetorium in ones and twos the first arrivals dragging him back to the moment at hand rufius arrived in the company of caelius and clodius while marcus and julius made predictably solitary entrances when all nine men were gathered in front of him frontinius roused himself to their briefing sending the duty guards out to stand watch at the door if we wanted to pilfer the pay chests wed have done it a long time ago nobody with the exception of the prefect enters without my permission this briefing is for officers ears only he waited theatrically until the doors were closed brother officers the prefect came back in from cauldron pool an hour ago as im sure youve all heard by now the message from the boys in the purpleedged tunics is simple enough prepare for war theres a brit called calgus mustering thirty thousand painted maniacs somewhere not much more than two days march from here and very soon now theyll come south with fire and iron looking for a fight he paused catching more than one eye riveted to his gaze a fight theyll get eventually eventually first spear rufiuss eyes narrowed with professional interest eventually centurion calgus will muster more spears than the wall cohorts and sixth legion could cope with even banded together to our full strength unless he was stupid enough to throw them at us piecemeal and on the subject of our enemys wits i have intelligence of my own for you calgus isnt that stupid in fact he isnt stupid at all i met him five years ago at a gathering of the tribal leaders north of the wall i was the supervising officer with half the cohort behind me to keep the peace between them and make sure it didnt get out of hand and it was still i can assure you a bloody uncomfortable experience not only were the tribesmen a fairly ugly bunch but calgus could dispute with minerva and not come away ashamed he was recently crowned at the time and still finding his feet as king of the selgovae but where his father was a sly old sod a master of the knife in the back the son was clearly a man of a different nature hes a clever brute a barrelchested redhaired bear of a man born to swing a battleaxe but blessed with his fathers silver tongue for all that he would insist on seeking me out for arguments about the justification for roman rule of the land south of the wall of course in the end i had little option but to end the discussion on the grounds that since were the ones with our boots on the ground there was little point to it i expected that to be the end of the argument and to a degree it was however he lowered his voice slightly reliving the moment calgus just stood there and looked at me for a moment then reached out a hand and tapped me on the chest with one finger my escort had their iron aired and ready to go in a flash growling like shithouse dogs and i reckoned we were a hairs breadth away from a bloodbath but calgus never faltered he just tapped me gently on the chest again and said just as long as you can fill those boots centurion not enough to give me a pretext to have him for inciting rebellion of course and half the north countrys tribal elders were hanging on his words as dry as tinder if i were stupid enough to provide the spark enough to make his point though and while i didnt like him i had to admire the size of his swingers ive been waiting for his name to reach this far south ever since and now that it has i can assure you all that we have a very worthy opponent so the word centurion rufius is most definitely eventually ill show you what i think will happen he turned to their sand table and sketched in a few swift lines with his vine stick here east to west coast to coast is the wall calgus cant go round it he has to go through it if hes going to make any impact other than burning a few outlying forts that we can rebuild before next winter here north to south is the road from yew grove to the northern forts crossing the wall at the rock there are the outlying forts north of the wall up the north road fort habitus roaring river red river yew tree fort and the tip of the spear three mountains theyll be evacuated by the time calgus can get his warband limbered up and their cohorts will retreat back to the wall in good order leaving the forts to the bluenoses theyll steal everything thats left behind and torch the buildings but they wont have the time to destroy the walls and so to be frank who cares those three cohorts will muster at the rock most likely making a force of about three thousand men when combined with the local half horse cohort knuckles raised a hand what about our dacian mates at fort cocidius frontinius dotted the sand twice with the tip of his vine stick good question otho you clearly havent had all of your wits beaten out of you heres us at the hill on the wall and heres fort cocidius five miles to our northeast the dacians will also pull back behind the wall bringing with them before you ask all of their altars to mars cocidius theyre going to squat with the second cohort down at fair meadow and we can only hope that they dont pick up too many bad habits while theyre there thats another two thousand men ready to move wherever theyre needed another reserve force like the one at the rock add to that the ten thousand or so lining the walls length and weve half the number of spears we expect calgus to muster the difference is that we have to stay spread out for the time being while he can concentrate his power in one place which means that the trick will be for us to avoid actually fighting the warband until the legions come into play he paused for effect all i can tell you about the heavy boys is that the sixth are already somewhere close to hand and the second and twentieth are footslogging up from their fortresses in the south which means we wont see them for the best part of a month the general isnt going to want to engage in pitched battle without at least two full legions in the line that way he can face off the tribes and still have a nice big reserve to manoeuvre into their flank or rear if he plays it smartly enough rufius nodded agreement so we can expect a month or so of marching round the country avoiding a fight yes thats about the size of it although it might be closer to the truth to say avoiding a fight if were lucky calgus will be desperate to bring us to battle early to set his dogs on us before the legions get themselves cranked up ready to fight if he can destroy the wall garrison or better still take sixth legion out of the campaign early enough the southern legions would be severely handicapped fighting at a numerical disadvantage against firedup tribesmen on ground they dont know calgus knows that and hell do whatever he can to force an early battle if we can stay on our toes and avoid a fight for the next month well have done very well in my opinion very well indeed youd best be generous making your offerings to mars cocidius tonight were going to need all the luck he sees fit to grant us now the cohort assessments he paused to allow the initial muttering to die down will still be held but just to a different timetable we still need to know whos going to guard the cohort standard this summer given that time is of the essence well dispense with the usual paradeground tests ive been scoring your men on their sword and spear work over the last few weeks just in case but we cant ignore the main test so all units on parade tomorrow morning at first light last five centuries for the speed march first five for the ambush force dismissed the next morning dawned just as fine with a warm and dry day in prospect the first spear paraded his cohort an hour after dawn taking pleasure in the cool morning air and announced the pairings of marching and attacking centuries with a slight smile delighting julius by tasking his th century with ambushing marcuss th century during their speed march the veteran centurion strolled across the parade ground to watch the ths departure standing to one side with his arms folded and his face set impassively drumming impatiently with his fingers against the iron rings of his mailed shoulder while some of marcuss men cast anxious sidelong glances at the officer morban stared back impassively beneath the centurys standard muttering to the nearest soldiers without taking his eyes off the scowling officer rumour says our old friend julius and the glorious fifth century are going to give us a right kicking today put young two knives in his place and take the standard for another year in fact rumour had us paired with the fifth long before uncle sextus announced it i had a drink with their silly bastard of a standardbearer in the vicus last night and i had twenty denarii with him that wed come out on top today so you turd burglars had better wake your ideas up both marcus and dubnus ignored julius for the most part by prior agreement as to their tactics for the day dubnus unable to resist the temptation caught his eye looked down to his thigh and extended his middle finger down the muscle if frontinius spotted the gesture as he strode up to marcus he gave no sign are your men ready centurion marcus saluted snapping to attention ninth century ready first spear the senior officer nodded beckoning the younger man by eye as he walked slowly away from the century out of earshot well centurion corvus your time of judgement is nearly upon us this cohort goes to war tomorrow and it must have officers that i can trust to lead their men to the gates of hades if thats where fate takes us every day since your arrival i have asked myself whether youre that sort of officer despite your age despite your alleged treason and in all those days ive never yet found an answer i can trust youre quicker with a sword than any man i know your century seem to love you well enough and yet marcus met his eye levelly and yet first spear and yet i am still not convinced that you will be capable of giving this cohort what it needs in time of battle so this is your day centurion the last day in which that question can be answered when you take your men out of those gates take one thought with you and keep it in your mind all the way back here no matter what happens sir the good of the cohort centurion simply that dismissed go and show your brother officers what youve been hiding from them these last two months marcus frowned at the last comment but had no time to reflect on it with the trumpeter blowing the command to commence the exercise and the first hourglass turned the th were out of the fort at the double march away to the west they marched along the military road behind the wall their ironstudded boots stirring the dust into tiny clouds the road ran along the northern lip of the vallum the massive ditch that divided military and civilian ground and its elevation allowed a cooling breeze to dry the sweat from the marching mens bodies as they pounded away from the fort in the early morning sunshine a mile from their starting point a track branched south over a bridging point across the vallum in the protective shadow of a mile fort before starting a shallow climb into the hills to the south it was the route by which they were to cover most of their march once he was certain that the century was out of sight of any watcher marcus trotted out in front of his men turning to walk backwards for a moment to be sure that they were no longer observed before signalling to dubnus in his usual position at the centurys rear the big mans voice boomed across the marching ranks making heads rise and backs straighten in anticipation of the coming order ninth century prepare to change pace at the run run the soldiers lengthened their stride together long accustomed to hauling their bodies and equipment across the undulating countryside at a fast jog they went south at a fast pace for another two miles before dropping back to rest at a fast march for a mile then stepped up the pace again the troops were sweating heavily now with the effort of running in armour with full campaign kit each man humping his armour sword shield two spears and his pack with only the pointed wooden stakes made to be lashed together into obstacle defences missing from their loads they were working to a timetable known only to marcus and his triumvirate of advisers dubnus morban and antenoch who had planned the day over a jug of wine the previous evening while dubnus still lacked any trust in antenoch he remained polite enough to the other mans face and had tolerated marcuss insistence on his being involved in their preparation the wind dropped allowing the days heat to get to work on bodies that were tiring and starting to dry out but still they ground on dubnus relentlessly driving them on with shouts of encouragement and threats of a faster pace if any man flagged five miles out from the hill marcus pointed to the roadside tenminute rest and briefing get your water bottles and drink but do it quietly if you want to know what were about to do breathing hard his men forwent the usual playful push and shove of the rest stop drinking eagerly from their bottles while their centurion explained what they were about to attempt his command of the british language had progressed a long way in the time available but he spoke in latin now pausing for dubnuss translation to ensure complete understanding the usual way of things in this event is for the marching century to concentrate on getting around the course as quickly as possible to win points for ground covered before the ambush when they are ambushed as they always are a practice battle results a few minutes fighting one of the two centuries is declared the winner and then they finish the march together all good friends again a few heads nodded knowingly this was the speed march they had come to expect not this time not this century they stared back at him eyes widening at the heresy how many of you would knowingly walk into an ambush or even the risk of one weve trained to march fast because well use that speed in the field to avoid ambushes or to put ourselves into the best positions before an enemy can reach them he paused allowing dubnus to translate although he could see from their faces that the majority had understood his words this ones real as far as im concerned what about you chosen dubnus nodded grimly staring dispassionately at his men daring anyone to disagree marcus continued julius wants to teach me a lesson take me down a peg and he wants to do this at the expense of your pride that and your reputation as soldiers you might not have noticed it he knew they knew all too well were basking in the glory of their meteoric rise but were second in the standings the century everyone wrote off as useless you want to keep that reputation be second best a few heads shook slowly morban roared at them his challenge lifting the hair on the back of marcuss neck as he shook the standard indignantly at them im not taking second place to any bastard without a fight youre either in this or you can turn round and fuck off back to the hill and apply for a new century one that takes losers marcus watched their reaction carefully gauging their sudden enthusiasm as men turned to their neighbours to see the excitement reflected in their eyes the standardbearer grinned proudly at marcus tipping his head in salute to hand the century back to his centurion so shut the fuck up and let the centurion tell you how were going to pull latrines beard for him julius lengthened his stride eager to reach his chosen ambush site alongside him moving with an easy grace that belied his age sextus frontinius matched him step for step the centurion would have avoided taking the first spear out on the ambush march if he could have found a way but his superior was all too well aware of the potential for the event he had stagedmanaged to get out of control he had made a point of politely requesting his permission to accompany the th century a courtesy julius had no choice but to return through gritted teeth so youve decided to attack them at the saddle eh julius julius tempted to ignore the question but with enough sense to avoid the pitfall of failing to acknowledge the innocent enquiry nevertheless waited a full five seconds taking his response to the margins of insolence before answering yes first spear sextus frontinius smiled inwardly keeping his face a mask of indifference a little early in the march isnt it his men will still be relatively fresh im surprised youre not going to wait for them farther into the route whats wrong with the usual places stung by the implied criticism julius wiped sweat from his eyebrows shaking his head in irritation at the unusual warmth im not allowing any rest stops until we get there so well get there first the ninth will never suspect a thing until were down the slope and on top of them if i didnt know you better id have to say youre taking all this a bit too personally the centurion spat into the roadside dust to clear his throat and first spear if i didnt know you better id have to say that youve rolled over for this roman with the rest of them frontinius glared at the soldier marching alongside him who redoubled his efforts to be seen not listening march out front with me centurion lets show these nosy bastards of yours how to cover ground he waited until they were ten yards clear of the marching century before speaking again i think its time we discussed this properly our rules not first spear and centurion just sextus and julius the other man glanced over at him and if i dont want to discuss it but you do julius youve been quacking away about it ever since he got here come on man let it out our rules absolutely the same as the day we joined dont say you havent asked for it hes a traitor an enemy of the man who rules the world and of the empire you swore to serve and yet youve gone out of your way to make him welcome the first spear shrugged unconcernedly im not convinced by all this traitor talk youve heard the same stories i have julius you know how this new emperors behaving and who pulls his strings as far as im concerned our mans guilt isnt proven not your call sextus if the empire says hes a traitor then hes a traitor and if it was you old mate what if you were unjustly accused then id run a thousand miles to avoid hurting my friends and and end up somewhere like here dependent on strangers for justice not negotiable julius i wont hand over an innocent man to that kind of evil and if they come for him if they nail you and the prefect up and decimate the rest of us for hiding him it wont come to that besides well be at war in a few days we could all be dead in a week so some unlikely discovery by the empire doesnt worry me overly right now next hes a snotnose hes never commanded so much as a tent party in action and hell fall to bits the first time he sees a bluenose warband frontinius snorted rubbish he killed on the road to yew grove he fought again on the road here he faced down that headcase antenoch with his bare hands and he seems to have faced you down well enough since then julius turned furiously still walking that was dubnus frontinius pursed his lips and shook his head sorry but thats not how i heard it the version that reached me was that he got right in your face and practically offered you the dance floor i was half awake and unprepared rubbish man ive never known you not ready to fight day or night admit it theres something in the young mans eye that would make any of us step back and take guard and i dont mean the sword skills either hes lost something in the last few months some carefully instilled selfcontrol an edge of civilisation that his father probably worked on all his life what i see in him is a dangerous animal thats been given every reason to want the taste of blood and now those early disciplines have been stripped away theres only cold calculation keeping that rage in check the pair of us could take him on two on one with swords and boards and id have money on his opening us both up from chin to balls in under a minute julius lifted exasperated hands to the sky so hes dangerous enraged hes a goatfuck waiting to happen put him in combat and hell go berserk and take his century with him again the first spear shook his head no he wont hes the model of selfcontrol think back to antenoch that first morning came at him with a knife and ended up with it tickling his own ear did you see a single drop of blood on the fool because i was there in seconds and i didnt no centurion corvus will have iron control right up to the second where he chooses to let it go just dont be on the wrong end of his sword when that happens he took a deep breath as they marched on side by side you know as well as i do that youre not competing for the honour of carrying the standard along the wall to the games this year what youre looking for is the opportunity to fight off every bluefaced bastard between here and the river tava who thinks it would look nice on the wall of his mud hut every century in this cohort is going to need strong leadership and the ninth isnt any different from any of the other centuries in that respect so give them to the prince hell give them strong leadership all right you know my thoughts on that individual hes no more proven than young corvus as far as im concerned he took a deep breath ill tell you what im just simply bored with pondering the whole thing so im going to delegate the decision delegate it to you but he raised a hand to silence the astonished centurion yes i know you already know the answer except im really not sure either of us have actually seen whats in centurion corvuss heart yet so you can make the decision but only when this days events are fully played out julius grunted his satisfaction my opinion wont change you can be sure of that sextus stared fixedly ahead as they marched on perhaps it wont you feel betrayed and undermined by your old friend the man you joined up with all those years ago ive allowed an inexperienced outsider into our close circle of brothers an action that might spell disaster for us all on the other hand oldest friend corvus might just have a pair of stones larger than either of us appreciates so lets wait and see eh the th made good time taking their water on the march rather than stopping and reached a position with a clear view of the saddle by the middle of the day julius called a halt sending a scout past the feature to make sure that the th were not about to hove into view just as he deployed his men into their positions for the ambush the man ran back a few minutes later to confirm that the road was clear to the grassy horizon provoking the first smile the th had seen grace their commanders creased face all day excellent evennumbered tent parties to the righthand hill with the chosen man and into cover odd numbers with me to the left and remember any man that shows himself before i give the signal loses a months pay the century split quickly into two disciplined groups hurrying down the slope from their vantage point and starting the climb up to the twin hills their equipment rattled and clattered noisily while the soldiers talked among themselves about the afternoons entertainment planning individual acts of revenge for real or imagined slights upon their centurys good name by members of the th thus it was with nobody looking too carefully at the greenery that crowned their objectives that it took a bellow of challenge from dubnus to draw their attention to the previously wellhidden troops who had risen like forest spirits out of the undergrowth of the righthand hills heavily wooded crown the ths soldiers hesitated for a moment caught between their orders and the shock of finding the saddle already occupied the short pause enough to cause a chorus of abuse to shower down upon them from the hills the th had taken their objective first and showed every sign of being in the mood to defend their ground julius stepped out in front of his men drawing his sword and sweeping it over his head ready to slash it down to point at the twin hills and issue the command to attack ready to start a fullscale battle if it was the only way to restore his face as the sword started to move in the downward arc sextus frontinius stepped out of the century with his arms in the air hold ignoring juliuss redfaced fury he turned to the saddles hills his voice bellowing out across the landscape ninth century form ranks for parade here the ths troopers came out of the trees and streamed obediently down the hill while frontinius paced back a dozen steps pushing soldiers aside without ceremony and pointed to the ground again fifth century form ranks for parade here the ths grumbling men pulled back still reeling from the shock of their centurion being so comprehensively outthought julius restraining himself by an act of supreme willpower stamped back down the hill to the designated place bellowing at his subordinates to get the fucking century on parade the two units lined up opposite each other scowls and sneers along both opposing lines of men while the first spear paced equably between them and watched the clouds scudding along in a clean blue sky enjoying the breezes cooling caress when both centuries were lined up and the harsh shouts of the chosen men and watch officers had died away to silence he turned slowly to look at both centuries taking in juliuss set scowl and marcuss white face ready to fight his lips thin with determination over a tightset jaw in all my days i swear i never saw two sets of men who wanted so badly to kick the balls off each other if i were to let you dogs loose now id end up with a dozen or more broken limbs and as many men with the wits knocked out of them well you mindless apes let me remind you that theres a great hairyarsed tribal chief by the name of calgus mustering a warband the size of five legions to the north whether its sunk into your thick skulls yet or not we will most likely be at war within a few days you need to learn to work together side by side in the line either century ready to perform whatever manoeuvre is needed to support the other even if itll cost lives and the time that you need to learn to do this is now he turned away from them and stared for a moment across the rolling countryside taking a moment to enjoy the sunshines gentle touch on his bare scalp we do need a winner from this competition if were to have a century to guard the cohort standard but without spilt blood the answer is single combat with before anyone jumps forward combatants chosen by the person here best qualified to make that judgement which would be me the silence became profound as he paused again every man straining to hear his decision and i choose centurions julius and corvus prepare for combat exercise swords and shields marcus passed his vine stick to dubnus leaving the sword at his waist in its scabbard and taking the heavy wooden practice sword from his other hip the briton fussed at his helmet fastenings for a moment leaning in close to look at the offending buckle murmuring into marcuss ear hes weaker on his left side shield dependent dont go in too close until he tires though or hell try to smother you with his strength stand off and use your skill you can cut him to pieces easily enough frontinius walked over to face him dismissing dubnus with a pointed nod to the ths ranks the senior centurion stared away into the distance speaking in a matteroffact tone im awarding your century three points for ambushing the fifth which puts you level with julius before the result of this event if you win youll take first place and carry the standard through the campaigning season if you draw and finish level on points ill award the prize to the fifth as the previous champions he paused significantly shooting marcus a sudden glance ill give you no guidance young man this is an opportunity for you to exercise some judgement ill simply remind of what i said to you this morning marcus nodded moving his shield into a comfortable position on his arm before stepping out into the space between the two units julius stepped out to meet him glowering from between the cheekpieces of his helmet its red crest riffling slightly in the breeze frontinius held them apart for a moment speaking softly into the silence that had descended upon the hillside as the opposing centuries waited for the spectacle to commence i want you both in fighting condition when this is finished ill deal with the man that injures the other personally they stepped apart saluted formally with their practice swords before moving together again each eyeing the other over the edges of their shields julius crabbed around to his left searching for a weakness in the younger mans defence striking without warning in a powerful lunge his sword hammering on marcuss shield as his opponent stepped away from the strike his studded groin apron whipping about with the movement the roman moved in low swinging his weapon in an arc that whipped past juliuss forward leg with a fingernails width to spare and then drew back as quickly looking for another opportunity to strike the fight lasted the length of a fiveminute sandglass each man alternately attacking and defending seeking to land one disabling strike on the other the soldiers watching made marcus the better of the two but unable to land the killing blow several times just a split second too late to press his advantage on an overextended and tiring julius at length frontinius raised his hand stopping the bout and declaring a tie the two men stepped apart both breathing hard from their exertions frontinius ushered them back to the ranks of their centuries waiting for them to take their places before speaking again antenoch in his customary place next to the centurion spoke from the corner of his mouth well centurion i had no idea you were a politician marcus ignored him as the senior centurion started to speak again we started the day with the fifth century leading the ninth by three points i have decided to award the ninth three points for a successful ambush on the fifth which places both units level these scores will be officially confirmed and awards made on formal parade but since im the final judge of the competition you can take this pronouncement as final since both units finish level last years champion century the fifth juliuss century erupted into cheers and roars of delight men punching the air with the joy of their victory only their centurion seemed subdued standing in front of his unit to a rigid attention silence the harsh command combined with frontiniuss furious body language was enough to promptly silence the fifths celebration will retain their position as cohort standardholders unless of course theres any repeat of that undisciplined outburst he paused to allow time for the threat to sink in before continuing in recognition of their achievement in tying the contest and their improvement on what was until recently a very poor standard of performance i also award the ninth century the task of lead century for the season the standard will be carried in its wartime position in the columns centre this season rather than at the front which means that i need a good century to lead the cohort let us hope that none of you have cause to regret winning these positions of merit which will leave you all holding the bloody end of the spear if we go to war with the tribes this summer they marched back to the fort at a steady pace frontinius keeping their minds busy by ordering both centuries to belt out their lewdest marching songs in unison until they tramped over the final hill and drew up on the parade ground the senior centurion walked down their ranks taking the measure of his tired but erect men before calling them to attention soldiers you represent the cream of this cohorts fighting skills ive nothing better in my armoury than the onehundredandsixtyodd warriors mustered on this parade ground you are trained and disciplined fighting men every one of you ready to stand in line and shed blood for the cohort now i suspect that there are a few scores waiting to be settled in these ranks things that have been said and done that can hardly wait to be avenged itll start with fists and boots some fool will pull a knife and ill have my two best assets at war with each other he paused significantly and that is not going to happen i will not allow it to happen so here are the rules for these two centuries any man brought in front of me for fighting a member of the other century will suffer the maximum penalty i can apply under the circumstances up to and including dishonourable dismissal without citizenship no excuses no leniency and no exceptions so you choose he strolled away across the parade ground for a few paces before turning back with a sly look on his face of course the situation might be different to that i imagined you might march back into the fort as the two best damned centuries in the cohort both so good i cant separate you you might take pride in your shared excellence you might even take the attitude that its the others that take second place to you not either of you to the other whatever you decide collectively you are my best weapon and i make a point of keeping my weapons razor sharp dont test me centurions take your units back to barracks dismissed marcus marched his men back into the fort left dubnus to chivvy them down to the bathhouse and went to wash the dust from his feet musing on the day antenoch had vanished and for once the centurion was happy to be spared his presence knowing that his clerk had already guessed the truth behind the result of his contest with julius the sound of his quarters door opening made him turn swiftly as julius came in without waiting for an invitation he looked to the bed where his belt gear and sword lay discarded wondering whether he could reach the weapon if the older officer intended him harm in the enclosed space of the quarter he doubted that he could resist a determined attack by the larger man without being forced to try to disable or even kill him julius held up his hands seeing the swift glance no im not here for a rematch but we do need to talk marcus nodded reaching for a flask of wine and two cups julius stayed silent while the wine was poured tipping half the offered cup down his throat with a sigh of satisfaction thanks i should thank you for this afternoons performance as well you could have put me down half a dozen times this morning i knew it i could tell that you were holding back from connecting with your attacks youre faster and better trained than i am and thats all there is to it youre the better swordsman although time will tell if youre the better warrior when the shit really starts flying you should have taken first place and we both know it he stared at marcus until the younger man nodded slowly letting out a sigh of release from his internal pressure why you earned that victory built up your men to taking it from under my nose why didnt you take it marcus frowned starting to speak and closing his mouth again after a moment he tried again youll laugh at me i did it for the cohort uncle sextus told me to think about what would be the best result for the cohort and when i did it was obvious that you had to win if id beaten you youd be sitting in your quarter now plotting revenge on me as it is youre just puzzled the cohort gets undivided leadership frontinius doesnt have to deal with a series of running battles between our centuries everyone wins julius looked at him for a moment without speaking except you perhaps the older man shook his head resting a hand on the hilt of his sword except you frontinius gave me something this morning something ive wanted since the day you arrived he gave me the responsibility to decide your fate said he was tired of pondering whether you have what it takes or not and if i say youre gone boy just a fading stain on this cohorts proud history what then if i tell you that where you go is of no concern to me and that all that matters to me is that you leave and dont come back what do you say to that eh marcus gazed back at him for a long moment then nodded his head half turning away to speak woodenly at the rooms wall im not surprised ive known deep down that you and your brothers wouldnt be able to accept me this cohort cant operate with a rejected officer at its heart and ive developed too much affection for this place to risk that rejection turning into casualties as to where i go dont worry yourself ill be in another place before dawn and thats all youll be wanting from me id be grateful if you could find a way to overlook the last few months and recommend dubnus to command the ninth he gestured to the door and perhaps now you could leave me in peace let me get on with what i have to do the burly officer stared at him a moment longer then shook his head wryly ill have to apologise to sextus i told him i was going to come here and say those words to you and he told me youd bite on the leather the way you did marcus turned back to face him his face hardening his eyes flicking again to the sword lying on the bed alongside him if you think that im going to let you stand here and calmly discuss my personality traits now that youve had your way youd better look to your blade centurion because in about ten seconds youre going to be getting a very close look at mine julius opened his hands again backing away slightly and talking quickly hold it was your last test to see if you cared enough for the cohort to accept the hardest decision youll do for sextus and while its hard to admit youll do for me too quite how were going to keep a swarthy bugger like you any kind of secret when we march to war is beyond me but sextus gave me the decision and ive made it you stay marcuss eyes narrowed and julius realised with a shiver that his temper was fully alight and if i dont accept your gracious offer after this last little test if i take that sword and fillet you like an old bull then spill my own blood the other man smiled holding his ground and keeping his sword hand rock steady six inches from the hilt of his weapon i dont doubt that you could spill my guts although wed have some fun finding out within these four walls without much space for fancy sword work i probably deserve it too the way ive been hounding you and your men but you wont the other thing sextus has you nailed for is iron selfcontrol and given that youre now the centurion of the cohorts lead century likely to be first into the shit and last out of it youre going to need it get some sleep young two knives youve a hard month in front of you but before you do fill me up with a little more of that dogrough piss youre drinking i cant drink a cup to your success if my cups empty he passed his cup back for refilling a hammering at the door made them both jump antenoch thrusting his head through the opening breathlessly ignoring the frown on marcuss face clearly juliuss presence was no surprise to him and marcus suspected he had been lurking close by ready to come to his assistance if necessary centurion julius youve an order to join the first spear at the north gate something to do with a bonfire julius downed the wine in a swift gulp and turned to the door ill see you later centurion in a woodland clearing well to the north of the wall beyond the reach of the units nervously manning the forts along the north road the leaders of britannias remaining free tribes were gathered in their first war council seated around a crackling fire in the cool light of dusk the halfdozen tribal chieftains eyed each other soberly as they waited for the arrival of their leader each of them was very well aware that they were about to step hard on the tail of a very dangerous animal when calgus tribal leader of the selgovae made his entrance it was without fanfare he shrugged off a cloak of wolfskin and walked to the fire to warm his hands he spoke without turning away from the heat his voice a deep rumble leaders of the northern tribes our men are poised to attack down what our oppressors call the north road straining for release into battle like a hunting arrow bent and ready to fly the romans scouts have been put to flight by our horsemen and there is nothing more substantial between here and their wall than a few pitiful forts one word from each of us and our men will fall on three mountains and put it to the flame he turned away from the fire opening his arms to encompass the gathering it simply remains for us to make the decision to attack but before we do so i want you all to be very clear about exactly what were committing ourselves to you all know very well that i was educated in isurium brigantium as the romans have named that great tribes historic home now trapped behind their wall and made slave to their empire you know that i speak latin and that i spent my childhood absorbing their history and culture and i know for a fact that many of you still mistrust me as a result of that education in truth you should thank cocidius for my fathers insistence on that education since it woke me to the danger to our tribes that has brought us all to this point of decision i was sent south by my father when i was in my eighth year and i stayed in the south until my fifteenth summer learning their language and their ways i hated every waking moment brothers with a passion that grew stronger with every year with every fresh lesson that taught me how they have spread their rule across the world in a restless search for new peoples to enslave and with each year my eyes opened wider to the state of the brigantian nation once proud rulers from the mountains to the sea for a hundred miles to the north and south of isurium now castrated lapdogs to their rulers so helpless that even their ancient capital has a roman name at fifteen i returned home for the summer and told my father that i wouldnt go back and live among slaves for a single day more i expected harsh words or a beating but he simply smiled at me and told me that in that case my education had served its purpose hed sent me south in order to open my eyes to the romans and their lust for expansion hed sent me south to harden my heart against their insidious persuasion hed dedicated my childhood to opening my eyes to roman deception making me a fit successor to his rule so brothers let me outline our alternatives we face a stark and simple choice either we try to live in peace alongside their rule and suffer eventual defeat and enslavement or we fight now and push them off our lands we can still gain a lasting peace on our own terms but the romans will only ever respect strength offer them weakness and we will all be in chains inside five summers he fell silent watching the faces in front of him after a moment the chief of the votadini an elderly man whose eldest son stood behind him to steady his arm spoke out softly you give us convincing words calgus we all know of the romans desire to take our lands we all lost sons and brothers the last time they tried to pen us up like cattle we all wish to avoid this and we would be willing to fight in response to your summons even were we not bound to follow you into battle but still i fear their legions three generations before us have failed to defeat them in open battle even with the advantage of superior numbers our victory in forcing them from the northern wall was the result of many attacks on small detachments of their soldiers a war of striking and hiding and having the strength to ignore their reprisals it was a victory but it was not won on any field of battle how will our warriors deal with their way of fighting if we take the field against them now calgus inclined his head with respect for the wisdom of the question by dealing with their strength one unit at a time brennus first well smash their forts along the north road and bring the wall cohorts to battle by attacking the wall itself the old man tilted his head and if they decline to fight us if they choose to keep us at arms length and wait for their reinforcements calgus laughed sharply exactly what we must expect them to do only a fool would throw a single legion and their auxiliary rabble into battle against our great forest of spears which is why i have formed a plan to ensure that they have no choice but to engage us and most likely in groups of less than their full strength a plan my brothers of the utmost simplicity yes a swift strike down the north road by our eastern warband burning out their forts all the way down to noisy valley by destroying noisy valley we deprive them of supplies we keep them on the back foot and we strengthen our arms with whatever we can take while they dither as to our next move well split the warband to left and right burn out the forts to east and west then pull back into the north taking what plunder we can carry we can trust in our unexpected retreat to drag them along behind us hot for vengeance at the same time our second warband and our main strength in horsemen will strike at their undefended forts in the west they will burn out fort cocidius and cross the wall to destroy the hill and fair meadow this threat in their rear will fix the auxiliaries and prevent them joining with the legion brothers we must put them off balance and keep them that way continually rushing their forces to the newest point of danger and when the opportunities present themselves as they will we will strike hard and destroy their cohorts piecemeal another of the tribal kings spoke out stepping into the firelight we agree calgus although i still say that this is a strange kind of war to fight i understand in past days we would have gone straight for their throats dashed ourselves against their shield wall as we have a dozen times before and lost warriors by the thousand in futile battles that could only end one way we know their legions are meat grinders made to fight in one way and only one way in a battle line where they slaughter our warbands from behind their shields they will never choose to fight man to man because man to man they know they can only lose this way we avoid confronting their legions face to face until the moment is right when weve bled them a dozen times razed their forts to the ground and made them charge round the land in search of us we strike where they are weak and we avoid their strength until were ready to deal with them when they march into a trap of our patient making then my friends we will take so many heads that well make mountains of their skulls after that there will be no choice for them but to negotiate a settlement their southern legions will be needed in their own areas soon enough or the entire country will go up in flames victory and peace on our terms i trust that would meet with your approval the dumnonii chief nodded reluctantly where you lead i will follow calgus just dont wait too long to bring my tribe some glory or all the promises of future slaughter i can make to them wont keep them in hand calgus laughed putting a hand on the other mans shoulder caradog you need wait no longer ive put you and your tribe at the tip of the spear tonight youll be beheading romans before the sun rises again even if its only the pitiful few that havent already run off down the road to the wall brennus snorted and their sixth legion will sit idly by and let all this happen calguss smile broadened ah yes the infamous sixth legion i have something special planned for legatus sollemnis and his men one of his retinue approached respectfully whispered into the tribal leaders ear and withdrew calgus pulled an amused face raising his hands in apology i must ask you to excuse me i have a visitor he left the circle his bodyguard of picked votadini warriors clustering around him as he made the short walk back to his tent at the door he was met by one of his advisers an elder of proven wisdom who had stood alongside his father in his day its a roman he rode up to the scouts and asked to be taken to you said that you would be expecting him i have him under guard inside two spears at his throat if he twitches in the wrong way our men will kill him immediately i asked him what he wanted but he refuses to talk to anyone but you shall i have his throat slit calgus shook his head quickly not this one aed this ones the key to our victory i knew that he would come to me at this time in fact ive been depending on it all these weeks so pass the word the man that so much as looks at him the wrong way will be joining his ancestors after a long session under my knife this one gets safe passage and no questions nodding his thanks he entered the tent the newcomer was standing at the far end the two warriors tasked with his control watching him down the shafts of unwavering spears crossing his arms calgus looked the newcomer up and down taking in his air of complete relaxation ive been expecting a visit from a roman these last few days but if youre that man youll know i have no way to be sure youre the same person the roman tossed a small object to him catching it calgus recognised the gold shield brooch that had been taken from him after their first meeting in the forest months before proof enough i have to salute your courage not only putting yourself in my hands when i might well still be smarting for vengeance for the murder of my companions but riding into this camp at this time brigantia herself must be smiling on you for you to have got this far without losing your head the other man smiled confidently fortuna smiles on the man who knows when to take the right risk ive taken that risk to offer you a bargain we can both profit from your gain you will recall will be two things youll value over any other prize a legions eagle standard and the head of a roman general if you kill me now youll never see either or hear the information ive brought to convince you of my sincerity if youre still interested the briton stared back impassively interested if theres a way that i can be guaranteed youre not just the highrisk end of a plot to mislead me at this critical time yes im still interested but to gain my trust roman youll need to give me two things firstly i want some proof that you can deliver me the prizes you offer so blithely secondly and much more importantly i want to know why start talking the roman shrugged proof that i can deliver you what ive promised where shall we start why not with who i am my name is titus tigidius perennis and i am a tribune with the sixth imperial legions staff you want proof i can tell you that the supply depot at noisy valley is being emptied out even as we speak by the time you get there the place will be a collection of bare cupboards with nothing of value to sustain your army in the field i can tell you that the other two legions the second and twentieth have been on the road north for over two weeks and will be here long before youre expecting you see i can tell you that your options are becoming more and more limited with every day and you havent even made your first move yet im your best hope for victory probably your only hope calgus nodded slowly raising a sceptical eyebrow i see and as to my second question yes why would i be doing this thats simple there is a cancer at the heart of the sixth legion a seed of disloyalty to the emperor and his closest advisers and i intend removing it in any way i can the ends will more than justify the means later that evening well after dark with the th either settled for the night or in the case of a few lucky men with dependants in the vicus on a onenight pass out of the fort marcus went for a walk up to the wall hed looked for rufius hoping to benefit from some measure of the older mans imperturbability by discussing the situation with him the veteran officer was nowhere to be found however and his chosen man had simply shrugged apologetically at the question standing above the north gate with the wind tugging at his tunic he drank in the hours quiet peace away to his right he could just make out the lake by the faint ripples kicked up by the winds touch while the forest wall made a darker line against the landscape the distant flickers of torches inside the treeline betrayed the presence of some part of the garrison clearly camping down for the night in barbarian territory most likely one of the night familiarisation exercises that frontinius ran from time to time he decided without interest leaning against the parapet to enjoy the moment the guards below were talking their words drifting up to him sometimes audible other times too low to be discernible he listened for a few minutes hearing hopes and fears expressed more in the voices themselves than by the words used taking strength from an uncertainty that seemed to match his own on the verge of turning to walk back down into the fort he heard his voice being called from below leaning over the inner parapet he saw caelius standing below there you are message from the first spear youre to join him at the treeline as soon as possible marcus frowned down at his colleague why i was about to go and get some sleep how the bloody hell would i know look im not tired yet ill walk out with you come on you dont want to keep uncle sextus waiting any longer than you have to they strode down the steep north face of the escarpment leaving the gate guards nodding knowingly at each other once they had passed and made their way across the flat plain below the forts walls away from the forts reassuring bulk the darkness seemed deeper pregnant with uncertain futures caeliuss presence at his side was more reassuring than hed expected wars coming two knives are you ready marcus paused for a second were ready theyre fit good with their swords no are you ready the pause was longer than before i think so i know i can fight i can take my century where i want it to go fight the way i want it to fight yes im ready ready to kill to drop a mans guts out of his belly and see the life fade from his eyes marcus stopped in the darkness looking up at the brilliant blaze of stars i fought on the road to yew grove you know and killed more than one man all i havent done is face a full warband in a battle line everyone gives that so much weight ive caught the other officers looking at me weighing up how ill perform when it comes to a real fight even dubnus seems reserved now part of another world and all theyve ever done that i havent is fought in a fullscale battle whats so difficult about that caelius walked back to face him starlight dimly illuminating the harsh lines of his helmet its shadows reducing his face to a death mask between the cheekpieces that depends on the man ive known some whove called the odds in barracks but shat themselves at the sight of a halfdozen angry farmers others the sleepyeyed men that you wouldnt trust to chase cattle out of a cornfield go wild in battle and paint themselves black with enemy blood you need to be ready for it you not just your men you dont get a second chance in a real fight you hesitate for a second and some big bluenosed bastard with a tenth of your skill will have your guts steaming in the dirt when we meet the enemy you remember what i told you eh and offer a prayer to cocidius for me when you come out alive he swept his hand past marcuss face as if catching a delicate butterfly from out of the air holding the closed fist up in front of him thats life grabbed from nowhere easily lost dont throw yours away marcus put up his own fist tapping caeliuss gently in the gesture of respect common between the cohorts soldiers they walked on in silence drawing closer to the torches moving in the trees until marcus saw that they were held by soldiers standing facing into the forest as if on guard duty a figure materialised out of the darkness with a walk that was familiar even in the neardarkness pure arrogant power in the strides julius two knives what theres no time come and whatever sextus asks of you you just say yes first spear both men took an arm propelling the mystified marcus towards a darker shape that loomed large in the gloom until its unseen bulk blocked all view of the lights in the trees julius abruptly put a hand on marcuss chest to stop him giving a soft whistle to signal his presence another voice spoke out of the darkness it is time light the fire for a moment nothing seemed to be happening although marcus sensed the presence of men around him one or two darker spots against the darkness then the flames creeping round the sides of the massive pile of brushwood and branches fire applied on its far side took hold gradually illuminating the scene almost a dozen men stood around him all of the cohorts centurions all with faces set in solemnity although rufius did manage a crafty wink of greeting frontinius stepped forward speaking clearly so that all could hear him above the fires growing crackle welcome centurion until today you were probationary under the assessment of these men your brotherstobe for all our initial doubts it is our belief that you will make an excellent addition to our number and provide leadership for your century that will be sorely needed in the coming days this is your moment to renounce your past and join your brother officers in our chosen duty he paused significantly giving marcus an interrogatory stare do you wish to become a part of the cohorts brotherhood in spite of the heavy weight of responsibility that the position brings renouncing all that has gone before in your life julius nudged his arm yes first spear do you swear to uphold the traditions of the cohort even at cost of your life yes first spear will you give faithful service to the cohort until death or the end of your service yes first spear will you fight and die as commanded by your superiors yes first spear will you demand the same of your men if required yes first spear and will you pay appropriate respect to the cohorts chosen god mighty cocidius the warrior yes first spear very well marcus tribulus corvus i formally and irrevocably appoint you a centurion of the first tungrian cohort your previous life ends in this place purged in the fire your new life begins here forged in the fire remember your vows well youngest brother for the time for you to fulfil them will come when you least expect it be true to your words he walked forward offering marcus his hand and the other officers crowded round with congratulations and slaps on his back now brothers there is one last matter with our new brother officer before we give thanks to cocidius for his meeting our high standards within a week well be camping alongside the other wall units some of them cohorts of doubtful honour and with many sharp ears besides if it becomes obvious that we have a roman officer serving with the cohort that information might reach the wrong people the men who destroyed our brothers family and made him outlaw for no good reason would come for him and that would most likely bring death and dishonour on all of us and our families and upon the prefect for that matter understand me clearly we have taken a calculated risk in accepting this man into our family from this moment he is to be referred to only as centurion or by the unofficial title that his century has seen fit to give him make sure that your deputies are all aware of the rule and their soldiers from now this man is to be known only by the name of two knives legatus sollemnis arrived on the wall at the rock with the sixth legions cavalry detachment shortly after darkness fell two nights later the rest of the legion was more than thirty miles back down the road to yew grove encamped after a day slogging their way north at the forced march and still a day away he had raced forward to take control of the wall forces on receiving word from his asturian scouts ranging across the frontier zone under perenniss command reports that the barbarian warband was already in the field their latest dispatches had calgus poised to strike down the north road towards his main eastern strength and a much greater prize besides once past the rock the walls eastern gateway it was less than a fivemile march south to noisy valley his main supply base for the wall units this he suspected was the prize for which calgus would commit his strength jumping down from his horse he hurried into the forts headquarters acknowledging the sentries salutes with a distracted wave of his hand as hed hoped not only the cohorts grimfaced prefect but also his own senior tribune appius were waiting for him in the lamplight a map of the area spread across the table in front of them gentlemen i suspect we havent much time so ill forgo the usual formalities whats the situation appius swiftly painted a picture for him pointing to the key points on the map calgus has thrown at least twothirds of his force straight down the main road with no attempt at concealment whatsoever theyre about ten miles out right now and coming straight on theyve already burnt out the fort at three mountains yew tree and red river and we expect them to do the same to roaring river very shortly what about the garrisons the cavalry detachment attached to the three mountains garrison seems to have attempted a defence of the fort a few survivors have straggled in but from their reports we shouldnt expect to recover the unit the brits seem to have a substantial cavalry force in the field perhaps five hundred horses fools of all the times that we can least afford to lose horsemen and the detachments at the other forts falling back in good order sir it would seem that the sight of burning forts on the horizon got their attention at least we can count them into our covering force what about the twentieth a messenger arrived three hours ago with bad news im afraid sir twentieth legion wont arrive for another five days theyve had problems of their own with the local tribes the second has caught up with them as planned but theyve still only got as far as veterans hill sollemnis frowned at the news still several days out then yet how i long for their arrival until they join us calgus has the initiative and from the way hes acting id say he knows it i should have put the sixth in play three days ago instead of which theyll arrive footsore and in need of rest late tomorrow he rubbed at tired eyes shaking his head wryly i gambled that the delay was compensated by my flexibility to move either side of the mountains if calguss move down the north road were a feint to distract me from the west it was a poor guess despite the strategic sense it made and so here we are scrambling to catch up with the game he rubbed at his weary eyes again before slapping the table with decision we shall have to manage with what we have prefect galen have your men ready to pull out within the hour and burn everything that will burn calgus wont stop at roaring river he needs to keep his men on the move if hes going to try what i think he intends so i expect the warband to be knocking at your gates before daybreak youre to pull back to the east and link up with the auxiliary battlegroup forming at cauldron pool appius legatus send riders to the sixth i want them moving up the road at first light and no later forced march send riders to the prefects at white strength and cauldron pool warn them that the rock and noisy valley are being abandoned and that theyre on their own for the time being theyre authorised to pull cohorts from the wall units farther down the line in both directions if they see fit to form larger formations but i dont want fighting men thrown away defending ground needlessly as far as im concerned calgus can mess about on the wall as much as he wants the forts are just wooden walls for the most part we built them once we can build them again men are more important than ground at this point make that very clear the officer nodded his understanding scribbling notes on a wax tablet good im riding south to noisy valley with my bodyguard well have to prepare whats left of their supplies for the torch if were going to deny calgus that stepping stone but i want to get as many more wagons away as possible beforehand youre to stay here and help make sure the local boys get away in good order and that the fort is burned out in good time i dont want to be fighting outside these walls when we come north again yes sir what do you think calgus intends after he gets south of the wall if i was calgus id have my eye fixed on two prizes firstly id want to take noisy valley intact with its supplies and weapons that way he can keep his men moving without having to forage for food either south for yew grove or west to roll up the wall forts then id be looking to destroy our legions one at a time overwhelm them with sheer numbers before we get a chance to build up a proper sized army that can grind his warbands into mince either way i reckon hell come looking for the sixth hoping to roll us over before the second and twentieth arrive noisy valley hes welcome to he can play in the ashes of those empty sheds as long as he pleases but as mars is my witness im damned if ill let him anywhere near my eagle until its accompanied by two others just the same lets be about it gentlemen the first indication to the tungrians that the warband had struck was a distant glow against the eastern horizon on being called by the sentries julius as that nights guard captain took one look and called for the cohorts senior officers first spear and prefect stood on the forts high wall for several minutes watching the minute flicker of light in silence at length the senior centurion turned away from the view taking no pride in the vindication of his professional opinion he turned to equitius that will be the rock burning at a guess the warband must have come down the north road during the night and attacked the fort without much warning impressive discipline to make a move like that in the dark with untrained savages sentries watch for another fire a little to the south of the first duty officer enter orders in the night report that all men are to parade at dawn and be ready to leave the fort at short notice pull the mile fort units back in after breakfast but leave a fast runner at each point to keep watch for any activity over the wall he stamped off back to his bed leaving the guards to watch for any further sign it came an hour before daybreak another tiny flicker of light in the distance and the dawn revealed a distant plume of black smoke that rose in concert with that of the original blaze and once again the senior officers grimly gathered to view the scene julius off duty but unwilling to sleep grimaced at the sight chewing morosely at an apple while marcus stood silently alongside him not quite able to fully comprehend what was happening on the horizon julius shook his head sadly noisy valley there goes the forward supply station we can only hope that northern command had the good sense to get all of the weapons and grain out before the barbarians decided to strike i dont much fancy tackling thirty thousand bluenoses if theyve all got a belly full of our bread and half a dozen of our spears apiece to repatriate after breakfast the cohorts women started their journey to the safety of waterside fort on the west coast thirty miles in the opposite direction from the horizons grim signs of battle the older women and small children riding in mule carts while the remainder walked alongside a courier galloped up to the walls minutes later his horse and those of his four escorts lathered in sweat from the speed of their journey equitius hurried down to the gate to receive the dispatch calling the officers together in his office the courier party their horses watered rode away to the southwest heading for the second tungrian cohort at fair meadow the rock and noisy valley are burnt out but their units are largely intact and falling back to the west to hook up with the units gathering at cauldron pool northern command has given orders for the prefect commanding cauldron pool to exercise local initiative but to avoid any last stand that would result in heavy loss of trained men the centurions waited imperturbably wondering how they would have reacted to an order to abandon the fort cauldron pool was only nine miles distant with only the fort at badger holes between them to block the barbarian progress to the hill early reports are that two warbands of about ten thousand men apiece have been deployed through the gap in the wall one turned east and driving for white strength the other advancing south that leaves something like another ten thousand men as yet uncommitted somewhere in their rear and a lot of options still open for calgus to exploit were directed to deploy forward to cauldron pool and join the second asturian horse the batavians the raetians and the thracians plus our neighbours the second tungrians to form a strong combined blocking force the generals intention would seem to be that of deterring any westward movement by the forces already identified while we wait for the legions to move in from their forward camps after that well start trying to find the warbands and destroy them one at a time anything to add first spear frontinius rubbed his scalp stepping out in front of the centurions brief your men that were marching east to take a blocking position along with other cohorts from the line forts dont tell them that the total strength of the blocking force between the rest of the line forts and the bluenoses will only be five hundred cavalry and three thousand infantry do tell them that well be away from the fort for a long period and that we are very likely to see combat no tell them that we are certain to see combat be ready to march as soon as the sentries are back in guard commander to sound the recall thats all centurion corvus a word he drew marcus to one side what i didnt mention yesterday when i gave your century the reward of being first in the line of march was the role traditionally played by the leading century in this cohort in time of war sir the firstplaced century gets all the kudos carries the standard about and dies gloriously in its defence if all is lost the secondplaced century on the other hand gets all the dirty jobs scouting in front of the cohort diversionary tasks and the like in other words all of the fun are you game for a little fun centurion marcus straightened his back pushing his chin out yes sir good in that case ive got just the job for you with the th century detached for the first spears speculative mission the cohort marched from the fort seven hundred men strong juliuss th century marching with the standard at the heart of the column that snaked out on to the military road and headed purposefully away to the east at the double marcus waited in front of his men until the last were clear of the vicus then turned to address them over the diminishing clatter of hobnails on the roads surface his farewell to rufius had been hurried his friend simply clasping arms and tugging his head down to whisper into his ear keep it simple marcus and dont be afraid to ask dubnus for advice if youre uncertain about anything i expect to see your pretty roman features within a day or two so dont disappoint me marcus nodded to himself without realising it then turned to face the century drawn up in parade formation very well ninth century were on detached duty until our present task is finished and we head for cauldron pool to rejoin the cohort lets go hunting four hours later having slipped through the wall at a now unguarded mile fort far enough from the hill to be out of sight of anyone watching the fort the th stole quietly back towards their camp in the steady light of a cloudy afternoon the emphasis now was upon stealth rather than speed across ground the soldiers picking each footfall with care to avoid snapping fallen branches their passage marked by nothing noisier than the buzzing of disturbed flies in the oppressively heavy air dubnus long accustomed to the hill countrys weather looked at the sky for the tenth time in half an hour working out how long they had before the inevitable rain started falling the century was stretched across the rough country in a halfmilewide net each tent party spaced across its own hundredpace frontage the men at each end keeping sight of their opposite numbers in the neighbouring parties marcus and dubnus moved silently in the rear waiting for any sign that their men had made contact their backs covered by a watchful antenoch if the hill were under observation for whatever purpose they would know soon enough at length later than dubnus had predicted a steady rain began to fall slowly growing heavier until water had penetrated down everyones necks no matter how tightly capes were fastened at least the rain will cover any noise were making dubnus snorted at marcuss comment flicking water out of his beard youve officially been here too long when you start finding reasons why its good for rain to fall in the early afternoon after an hour or more of painstakingly slow progress in the continuing rain a flurry of hand signals rippled down the line of soldiers who as instructed went to earth once the message was passed on marcus and dubnus made careful haste up the line until they reached the soldier who had raised the alert behind the cover of a thorn bush he pointed forward then pointed to his nose and sniffed audibly marcus sampled the air finding the slight tang of wood smoke on the breeze and nodded to dubnus who leant in close to whisper in his ear above the rains pattering ill take the two closest tent parties in marcus nodded the rest of the century would stay in place until the order was given to move again were too far from the hill for this to be the watch point try to do it silently and well get the watcher as well after a whispered conversation with the two tent party leaders their men gathered behind the thorn bush dubnus whispered a command and the group split up one tent party remaining with the officers the other snaking away on their bellies to move around behind the source of the smells that had betrayed their quarry marcus and dubnus crept up to the edge of the copse from which the cooking smells were emanating allowing time for the men making their way around to the far side to get into position as they slowly eased in between the trees the guttural sound of native conversation grew louder clearly the hidden men did not fear discovery raising his head with a hunters patient stealth dubnus peeped through the top of a bush then sank back into place he whispered to the nearest man marcus straining to pick up the words despite his proximity three men one well dressed one poorly dressed one old kill the young peasant spare the others if you can the whispered command was passed around the group and a man wormed around to brief the other tent party while the soldiers readied themselves to spring dubnus hefted his throwing axe then stepped out of the shade of his bush barking a low challenge at the startled britons as marcus came to his feet a rough circle of bare ground had been created in the copses middle half a dozen trees having been felled to clear enough space for a shelter of branches and turf to be erected in its middle to one side of the clearing a man of about twenty years dressed in rough woollen leggings and tunic was tending a cooking fire protected from the rain by a crude turf roof over which were suspended half a dozen gutted hares his shocked face an upturned white blur an old man of fifty or so sitting on the stump of one of the felled trees was looking up at the last member of the group a man in his early middle age and dressed as dubnus had indicated well enough to be a local noble of some kind the cook leapt to his feet reaching for a sword propped against his cooking spit a spear blurred out of the trees behind him and thudded into his body arching his back and dropping him across the fire face first the other two men drew swords spinning back to back as the rest of the hunting party burst into their hiding place snarling defiance at their attackers alive dubnus stepped into the clearing smashing the nobles sword from his hand with a sweep of his axe following up with a shield punch that knocked the man out cleanly faced with half a dozen armed troops the older mans resistance crumbled and the soldiers disarmed him without a struggle marcus strolled into the copse eyeing the dead cook whose rough clothes were smouldering get him off that fire there may be others close at hand we need to know what these men were about and quickly yes put the knife to the older man marcus turned to find antenoch at his shoulder why him the subject of conversation glowered up at them crouched in a kneeling position under the swords of a pair of soldiers his wrists and ankles bound firmly antenoch squatted to look into his eyes smiling at him without any change of expression in his own eyes hes seen more than most to judge from his age probably fought in the uprising of killed saw men die horribly wouldnt that just harden him for a while but as a man grows older his own mortality begins to press upon him i can get the information we need but ill have to shed blood to get it quickly enough marcus hesitated centurion they wouldnt think twice about skinning you alive if they captured you and we have to descend to their level the other man shrugged depends whether you want to win or not marcus nodded take the other one away out of earshot i dont want to risk him hearing any of this dubnus nodded gripping the unconscious briton by the arms and dragging him from the clearing marcus squatted down alongside antenoch as his clerk drew a small dagger if he condoned the act of torture he could hardly walk away from its consequences the briton stared unhappily at the knife only his eyes and nose visible above the heavy cloth gag that had silenced his muttered protests antenoch tossed the blade from hand to hand staring at the older man until he dragged his attention away from the weapon and returned the gaze the soldier spoke in the british language gesturing with the knife to emphasise his point you know that youre going to die dont you marcus was perturbed to see the other man nod impassively but then youre not that far from dying in any case five or ten years at the most better to go this way than slowly with no teeth and depending on the help of your sons to eat and shelter eh again the nod the briton had clearly come to the same conclusion in fact the only thing between you and a nice clean death is the fact that you know some things that i need you to tell me you talk i slit your throat and make sure youre buried too deep for the wolves to find you hows that for a deal they waited while the briton digested the suggestion at length he shook his head unhappily pulling a deep breath into his lungs in preparation for what might be to come shame you see i reckon youre a respected warrior with many heads on your walls i think youve earned the rewards of the afterlife all of the good things you denied yourself to live a life of training and devotion to the sword the women will be oiling themselves up in the great kingdom over the river ready for your arrival be a shame for all of you when you arrive without your manhood without warning he reached down and unfastened the bound mans leggings pulling them down to reveal his genitalia not bad not bad at all think what the girls upstairs are going to miss out on he grasped the britons testicles separated one from the other and with a flourish of the knife neatly sliced it from the captives body holding the bloodied organ up for him to see one of the watching soldiers vomited noisily into a convenient bush earning a glare from dubnus who had returned to witness the interrogation show some respect the britons howl of pain and anguish was muted by the gag to a low moan his eyes bulging with the pain antenoch stopped him from slumping to the ground with an outstretched hand holding him up as the waves of pain washed over him waiting until the mans eyes opened again now from here it can go one of two ways either you can be sensible and tell us what you know or i can remove the rest of your manhood and send you on your way incomplete id imagine even one ball and your cock would be of more use to you in the afterlife than nothing whatsoever the older man nodded honour satisfied antenoch cut his gag away keeping the knife close to his throat once the obstruction to speech was removed the briton spoke through gritted teeth fighting back the pain with a conscious effort youll kill me cleanly and put my body where the wolves cant drag it to pieces my word and his he gestured over his shoulder to the silent marcus who nodded gravely i will tell you what you want to know but first theres a woman antenoch frowned what woman the warrior sighed and shook his head at a memory his breath still shaky with pain i warned him not to take her i told him that no good would come of it it offended cocidius shes one of his people he nodded his head at marcus although i cant say if she still lives or whats been done with her the confession and burials took another two hours during which time dubnus took three tent parties and found the watchers hide post betrayed by the briton leaving the lone watchers head tied to a branch by the hair as a calling card the century took a swift meal of bread and cheese from their packs then headed northeast in early evenings halfdarkness dragging the unwilling noble with them and using their intimate knowledge of the terrain to make reasonable progress under a fat full moon when they stopped five hours later within thirty minutes march of their target marcus and antenoch took the noble off into the dark a tent party of soldiers shadowing them in a watching arc to ensure that no unfriendly strangers interrupted dubnus busied the century with the task of camouflaging their faces with salivamoistened mud each man painting broad stripes across anothers features to break up the large area of pale flesh out of sight of the halted century antenoch pushed the man to the ground and pulled his knife finding marcuss hand on his shoulder my turn translate he squatted next to the noble pulling his regulation dagger from its place at his side i always thought id never use an issue weapon for a dishonourable purpose this country is changing my mind in all sorts of ways were a mile from your farm where im told you have a roman woman captive the other man shrugged at the translation spitting at marcuss feet we offered your companion the chance to change his mind earlier my bodyguard here only cut off one of his balls and then allowed him to think again about telling us what he knew he told us that you had already taken the woman by force and that you intend giving her to your men as a celebration of the great victory to come another shrug you dont get that extra chance to change your mind you will die here either intact and quickly or no longer a man and in terrible pain and very slowly i expect that the wolves will find you quickly enough if we slit your belly and peg you out for them take a moment to consider your choice but dont expect to get an opportunity to make that choice more than once the nobleman looked from marcus to antenoch who nodded slowly to emphasise the threat he coughed noisily to clear his throat then glared up at marcus his latin roughened by lack of practice was nevertheless clear in its emphasis better to die without my manhood than to betray my people you should understand that do what you must marcus turned away his mind thousands of miles and several years distant on a windy afternoon late in the year training inside the house to avoid dust stirred up by the gusts outside his trainer sensing boredom in his student had suddenly dropped his sword to the floor and indicated to him to do the same sometimes you wont have a blade to defend yourself with master marcus in the arena ive had my blade smashed from my hand more than once but still won the fight how ah got your attention now have i simple enough young man know where to strike a man and how hard to strike him if youre fast enough to get inside his defence and land a blow you can choose to put your opponent on his back or simply take his life just hit him here pointing a finger to touch marcuss throat and youll stop him breathing you choose how long for a little tap will put him down for a moment short of breath and helpless a decent thump carefully measured will probably knock him out for a few minutes anything harder will almost certainly kill him since swords obviously dont entertain today lets practise that killing blow eh he raised an arm pointing to the back of his wrist strike here as hard as you like no boy i said hard your opponent just smiled at you and stuck his sword into your guts pick a point a foot behind the target and punch at that good excellent followthrough again excellent now lets work on the harder job just knocking the man down for a little while he spun back and struck the kneeling mans throat with the daggers hilt with killing force dropping him choking into the grass after a moment or so the spasmodic jerking slowed then stopped altogether he knelt and put two fingers to the mans neck dead hell meet his ancestors a complete man and i didnt dishonour the blade antenoch frowned in the moonlight why didnt you torture him because he wasnt going to talk and we dont have the time to waste carving one man when theres a job to be done come on he turned back to the centurys waiting place leaving his clerk staring quizzically after him in the darkness the tungrians made a silent approach to the farm advancing down the dark hillside that brooded to its south until the black shapes of its round huts and fenced enclosures which surrounded them stood out against the stars a stop group of three tent parties moved carefully around the buildings heading for their position at the farms rear to catch any escapees while the rest of the century dropped their packs into a large pile and advanced to the walls still silent behind their shields in the darkness a dog awoke smelt strangers and barked indignantly joined a heartbeat later by half a dozen others marcus drew his sword and jumped the wall sprinting across the empty animal pen and kicking hard at the door to the main building it resisted his attack and he stepped back to allow a pair of soldiers to shouldercharge through the barrier moving through the shattered doorway in their wake and peering into the gloom over the top of his shield sword ready to strike a man charged out of the darkness a faint light reflecting the line of steel brandished high above his head and without conscious thought marcus stepped forward into the brace and punched his shield into the contorted face stabbing his sword upwards into the unprotected chest he stepped back again watching the body crumple back into the darkness a shriek sounded from the far side of the hut as another point of resistance was extinguished dubnus moved swiftly past him stepping over the sprawled body of his kill and headed away into the darkness marcus followed through a wooden archway and into a smaller hut this one lit by a candle in whose puddle of light huddled a woman and her three children dubnus grabbed a soldier pushing him at the terrified group watch them kill them if they try to escape on the huts far side barely illuminated by the candle was a heavy door secured by a bar dubnus tossed away the bar and heaved the door open then ducked away as a wooden bowl flew past his ear a cultured female voice spat latin imprecations at them from the darkness within come on then you bastards come and get me dubnus backed away from the door gesturing to marcus to try his luck marcus peered around the frame quite unable to make out anything in the dark chosen get me some light maam we are the ninth century of the first tungrian cohort imperial roman auxiliary forces youre free a slight scraping movement inside the room made him duck instinctively but the wooden cup caught him neatly under the eye making stars flash before him for an instant jupiter wheres that bloody light captured roman citizen or not if you throw one more thing at me ill dubnus ducked back into the hut with a blazing torch careful not to let it catch at the straw roofing marcus sheathed his sword and took the light holding it carefully in front of him as he stepped back into the doorway take a good look armour helmet shield i am a roman soldier satisfied the woman stayed where she was crouched behind a small knife in the far corner of her cell her dark hair was in disarray straggling across a dirty face out of which shone piercing green eyes above a snub nose and small mouth her chin wobbling slightly as she fought back the tears was delicately pointed she was dressed in a woollen shift and little else her feet crusted with scabs from previous cuts and scrapes her clothes and shoes presumably stolen on her capture very well suit yourself well leave you here for the bluenoses to find when the fire brings them running he turned away winking at dubnus no wait he opened his mouth to invite her out of the cell just as a sudden scream sounded from outside the hut dubnus chose the fastest way out of the structure hacking fiercely at the wall to make a small gap through which he burst in a shower of dried mud and horsehair into the night in his wake marcus drew his sword shouting at the soldier already guarding the stillterrified family to watch the woman as well outside the fighting had already all but ended with two of the ths men down one not moving and half a dozen native men in rough woollens sprawled in the light of dubnuss torch two remaining enemy were falling back under the advance of a dozen of marcuss men through whose line dubnus charged in a blaze of light tossing the torch at one of them even as he ran another through with his sword leaving the sword buried in the dying mans guts he ripped the axe from his belt and hurled it into the distracted tribesmans throat a froth of blood sheeting out from the wound as the man dropped to his knees then pitched headlong to the ground marcus grabbed the nearest man that wasnt vomiting demanding to know where the barbarians clearly too well equipped to be farm peasants had come from the soldier still wide eyed from sudden combat pointed vaguely out into the darkness his voice shook with fear rising as if a shriek was waiting to explode from his body came from out there might be more marcus took the man by the throat pinching his windpipe hard to get his attention and putting his face in close steady there arent any more of them or theyd be all over us by now dubnus get these men ready to probe forward he looked at the wounded soldier seeing a great dark stain blacken the mans right legging above the knee a bloody spear lying near him the man lay back against the cold earth his eyes closing as if to sleep bandage carrier a calm voice spoke behind him assured in its tone ill treat him you concentrate on doing your job he turned to find the woman at his arm her eyes locked on the fallen soldier you hes going to die centurion the wound has pierced the great artery let me comfort his last few moments he turned away in wonder pushing a pair of soldiers towards her and telling them to watch over her and get her a cloak then stalked off to find dubnus chosen are these men ready to scout forward yes sir i good then go and organise the searching of the farm and get the rest of the century ready to move out well be back inside ten minutes dubnus stared at him hard in the gloom then turned away to his task marcus looked his men over most of three tent parties twentyfive men all looking jumpy enough to run if a small boy with a wooden sword came out of the darkness right were going forward to look for signs of where those barbarians came from were going to move in a line and i want you to look for anything that might give us a clue as to what a party of warriors was doing hanging around a latrine like this that got a laugh at least form a line twofoot spacing and follow me oh and by the way they stared at him a mixture of curiosity and dread distorting their faces you won that one yes be proud of yourselves youre all warriors now he ignored the fact that half of them had probably stood watching in amazement when the fighting started that was for those that had actually fought to take advantage of later what he needed now was for them to take courage and for the most part they did some of them actually standing taller under the praise he led them forward using his drawn sword to feel ahead into the darkness a tinge of purple in the east betraying the approach of sunrise only an hour away not a good time to delay in the face of an enemy of unknown strength and disposition fifty paces brought them to a fence which marcus vaulted with a bravado he was far from feeling grateful to hear the grunts and thuds of his men crossing the obstruction even as he hissed at them for silence ten paces past the barrier he heard a tiny sound a scraping rustle against the ground that made him duck into his shield and advance the sword wrist cocked arenastyle ready to strike a heavy breath puffed against his cheek making him jump backwards in shock a muted bellow of greeting bringing his heart into his throat the soldiers started to laugh one of them walking forward to get a better look cattle sir lots of them marcus sheathed his sword in disgust taking a closer look the animals jostled around them hoping for food the ox that had startled him crowded in closest nudging at his hands with its massive snout like an overgrown mastiff and his heart lightened as he realised that the biggest threat was being trampled if the animal thought there might be fodder somewhere behind him beasts like these became used to being pampered hand fed with the best food that could be found for them anything to make them fatter and glossier for the day when the armys purchasing officer came to call children tended to get the job of looking after them and as children do ended up domesticating them into pets he sighed at the thought and how his men many of them the children of the local farms on both sides of the wall might react to what he already knew was his only course of action very well farm boy they seem to like you well enough take a rough count and let me know how many there are you get me some light you get the chosen and bring him here quickly dubnus arrived just as the count was completed roughly fifty fully grown animals standing silently in the dark field dubnus stroked his beard i left two tent parties guarding the farm those enemy troops must have been guarding these heard our noise and ran into our men theres flour in the farm enough for thousands of loaves and big hearths built into the walls firewood too and pine pitch and staves for making torches lots of jars fifty oxen are enough to feed ten thousand men this is a supply dump waiting for a warband the size of a legion he stared sadly at the cattle their breath steaming in the torchlight marcus nodded agreement but where was the enemy within marching distance and hungry for supplies before they went at the wall or was this just a contingency an option prepared for an eventuality that might not come to pass they looked at each other sharing a moment of understanding how many jars of pitch enough very well lets get it over with the chosen nodded then shook his head ruefully war makes for unhappy tasks he swung to face the waiting troops oddnumbered tent parties fetch firewood from the barn three loads each bring them here to me even numbers to me the slaughter was grimly efficient farmraised soldiers reluctantly leading the oxen out of the enclosure one at a time to be greeted by a party of the stronger men who gently penned each beast in their ranks using gentle hands and words to soothe the animals dubnus and two of the older soldiers one of them a butchers apprentice in his youth all of them bloody spectres after the first few animals calmed each animal further with soft words then dispatched each one with a swift twisting thrust of their long knives beneath the massive jaws the soldiers dragged each fresh corpse away with ropes taken from the farm building a pyre of their bodies with the firewood piled around them soon they too were liberally streaked with the animals blood as it worked deep into scalps and fingernails the man who had first gone forward into the herd gently touching and caressing the oxen as he counted them turned away and wept at the spectacle to marcuss astonishment not only did his colleagues keep a respectful distance until his eyes were dry again but dubnus wrapped a bloody arm around his bony shoulders and spoke a few private words of comfort after a while tired of the smell of the animals blood marcus went back down to the farm buildings while the cull was completed finding the roman woman sitting quietly the dead soldiers head cradled in her lap while the men set to watch over her squatted on either side she looked up at marcus her dirty face streaked with dried tears he regained consciousness for a few moments he called on brigantia to take his spirit she sniffed quietly thank you for staying with him she stood gently placing the dead mans head on his shield centurion valerius aquila the response was automatic the word hanging in the air between them as her eyebrows rose with interest visible in dawns first light a famous name in my childhood your family are a powerful force in rome no more lady it seems youre a native roman until i was thirteen and my father was posted to the wall so how does the son of a famous family come to be an auxiliary officer rather than choosing to serve with the legions her voice came to a stop as his response sank in marcus bent closer whispering in her ear id be grateful if we spoke no more of my former status until we have the privacy for a frank conversation i see but i a soldier ran up to them his armour crusted with blood saluting respectfully with more than half an eye on the womans body centurion the chosen says to tell you that the culls finished were ready to burn them her eyes ignited with fury scalding marcus with their sudden flare of anger not the oxen tell me it isnt the oxen he marched stony faced back up the hill the woman running at his shoulder when she saw the lifeless humps of flesh littering the mistwreathed ground her anger was kindled anew she rounded on marcus with a snarl that made the soldiers closest to her step back involuntarily their minds jerked back to distant memories of angry mothers you bastards every one of those cattle represented life or death to a crofting family and youve slaughtered them without a second thought dubnus stepped forward interposing himself between them before antenoch had a chance to take umbrage these cattle were either taken or purchased from the crofters to feed a barbarian warband either way were denying food to the enemy he turned away accepting a torch from one of the soldiers sadly staring at the scene pour on the pitch a dozen men hefted heavy jars pulling their stoppers and pouring the sticky viscous pitch half liquid half solid over the dead animals then repeated the act with fresh jars until the pungent aroma spread across the field more men stepped up with further jars pouring until the fumes made marcuss eyes sting and water dubnus stepped up to the nearest corpse muttering a swift prayer under his breath as he lowered his torch to the dead animals sticky fur the pitch smoked for a long moment before catching fire the flames slowly spreading across the pile of dead animals the flames sent a pungent scent of roasting hair to assault their nostrils the ths soldiers standing in reverential silence at the destruction of such great wealth smoke from the burning beasts created an artificial fog to replace that burnt away by the heat making the men cough and cover their faces with their sweat rags the century watched the growing blaze for a few moments more every man taking a drink of beer from jars found in the farmhouse as reward for their efforts with a primlooking cyclops posted to ensure that nobody drank more than would be prudent so far into unfriendly country once everyone had taken their share and several had been turned away with bristling indignation by the beers custodian marcus shook himself from his tired reverie time we werent here century form ranks for the march men ran to assume formation transforming chaos into ordered ranks with a practised ease half a dozen men holding the halters of ponies taken from the farms enclosure marcus turned to the woman his smile tight lipped with fatigue and residual anger at her outburst well maam would you care to ride or walk she glared at him then stalked away and mounted one of the ponies ninth century at the quick march march they moved quickly down to the farm the flour intended for loaves to feed the oncoming warband had been stacked in the farms main room and doused with more jars of the aromatic amber pine pitch ready for burning dubnus tossed a torch in through the door with a sad smile then led them back up the hill on the far side in grim silence at the crest he halted them temporarily turning them to look back into the valley as the first rays of the rising sun lit the hilltops around them the reek from the burning oxen and the newly fired farmhouse was rising in a thick dark column that would be visible for twenty miles if there were a warband heading for the farm its leader would shortly be doubling his efforts to reach the scene and probably throwing whatever he had by way of mounted scouts forward at their best speed to investigate the reason for the fire marcus turned to face his men ninth century this is a major victory theres almost certainly a large enemy warband within a day or twos march of this place probably marching in the expectation of replenishing their supplies in preparation for an attack on the wall perhaps even on the hill what they will find thanks to us is their meat destroyed the pitch for their torches burned and their flour gone up in flames with it unless they have an alternative source of supply their leader will be forced to fall back on more friendly territory in search of food now he paused for effect aware that every eye was locked on him their sensitivities about the destruction of so many fine oxen forgotten the responsibility of bringing the century back to its parent unit intact weighed him down for a moment now we have to think of ourselves there might well be scouts heading for the farm even as we speak quite possibly in numbers that would overwhelm us on open ground my intention is that we should make a forced march for the wall and get it between us and any potential threat he grinned at them wolfishly nows the time that we get some return on all that training well eat breakfast once were back on the civilised side of the wall we move in two minutes so make fast and get ready to run the soldiers set to work tightening fastenings and making sure that their boots were secure once the century was on the move any man who dropped an item or whose footwear loosened would be forced to drop out then run twice as hard to catch up again he pulled dubnus to one side speaking quietly in his ear we need to know what happens here in the next couple of hours choose a good distance runner share his kit out and have him find a sheltered spot to watch the fire he waits until midmorning then pulls out and follows us back to the wall the chosen nodded silently walking away into the centurys activity the morning air was a cool relief as the th jogged towards the wall it was too early for the sun to be uncomfortable looking back even ten miles from the farm marcus was amazed at the size of the pillar of smoke that rose into the heavens shearing suddenly to the west where it met a high air current thousands of feet above the ground he smiled wryly at the probable effect of the sign on his own side of the wall and what it might be mistaken for at least he could expect to meet friendly faces once the th had crossed the border scout units would in all likelihood be racing for the spot from both east and west they reached their original crossing point at midmorning and set up a temporary camp on the southern side of the wall marcus gave the command for field rations to be opened and luxuriated in dried meat and the last of the previous days bread issue with a little pickle from a jar that antenoch had slipped into his pack climbing the rampart to survey the ground to their north he saw that the pillar of smoke was lightening the fire presumably having consumed the farm buildings its top stretched a dirty stain in the clear blue sky for a dozen miles or so to the west slowly dispersing in the gentle winds the ground in front of the wall climbed gently for a few hundred years before falling away towards a distant line of trees from the ground on that slope he mused it would be impossible to see the wall he made his way back to the ground and walked over to where the woman was taking a solitary breakfast still guarded by the same soldiers who had shared her vigil over the dying man at dawn dismissing the men marcus squatted on to his haunches when she showed no sign of standing to meet him her face seen for the first time in the daylight bore the marks of a heavy beating within the past week bruises past their first lividity still evident as shadows on her cheekbones and jawline maam weve had no formal introduction she looked up at him with a quizzical gaze then offered her hand he noticed the wedding ring your husband must be worried i doubt that very much hes the reason im here he caught the tone in her voice and skirted away from the subject marcus valerius aquila at your service although that isnt a name ive spoken to anybody else these last three months she smiled for the first time perhaps at his formality when i left rome the valerius aquila brothers were among the most respected senators in the city my father spoke of them frequently what relation are you to them his eyes must have clouded since she reached out a hand to touch his arm with an unnerving concern im sorry he smiled at her feeling another layer of his mental scar tissue fall away thats all right its just that youre the first roman to ask me that question i always wondered what id do when the time came lie and protect myself or tell the truth and honour the dead he took a deep breath grateful that she waited patiently for him to gather himself my father was senator appius valerius aquila he fell victim to a palace intrigue led by the praetorian prefect and from what ive been told my entire family was murdered to prevent any danger of attempts at vengeance i was a praetorian centurion her eyes widened momentarily as the irony dawned on her then softened with sympathy my father managed to bribe a tribune to send me away on a false imperial errand to this country he told me that i was carrying a message for the legatus in yew grove but it was really a last message from my father im sorry thank you i escaped two attempts to finish the job by killing me thanks to the efforts of two men i count my as closest friends and now i fight under the name marcus tribulus corvus only five other men know of this deception and so now lady you hold the power of life and death over me a simple denunciation will be enough to have me imprisoned and executed within days wont you return the compliment by telling me your name she smiled briefly her face lighting up with the expression with honour centurion i am felicia clodia drusilla daughter of octavius clodius drusus and wife of quintus dexter bassus the prefect commanding the second tungrian cohort at vindolanda a name with which i would far rather not have fouled my mouth she glowered at the ground for a moment forgive me centurion an unhappy marriage is neither your business nor your concern except perhaps when it results in the abduction and mistreatment of a roman citizen she laughed again a strange reaction in someone who had endured the torments attributed to her captivity by their first informant i wasnt mistreated in any particular way and these bruises predate my time in captivity i probably would have been raped senseless if the warband had arrived before your rescue but those people were more embarrassed than excited by my presence i ran away from my husbands fort when his cruelty and violence towards me became too much to bear i persuaded my serving maid to disguise me as one of her own once we were out of sight of the fort we slipped through one of the mile fort gates a week ago and were caught by the master of that farm a day later heading for my maids home village he locked me up probably wanted to force himself on me but his wife was too fiercely opposed said it would bring the legions down on them i think she took pity on the state of my face she might well have been jealous too she smiled again ruefully this time thank you for your gallantry they still hadnt decided what to do with me when you arrived what made you come we captured the husband spying on our fort at the hill one of his men told us that hed already he paused embarrassed at the words implication touched by his embarrassment she put her hand on his arm id guess he boasted in public to maintain his reputation i a shout from the walls top grabbed marcuss attention dubnus beat him to the ladder the pair of them bundling breathlessly on to the flat surface atop the mile forts structure in the middle distance half a mile or so from their gate a single man was running across the windblown grass thats our scout dubnus nodded grimly yes and hes running too fast for my liking he turned back to look down at the resting soldiers ninth century stand to fighting order even as he spoke a dozen horsemen broke from the cover of the trees to the north another mile or so behind the running figure dubnus hurled himself down the ladder while marcus scanned the distant trees for any more movement he turned to look down at the century each man holding his shield and javelins at the parade rest their faces filthy from the nights impromptu camouflage of dirt their armour and bodies covered with dried blood get them moving first his instincts told him and then explain the dangers first tent party open the gate marcus slid down the ladder drawing his sword which flashed in the sunlight follow me he ran through the open gate turning to watch his men charge through the opening four abreast jogging backwards and watching their faces he saw fear and determination written in equal proportions he gestured with the sword catching their attention with its flashing arc ninth century we have a comrade in danger there may be more cavalry lurking in ambush waiting until were clear of the wall if there are we might all die seeking to rescue one man but think how he feels seeing us coming out to him were going out to him were going to bring him back with us or theyll have to cut every one of us down to take any one of us more than a few faces stared at him in disbelief though their legs kept them moving away from the walls shelter he sensed the situation slipping away from him and felt the first touch of panic grip his mind suddenly he had no words to reassure or embolden them he turned his back on them mutely waving the sword forward in another flashing arc that pointed to the enemy cavalry galloping across the grass from the centurys rear another voice sounded deep and harsh booming across the open space ninth century at the run run where the appeal to reason had faltered the whiplash of command took the soldiers and threw them forward into a headlong run without any conscious thought process the century put its collective head back and ran the ranks opening out slightly as men opened their legs for the task marcus looked gratefully back at dubnus but the big chosen simply waved him forward to do his job and in that second he understood and embraced what he had to do if they were to succeed the adrenalin kick giving his words an unaccustomed savagery run you bastards no fucking horse boy beats me to one of my own grabbing a deep breath he ran to catch the front rank then matched strides with them and started to accelerate pulling them out across the murderously empty ground in a race with the barbarian cavalry they crested the gentle ridge and ran down the slope on its far side to reach the exhausted scout with seconds to spare bundling him into the hollow square that marcus had shouted for as he fell into their arms the small cavalry band shaggyhaired men on hardy ponies with long spears and round wooden shields simply parted to either side of the square and rode around them clearly not willing to tackle so many infantrymen readied in defensive formation the th jeered and waved their spears shouting abuse at the circling horsemen venting their relief at the standoff as he stood in their midst watching the native cavalry circle impotently marcus felt a pull at his shoulder oh brigantia gods help us marcus looked at the point to which antenoch pointed his face suddenly pale with the sickening realisation that there was in reality no need for the relatively few horsemen riding round their square to take them on a hundred and more mounted barbarians were breaking from the trees in a dark wave marcus stared across the halfmile that separated the th from the forests dark bulk watching the enemy irregular cavalry trot briskly from their hiding places under the trees canopy forming a rough line the horsemen accelerated to a canter starting up the gentle slope towards the centurys fragile square he looked about him at his men their attention focused on the oncoming cavalry their faces fixed in disbelief at the cruel twist in their fortunes even dubnus seemed diminished leaning on his pole as if suddenly tired and for a second the hope went out of the young officer he stared beyond his men at the smaller group of horsemen that had drawn away to wait a short distance upslope of their position just short of the slopes crest close enough for them to see their mocking grins then with an intensity that shocked him as much as the men he commanded his temper ignited firing a burning fury into his voice ninth century spear drill a few men turned to look at him their faces numb with the shock of their ambush by the horsemen stoking the fire of his fury ninth century spear drill prepare to assault the horsemen to our rear dubnus came to life with a start slapping the man next to him across the back you heard the fucking officer spear drill the century seemed to shiver for a moment as if a powerful wind was blowing through the thin ranks then snapped to attention dubnuss voice boomed again stirring them with a fresh purpose on the command form line form a double line facing the front ready form line the th moved quickly months of drill practice taking over and dropping them into position without conscious thought within twenty seconds they were drawn up in line facing the stilldistant oncoming horsemen their spears held ready to throw marcus looked behind him seeing that the smaller group of cavalry was still in place on the slope to their rear watching curiously as their enemies apparently abandoned the small degree of safety given by their shields but still not bothering to do any more than sit and watch as the last men moved into their places marcus drew his sword turned and pointed it up the slope about face charge the tribesmens ponies reared in surprise as the line ran towards them every man bellowing at the top of his voice the more skilled horsemen among the britons managed to wrestle their mounts out of place and ride away up the slope but the majority were too slow struggling to control their beasts as the soldiers battle cry died away marcus shouted the last command necessary to launch his attack throw the line of men threw almost simultaneously exhaling a collective whoosh of breath as their spears flew from straining arms a short vicious arc of wood and metal that slammed a rain of razorsharp steel into the milling horsemen men and horses were impaled by the missiles their screams blending into a cacophony of pain swords the th barely breaking step charged in over the fallen stabbing at men and animals with the carefree ferocity of victory offering no mercy to those unable to run a short frenzied melee ended the fight leaving half a dozen soldiers with assorted flesh wounds while almost a dozen of the dead and dying tribesmen and their mounts were scattered across the tiny battlefield marcus turned back to the larger body of horse their pace accelerating at the sight of their fellows slaughter and now barely four hundred paces distant form square his men nodded grimly at the quiet command retrieving their spears and moving swiftly into their allotted places ready to receive the enemy charge and die as the square formed marcus looked about him again noticing with surprise the few survivors of his mens vicious attack having galloped away over the slopes crest now flying past the century in the direction of their fellow horsemen at a breakneck pace as they passed the oncoming mass of horsemen a couple turned back and pointed back up the slope shouting at their fellows the tribal cavalry faltered seemingly losing purpose for a second and in the moment of their hesitation a sound came to marcuss ears that puzzled him it was a distant rumble as if thunder was grumbling somewhere beyond the clear horizon but apparent as much through his boot soles as his ears the rumble swelled in volume making the soldiers heads turn as they realised that it was coming from behind them from the direction of the wall with a sudden explosion of movement and noise a wall of horsemen came over the crest and charged down the slope parting to either side of the ths tiny square armoured cavalrymen bent over their horses necks and thrust long spears towards the tribesmen who had already turned to ride for their lives fighting horses rooted with fear by the noise of the oncoming wave of heavy cavalry a decurion rose in his saddle lifting his spear and shouting encouragement to his men as they passed the th their shouted response lifting the hairs on marcuss neck with its bloodlust petriana petrianaaa the cavalry swept past the ths square and hammered into the rearmost of the enemy riders while the century stood in amazement watching the tidal wave of horsemen wash across the open space between the crest and the forest a scattered detritus of dead and wounded barbarian riders and horses studded the ground over which they passed the mass of native horsemen became thinner by the second their blown horses easy prey for the stronger and fresher roman mounts spears were thrust into the backs and necks of the fleeing britons making their backs arch at the moment of impact a group of horsemen cantered up to the tiny defensive square pennants below their spear heads fluttering prettily in the strong breeze blowing across the open ground a long dragon standard twisting and flapping in windblown serpentine twists rode proudly above the formation which opened to allow a magnificent grey stallion to approach the th like those of its fellows the beasts eyes and long face were protected by a decorated armoured plate that curved around the snout vision enabled by a delicate pattern of holes drilled into the halfglobe bulges over each eye its rider searched the ranks agewrinkled eyes peering from beneath the peak of a heavily decorated helmet while the riders of his bodyguard rode out to either side watching their surroundings with professional wariness marcus stepped out from the ths ranks snapping a salute at the prefect while he admired the mans heavily muscled bronze cuirass secured by the customary linen band the senior officer jumped down from his horse passing the reins to an attending trooper before returning the salute he stared at marcus with unveiled curiosity turning to survey the slaughter without any change of expression speaking without returning his eyes to the young officer his voice a patrician rasp ywere lucky that we happened along young centurion or your head would be decorating some hairy fellows spear point by now im licinius prefect commanding the petriana cavalry wing your unit marcus stiffened to attention and saluted ninth century first tungrian cohort prefect the other man turned back to look at him again one eyebrow slightly raised marcus met his stare directly noting the experience lines that ran down from either side of his nose and his furrowed forehead the older man was he calculated soldier through and through an experienced prefect with two or three previous postings behind him before being favoured with such a prestigious cavalry command tungrian eh ydont sound tungrian ysound roman youngster look it too so how does the ninth century of the first tungrians come to be all on its own on the wrong side of the wall getting ready to die on the spears of several times its strength of enemy horse eh marcus told him the story of the last two days in quick economical sentences that reduced their achievements to their bare bones while the prefect watched dispassionately as his men dismounted to finish off the wounded and take souvenirs he reached the slaughter of the oxen before the other man interrupted wait a moment decurion an officer detached himself from the waiting troop of horsemen trotting across to his commander and saluting precisely sir dispatch a message rider to cauldron pool message to read the troop commander fished out his writing tablet the stylus poised over its wax from petriana wing rescued first tungrian ninth under barbarian horse attack to north of wall at mile fort twentyseven debriefed centurion fiftyplus oxen found ten miles to northeast of the hill cattle slaughtered and burned to deny enemy supply number of oxen and enemy horse suggest enemy warband ten to fifteen thousand strong in vicinity now likely to be falling back for alternative supply attack on wall in this sector temporarily unlikely forward to commander sixth legion immediately ends give the rider a twentyman escort go the officer turned away to his task carry on centurion marcus completed the story explaining their return to the barbarian side of the wall in defence of their comrade the prefect pulled his helmet off and tossed it to a trooper running a hand through his thick head of hair streaks of grey ran through the black after a moment of thought he turned back to marcus and his waiting soldiers nodding with pursed lips well centurion either fortuna herself smiles down on you or youre an exceptionally competent officer either way you have a century to be proud of not many infantrymen of my experience would have taken the risk your men did in seeking to safeguard your friend i salute you all and to marcuss amazement he did just that clapping him on the shoulder in congratulation i would regard it as a privilege to escort you and your men to cauldron pool and to take a cup of wine with you once youve had time to get your unit settled trumpeter sound the recall those layabouts have had long enough to take every blasted head on the battlefield now young man im intrigued by your accent tell me more about yourself marcus caught in the full glare of the mans piercing intellect and unprepared for another explanation as to his origins thought frantically antenoch stepped forward neatly saluting with a gusto that raised eyebrows throughout the th prefect sir excuse me but our centurion has omitted to inform you that there is a young roman lady waiting for us at the wall gate your eminence might want to detail an escort to her to ensure her personal safety in these rough circumstances the prefect nodded sagely a faint smile creasing his lips quite so soldier and right of you to point out the fact let us get back on the road to the east centurion and perhaps you and i can talk further in the more relaxed atmosphere of cauldron pool he remounted pulled his helmet back on and rode away spurring the magnificent grey into a canter back towards the wall his bodyguard wheeling their horses to follow by late afternoon legatus sollemnis was forced to admit to himself that he felt more relaxed with the circumstances of his command than at any time in the past week he relaxed in his chair while the th legions staff officers briefed him on the current situation and felt for the first time in several days as if a measure of control over the whole awful mess had come his way the sounds of treefelling came distantly into the command tent as his engineers laboured to perfect the field defences that would protect their flanks and rear and reduce any frontal attack to a vulnerable crawl with these defences and the legion artillery commanding murderous firing arcs his six thousand men could hold such a wellfounded position at the forests edge against thee times their number at length titus tigidius perennis took centre stage as the legions senior tribune moving to the map and pointing to their position astride the road to yew grove ten miles south of the wall then to the auxiliary battle groups location at cauldron pool so legatus in summary we face a loose enemy formation of about fifteen thousand men our current dispositions limit the enemy warband from doing very much other than burning a few garrison forts if calgus attacks south to attempt a breakthrough towards yew grove we can provide the defensive anvil while prefect licinius and his auxiliary cohorts plus the petriana and augustan cavalry wings swing the hammer into their rear on the other hand if he tries a push to the west the auxiliaries can hold him if they choose the right ground and we can break from our defensive position and do the hammering either way if he moves to attack either force well have him straddled like a robbers counter ripe for a battle of annihilation our good fortune in the discovery and destruction of the supplies for their presumed western force and the petrianas annihilation of their cavalry has made prefect liciniuss rear safe for the time being the only question now is how we should capitalise on this development sollemnis nodded staring intently at the map in front of him yes we seem to have calgus in a trap of his failed strategy without his western force hes unable to remove liciniuss threat to his flank and effectively unable to move either west or south without dire risk and to attack to the east would be both largely pointless and risk hemming himself in between wall and sea i think we have him gentlemen or at least weve balanced the situation enough to have stopped his rampage for the time being my opinion is that we keep sufficient measure of the initiative just by digging in where we are and so forcing calgus to decide what to do next if he attacks he puts himself at risk of being assaulted from two sides if he waits he plays into our hands by bringing the second and twentieth legions into play any other opinions his first spear spoke up i agree legatus we must stay defensive until the other legions arrive fighting from behind our temporary defences with our artillery positioned to support the line we can hold his barbarians off for long enough to let the auxiliaries strike to flank and rear moving forward would be suicide with only our six thousand spears perennis nodded his support i agree with the first spear with one small addition when calgus moves back to the north as he is bound to do given his position we should follow up smartly and get north of the wall i have a perfect location for a forward camp in mind once were free to advance sollemnis stood with the decision clear very well we hold what we have for now and push the decision on to calgus lets see what he does with several barbarian tribes baying for our heads but no safe way to give them what they crave the road to the fort at cauldron pool was uneventful enough a gentle stroll by the standard of their regular exertions but the spectacle of the cavalrymen riding easily to either side heads dangling from saddle horns and spears eventually started to rankle morban rattled his standard at the th century leading them off in a spirited rendition of a favourite marching song oh the cavalry dont use latrines they piss in their leather britches they drag their arse in the tickly grass those dirty sons of bitches marcus gave the decurion riding alongside him a wry smile as the song progressed into a description of the sexual habits of the cavalry guessing that hed probably heard it a few times before after a while as clouds rolled over the landscape and threatened rain they concentrated on covering ground eager to rejoin the cohort at cauldron pool and get the chance to eat hot food when darkness fell finding them still a good five miles from their destination the horsemen lit torches and illuminated their way triumphantly escorting them to the walls of the fort where the first spear was waiting for them in front of twenty men with torches he stepped forward gesturing them to follow him into the temporary defences of a sixfoothigh turf wall within which burned the watch fires of dozens of centuries the th marched into the tungrian section of the camp with their heads held high to be greeted by a respectful silence from their peers as they paraded marcus stepped out in front of the century turned on the spot and saluted the waiting chief centurion who returned the salute with a grim face first spear ninth century reporting back from detached duty sextus frontinius stared back at him still deadpan before speaking ninth century if the reports we have received of your activities are correct you have reflected much pride on the cohort for now you will be tired and in need of a wash food and rest your colleagues will show you where your tents have been erected and will have washing water and hot food ready for you morning parade is cancelled for the ninth century you will parade at midday before lunch without your current coating of blood and soil that is dismissed he turned to marcus putting a hand on his arm not you centurion you come with me he took marcus through the darkened camp threading between the leather tents until they reached the headquarters tent three times the size of those designed to house a tenman tent party inside dimly lit by the guttering flames of oil lamps a large wooden table dominated the space scrolls neatly stacked across its width indicating that it would be a hive of administrative activity during daylight hours in one corner a hanging screen rendered the prefects quarters private a pair of fully armed soldiers from the th century providing immediate protection for their commanding officer frontinius coughed discreetly the slight noise summoning his superior from behind the screen equitius nodded to them both indicating the seats that clustered around a low table in another corner of the tent centurion news of your exploits travels before you if i am to believe the dispatch relayed to me by the local prefect your century in the course of a simple search mission found and destroyed not only a barbarian scouting party but fifty head of cattle that had apparently been gathered to feed an enemy warband is this correct marcus nodded dropping wearily into the proffered chair yes sir frontinius remained silent while the prefect pulled at his beard in a distracted manner i was afraid of that you present us young man with something of a quandary on one hand you are still had you forgotten a wanted man with a hefty price on your head on the other you are the hero of the hour responsible for turning back an enemy warband which might well have been ten or fifteen thousand strong for the loss of two men prefect licinius is singing your praises to anybody that will listen and has already sent me a formal request for an interview with you probably wants to offer you a position with the petriana something better fitted to the wellbred young man you so obviously are and theres the main problem once the euphoria wears off itll take him about five minutes to start asking all sorts of difficult questions and it doesnt take a topclass mind to see where thatll end up if however i refuse him permission to speak to you his questions will be addressed to a wider and infinitely more dangerous audience i am still undecided as to my best course of action marcus nodded prefect ive given it much thought in the last few hours perhaps i have a solution for tomorrow at least he spoke for a moment gauging the other mans reaction equitius mulled over his idea briefly nodding his assent from first light mind you lets not risk prefect licinius being an early riser very well dismissed marcus and frontinius stood to leave equitius turned away and then back again as a thought occurred to him oh and centurion prefect excellent work sleep well outside the tent frontinius put a hand on marcuss shoulder to detain him his eyes glinted in the torchlight his face expressionless in the heavy shadows you took your whole century back over the wall to save the life of a single soldier marcus nodded soberly yes in retrospect it seems a little far fetched but yes first spear i did he waited for the storm to his amazement the older man looked at him strangely for a moment nodding slowly in the best traditions of the tungrians whether you knew it or not very well done centurion very well done indeed marcus frowned but what if id lost the whole century trying to save one man ive thought of little else since it happened frontinius looked at him in the torchlight shaking his head there are two types of successful officer those that do the right thing and those that are born with cocidiuss favour the latter can take audacious risks and get far better odds than just following the field manual youre lucky centurion keep it that way antenoch woke marcus before dawn shaking insistently at his shoulder until the centurion stirred swinging his feet from the camp bed and on to the floor dawn centurion and time you were dressed for the day here drink this a beaker of warm honey diluted by a substantial quantity of wine opened marcuss eyes well enough the tents interior lit by a single lamp was dark and oppressive while a steady drumming on the tents oiled leather roof puzzled his senses for a moment pissing down a great day for serving out your penalty the night watch took great delight in pointing out that itll probably rain until midday at this rate when they woke me up fucking nd century marcus groaned softly struggling to his feet a swift wash in the bowl of water antenoch had brought in with him enlivened his senses while the rest of the honey drink warmed his stomach sufficiently to make the task of getting into uniform a welcome distraction from dwelling on the conditions outside antenoch helped him into his cloak and then went to look out of the tent flap while marcus took a final deep breath resigned to being soaked to the skin within ten minutes of stepping out into the downpour your escorts here puzzled he went to look through the flap outside grinning happily through the rainswept grey morning were four of the ths soldiers wrapped in their own cloaks each man holding a wooden pole attached to some kind of hastily improvised wooden framework across which was strung what looked suspiciously like the remains of a tenman tent the scout they had rescued the previous day was closest to the tent door solemnly gesturing him under the shelter of their portable roof antenoch shook his head in amused wonder stupid bastards spent half the night putting the bloody thing together i told them that standing about in the rain all day might make you think twice about taking on five times our number of enemy horse next time the chance presents itself but they insisted marcus walked out under the sheltering leather shaking his head with speechless wonder cyclops the oneeyed miscreant freed one hand to salute where to sir stirring himself marcus found his voice to the headquarters tent gentlemen i really dont another of the soldiers a gauntfaced man with a heavy facial scar down one cheek spoke up gruffly holding up his right hand to contain marcuss protest the entire century wanted this sir so dont be worrying about us therell be another four men along in a while sos we can go and have a warm now lads on the command march to the head shed march they paraded through the camps empty streets drawing amazed stares from the guards mounted at each centurys section of the camp men huddled together against the rain peering incredulously in the growing light until they reached the headquarters tent frontinius peered through the tent door stepping out into the rain with his eyes wide the four soldiers stared resolutely at the lightening sky while marcus squirmed uneasily at the prospect of his superiors opinion having walked around the contraption once in complete silence his immaculate boots beading with rain drops the first spear turned to address a nervous marcus i have to say that for the first time in twentytwo years of service i am quite genuinely amazed you scarface whats the meaning of this the ninth century cares for its own sir we wont be letting our young gentleman catch his death of cold and he shut up his face red with the pressure of having answered the cohorts senior soldier back i see centurion and men waited with bated breath for the law to be stated nothing in the manual specifically states that an officer on administrative punishment cant be sheltered from heavy rain by four soldiers with a tent lashed to a wooden frame even if at least one of the soldiers concerned is famous throughout his cohort for holding the opinion that most officers arent fit to scrape out the latrines after him scarface went an even deeper shade of red so is there room for another under there marcus gestured to the space next to him ignoring the indignant eyes of the roofbearers frontinius stepped in from the rain taking his helmet off and shaking the drops from its bedraggled crest he regarded marcus with a sideways glance sweeping a hand across his pale scalp to catch the odd raindrops gleaming there and now centurion two knives since you have me as a captive audience you may tell me all about your exploits of yesterday when prefect licinius appeared after breakfast he too came up short at the sight of the rain cover what put the honey in that particular cake morban later confided to dubnus was the fact that custody of the four poles was in the process of being transferred from one fourman group to another the cavalryman had watched speechless while the eight men transferred the cover from one group to another with the precision of a legion parading its eagle when the handover was finished and the outgoing men had completed the effect by marching smartly around the corner of the headquarters tent before collapsing in stifled laughter the prefect approached taking in the silent centurion and his first spear the latter was happily chatting away about the fighting habits of their enemy and affecting not to have noticed the senior officer whereas the warband you see is usually a oneshot weapon the tribal leader points them in the right direction whips them up into a frenzy and then lets them run wild which can be a problem if they need to be turned around for any reason since you cant just he snapped to attention shouting to marcus and the roofbearers to follow his example licinius having thus been formally recognised strolled forward nodding to frontinius and staring with visible envy at the mobile roof while rain beat at his oiled leather cape at ease first spear frontinius relaxed throwing the tribune an impeccable salute prefect licinius sir welcome to the first tungrian camp the prefect returned the salute with casual ease stepping close enough to gain some shelter from the incessant rain first spear frontinius might one ask the purpose of this he waved an arm vaguely at the scene raising an eyebrow at the soberfaced frontinius prefect this centurion is under administrative punishment one days parade in full uniform and withdrawal of speech for exceeding the remit of written orders specified by prefect equitius in that he took his century over the wall to rescue one of his men and ended up having to be rescued by you and the prefect himself out with four centuries sir patrolling down towards the north road and this he gestured again at the rain cover its roof sagging slightly with the weight of water soaked into the oiled leather simple sir it would appear that this young officer has instilled sufficient pride in his men that they regard the punishment of one as a collective duty the other man smiled gently recognising the deflection of any comment he might have regarding the shelters legal irregularity i see very well first spear please inform the centurion that im sorry to have missed the chance to meet him properly the petriana is ordered to conduct a reconnaissance in force to the west to discover the exact dispositions of our bluenosed friends doubtless well get another chance though quite amazing he turned and walked away shaking his head in disbelief frontinius waited until he was out of sight stepping out from beneath the rain cover and eyeing the steadily lightening clouds with a critical gaze itll have stopped within the hour very well centurion two knives i hereby commute your punishment to confinement to your tent until dusk get some sleep your century has the night guard doubtless the prince will be keen to introduce you to the art of aggressive night patrolling marcus slept soundly despite the noise of the camp until antenoch shook him awake again at sunset he wolfed down a plate of cold meat and bread and went in search of his chosen man closely followed by his clerk dubnus was detailing the guard roster for the night counting the century off into tent parties and giving each one a part of the tungrians area of the camp to patrol when he was finished one last eightman group of soldiers remained in front of the headquarters tent a collection of older men more than one bearing the scars of previous skirmishes he spoke quietly into marcuss ear these are the best men for a night patrol steadier than some of the others well go over the wall up into the trees on the high ground then wait and listen this is a good camp but weve used it many times before so it ought to be known to the enemy the tribes will have scouts out and will try to infiltrate men in to watch the camp perhaps even snatch a sentry or an officer from his tent we hear them we stalk them and we kill them simple youll learn some new skills tonight morban can stand in as watch officer while were out in the forest he passed marcus a thick wooden stave and a length of black cloth your cloak will hide you in the forest and keep you warm wrap the cloth around your head until your helmets full itll keep your head warm and offer some protection if you get hit on the head the clubs a lot better for fighting in the dark than a sword but the other side will be using clubs of their own turning to antenoch standing to one side with a large and distinctly nonregulation sword strapped across his back he waved a hand dismissively we wont need you tonight stay here and guard your tent antenoch turned away impassively and disappeared into the surrounding shadows i still dont trust him better if we leave him behind and avoid the risk of a knife in the back he led the party through the gap in the earth wall and up a shallow slope towards the dark treeline at a slow trot as they reached the trees the patrol flattened themselves against the cold earth waiting in silence for dubnus to decide whether it was safe to move marcus stared out into the maze of tree trunks his night vision slowly improving as his eyes became accustomed to the darkness dubnus muttered into his ear look to one side of what you want to see seeing in the darkness is better from the corner of the eye than the centre it was true he looked into the forest seeing the tree branches sway gently as a breeze lifted their leaves and heard the distant hoot of a hunting owl below them huddled into the river bend the camp squatted in its solid bulk studded with the pinprick light of torches at each guard position behind it loomed cauldron pools fort its whitewashed walls standing out in the gloom to his now completely nightadjusted eyes at length dubnus nodded to the patrol splaying three fingers forward two groups of three men moved silently into the trees heading to left and right while dubnus led marcus and the remaining soldier forward to their own listening position a hundred yards inside the forest wall they padded slowly and quietly through the tree trunks fallen twigs crackling minutely under their boots marcus copied dubnuss exaggerated steps and slow cautious footfall each foot searching for larger twigs as it sank to meet the ground avoiding making any loud noises at length they settled into their listening post for the night a space between two fallen trees that dubnus had clearly used before from the ease with which he found the sheltered spot marcus and the other soldier huddled into their cloaks at dubnuss whispered suggestion leaving him to stare out into the silent darkness down in the camp with the troops asleep for the night and night patrols padding morosely around the perimeter fence annius slipped quietly through the ranks of tents through the doglegged gap in the sixfoottall earth rampart and up to the stonebuilt forts walls a pair of soldiers stepped forward with their spears levelled letting him past and into the fort once it was established that he was on official business since the fort was more or less a duplicate of the hill he found his way to the supply building quickly enough and knocked quietly on the door slipping quickly inside as soon as it opened the storeman closed the door behind him sliding a pair of massive iron bolts into their sockets turned and silently beckoned annius to follow him at the rear of the storeroom he opened another smaller door gesturing the quartermaster through in front of him a small personal room lay beyond well lit by oil lamps the walls insulated against the cold air outside by hanging carpets while a flask of wine and a tray of small honey cakes decorated a delicately carved wooden table a man lounged on a couch by the rooms far wall nodding graciously to annius and indicating the couchs companion on the other side of the small table the quartermaster arranged himself on the couch in a dignified silence waiting for his host to speak first with this as with any other negotiation every tiny advantage was to be sought the other man waited another moment before stirring himself to lean on an elbow baring his teeth in a cockeyed smile below calculating eyes so friend and colleague annius when your mob marched in yesterday i wondered how long it would be before you and i were doing business are you buying or selling annius pursed his lips forcing his face to stay neutral a little of both my trusted friend tacitus excellent heres to a mutually profitable exchange they drank both sipping politely at the wine rather than risk its effects on their skills tacitus gestured to the cakes and took one himself in the ageold gesture of trustworthiness annius nibbled at another these are good my own baker in the vicus youll take a dozen as my gift im grateful and down a bargaining point already he fished in the folds of his cloak passing the other man a small wooden box saffron the best persian i remembered your affection for the spice perhaps your baker can use it to good effect and up two the spice had cost him a small fortune but put tacitus in his debt by the rules of the game they routinely played well if you have more of this to sell our bargaining will be a memorable event unfortunately not the case that was the last of the travellers supply a shame so tell me brother what is it you bring to the table little enough we marched too quickly for detailed preparation five jars of iberian wine a small quantity of a precious ointment from judaea and money money indeed you must be keen and what is it that you seek damn him for a cool bastard information tacitus i have a small local difficulty to manage and remembering how good your sources have been in the past tacitus adjusted his position rising up on one elbow ah problems with your first spear i wondered how long hed tolerate your ways of making money i no it isnt frontinius he keeps me on my mettle makes sure that his men have effective equipment but he tolerates my provision of the better things in life as a necessary evil and makes sure that my business pays a healthy percentage to the burial club no the problems a step lower down the ladder than frontinius tacituss eyes narrowed with the admission a centurion tell me more marcus woke again when dubnus shook his shoulder nodding silently at the big mans silent instruction to watch the arc to their front the chosen man rolled into his cloak and was still leaving marcus alone in the darkness he watched the silent forest with slow head movements remembering the instruction to use the corner of his vision rather than looking directly at the subject after a few moments purple spots started to dance in his vision making him close his eyes for a moment before starting the process again after an hour or so a faint sound caught his attention a tiny click out in the trees but sufficient to snap his senses alert a moment later there was another louder and then again the almost imperceptible but unmistakable sounds of men moving across the forest floor he reached out with a foot and nudged dubnus awake keeping his attention focused on the scene to his front the chosen man rose silently moving his head alongside that of his centurion breaking twigs he pointed in the appropriate direction to back up his whispered warning then kept silent dubnus listened for a moment and nodded bending close to marcuss ear theyre here perhaps too many for us well sound the alarm and get back into camp the others will do the same marcus nodded shaking the sleeping soldier awake and whispering in his ear to be ready to run while dubnus prepared to put the signal horn to his lips ready to blow the note that would alert the camp marcus prepared for the short run back through the surrounding trees he leant his weight on the stub of a branch readying himself to vault the fallen tree that formed the rear of their hide with a rasping cough the stump rotted through beneath the bark tore away from the trunk under his weight the noise echoing out into the forests silence for a moment the silence returned but then with a sudden chorus of shouts and yells came the sound of men running across the forest floor towards them with a curse dubnus put the horn to his lips and blew one high note that drowned out all other sound tossing the horn away and hefting his club shouting into the darkness ninth to me their chance to run was gone the enemy alerted by the snapping wood charging in at them too quickly for flight to be a realistic option marcus readied himself stepping alongside dubnus and bracing himself for the enemys assault with his stave held ready to strike a body hurled itself out of the darkness and was met by a vicious swing of dubnuss club two more followed both men going down under the defenders blows and then a torrent of tribesmen assaulted the trio splitting them into tiny islands of resistance marcus swung his stave into one attackers belly releasing it as it caught in the reeling mans clothing swept his sword out and stepped forward to strike at another hamstringing the man as he shaped to attack dubnus from behind a massive tribesman stepped into the fight swinging his own club in an expert backhand to deal a fearsome blow to marcuss head he fell vision dimming as consciousness slipped away vaguely aware of a figure standing over him with a sword held high screaming incoherently as the sword poised for its strike frontinius briefed prefect equitius an hour later once the excitement of a full cohort standto was over and the centuries had gone grumbling back to their interrupted sleep hed been on the scene in minutes with the duty century but only in time to greet the ths men as they carried their casualties off the hill it was nothing really just a few barbarian scouts running into our listening patrols it was too dark for much serious fighting and what there was seems to have been scrappy more like a vicus bar brawl than a real fight the turning point appears to have been one of our lads going into a blood rage in the middle of the skirmish and slicing up several of the barbarians after which they seem to have thought better of the whole thing weve got a man dead and two wounded one light sword wound and a nastylooking concussion thats the good news the bad news is that the man with the concussion is our very own roman centurion his helmet stove in by a barbarian with a strong club arm equitius groaned so now hes stuck in the fort hospital for any and all to see frontinius shook his head no i spent a few minutes with the doctor and had him hidden away in a quiet part of the building away from curious eyes ive also told the ninth to keep the news of his injury to themselves the prince can run the century for the next day or two equitius nodded thoughtfully so this might even work to our advantage and keep him out of sight until its time to deploy into the field frontinius snorted a mirthless laugh yes and we get to find out if his skull is thick enough to keep his educated brains in one piece or whether the bluenoses have just solved our problem for us light pricked at marcuss eyes as they struggled to open he could see only a ball of light with a dark figure floating behind it closing his eyes and surrendering to the darkness again and whatever it was that was happening seemed much the easiest thing to do when he woke again the metallic taste in his mouth was gone and the light that greeted his cautious gaze was that of weak daylight a pale shaft through a window in one wall of the room in which he lay still exhausted in a narrow bed underneath heavy blankets he was naked while his head ached awfully a familiar voice called out from close by orderly orderly you dozy bastard fetch the doctor hes awake the owner of the voice came back into the room and fighting his eyes back into focus marcus recognised an exhaustedlooking antenoch lie still the doctors coming he sat down in a chair at marcuss bedside running a hand through his disordered hair we thought for a while you might not live you were out of it for so long only the helmet saved you and you should see the dent in that you wont be he stopped in midsentence as another figure entered the room marcus gingerly turned his head to see the new arrival blinking at the sunlight recognising the doctor with a shock you but youre a a woman evidently your concussion hasnt entirely removed your cognitive powers centurion corvus it was the woman from the farm an image of her fury at the sight of slaughtered cattle flashed into his mind felicia his memory grasped for the name making his brow knot with the effort clodia drusilla felicia clodia drusilla he raised an arm the limb seeming heavy water please antenoch put a cup to his lips the liquid ungluing his mouth and throat thank you madam i am surprised her eyebrow arched in a challenge that marcus knew was completely beyond his faltering capabilities grateful for your care he closed his eyes for a moment feeling his body sag against the bed with exhaustion her voice reached him as if from a distant place and now master antenoch its time for you both to get some proper sleep go back to your unit and sleep for at least ten hours here ill make it a formal written command there to sleep for ten hours without interruption give that tablet to your chosen man and tell him that the centurion will be ready to receive visitors tomorrow afternoon at the very earliest calgus stood astride the wall with his adviser aed as the sun set that evening watching his warriors pouring back to the north through the north roads smashed gates they were moving in good order for the most part one or two supporting comrades clearly the worse for drink but if individuals had overindulged in captured wine it was of little concern to him behind them the fortress of the rock was still smearing the sky with the grey reek of its smouldering timbers while torches were being lit by his marching troops to provide illumination for the night movement all things considered he mused he had enough reason to be satisfied as his first attack played to its close at length his adviser aed spoke his opinions delivered with the customary candour that calgus valued where most others would tell him simply what he wanted to hear so my king their wall is broken the garrison troops huddle anxiously around their forts to east and west and their sixth legion seems content simply to prevent our advance on yew grove some of our people see this as victory enough while others argue for striking west or south and destroying the roman forces before they can join we must explain our next moves soon before the tribes fall to arguing among themselves a lack of roman shields to batter will have our peoples at each others throats before long calgus spat on to the walls flat surface his face twisting into a sneer i will gut the first men who take swords to their brothers myself you can let that be known as for the romans ive told the tribal leaders that our cleverest move is the one were making now to pull back from the wall and let them follow into the uncertain lands to the north if they dare the right move is to pull back and invite them onwards on to our ground of course it would have been different if our western warband had not failed to break the wall to the west behind the traitor cohorts if we could have put the soldiers waiting to the west between two forests of spears and with no place left to run that would have been a blade to their guts i would have twisted without hesitation aed nodded his face impassive i understand my lord yet i must tell you that at this moment our only real fear is the warband itself or more particularly its urgent desire for battle real battle the tribes grumble that their war so far has been one of chasing after fleeing romans and burning empty forts lord calgus the northern tribes are clamouring for a proper fight a fight we currently deny them calgus nodded at the advice after the council of the tribes the previous evening he was already aware of the problem he had called the gathering of tribal leaders knowing that he would at the least have to listen to their arguments for their warriors to run amok down the line of forts that garrisoned the wall these were arguments made stronger by the speed with which the defenders had evacuated their forts rather than fight for their homes put simply the defenders seemed ripe for taking ready to fall under the tribes attacks hed listened patiently until their arguments dried up in the face of his silent contemplation when silence had fallen and all men in the gathering hed called were waiting for him to say something hed voiced his opinion what you propose is exactly what the legatus commanding that legion down the road to yew grove wants for us to waste our time and strength destroying empty forts they will simply retreat in front of us leaving us to spend our energy on pointless destruction or worse they will attempt to pin us between their two forces im not entirely sure our warriors would stand their ground if that happened one of the tribal leaders had stalked forward to stand in front of him a dead romans head held casually by the hair in one hand a roman infantry sword in the other he turned to the assembled chiefs holding both in the air above his head i say we fight my people have tasted roman blood taken heads taken weapons to retreat now will bring shame upon us in the eyes of brigantia who knows whether she will look with anger upon a retreat in the time of victory and punish us for avoiding battle the gathering held its collective breath waiting for calgus to pounce from his chair perhaps even draw the sword that hung from his waist and take the other man apart with it for the slur he was more than capable of such sudden violence as they all knew from experience after a long silence allowing time for the suddenly isolated noble to realise what he had done calgus laughed softly a collective sigh of released breath greeted the sound balthus bids us storm more of the wall forts while the legion to our south hide in their camp and yes we could easily fire another halfdozen of their camps knock the gates out of a dozen gateways kill a few hundred careless romans take more swords and spears he paused looking around the gathering meeting each of the leaders eyes in turn how many heads have we taken already five hundred a thousand what good will another five hundred do us do any of your men lack for swords or shields and as for their weapons well i ask you balthus would you fight me here and now man to man you with that toothpick and me wielding the sword of any other man here he paused again waiting for the implication to settle in i thought not if we delay here we simply give the romans more time to bring their legions together in a massive armoured fist that will smash our warbands i have information on that subject and it isnt good news the southern legions started moving north several weeks ago anticipating our attack and will be on the wall inside a week and when they arrive my brothers the western legions will move through the wall farther to the west and move east to pin us here on the wrong side of their defences and then in all truth we will be done for outnumbered and unable to fall back to join the other warbands and all because we were desperate to win a few more heads and some roman spears he turned to encompass the gathered nobles with opened arms we need neither a few hundred heads more nor any number of the romans weapons suited to their tactic of hiding and stabbing and not to the way we fight man to man what we need is to take not five hundred heads or a thousand but ten thousand when a legions standard lies on the ground before us when we have the head of a roman general pickled in a jar that will be a victory on that day i am certain the other legions will think carefully before coming north to punish us but will instead send negotiators to buy peace with us at a price of our naming but to achieve that victory we have to lure that single legion out on to our ground where we and not the romans choose the place and manner of our meeting so tell me my brothers should we stay for a while here and win more useless trinkets for our warriors to play with or shall we follow our intended plan and take a prize worth having hed prevailed of course his argument had been all the more convincing for being correct finding the stores at noisy valley all but emptied in advance of their arrival had validated the roman traitors other revelation that the western legions would arrive weeks earlier than he had expected now the warband was pulling back from the wall in good order its leaders happy enough to follow his direction and keep a muzzle on their mens urge to fight calgus turned to face his adviser the older mans face inscrutable in the dusks failing light your counsel is true as always aed ill give the tribes all the heads they can carry granted their patience for a few days the romans could skulk behind their defences for the time being his warband would have vanished into the north by the time they stirred to follow the trick now would be tempting the ths legatus to follow them on to a killing ground that calgus would choose with care that and a little inside assistance marcus woke again in the middle of the next morning his head relatively clear and his stomach growling for food clodia drusilla took one look at him and ordered a bed bath and a meal both administered by a stonefaced orderly who responded to marcuss attempts at conversation with monosyllabic grunts hot water a borrowed blade and a clean tunic lifted his spirits even if he was still weak enough to fall back on to his bed exhausted afterwards and a small meal of bread dried fish and vegetables left him replete he slept again almost immediately and was woken by a hand gently shaking his shoulder it was licinius the petrianas prefect smiling down at him with a glint of triumph dressed in a mudstained tunic and armour he had clearly come to the hospital directly from the saddle the shutter was closed and licinius was carrying a lamp adding its illumination to that of the lamp already burning by the bed ah there you are centurion marcus pulled himself up on to his elbows subsiding back on to the pillow that his superior hastily pushed beneath his straining body the orderly tried to send me away now ive seen you i think i understand why are you up to talking marcus declined the chance to put the conversation off once more too tired to be bothered with his own safety any longer yes prefect we can talk but tell me what time is it whats happening out there the other man sat on the short stool provided for the purpose hunching forward to hear marcuss tired whisper as he opened his mouth to speak again felicia burst through the door her mouth a thin whitelipped slash in a face pale with anger the prefect leapt to his feet bowing respectfully clodia drusilla my dear what a pleasure to see you again i she pushed a fist into his face making him step back in surprise almost tumbling over the stool you have no right or permission to be here and as this officers doctor im ordering you to get out now marcus raised a hand forestalling her outburst its all right doctor just a friendly conversation she turned on him wagging a finger threateningly that isnt your decision centurion and besides no more running what no more running from the truth not from an honourable roman prefect but her reproach ran dry leaving her staring helplessly at the bedridden centurion for a moment she turned and left the room in silence licinius sat down again raising an eyebrow at marcus clodia drusilla seems very protective of you young man perhaps yshould consider your position very carefully with regard to that young lady i happen to be acquainted with her husband well enough to know the way hell behave if he suspects his property is being coveted by another marcus looked at him questioningly until the older man shrugged his shoulders never mind just watch yourself there as to the time its late in the afternoon two days after you took what was by all accounts quite a thump on the head as to whats happening outside he paused rubbing his tired face with a wrinkled hand calgus came down the north road burned out everything down to noisy valley let his men loose on white strength and burned that down too then retreated back up the road and vanished into the landscape mars damn him for eternity ive got patrols out looking for the warband but for the time being theyre off the bloody map now that the barbarians have left the scene of the crime sixth legion has come forward from the blocking position they were holding to the south marched through here at lunchtime and thundered off over the horizon to some secret camp or other they scouted out a while ago where the other legions have got to mars only knows but we young man have subjects closer to home to discuss do we not marcus nodded giving in to the inescapable firstly as to your great secret dont trouble yourself with the revelation ive already questioned equitius and got the truth out of him marcuss eyes opened wide you the officer waved a hand dismissively shaking his head in amusement yclearly dont appreciate my position here young man i command the petriana cavalry wing and im the senior prefect of all the wall garrisons im already a senator as a result of an imperial promotion after a dirty little skirmish a few years ago and i have some very powerful friends in rome when i told your commanding officer to spill the beans he did what he was told related the whole story and offered to resign his command and fall on his sword because hes a realist the man that lives in yew grove may nominally command the wall garrison executing the governors orders but as long as im in place these units answer to me right up to the point where sixth legion comes forward into the line and hes in a position to take effective control marcus lay back strangely relieved at not having to hide from the senior officer any longer did you take equitiuss command licinius snorted his laughter of course i didnt yfool i cant afford to go dumping effective officers just because they happen to have an eye for a good officer but the prefect leaned in close half whispering into marcuss ear his patrician affectations suddenly replaced with a harder tone but nothing man i told you ive got friends in rome men of influence and stature they write to me regularly about the city and whats happening around them and their letters have steadily become more pessimistic some of them even write anonymously using recollection of our shared experiences as their identification for fear of their words being read by the wrong person our new emperor is in the sway of dangerous men and is steadily undermining the rules that have underpinned our society for almost a century your father and his brother were his victims murdered for their land and to silence a potential dissenting voice in the senate as a loyal citizen of rome i should of course arrest you and equitius and his first spear and hand you over to sixth legion for trial and execution he stopped speaking and looked away from marcus out of the rooms window as an officer of rome with a prior duty to the defence of this province it is my judgement that i will do no such thing but you risk losing everything centurion there are two or three warbands out there that amount to about thirty thousand fighting men all of them fired by the desire to liberate their lands from roman influence and get their cocks up some nice soft flesh in the process against that mass of angry warriors we total ten thousand regular troops and two thousand cavalry plus another eighteen thousand legionaries if the legions make an appearance in time to join in the fun if we get it wrong i could be dead inside the week in which case my failure to report your presence here will be inconsequential my duty is first and foremost to the troops under my command and to the people that depend on our protection to prevent those savages from killing and shagging their way all the way down to yew grove and besides quite apart from yourself there are two other good men involved at the very least your first spear is an outstanding soldier and equitius equitius has something even more special it wouldnt surprise me to see him reach very high office indeed if he comes through this thing intact youll understand when youre my age he got up and walked to the door reassuming his former aristocratic bearing anyway youre a good officer marcus tribulus corvus good enough to take advantage of your luck make the most of that fortune in the coming days ride it to the best possible advantage we shall have need of your brand of audacity if were to prevent this calgus from nailing our heads to his roof beams just dont give me reason to regret this decision he left raising an eyebrow at felicia who glared at his departing back before hurrying back into marcuss room appraising him with a frank concern he found touching he knows your secret then yes he put the question directly to my prefect and im to return to duty as soon as im fit it seems that live officers are of more value than dead traitors at this time she exhaled noisily sitting down at the end of his bed im pleased ive known him for long enough to be aware that he has his own very particular set of principles but i wasnt sure how hed react to your situation he said that your husband he stopped unwilling to embarrass the woman is a violent man would react without thinking if he thought there might be some slur upon his manhood hes a good judge of character not everyone sees through that veneer of hail fellow well met that prefect bassus uses to mask his real nature did he think that we were lovers marcus blushed unable to meet her questioning gaze yes i think he did she laughed putting her head back the laughter stung marcuss pride making his voice harsher than he would have wanted not so funny madam youre a beautiful woman he can see that any man would find you attractive he hoped that she wouldnt detect either his discomfort with her amusement or his almost total lack of physical experience of women her laughter died away and she returned his indignant glare with a gentle smile on the contrary centurion it wasnt that prospect i was laughing at the old proverb came to mind better to be strangled for a sheep than a goat if you get my meaning she turned and left the secret smile staying on her face until she was back in her tiny office making the duty orderly raise his eyebrows in mute curiosity dubnus arrived an hour later standing awkwardly in the doorway until marcus beckoned him in the big man came to attention at the bottom of the bed in which marcus was now sitting reading a borrowed scroll of caesars writings on his campaigns in gaul launching into a speech he had clearly prepared with painstaking care centurion i request permission to be allocated another century at a lower rank if necessary marcus sat bolt upright making the ache in his head throb a little harder he swayed for a second with the pain causing dubnus to leap around the bed and steady him by the arm the pain subsided after a moment he motioned the soldier to sit down and took a moment to wind the scroll up looking into the other mans stonily fixed face what reason could his deputy have for wanting to leave the th why dubnus the chosen man knotted his fingers and his eyes blinked rapidly betraying the turmoil beneath the surface a chosen mans main job is protect his officer and bullshit the roar surprised marcus himself and sent another wave of pain through his head but the rush of relief he felt in discovering the cause of his deputys unease mixed powerfully with his panic at the prospect of losing the man dubnus flinched back on the chair his eyes widening at the sudden display of anger your job is to be my deputy to stand behind the century with your poles end in their backs and ensure that the ninth moves in accordance with my commands steady the men when they waver he stopped for a moment and reached for the water cup by his bed drinking deeply and thats a job you perform superbly well think back dubnus when i decided to go out and rescue our runner without you at the back of the column our men would have turned and run for the safety of the wall before wed got two hundred yards out into the open they were shit scared and so for that matter was i it was only your voice behind them that made them keep moving but in the forest i managed to make enough noise to bring the tribesmen down on us that was nothing to do with you and i failed to stay with you we were fighting for our lives in the darkness against superior numbers its a wonder we arent both stuck in here or somewhere worse look forget it dubnus it wasnt your fault and youre not leaving the ninth relax man youre making my headache worse besides someone stepped over me and held the bluenoses off dubnus winced at the attempted humour then became serious again the look on his face stopping marcus midsentence which is the other reason why i should leave the century it wasnt me that saved you it was yes antenoch antenoch dubnus nodded miserably he came out of the trees behind us jumped over you and fought off the tribesmen until relief arrived killed three men and cut the sword arm off another he tailed off watching marcus intently antenoch followed us into the trees without y us noticing dubnus nodded again his face lengthening marcus felt his grip on his selfcontrol starting to slip after you refused to let him patrol with us yes the reply was no more than an ashamed whisper and for a second marcus had the sense of talking to a naughty child he kept control of a desire to laugh uncontrollably by the skin of his teeth good eh i said good and i meant it your feud with him has gone on long enough from now on youll trust him implicitly as i evidently have every reason to do where is he now hell come to the hospital later i told him to wait until i was back in camp marcus lay back his head buzzing with pain very well tell him to come up and see me after the evening meal i need to sleep some more now and dubnus centurion dont even consider leaving the ninth again without winning a vine stick first unless you want me to have you have you he slipped into sleep when he woke again the pain in his head was almost gone and antenoch was sitting quietly at his side reading the borrowed scroll seeing his centurion awake he furled the scroll shaking it in marcuss face and what sort of reading matter is this for a sick man besides what the divine julius actually knew about fighting the gauls would probably have fitted on your pocket tablet with room to spare theres more to warfare than looking good on a horse and knowing when to send in the cavalry id like to have seen him stand in a shield wall with the shit flying and retain his famous composure marcus laughed at him refusing to be drawn oh good youre better you must be or the good lady felicia wouldnt be talking about letting you out in the morning dont be so familiar antenoch unless the ladys given you permission to use her forename one of these days youll talk yourself into a mess i cant get you out of oh the lady and i are on firstname terms centurion from the long conversations we had mooning over your sickbed before you got bored with sleeping all the time conversations i might add that lead me to the belief that felicia entertains feelings for you that go beyond those that might be expected between doctor and patient you play it right you could be hiding the sausage marcuss irritation boiled over his finger stopping an inch from antenochs nose enough youll push me too far you insolent bastard credit me with some sense of decorum shes a married woman for jupiters sake whether i want her or not there are rules by which our lives are run to his dismay the briton collapsed against the wall in giggles rules gods above listen to him he wiped his eyes theatrically shaking his head in mock amazement and you a roman citizen born and bred dont you know you people practically invented adultery they stared at each other in angry silence for a moment neither willing to concede at length antenoch spoke again anyway be that as it may the lady felicia who i am sure has led the most blameless of lives entertains more than a hint of affection for yourself and thats official marcus rose to the bait what do you mean official his clerk smiled slyly her orderly told me so we shared a mug of beer last night after he was off duty call it a scouting mission on your behalf if you like hes been with her for a year and a half down at fair meadow helping her put damaged second tungrians together again and he reckons he knows her better than her husband ever will marcus shook his head aghast i really shouldnt be listening to this but you will because you feel for her just as much i warned you id always speak my mind she hates her husband because he wont recognise her abilities and wants her to play the submissive little wife for him another fool that thought he could change a woman once they were married anyway he told me that she gets all misty eyed when she thinks he isnt looking and hes pretty sure youre the cause which i can understand a nice young boy in uniform like you and whats more marcus raised his arms in mock surrender no more ive heard all i need to youre quite impossible and im tiring fast just listening to you run along and play your games with the orderly and leave me in peace we can discuss this again once ive got a grip of my vine stick antenoch got to his feet his smile undaunted youd only break the stick sleep well centurion but remember what ive told you he went to the door looked out into the corridor and then turned back as if on an afterthought and if she does decide she cant resist i think youll owe me an apology perhaps we could even have a small wager on the matter he ducked round the door frame as marcus threw the scroll at his head annius sat in his tent throughout the afternoon working through a sheaf of tablets and sending his staff around the camp to find the items he required until he was convinced that the cohort had all of the supplies required for a deployment into hostile territory spearheads had already been purchased from the local armourer spare swords traded for surplus sets of mail and generally scarce boots quietly stolen from a neighbouring units store all might be required in the next few days and he had no intention of inviting the wrath of men he would depend upon to stand between him and thousands of angry barbarians darkness fell and he worked on by the light of half a dozen lamps snacking from a plate of cakes purchased from tacituss bakery until a disturbance outside the tent caught his attention rising to go to the flap he received his clerk in the belly the man literally thrown into the tent from outside they fell on to his table scattering tablets cakes and lamps plunging the interior into darkness the flap was pulled open the man standing in the opening silhouetted in the light of the torches that burned around the camp stores officer annius the cohorts guards would notice would come to his rescue he gathered his dignity getting to his feet and trying to make out the indistinct figure at the tents door yes what the other man reached into the tent grasping him by the neck and pulling him out through the door choking him with the pinchhold on his windpipe close up in the light of the torches he was evidently officer class dressed in cavalry armour and with a body that annius would have bet filled his cuirass without any trouble he leaned in close to speak into the stores officers face his eyes shining in the torchlight and a hand sliding down to his waist gripping the hilt of his dagger i told your clerk and ill tell you shut your face if you want to live i could slit your throats and be away from here before your guards woke up understand his vision greying from the vicelike grip on his throat annius nodded limply good the grip relaxed allowing him to gulp in some air his arm was grasped leaving him no alternative but to accompany the man as he led a winding path through the tents without a cloak he began to shiver in the nights cold air after a minutes swift walk the officer pushed him into a tent lit brightly by several large lamps and followed placing his bulk between annius and the door flap a younger man also in uniform sat idly in a chair at the tents far end a thin purple stripe ran along his tunics hem and he was attired in magnificently polished armour in the lamplight annius read his face in an instant finding the intensity and intelligence of a predator under a shock of blond hair well storeman do you know who i am he shook his head realising that he should speak and chanced a response a senior officer sir a legion tribune to judge from your rank quite so and more too youll doubtless have heard of our emperor commodus yes tribune did this have something to do with that young bastard of a centurion what had tacitus been broadcasting to the world my name is titus tigidius perennis my father is the praetorian prefect of rome i carry a special commission from the emperor he took a small scroll from inside his tunic and waved it at annius ive read it so many times i can remember the wording as if it were open in front of me find and bring to justice any person guilty of treason against the throne of whatever rank within the imperial government of britannia command the services of any man required to aid in this task of whatever rank on penalty of death for refusal on penalty of death storeman theres more but its only detail by comparison i came to britain to serve as a tribune in the sixth legion under legatus sollemnis a man suspected of harbouring treacherous sympathies with certain roman enemies of the state enemies since dealt with in ways fitting to their unveiled treason he let the implicit threat hang in the air for a moment before getting to his feet and walking across to annius staring him in the eyes before restarting his discourse i found the legion well trained and ready for war the legatus obviously competent but curiously reticent on the subject of his emperor unwilling to discuss a subject he might have felt could trip him up and so i waited content to work in preparation for a war we were both convinced was close upon us then a few months ago came word that a young traitor son of one of the men arrested for treason had run for cover and was seeking to join the sixth as an anonymous centurion legatus sollemnis played it straight sending the boy back south by night as instructed by the governor giving my men a chance to deal with him on the road someone whether with the legatuss blessing or not killed a cavalry decurion and two of his men sent to deal with the traitor worse they tortured the decurion for information while he lay dying and then escaped into the open country almost certainly with the traitor in tow after which disappointing events nothing was heard of either the outlaw or whoever aided him until perhaps now he turned away pacing down the tents length before turning back and speaking again the decurion they killed was a respected man in these parts first in line for promotion to first spear with the asturians who you might have heard have sworn to a man to have their revenge on the killer whenever and wherever the chance arises this man he gestured to the officer filling the tents doorway has a particular interest in taking the killers blood since the man was his older brother now a contact of mine within the fort tells me that you have information on the subject which i might find useful he recommended i speak with you with all dispatch he paced back to the terrified storekeeper staring into his eyes now you are at this moment weighing up whether to tell me the truth or not lets face it im here tonight and gone in the morning while your first spear will always be there and eager for revenge if he thinks youve betrayed him in such a way he turned to the decurion and nodded a pale sword slid from its scabbard the edge winking in the lamplight the decurion here however is another matter he wants revenge on this traitor and whoever helped him and hell be very upset indeed if he feels that youre obstructing his path to justice so storeman your choices are simple tell me everything you know here and now without hiding anything or theyll find you face down in the river with a rather nasty hole in your back its really up to you annius opened his mouth and started talking marcus read quietly through the evening submerging himself in caesars twohundredyearold account of his subjugation of gaul until the shadows lengthened and the orderly came to light his lamp after a while straining to make out the characters in the halfdarkness became too much of an effort and he rolled up the scroll and slid beneath the blanket blowing the lamp out to leave the room in darkness hovering above sleeps dark waters his mind easing down to rest he thought for a second that he felt a gentle touch on his face soft enough not to pull him back from the brink of rest enough to hold him there in a state of uncertain thrill the touch came again and a soft voice spoke soothingly to him as a warm body slipped under the blanket beside him his body trembled slightly with the sudden realisation as hands caressed his back and neck lips finding his ear and gently kissing away the fear he rolled over to meet her kiss with his own still stunned at the situation pausing for breath after a long moment it would seem that i owe my clerk an apology felicia renewed the kiss wordlessly moving her body over his beneath the blankets rough folds felicia left marcuss bed in the early hours abandoning him to an exhausted dreamless sleep he woke long after dawn to the orderlys persistent shaking of his shoulder centurion theres a messenger from your cohort waiting outside clodia drusilla grants you her permission to leave the hospital and has asked me to give you this he directed a significant look towards marcus making it quite clear that he could guess at the tablets contents as he left one of marcuss men came through the door with a bundle of clothing and equipment tied up in what marcus quickly recognised as his cloak sir first spears regards an he requests you to rejoin the cohort on the way to the north road the horse boys found the barbarians yesterday an were moving to attack them marcus dressed quickly shoving the tablet into a pocket and grabbing a piece of bread from the breakfast table as he followed the soldier out of the infirmarys quiet corridors and into the forts orderly hubbub the rest of the mans tent party were waiting impatiently at the door their leader saluting smartly at his appearance among them morning sir good to see you looking better i hope youre up to a run this morning the cohort marched out at the double almost half an hour ago along with the second and the batavians marcus nodded grimly tightening his new helmets strap until the leather bit into his chin ignoring the pressure on his stillsensitive scalp while the men checked that their packs were secure on their carrying poles before hoisting them on to their shoulders along with their spears a shouted command set them running a steady trot to which marcus was pleased to discover his body adjusted after only a moments protest five minutes took them across the forts bridge and out of view of the fort passing through wooded copses and open fields as they climbed the steep hill to the east of the river despite the roads arrowstraight line marcus kept a hand on his swords hilt aware that a roving barbarian scouting party would see an officer and eight men as fair game half an hours running brought no sight of the cohort confirmation of marcuss mental arithmetic he had guessed that it would take the best part of another hour to catch the tungrians and so it proved the black snake of men appearing on the horizon as they ran into sight of the crossroads with the north road the tailend century of the rearmost cohort was clearing the crossroads and heading out through the walls open gates as the nine men ran up to it marcus recognising their companion unit the second tungrians with a sudden guilty start they moved to the verge padding past the marching soldiers without breaking their pace and ignoring the barrage of catcalls and insults that followed their progress up the line of centuries at the columns head marcus recognised his own cohort and quickened his pace in response a voice rang out from behind him peremptory in its authority you there centurion a moment he signalled his men to rejoin their colleagues and then turned reluctantly to face the speaker walking backwards to keep pace with the columns leading rank an officer marched forward from his place alongside the columns head extending a hand in greeting marcus saluted before taking the offered hand turning to walk alongside the other man quintus dexter bassus prefect second tungrian cohort and you i presume from the look of you are the first cohorts illustrious young cattleburning centurion marcus drew on his praetorian etiquette training recalling his instruction on how best to maintain a respectful posture while escorting a walking dignitary and turned his torso towards the prefect nodding his head slightly yes sir he took a deep breath thinking quickly centurion two knives i prefer to fight with two swords when possible and the title seems to have stuck ive heard it a soldiers name if ever i heard one is there a name that you can share with me with pleasure prefect my family name is corvus well centurion corvus i can only offer you my inadequate but heartfelt thanks for your rescue of my wife they walked in silence for a moment the massed rattle on the road of hobnailed boots and the jingle and rattle of harnesses and equipment filling what would otherwise have been an uncomfortable gap in the conversation the thanks prefect would more appropriately be offered to my century but nevertheless i am happy to acknowledge them and to express my pleasure that we were in the right place at the right time the other man pursed his lips perhaps marcus thought caught between the need to show gratitude for the act and a curiosity as to what felicia might have said to him during the their time together youre too modest young man the whole army is talking about the way your century denied the barbarians their supplies and i owe you a debt of thanks i cannot easily discharge the gods only know what indignities your fortunate arrival spared my wife prefect you may be aware that i sustained a head injury during a night patrol two days ago your wife was good enough to administer her medical skills to my wound greatly assisting my recovery any debt is thus well repaid the other man stared at him for a moment a noble sentiment and more typically roman than im used to from the local officers i find it refreshing to see a young gentleman accept a position in an auxiliary unit rather than insisting on serving with the legions although im surprised that a traditionally minded first spear like frontinius would ever accept such a recruit i wonder centurion marcus willed his face to remain impassive if clodia drusilla mentioned to you what she was doing over the wall at such a time relief flooded his mind at the mans obvious preoccupation with his woman followed immediately by the realisation that he was still walking on eggshells ah no sir now that you mention it she didnt tell me and neither did i have the time to ask i was preoccupied with getting my men away from danger and and not really your business anyway eh very well centurion since youre clearly a man of discretion i can see i shouldnt delay you from your men any longer good day marcus saluted briskly and turned relieved to be away without having to face difficult questions regarding either his own provenance or the other mans wife accelerating his pace he trotted smartly past the tailend century the men of the th striding along with their axes over their shoulders as he passed the ths front rank titus stepped out with his fist raised for the tap good work young two knives youre the talk of the cohort marcus reflexively tapped the huge mans fist with his own shooting a surprised glance at the big mans smug smile normally he would now have been running alongside his own men but the th were at the columns head otho striding along beside his th century simply smiled his battered smile and winked as the young centurion passed ahead of him brutus was walking along backwards at the head of the th applauding he slapped marcus on the shoulder as he passed calling after him and i thought i was supposed to be the lucky one rufiuss chosen man was apparently in command of the th and quite sensibly kept his mouth shut and his eyes to the front as a redfaced marcus hurried past as he progressed up the columns length shouts of ribald encouragement from the marching ranks accompanied his progress until he reached the standard carried in the midst of the th century julius was marching at the fifths head with rufius striding alongside him his friends face widened into a broad smile of welcome heres the young fellow fresh from his deathbed here two knives clasp hands with me once more marcus put his hand out only for rufius to grasp it eagerly rolling his eyes i shook his hand a real live hero i wont ever wash it again julius nodded to him his eyes showing a mix of respect and something else that marcus was hard placed to identify it looked almost like concern hows your head two knives harder than i thought thank you julius the other man nodded with a sardonic smile its going to have to be if youre going to keep on like this rufius poked julius in the ribs hes just jealous weve spent the last three days patrolling and sitting around bored not tucked up in hospital with a nice lady doctor to look after our every need marcus blushed a deeper shade of red unable to control the reaction and rufius pounced on the display his bearded face split in a disbelieving grin ah so there is something to the rumour you lucky bastard i swear you could fall into shit and come out smelling of myrrh marcus bit his tongue to prevent a sheepish grin that was hovering on the bounds of his control a gentleman would never discuss such a question ill talk to you later he set off up the column with his ears still hot under the helmets protection making a mental note to murder his clerk at the first opportunity the prefect was nowhere to be seen but frontinius dropped back from the columns head as soon as he heard marcuss voice returning the younger mans salute you can have your century back now that youve caught up with us keep them moving at the double march until the signal for a rest comes and otherwise take your cue from the raetians ahead if you see men to the flank take a good look before you shout theres a legion out here somewhere and i wouldnt want the tungrians to be the ones to point the spear at our own side keep your eyes open marcus nodded acknowledgement then ran to the head of his century settling into the groundeating double march a blessed relief after the mornings exertion antenoch appeared at his shoulder after a moment good morning centurion i trust you slept well marcuss eyes slitted daring the man to push his question any farther antenoch took the hint er good ive got some bread and dried meat if youre hungry after your er exertions give me the food antenoch and keep your mouth shut it seems that there are far too many people in this cohort making assumptions about my behaviour without you making it any worse he accepted the food and chewed quickly wanting it inside him and not in his hands if trouble developed gave his clerk another withering stare and then dropped down the line of march to talk to dubnus at the centurys rear how are they the briton nodded grimly ready what was the mornings briefing theres a lot happened since your bang on the head the warbands that came south of the wall didnt stay long to fight once they found noisy valley burnt out and a legion dug in between them and yew grove theyve retreated to the north back past red river apparently no one knows why the sixth legion followed up and is somewhere north of the wall theyve got cavalry in contact with the bluenoses so now were moving to close them down for a battle the prefects gone to meet the sixths legatus to agree the overall plan theres a big fight waiting for us and not too far off either equitius wondered for the hundredth time how sollemnis had managed to manoeuvre a whole legion through such close country and for that matter why his escort a thirtyman detachment from the asturian cavalry who seemed to have become tribune perenniss personal command looked nervously to either side of the narrow path into dense forest vegetation that made vision impossible after no more than a dozen yards something took fright deep in the undergrowth and bolted away from the path making his horse prance nervously for a moment this rather reminds me of the accounts of the teutoburger forest i read as a boy the comment went seemingly unnoticed by the younger man for a long moment before he responded over his shoulder not bothering to turn in the saddle i had the asturians map this areas paths during the spring just in case we needed to move one of the legions round an enemys flank if the wall were under threat ive got this country etched into my head varus made the mistake of advancing into close terrain hed failed to thoroughly scout thats the way to lose a legion or three equitius scowled at the other mans back hating his selfassured swagger and yet his plan had succeeded brilliantly so far moving the legion from its blocking position behind the wall into a hidden temporary fortress from where they could strike at the enemy warbands without warning given the right opportunity it was this very opportunity with which equitius was riding to join the th news that the petriana had managed to pinpoint the warbands location a horseman had galloped into the cauldron pool camp the previous afternoon with news that his detachment had chanced upon the warbands wellbeaten path north of the wreck of the red river fort successful in their stealthy tracking of the enemy formation to its current resting place they were calling for reinforcement and quickly before the warband decided to move again that old war horse licinius had led the rest of the petriana out an hour later leaving instructions with equitius to get the th legion committed in their support as soon as possible they had been riding ever deeper into barbarian territory since early morning following the legions path down what was no more than a hunters track and now the sun was close to its zenith the asturians kept to themselves leaving him with nobody to talk to other than perennis a young man for whom he was gradually developing a marked aversion so tribune how did you come to be posted to this miserable end of the empire again the calculated pause i asked for the posting my father told me that the emperor wanted to send a young man of the equestrian class to serve with the northern command to provide him with a firsthand description of the country and its people a thinly disguised reference to his role as an imperial spy which equitius sensed was deliberately sufficiently implausible as to make the real purpose quite apparent hearing this i persuaded him to present me to commodus and to make the case for my taking the role the emperor asked me what i would do in the case of my discovering treachery at any level of the army even that of a legionary legatus and he paused again letting the silence drag out i told him that i would quite cheerfully condemn the traitor to a public and agonising death as a lesson to any others of the same mind it seemed to hit the right note equitius would have bet it did commoduss reputation for insecurity and bloody overcompensation was already well established perennis turned in this saddle looking back at him i expect you would have said exactly the same equitius met his eye suddenly frightened for the first time in several years hiding his fear behind a slow smile i expect i would thirty yards ahead of them and without warning half a dozen armoured men stepped from the undergrowth their spears ready to throw it was now he thought about it perfect country to defend if a column of attackers were surprised on the path they would be bottled up like rats in a lead drainpipe he glanced to one side and saw armoured men moving through the woods closing the trap the centurion on the path ahead demanded the password and waited to receive it from perennis without a change of expression password given and accepted equitius looked down at the men as they rode past grimfaced veterans who looked up at him with the disdain to which hed become accustomed as an auxiliary officer regulars as convinced of their superiority over any other fighting man as they were that the sun would rise the next day proud and nasty with it habitually taking no prisoners and expecting no quarter where a captured auxiliary would be slaughtered without compunction as a traitor to his own people a legionary would be saved for more exquisite treatment to be exacted at leisure if possible to the tribes they were not simply soldiers of the hated oppressor but enemy citizens or as good as and both feared and hated in greater proportions accordingly a mile down the track they broke out into the open a clearing in the forest greatly enlarged by the legionaries labour in felling trees the fallen trunks stripped of their branches and converted into a rough log palisade around the temporary camps perimeter their branches had been hacked into thousands of stakes and set outside the wall at angles that would impale a careless night attacker tents mushroomed across the open space inside the fence enough for a full legion at eight men to a tent men still working at strengthening the camps defences equitius smiled remembering the old adage give a legion open ground for a night and you got a field camp surrounded by an earthwork four feet high a week and they would pillage the surrounding land for the materials to build a fullblown fort a month and the officers mess would look as if it had been there for a year the small party passed through the open gateway making their way to the camps centre where the command tents rose above the lower troop and officer versions sollemnis met them at the door of his headquarters tent accepting perenniss salute with appropriate gravity before clasping equitiuss arm in a warm greeting my good friend its been almost a year equitius nodded soberly glancing significantly at the tent and now we meet in a time of war with little time for talk but talk we must perennis i would invite you to share our discussion but you probably have duties to attend to the tribune nodded indeed sir i thought i might take a squadron of the asturians to the west and make sure that the barbarians havent slipped away from the petriana sollemnis waved a hand absently very good regular dispatches mind you i want to know where you are when we move he turned away gesturing equitius into the command tent past the hardbitten legionaries guarding its flap a drink an orderly came forward with a tray pouring them both a cup of wine and then withdrew leaving the two men alone sollemnis gestured to the couch please my friend sit down you must be tired after a day in the saddle now firstly tell me what you think about my tribune freely of course youre not overheard and you and i are old friends your opinions have always been important to me never more so than now so tell me what you think equitius weighed his words on one level he seems the most complete soldier was this location really his idea oh yes he spent most of last summer cataloguing the ground he has a sound grasp of tactics and an understanding of war fighting and strategy that puts men twice his age to shame and on the other level hes dangerous do you trust him trust his abilities absolutely youll have heard the stories about our great victory over the twentieth in last autumns manoeuvres that was our perennis using the asturians to scout a way around their flank patrols and bring us down on their supply train like wolves on the flock while the shepherd was away the senior centurions recognise a kindred spirit and they worship the ground he walks on trust the man not likely he was imposed on me by the governor and on him by the emperor for the purpose of ensuring my loyalty but for a young man his ambition burns exceedingly brightly too brightly for my liking im afraid his fathers influence i suppose so why tolerate him i refer you back to my first answer his skills will be invaluable to the legion in this campaign after which ill send him back to rome as a hero to report our victory and recommended to take command of a legion of his own with promotion to senatorial rank in the meantime ill do everything possible to keep our secret from him now i believe another young mans been making something of a reputation for himself in the last week equitius smiled wryly yes his adoptive father did too good a job of the boys training turned him into a bloody assassin we paired him with an experienced chosen man in the hope that hed temper the boys lack of experience instead of which they went storming around the countryside at the first opportunity burning out calguss supplies and taking on his cavalry at suicidal odds but for old licinius youd have no son now licinius gods how long did it take that old bastard to see through the matter he didnt have to he asked me for the truth and i gave it to him you lie to that man at your peril hmm and his verdict was that the boys too good a soldier to throw away if the emperors men discover him licinius will of course disown the pair of us as traitors so were not discovered yet the legatus blew a long breath out you have my thanks for your risk ill find a way to make amends once this is all dealt with the twentieth comes up for command rotation early next year my recommendation will be for you to take the rank of legatus not that the position is guaranteed to be in my gift i never quite understood why it was that you didnt get command of the twentysecond primigenia in germania you were senior tribune after all the legatus and i didnt entirely see eye to eye he thought it was appropriate for the senior officers to benefit from a variety of incautious frauds against official funds i didnt i was caught between two fires i either informed on him and earned a reputation as a toady or ignored the situation and paid the price with the rest of them when they were found out i managed to get the appropriate information to the governor but i didnt want promotion into the shoes of a man id effectively condemned to death so i asked him to send me to britannia instead being appointed to an auxiliary cohort was the closest thing to a promotion i could have expected under the circumstances command of a legion would be a very fine thing indeed but im happy enough with the tungrians his friend nodded well if i get my way youll have a legion soon enough in the meanwhile we should probably concentrate on more pressing business tell me about this new development with our esteemed adversary the cohort went north at a fast pace twice marching past burnedout forts the smell of charred wood stayed with them long after the ruined outposts were out of sight as had an altogether more disturbing odour marcus was kept busy until after sunset once the cohorts turned off the line of march for the day since the prefects had decided to avoid the previous marching camps which abounded in the frontier area their locations likely to be known and watched there was a fourfoot turf wall to be built and no time to waste one tent party was drawn by lot and sent to form part of the guard force an important precaution even if the enemy could not be expected to find their encampment this late in the day even less attack it another tent party was set to prepare the cohorts evening meal with all tasks distributed and under way and their section of the rampart growing steadily under dubnuss expert eye marcus suddenly found himself lacking any worthwhile task knowing looks were exchanged a moment later as his wiry figure joined the working party to carry cut turfs from the increasingly distant cutting gang to the wall builders antenoch one of the more skilled rampart builders threw down the turf he was holding in disgust watching his officers more or less clean mail shirt swiftly deteriorate under his first muddy load he nudged dubnus who had graciously made a great show of accepting his presence in the century who in turn set out to intercept his centurion but a raised hand forestalled his comment the more bodies involved the quicker we finish i cant supervise the wall building and i cant cut turf or build the rampart with any expertise the century is all working ill bet most of the officers are working and im damned if ill stand by and watch get on with making that rampart sound and you can teach me the basics later frontinius walked past on an inspection a few minutes later searched without success for the centurions distinctive crested helmet and was about to ask dubnus where his officer was when he made out just who the slightly grubby figure delivering turfs to the wallbuilding gang was he stood and watched as the tired centurion headed back out to the turf cutters nodded to himself and then with a raised eyebrow to dubnus went on his way with the wall declared complete high enough to slow an attackers charge to a walking pace and make excellent spear targets of anyone crossing the obstacle the cohorts went to dinner with the exception of the guard units who paid for their inactivity during the building work with a later meal fed the men turned their hands to their domestic chores in the flickering torchlight making hurried repairs to clothing and equipment wellworn jokes and insults flying between the working men in equal measure as they relaxed tired limbs and minds their last task was to remove the worst of the days dirt from their uniforms and faces a delegation from the th promptly demanded marcuss dirtcaked mail which they brushed out and returned with a polished gleam as the troops turned in for the night huddled into their blankets and packed tight in their eightman tents the officers were called to the headquarters tent for their briefing equitius who had returned just before sunset ordered the tired centurions to stand easy as you know i met with the sixths legatus early this afternoon our situation is more than stabilised it has become on the whole favourable the sixth is camped in this forest here he pointed to a point on their rough map twenty miles distant second and twentieth legions have reached the wall and are marching along the main road to join us theyll probably arrive some time the day after tomorrow sollemnis plans to tackle the warband during that day with everything we can throw at it and as quickly as possible before it can gather any more spears even if it means starting the attack before the second and twentieth arrive so we break camp in the morning and march with all speed to join the petriana and augustan cavalry wings which are currently holding position ten miles to the northwest the sixth will also move tomorrow with the intention of joining our forces together and forcing a decisive action once we have their position fixed well gauge how best to bring them to battle but and i emphasise this well only fight if we can bring the legion and our own spears to bear and on the right terrain for our tactics together were twelve thousand men with the cavalry wings quite enough to make a mess of twice our number of undisciplined barbarians on the right ground so go and get some sleep and have your men ready to move at first light weve got a long marching day in front of us tomorrow marcus headed back to his tent eager to roll up in his blanket and snatch a few hours sleep as he took his boots off something poked him in the ribs and he remembered the tablet the orderly had given him that morning hastily pushed into a tunic pocket and then forgotten in the rush of the day opening it he leaned over close to the single lamp straining to read the stylus marks on the tablets hard wax marcus thank you for last night if i were not already taken you would be my choice its cruel how the fates conspire to make this clear only after its too late with my love the next day dawned to a thin summer drizzle accompanied by a sharp wind to mercifully cool the hardmarching cohorts goaded by their centurions to a brisk pace and for once grateful for the absence of unobstructed sunlight they headed up the north road towards the abandoned outpost fort at red river in the th half a mile ahead of the leading units since the tungrians were leading the column nobody was in any doubt as to what they should expect roaring river fort burnt to the ground although i dare say they scoured the place for weapons first red river wont be any different dubnus nodded grimly at morbans words as they marched remembering the scene as the cohorts had marched past the shattered remnants of the roaring river fort the previous day in peacetime the fort had been home to a sizeable detachment of auxiliaries usually rotated out of the wall units for six months at a time positioned north of the wall it also attracted more than its share of hangerson prostitutes thieves merchants and pedlars all keen to part the soldiers separated from their usual environment and loved ones from their money in any way possible the warband had evidently come down the north road fast enough that the evacuating troops had found little time to worry about the occupants of the forts ramshackle settlements who had themselves either taken swift flight or paid a severe price for their collaboration fifty or sixty men had been nailed to the remaining standing timbers at roaring river another twenty farther south at fort habitus all of them smeared with tar and then set ablaze only the blackened husks of their bodies had remained along with an overpowering stench of burnt flesh of the women thered been no sign although their fate wasnt hard to imagine there wasnt a man in the cohort that hadnt imagined the same fate for his own fort and shuddered already the mood among the troops had changed from one of concern as to what they might come up against in the field to a hunger to get some revenge spill barbarian guts and take heads the same thought was obviously on equitiuss mind for he ran forward with frontinius and a twentyman bodyguard from the th and caught up with the th at the milestone three miles before they reached the red river fort its off the road here i think and time for you scouts to start earning your corn if this calgus is half the commander hes cracked up to be theyll have red river under watch and id rather stay incognito for the time being he looked to either side then pointed off to their left at rising ground stretching up to a distant line of trees well wait here on the road until you report that the path ahead to that forest is clear the th went in the direction indicated off the road to the left and started up a narrow farmers track that led to a rude hut the abandoned farmers dwelling then on up to the treeline the woods three hundred yards distant across the abandoned field were an uncertain refuge however morban took a good hard look and spat derisively into the dust cocidius above the entire warband could be in that lot and wed never know it marcus turned back to grin at the standardbearer thats what the prefect meant when he said it was time to earn our corn want to take the standard back to the main body and risk getting jumped on my own on the way back no thank you very much sir ill risk it here with a few dozen swords between my soft flesh and the enemy very well chosen well have a party of scouts up that path as soon as you like the rest of the century to observe from here until we know whats behind the trees nice and steady no need for shouting or rushing about dubnus nodded walking through the troops and picking his scouts by hand briefing them in measured tones rather than the usual paradeground roar the five men chosen shook out into an extended line across the field then started climbing the slope at a measured pace slow enough that they had time to strip ears of corn from the standing crop they nibbled at the immature kernels as they moved through the thighdeep green carpet look at those lucky bastards just strolling in the country and chewing some poor bloody farmers wheat morban spun to glare at the speaker the soldier scarface shaking the bagged standard at the man then whispered at him sotto voce shut your mouth you stupid sod firstly its them risking a spear in the guts not you so a few nibbles of corn isnt exactly a great reward secondly if your bellowing brings a fucking great warband down out of those trees before the rest of the cohort gets here to die with us i am personally going to stick this standard right up your arse before they cut my head off statue end first scarface hung his head red faced tongue lashings from morban while not exactly rare were usually less vehement the scouts progressed up the slope vanishing into the trees together as if at some preordained signal after a moment a man reappeared at the woods edge waving them to come forward with some urgency the century went up the track at the double marcus leading the way in his eagerness to see what had animated the man antenoch drew his sword and stayed close to his centurion his eyes moving across the trees with hard suspicion as they ran up the slope morban hurrying along behind them muttered an insult at the clerks back whats the matter antenoch hasnt he paid you yet this month inside the wood in the shade and quiet marcus found two of the scouts conferring over something while the other three were dimly visible fifty or sixty yards distant moving deeper into the trees there were flies swarming in the still air their scratchy buzz sawing at his nerves as they crisscrossed the scene the man who had waved them up the track now recognisable as cyclops gestured to the ground with some excitement they were here all right sir a day ago perhaps two marcus looked in a small pit dug a foot or so into the earth a pile of human excrement and small animal bones formed an untidy still life a small cloud of buzzing flies still feasting on their find he turned to find dubnus at his shoulder the chosen man looked down into the pit then squatted down and poked at one of the stools with a twig these men got lazy didnt bury their leavings properly cyclops look for other pits probably filled in see how many you can find two knives you need to brief the prefect this is a day old from the feel of it no more or the flies would have lost interest by now these were probably the men that torched red river set an ambush here in case there were roman forces in the area to come to the rescue these woods would easily conceal a whole warband and hide their fires sir the call came from the scouts deeper into the woods marcus shot a glance at them dubnus you brief the prefect ill see whats got their attention he went on into the woods the century spreading out to either side spears and shields held ready the scouts beckoned him on pointing to the ground now that he took the time to look he saw that the damp earth was pressed flat for a hundred yards in all directions the marks of many boots most of the prints the most recent were pointed in the same direction west the cavalrymens horses fretted at their reins impatient to be away from the plodding infantry column and free to run the prefect had a dozen horsemen his escort from the ths camp to use as swift messengers in the absence of the petrianas courier riders four were to be loosed now tasked to ride northeast and find the oncoming legion to warn them that a second warband was in the field the headquarters clerks finished coding the message with the days cipher and a centurion whisked the tablets out to the waiting horsemen equitius scratched his beard increasingly itchy as the spartan field regime of coldwater washing took its toll on his cleanliness hed manoeuvred the column off the road and into the woods then dropped his five cohorts into a swift defensive posture while he composed his message to sollemnis another warband on the move gave calgus much greater ability to threaten any advancing roman force manoeuvre to strike at a flank or rear while the first held their attention even more than before he knew the critical importance of adding their four thousand spears to those of the legion for both their sakes he raised an eyebrow questioningly at frontinius and now first spear before i call the other prefects to confer your advice please do we push forward to our meeting point with the legion or make a more cautious approach there could be ten thousand or more spears waiting for us out there frontinius pondered rubbing his scalp i say we hump forward to join with the sixth as quickly as we can better to be part of a combined force than wait about out here for the barbarians to find us the ninth can scout forward half a mile in advance make sure we dont fall into any nasty little traps equitius nodded his agreement turning to walk away very well ill get the other cohorts ready to move youd better get the ninth on the job the days advance was for the most part a nonevent the th went forward at a steady pace while individual tent parties were directed to any feature of the rolling ground capable of concealing an enemy every copse every wrinkle in the ground was investigated by nervous soldiers their caution easing as the day grew older and still no sign of the enemy was found the beaten path left by the warbands passage had turned gradually away to the northwest while the cohorts meeting point with the th lay directly to the west by the middle of the afternoon the wind had died away to nothing and the soldiers were starting to get hot and irritable under the burden of their armour helmets were removed and hung around the troops necks allowing the sweat to evaporate from their scalps rather than soak into their helmet liners and water skins became an increasing source of temptation when a centurions back was turned one of the questing tent parties investigating a small clump of trees just off the line of march beckoned marcus and dubnus forward with frantically waved hands the rest of the century deploying to either side in guard positions in the middle of the copse was a grim scene already busy with flies and stinking of decays onset half a dozen men lay dead one with his throat cut untidily wide open the others with combat wounds dubnus examined the bodies looking at each ones blue tattoos with care theyre from the same tribe but four of the bodies are from one family group two from another they must have quarrelled he moved one of the bodies with his foot pulling a hunting bow from an indignant cloud of flies a quiver of a dozen heavy irontipped arrows tied to the weapon and they must have been in a hurry to leave to have missed this id guess that some of the losers escaped and the winners headed for the warband eager to get their version of events in front of their tribal elders first he strapped the bow across his back having tested the tautness of its string frontinius came forward with the runner sent to fetch him and surveyed the scene unhappily he looked hard at the bodies then nodded agreement to dubnus youre right a family squabble by the look of things this could have been a scouting party or just a group of men on their way to join the warband but either way it tells us that were too close to the main force for my comfort well push on as planned but i want extra vigilance from here the rest of the afternoon however passed without incident at least until the th spotted a line of horsedrawn carts against the dark green mass of the next line of hills and a row of machines made tiny by the distance legion artillery train morban grunted the rest of themll be on top of the hills digging out a camp while those lazy bastards sit on their arses they stopped to wait for the cohorts to catch up with them unwilling to advance out towards the line of bolt throwers and catapults until everyone knew exactly who they were legion artillerymen were notoriously quick to fire at almost anything that moved and their weapons were capable of punching a bolt through a man at four hundred paces once the cohorts had advanced to their position frontinius took the th forward at a cautious pace until a detachment of the legions cavalry galloped over to investigate them their decurion nodded recognition saluted frontinius and pointed up the hillside the sixths up there digging in first spear and youre invited to join them as soon as possible theres probably twenty thousand enemy spears within a halfdays march of here and the legatuss keen to get everyone into defensive positions for the night they marched past the supply train eyeing the evillooking bolt throwers painted with names like maneater and ribsplitter and their lounging crews then climbed the hills long slope until they reached the crest where a scene from a hundred field exercises greeted them the legions six thousand men were labouring like slaves a steady flow of cut turfs flowing to the rampart building gangs the ths camp prefect strode out to meet them pointing over the temporary forts rising walls to a point on the far side glad to see you prefect your last message put the wind up everyone wed like your cohorts on the eastern face since thats the side where the slopes shallowest equitius shot a wry smile at frontinius before replying ill take the fact that you want us to protect the most vulnerable face of the camp as a vote of confidence prefect i presume that if we come under attack youll consider yourselves invited to the party later dug in and fed their artillery placed around the camp and their watch fires set twice over to delude enemy scouts as to the size of their force until the camp seemed ablaze the troops sat uneasily in their tent parties and centuries mulling over the likelihood of action the next day the older men passed down their wisdom such as it was to the younger troops while officers and their chosen men circulated their commands each seeking in his own way to bolster their morale the circulation of officers was not restricted to the junior ranks either late in the evening legatus sollemnis walked into the tungrians lines a dozenman bodyguard walking about him with jealous eyes he clasped hands with equitius and joined him in the headquarters tent for a cup of wine so are your men ready for tomorrow well get our chance to measure our skills against theirs very soon now if i read the signs correctly signs didnt the camp prefect tell you sometimes i wonder how that man ever made it past centurion our cavalry scouts have the warband youve been following located and under close watch about ten thousand men strong theyve occupied an old hill fort but without their own scouts theyre blind and we have freedom of tactical manoeuvre i never thought id enjoy on hostile ground the original warband the one perennis located two days ago is still thirty miles distant and not showing any signs of moving yet its a chance to defeat the warbands piecemeal before they join together and one i intend to take with both hands we have the bastards that razed every fort on the north road in our grasp my friend and in the morning well give them a taste of the hammer and anvil he unrolled a rough handdrawn map of the area were here about ten miles from the barbarian camp tomorrow i shall send your five cohorts and four of my own under your command around their left flank by this route and send you into their rear i will take the main body of the legion forward in frontal attack with an approach to contact across this open area using these two large woods as cover for as long as possible calgus will find spears whichever way he turns and we shall have them bottled up for the slaughter equitius frowned its aggressive thats clear enough what about a reserve sollemnis nodded his understanding i know ive thought long and hard but for a start weve got the petriana and your formation will act as a reserve of sorts the simple truth is that this things balanced on a knifeedge we need to get at them before the first warband joins up and makes them too big to tackle without the other legions if we can exploit their lack of scouting ability to hit them without warning we can get the job done quickly and efficiently the other man frowned again uncomfortable at having to tell his friend his misgivings about the plan and youre basing all this on the reports of our scouts who presumably are still under the command of your senior tribune yes and the answer to your unspoken question is just as it was before do i trust him not to play a dangerous game once all this is over of course not but hes proved adept with his asturians better than the petriana since he took over the task to let licinius rest his men hes put me in a position to cripple this revolt with a single decisive blow and if i fail to take that opportunity ill find myself recalled to rome before you can say imperial death warrant for failing to put down barbarian uprising what would you do equitius nodded his agreement although his face lost little of its pensive cast if you want an honest opinion gaius id say its risky theres no proper reserve the advance to contact takes your force past two large woods that could hide thousands of men and its all based on reports from a man i wouldnt trust for a second but i take your point about the risks of delaying and if we catch them in the open without time to form up we can grind them to shreds between our shield walls its a risk but its one i have to take will you take it with me equitius put a hand on his friends shoulder looking hard into his eyes as if you even need to ask sollemnis nodded his lips pursed with gratitude and emotion thank you and now i would appreciate a tour of your unit youll understand that theres one officer in particular i would appreciate meeting if only briefly i havent seen the boy since he turned twelve apart from a brief meeting under difficult circumstances the prefect raised an eyebrow are you sure thats wise it might be better to let that sleeping dog lie i understand your concern look itll do your boys good to see that im out and about and ill only be with each century for a minute or two id just like to see him once more before we confront the barbarians by this time tomorrow one or both of us could be face down in the dirt id prefer to have seen my son the way i want to remember him rather than the way circumstances might force upon us please equitius relented shaking his head slightly being too damned persuasive got you that particular problem in the first place i seem to remember you always were too good at getting what you wanted ill have frontinius walk you around the cohort a brief tour of inspection dont give the lad any reason to suspect the truth though the last thing i need on the night before a major action is a centurion wondering whether his dead father really was his father wouldnt you agree the first spear met the legatus outside the cohorts command tent as bidden a few minutes later he saluted formally and then stood to attention legatus i believe you have requested a tour of my cohort sollemnis smiled at him waving a dismissive hand relax first spear i just want to see what state my troops are in for tomorrows fun and games we attack tomorrow sir without waiting for the other legions yes and ive just had this conversation with your prefect there are some aspects of the plan which are less than perfect but if we destroy this one warband then we can put calgus on the defensive and we might well find that a disheartened barbarian army melts away in the face of a successful outcome tomorrow frontinius kept his mouth shut and sollemnis sensing his disquiet extended a hand to point into the camp so shall we have a look at your men they walked into the camp heading for the closest watch fire as arranged at their last meeting before the warbands rampage to the south calgus went to the hill forts eastern entrance shortly after dark had fallen his army was gathered inside the tall earth ramparts wide perimeter taking full advantage of the protection afforded by the massive earthwork he had with some trepidation agreed to the roman traitors suggestion that he bring the warband to its fullest possible strength in this ancient place knowing that his army would be in deep trouble if the three enemy legions took them by surprise now he waited in the torchlit darkness with his bodyguard clustered close around him eager to see if the man was as good as his word after a few minutes wait a voice called softly out of the darkness bring him to me dont damage him four men walked forward into the night with torches finding perennis waiting for them fifty yards down the road his open hands raised to show that he was unarmed he walked back to where the barbarian leader waited seemingly as relaxed as ever despite the spears pointing at him from all angles calgus i see your hunger for victory has overwhelmed the risk that i might be leading you into a trap i have more than twenty thousand men at my back roman i doubt theres a trap you could spring that i couldnt batter to pieces perennis smiled the gesture half hidden in the torchlight i warned you a week ago that the southern legions were farther advanced in their progress than you believed now i can tell you that theyve reached the wall and are hurrying to join with the sixth legion once theyve joined your chance to take advantage of my plan will be at an end and you and i will be firm enemies rather than allies of convenience i estimate that you have until noon tomorrow in which to strike and no more time than that we must conclude our business quickly if youre not to find yourself rudely interrupted by the second and twentieth legions so whats it to be bloody victory or an ignominious retreat back into the hills you know you cant face them in open battle calgus turned away staring out into the darkness his features unreadable what do you propose even a single legion will cause my people grievous losses if i allow them to face us in line of battle with the support of their auxiliary cohorts have you brought my army here just to tell me weve no alternative but to run or give battle in the very way that has always resulted in our defeat because if you have the roman interrupted him impatiently i propose the ambush thats been in my mind since the first time i scouted this ground six months ago i propose your warriors taking the legion by surprise while its still deployed for the march that way you can strike from both sides and avoid the danger of the cohorts getting into line theres a place not far from here that fits the bill perfectly funnily enough later on in the evening with most of the troops bedded down if not actually sleeping and the legatus safely back among his own men equitius invited frontinius to join him in a cup of wine as was often their habit in the field they sat in the flickering lamplight and talked as friends the artificial restrictions of their ranks temporarily abandoned so what did sollemnis say while you were out walking the cohort with him frontinius took a sip of his wine after wed spoken to a couple of the centurions he asked me what i really thought about his intention to attack calgus tomorrow equitius grimaced and you said i told him that his role of late seems to consist mainly of putting my cohort in harms way equitius grimaced again ouch and what did he say to that he apologised for sending young marcus to us explained how he had no option under the circumstances then he asked what i thought of the boy i told him that it was an unfair question under the circumstances and that he should form his own opinions when he met him well we walked into the ninths area just after that got challenged very smartly had a chat with young two knives and a few of his men made our excuses and moved on we cant have been there for more than two or three minutes but it was enough for the legatus he stopped to wipe his eyes in the shadow of a tent when he spoke to me again he was obviously choked up by seeing his boy again and bearing in mind that he might not get to see him again that seemed understandable now prefect show me exactly what it is that our august leader plans for the morning he stared at the map spread across the table in front of them putting a finger on the position where the barbarian warband was reported to be camped theyre here as reported by the younger perennis yes hmm we break camp at dawn make a swift march to contact cant be more than six or seven miles and if theyre in the same place when we arrive it should be a reasonably straightforward fight unless they decide to run away our ten thousand men against their ten thousand men and us with the advantages of at least partial surprise and able to fight on our own terms yes although youve failed to guess one aspect of the plan he intends splitting his force into two parts hammer and anvil were not going to let them run away were going for a battle of annihilation frontiniuss eyebrows rose and you think thats wise risk them catching and defeating each of our smaller forces in turn hes set on it the fact that perenniss scouts have set the whole thing up for him doesnt leave him with much alternative from his point of view frontinius shook his head well that goes against the style of warfare that i was taught if it all goes right we could kill lots of barbarians tomorrow but if anything goes wrong if theyve moved since the last scout report or if theres more of them around that we havent found we could both be decorating calguss roof beams in a week or two id better go and treat this tired old body to a few hours sleep the legion and its supporting cohorts snatched a hasty breakfast in the dull grey light of dawn and were on the march less than thirty minutes after the sun had cleared the horizon taking another calculated risk sollemnis had decided that they would camp in the same place that evening and thus avoided the lost time of actually striking camp leaving their tents standing ready for the legions return the long column of men snaked north led by a detachment of the asturian cavalry who had returned from their place watching the warband late the previous night only perennis and a few picked men had remained in place and they would have pulled out at first light heading for a prearranged meeting point to provide the legatus with a lastminute briefing on the warbands dispositions while the tungrians were far back down the order of march back behind the ths last cohort equitius had ridden away with sollemniss officers to participate in the final orders group that would start once perennis and his scouts rejoined the column as the legion moved forward he stopped his horse for a moment to take the sight in turning in the saddle to stare back down the line of soldiers marching four abreast up the rough track that had been chosen as their approach route for the battle to come sollemnis ranged up alongside him his horse steaming slightly in the chilly dawn air he recognised a cohorts senior centurion and saluted gravely getting a brief nod and hurried salute back from the officer as he passed it isnt often youll see a whole legion bashing along this fast even on exercise the centurions have to lay the vine stick on pretty hard to get their boys really sweating and yet just look at them this morning the hardbitten legionaries were slogging past them at a pace reserved for those times when the legion needed to be somewhere else very quickly indeed and some of them were clearly already suffering from the exertion they had been forbidden to sing this morning for fear of making too much noise any song would in any case have quickly been blown out by their blistering pace equitius could already see faces in the ranks that were stretched by the effort of sucking in enough air to keep men and their sixtypound load of armour and weapons moving so quickly another century passed the officer ranging easily alongside his men with one eye on the road and the other on his people sparing a quick glance and a sardonic smile for the officers sitting comfortably on their horses other glances lacked the hint of humour and were simply surly in the face of such relative luxury my officers were about as happy with the prospect of todays battle as you were last night they also asked about our lack of a defined reserve and some of the senior centurions were quite vocal on the subject if anything goes wrong mars protect us therell be a long queue of them ready to testify that they warned me about the dangers equitius nodded sagely quite possibly including myself if you have the misfortune to end up with your head on the end of a spear but if we succeed ah if we succeed the old saying comes into play you know victory is a child with a thousand fathers so first father of todays triumph where are we holding the orders group before splitting into two forces two more miles up the road if perennis is at the spot hes chosen to meet us they rode on and as expected perennis was indeed waiting for them at the preordained place a fork in the road his asturians tarried a short distance away an evillooking decurion and half a dozen horsemen while he walked forward and saluted sollemnis with precision for a man who had spent the night at best rolled in his cloak and sleeping in a ditch he looked fresh and ready for the day legatus i have a report for you from the point of decision sollemnis nodded gesturing his officers to gather round before motioning perennis to begin sir the barbarian warband is still in the same location and apparently suspects nothing their strength is estimated at ten thousand men and when we left they were waking up for the day with cooking fires lit and no sign of preparation for combat if you still intend attacking i would say that our chances of success are almost total sollemnis looked at his other officers as he replied thank you tigidius perennis this is good news gentlemen i have decided to attack as we planned last night the first six cohorts of the sixth will advance in column across the open valley to the enemys front using the woods to the right and left as cover for the move this advance will be carried out at the battle march on my command we will deploy into battle line and assault the barbarian hill fort the legion artillery will accompany us and will provide support from the flanks if it can be deployed quickly enough at the same time the sixths remaining four cohorts plus our five auxiliary cohorts this force to be commanded by prefect equitius will advance around the right flank this force will take position ready to strike at the barbarian left and rear once the main force is engaged the signal for them to attack will be three loud trumpet blasts followed by the advance signal if the flank force is detected or sees anything to indicate an alerted enemy prefect equitius will sound three blasts followed by the stand fast signal and will deploy into line ready for battle in this case i will judge a response from the tactical situation to hand my intention is to draw the barbarians into a battle and then close the door behind them gentlemen were not just going to defeat this collection of savages masquerading as soldiers were going to rip them limb from limb tell your men that this is going to be a victory that theyll sing about for many years to come that is all his officers turned to go back to their places ah one more thing they turned back to face him again faces expectant i hear theres talk in the legion about what happened when the north road forts fell roman citizens soldiers and civilians tarred and torched and the gods only know what indignities carried out on them beforehand i expect that youve all heard men calling for equally harsh treatment to be given in return whenever we get the opportunity they waited expectantly i have to say that i agree wholeheartedly tell your commands that there will no mercy shown to any of the enemy attempting to surrender or escape any prisoners that are taken will be processed to my headquarters and will be crucified this evening their legs will not be broken and they will be left to die slowly with no exceptions save one if we take calgus alive hell be paraded through rome before he feels the stranglers cord tighten at his windpipe that is all equitius saddled up and rode back down the long column of resting legionaries most of them lying on their backs recovering from their exertions of the previous hour until he reached the th cohort and called for the senior centurions of the last four cohorts in the column with the officers gathered around him he confirmed the orders from sollemnis and told them to get their men moving the cohorts got ready to move without any of the shouting and chivvying usual in some legions their air of quiet determination and competence reassuring equitius that his temporary command would perform well enough when battle was joined the nine cohorts headed up the track past the remainder of the th past sollemnis who watched them pass with a pensive expression turning right at the fork on to another track if their scouts intelligence was correct this road would take them along the edge of the shallow valley through which the th would advance to battle round the barbarian left flank and into the position from which their attack could be launched equitius scanned the horizon until he saw the landmark hed been told to look for then reined his horse in alongside the senior centurion of the leading cohort head for that wood on the horizon and keep your eyes open for barbarian scouts if were compromised id rather have some time to do something about it im going back down the column for a chat with the auxiliaries if you get to the wood before im back up here break the march for a tenminute rest the other man nodded his understanding and equitius turned his horse to ride back down the column he found the tungrians sweating away in their place behind the last legionary cohort and rode alongside frontinius for a moment is the cohort ready his bald head beaded with moisture frontinius grimaced up at his superior as ready as well ever be lets just hope the scouts have got it right turning again equitius rode to the columns rear stopping to talk to his fellow prefects each of them was grimly determined their men looking much the same as did his own a combination of warlike posture and underlying nerves in the distance to their rear he could see the main force column snaking away from its rest position heading for the side of the nameless shallow valley back at the front of the column the wood was drawing closer and when it was less than half a mile away he spurred his horse forward to investigate before his men arrived the trees were silent and empty with no hint of an enemy presence and equitius climbed down from the horse to take in the scene in the valley below creeping cautiously to avoid making his silhouette stand out above the steadily brightening skyline the wood was positioned at the valleys head a small stream flowing down through it and across the almost flat expanse below two larger woods half filled the space one to his right half a mile distant down the slight slope the other half as much again to his left and he stared intently at them for a long moment if there were to be any threat to the ths approach march it would surely come from within the densely packed trees nothing moved indeed the landscape was preternaturally still without even birdsong and a vague sense of unease permeated his thinking as he watched the shadows imperceptibly shortening under the rising suns gaze he turned back to look for the approaching column and saw the leading troops less than four hundred paces distant remounted he cantered the horse across to them and ordered the senior centurion to rest his men there rather than risk having them appear on the skyline and alerting any zealous barbarian foot scouts as the first centuries fell out for their breather a party of horsemen came into view hurrying up the line of soldiers pursued by the inevitable obscene catcalls as the group approached he realised that it was perennis and his asturian escort headed by the glowering decurion the legion tribune rode up and without preamble or greeting launched into his orders a message from the legatus hes received new intelligence and has therefore changed the plan the sixth legion cohorts are detached from your command as are the second tungrian raetian aquitani and frisian cohorts i am to lead these units to form a blocking position to the rear of the main force while your cohort is to remain here and provide a watch on the woods to the right of the main line of march youre to keep the cohort well away from the valleys edge at least four hundred paces and you personally are commanded to watch the valley from cover any enemy movement to the rear of these woods which you will see before the main force is to be alerted to the legatus by the triple sounding of a trumpet followed by the stand fast signal as previously agreed equitius stared at the man in disbelief to change a battle plan halfway through the approach to contact was downright dangerous and went against everything that both he and sollemnis had been taught questions flooded his mind what new intelligence what could have changed so dramatically as to invalidate the original plan perennis looked at him with irritation and urgency pulling a tablet from the tunic beneath his armour prefect equitius i am neither granted the time nor ordered to explain whats going on time is of the essence now and i must carry out my orders without delay read this and you will see that my orders are lawful he wheeled his horse away calling to the th cohorts senior centurion decimus you old bastard get your grunts ready to march right now were heading to the west to get into position to guard the sixths backside the officer looked at equitius and shrugged entirely used to the legion way of doing business theyre legal orders right prefect equitius scanned the tablet carefully while the writing could have been anyones the mark of sollemniss seal was unmistakable yes first spear they are in that case sir well see you later seventh cohort on your feet the long column started moving again the line of march swinging back to the west as it reached the place where equitius was sitting unhappily on his horse the tungrians fell out of the column as they came up ten minutes later the other auxiliary prefects stopping briefly to sympathise as they passed and then the column was gone marching out of sight behind a small hill frontinius walked up to equitius with a perplexed expression all i heard was that we were to stay here what the fucks going on prefect equitius climbed down from his horse passing the message tablet to his deputy you tell me one moment were marching to take part in a pitched battle and massacre ten thousand bluefaced savages the next im standing here with my phallus in my hand just in case something that those scouts assured sollemnis couldnt happen does happen something smells very wrong here anyway youd better brief your officers pull the cohort back to four hundred yards from the crest ill stay here to watch the valley he walked unhappily away frontinius took a good look around taking in their new surroundings and then called marcus to him right centurion you can take a tent party and scout out that wood for me i want to be sure there are no nasty little surprises waiting for us in there and i want to know anything else thats worth knowing about it keep below the skyline and dont go anywhere near the edge of the trees i dont want anyone spotting you dismissed marcus gathered dubnus and a tent party to him leading them along the edge of the wood with deliberate care dubnus took the hunting bow hed found the previous day from its place on his back and nocked an arrow the cruel barbed head glinting in the sunshine close to the narrow stream that flowed down into the trees they found a path two men wide but showing no recent sign of passage by either boot or bare feet thorns and branches grew across it at intervals hunters path dubnus mused there must be a source of game near marcus took a look down through the archway of trees down a path that ran arrow straight to the thumbnailsized speck of daylight at the far end chosen youre best at this sort of thing scout forward for us cyclops you come with me to provide the chosen man with support if he needs it the rest of you squat down here and keep out of sight if i call get down this path as fast as you can and be ready to fight otherwise dont move dubnus slid into the trees deep shadow still covering the woods floor out of the thin early light the smell of pine needles filled the air and insects buzzed lazily at the intrusion he stepped softly down the path sweeping the arrows head slowly from side to side as if using the point to sense for enemies fifty yards down the path the wood was utterly silent the trees undisturbed by animal or breeze the exit at the far end of the path a coinsized arch of light something moved off to the right almost imperceptibly and the arrow tracked round to cover that arc holding steady as dubnus bent the bow back the last inches to its full tension with only two fingers stopping its explosive release of energy a hare bolted from cover weaving across the needlecoated floor twisted in midleap and fell to rest transfixed by three feet of hunting arrow marcus and cyclops following up ten yards behind breathed out long sighs of released tension dubnus plucked out another arrow and nocked it to the string in one fluid motion five paces from the paths end he stopped motioning the other men forward marcus squatted behind him peering over his shoulder through the arch of trees he could see most of the valley but was sure that they would be invisible inside the paths dark tunnel the long grass that grew across the valley waved in idle ripples in the gentle breeze while the trees in the large woods to right and left waved their branches fitfully dubnus stared intently at the scene something as yet unidentified nagging at his sense of what felt right to their left a sudden movement caught the eye men coming over the side of the valley and spilling out on to the slope a column of men moving fast and with purpose the sixth marcus nodded watching their progress while dubnus scanned the valley again his gaze coming back to the woods that were piquing his suspicion without providing a basis for real concern the legion ground across the valley at a fast pace almost running now centurions urging their men on with encouragement and imprecation desperate to close the distance and get into line knowing the vulnerability of a column in the face of a determined attack the woods rippled their branches blamelessly in the breeze catching his eye again and as he stared at them the realisation hit him with a force that turned his legs to stone for a long second the trees marcus looked over his shoulder seeing only massed greenery what look at the branches theyre in the fucking branches he leapt to his feet and sprinted back up the path leaving a bemused marcus looking for something his chosen man had spotted but he could not work out what it was then cyclops whistled low behind him the branches two knives theyre not moving together the bloody barbarians are in the trees this is the point of decision sir these next two or three minutes the th cohorts first spear wiped a hand across his sweatbeaded forehead his legs pounding away on the soft grass to keep up the legions pace sollemnis nodded gravely recognising the truth in the panted words a legion in column in close country was a notoriously vulnerable situation varus had proved it at the battle of the german forest by advancing three legions into a massive and wellprepared ambush by german tribesmen redhaired giants not unlike the present enemy and had paid with his own life and eighteen thousand other mens besides deployed into line the legion could quickly reorient to meet any threat could employ its disciplined fighting power against an enemy and exchange lives at a rate of three dead barbarians to one lost legionary in column with heavy cover to either side a clever enemy could attack the legions rear no matter which way the marching men turned to fight as long as perennis was right and they could reach the line of attack undetected all would be well he turned back to look down the marching column the th cohort had cleared the valley side the head of the column was now level with the wood to their left and was swinging to take full advantage of the cover of the one to their right five minutes id say then well be out of the cover of that wood and start deploying hed ordered that the column break out into two threecohortlong lines four men deep with the rearmost line ready to feed men into the grinder as barbarian axes and swords progressively ate into the front ranks anyone from the front rank that survives the day will be awarded the assault medal with ten thousand barbarians to hack through and a hill fort to storm id say theyll have earned it his senior centurion nodded agreement the defeated barbarians were likely to fall back into their fort and even with the bolt throwers set up on the flanks a few hundred yards back spitting their footlong bolts into the hill fort to discourage the barbarian archers it was going to be an unpleasant day for the men going face to face with the warband the columns head was approaching the righthand wood now three minutes of vulnerability left and then hed take a victory that would stamp out this rebellion and put fear into the barbarians that would keep them quiet north of the wall for another generation calgus if he were taken alive would be carried off in chains and paraded in front of the emperor before a staged execution if not his head would have to do he knew of native scouts who understood the art of preserving a dead mans head for years and he would have perennis take it to commodus with the ths legions badge stamped on to the dead mans forehead cement his place in imperial favour and kill the rumours of disloyalty for good he smiled to himself at the image perhaps he ought to have perennis dealt with too from the ridgeline to the north of the advancing legion cohorts a trumpet note sounded catching the attention of every man in the column repeated itself then sounded a third time the note switching into the stand fast call and making his guts contract it was the signal that hed ordered equitius to give if they were detected or found an alerted enemy but it was coming from the wrong place with a sudden rattling hammer of iron against armour plate hundreds of arrows ripped into the legions ranks dropping dozens of unprepared legionaries in writhing agony or sudden death the column dithered for a moment another rain of arrows striking home and this time sollemnis saw what hed missed in the surprise of the first volley that they were being fired from above head height negating the defensive protection of the legionaries shields a legionary near him spun and fell an arrow lodged deep in his throat another jerking and then toppling stiffly backwards to the ground with a feathered shaft protruding between the cheekpieces of his helmet the hissing passage of an arrow past his left ear warned that he was the archers target theyre in the trees at least one centurion had come to the same conclusion and several centuries started to form testudos shields held to side and overhead to frustrate the attacks getting ready to charge into the trees and dig out the barbarian archers at close quarters then as the situation started to stabilise after the first shock of attack a thick wave of tribesmen bounded from the woods to either side of the stalled column with a berserk howl that lifted the hairs on the back of the legatuss neck pouring out of their cover in an apparently unending stream of rage to charge into the nearest cohorts swinging swords and axes with hatefuelled ferocity the barbarians smashed into the unformed line in an instant exploding the legions carefully trained fighting tactic of shield wall and stabbing sword into thousands of individual duels sollemnis knew only too well that these were fights in which an infantryman armed with a short infantrypattern sword was at a disadvantage faced with a weapon of twice the length he regained his wits drew his sword and bellowed above the din defensive circles form defensive circles the flank force will take them in the rear if we can defend long enough the th cohorts senior centurion his men suffering under the iron rain of barbarian arrows but as yet not engaged bellowed to his officers to follow the order and sollemnis walked into the protection of their shields with his bodyguard as the circle closed looking across the battlefield to see two other cohorts fighting to achieve the same result under a press of barbarian attackers the rest of the legion was already fighting in broken order with little hope of regaining any meaningful formation before the battles end inside the circle a dozen wounded legionaries were being seen to by the cohorts medical officer most with arrows protruding from their throats and faces the medic looked closely at a stricken chosen man took gauge of the wounds severity shook his head decisively and moved on to the next casualty the dying man with an arrows shaft sticking out of his neck and blood jetting from the wound put a shuddering hand to his swords hilt half drew the weapon then stopped moving as the life ran out of him sollemnis wrenched his eyes from the scene striding to the first spear the veteran soldier was calmly scanning the battle around them with a professional eye looking for an advantage despite their desperate situation situation theres more than ten thousand men out there more like twenty weve been had looks like the last three cohorts are already in pieces ourselves the fifth and sixth managed to get into defensive formations but once the others have been polished off theyll make short enough work of us or just stand off and let their archers pepper us until were too weak to resist if the flanking force doesnt get stuck in soon were all going to die the legions eagle standardbearer stood close his own sword drawn clearly determined to sell his own life in defence of the emperors eagle an arrow clattered off his helmet another hitting the standards eagle with a hollow thwock making the man duck reflexively his eyebrows raised at his legatus in mute comment sollemnis nodded grimly then turned to stare up at the ridgeline where the alarm signal had sounded a few figures stood silhouetted on the crest apparently watching the battle below the standardbearer a man of seniority in the legion and well known to the legatus pushed his way to sollemniss side disdaining the stream of arrows directed at the eagle why dont they attack sir theres another nine cohorts up there and in good order the legatus shook his head in puzzlement hearing the screams of his commands dismemberment from all around i dont know but how tigidius perennis and his asturians scouted this ground as safe for the approach is a sudden insight gripped his guts hard testing his sphincter with a sudden push that he barely managed to control perennis of course the other warband had clearly never stayed in place as hed been briefed the brazen lie tempting him into a move whose audacity would clearly be judged as suicidal with the luxury of hindsight he drew his sword and picked up a dead mans shield tugging down his ornate helmet to be sure the back of his neck was protected very well gentlemen if were going to die today lets make sure we give these bluefaced bastards a decent fight to sing about wounds of honour sixth legion wounds of honour watching the slaughter below equitius shook his head with fascinated horror there must be something we can do frontinius replied in tones dulled by resignation to the facts yes we can parade on the crest and in all likelihood the men down there will look up laugh at us and get on with butchering the sixth or we can advance down the slope into the battle and be dead inside ten minutes youre looking at a doomed legion prefect something few men have seen and even fewer have lived to describe the sixths standard will be carried away into the northern mountains and become an object of wonder for the tribes most likely with your friend sollemniss head to accompany it he made the decision to attack across that valley he changed our role at the critical moment now hes paying for those mistakes the hard way equitius nodded unhappily i just dont see how he could have got it so wrong the man was a senior tribune in the war against the marcomani took command of a legion with a battlefield promotion when his legatus dropped dead in the middle of an action and fought them brilliantly to rout twice his own strength of barbarians it isnt a mistake he ended up running northern command so how the bloody hell do we end up with this the ths remaining three cohorts were creeping together now under attack by thousands of barbarians and seeking to combine their strengths a horn sounded and the attackers drew back from combat leaving the field clear for their archers to pour arrows into the compressed masses of legionaries after a dozen volleys from the archers the horn sounded twice more and the britons charged in again swords and axes glinting brightly in the morning sun as they went about their destructive work even at that distance the smell of blood and faeces was now reaching the watching soldiers as the scale of the slaughter mounted equitius heard the sound of approaching hoofs and turned to see perennis and his escort approaching again the tribune reined his horse in and took in the view from the valleys edge for a moment before speaking well well it would seem that our legatus has got himself into a bit of a pickle equitius stared up at him with narrowed eyes seeing the sardonic smile playing about his face shouldnt you be worrying about bringing up the reinforcements tribune the other man sat back in his saddle sharing an amused glance with the decurion it might have made a difference when the barbarians first attacked a few thousand armed men piling down into the battle from up here but not now thank you prefect equitius those six cohorts are all but finished and i dont think that tossing another nine after them would be a particularly positive step do you at least this way i still have most of a legions strength to command until the reinforcements arrive from gaul you a junior tribune an equestrian in command of a legion oh yes didnt i mention my imperial warrant he reached into a pocket and pulled out a scroll tossing it down to equitius the prefect read it taking in the imperial seal and the wide range of power it bestowed upon perennis i particularly like the sentence that says i should take command of the sixth legion should legatus sollemnis be found incapable of his task id say hell reach a state of incapability some time quite soon so while i may not be of senatorial class i will be exercising the power granted to me by the emperor frontinius leaned over to marcus muttering quietly into his ear get yourself back over to the cohort be ready to bring your century over here in a hurry and so from this moment im assuming command ill incorporate the auxiliary cohorts into my legion to bolster our strength but not your cohort prefect you and your people have a special place in my plans stay where you are marcus valerius aquila no trying to creep away when you think nobodys looking marcus stopped turning slowly to look up at perennis yes ive known that you took refuge with these halfsavages and their disloyal prefect for a while now your supply officer was very forthcoming one night in the camp at cauldron pool when the decurion here applied the tip of a dagger to his throat did you really think that you could hide with these bumpkins for ever all that youve done is bring your own disaster down on this entire cohort just as legatus sollemnis has paid the ultimate price for his treacherous attempt to hide you so will this collection of semibarbarian traitors dubnus put a hand behind his back and muttered the word axe quietly over his shoulder to cyclops the weapon slid from its place in the small of his back the handle slapping unnoticed on to his palm its comfortingly familiar wood rubbed smooth by years of handling perennis nodded to the stonefaced decurion who jumped down from his horse and drew his sword the other cavalrymen watched intently arrows nocked to their bows ignoring the single tent party of men standing in a huddle to their left perennis leant out of his saddle pointing towards the wood that marcus and his men had recently scouted and now gentlemen your orders the first tungrians will establish a defensive position on the slope below that wood and prevent the barbarians from breaking out of the valley by that route for as long as possible there is to be no retreat from the position which must be held at all costs and to the last man you first spear will command the cohort since i am now declaring a sentence of death on your prefect for his treachery in harbouring an enemy of the emperor and the state i could be more thorough in my punishment but the rest of you will obviously be dead soon enough equitius scowled up at perennis full realisation of the true nature of the last hours events striking him youve just thrown six legion cohorts into a barbarian trap to get rid of one man that was in your way and now youll casually toss away eight hundred more spears because one innocent victim of romes descent into despotism takes shelter among them perennis smiled broadly your friend sollemnis is reaping the crop hes sown and so will you all soon enough the rest is detail well go on the defensive for a while rome will send in a legion or two from gaul the sixth will be reinforced back to full strength and all will be as it should be besides youve got more pressing matters to worry about decurion execute the prefect frontinius half drew his sword stopping as half a dozen drawn bows swung in his direction equitius put his hands on his hips and straightened his back in readiness the decurion took a step forward raising his long cavalry sword for the executioners blow before his eyes widened with shock as dubnuss throwing axe smashed into his back the heavy axe blades weight punched through his armour chopping through his spine and into the organs clustered behind it a gout of blood spilled from his open mouth in a scarlet flood as he sank forward on to his knees his hands helplessly seeking the source of the sudden rush of enervating pain before any of the cavalrymen could react dubnus was among them his sword flashing as he struck at one and then another marcus and frontinius drew their swords and charged in alongside him one of the horsemen loosed an arrow at frontinius the missiles iron head flicking off his helmet just as marcus hacked at the mans leg with a fierce downward cut his sword severing the limb just above the knee and chopping into the horses ribs with the force of the blow the animal reared up tossing the crippled cavalryman from his horned saddle then kicked out hard with its back legs in protest at the pain catapulting another asturian from his mount with his chest caved in marcus was knocked to one side as cyclops jumped in front of him raising his shield to block an arrow from a horseman the young centurion had failed to notice in the melee at less than twenty paces range the missile punched through his shields layered wood and leather the iron head transfixing his shield arm and drawing an agonised grimace from the oneeyed soldier pivoting on his left leg with a swelling bellow of rage cyclops slung his spear with deadly accuracy into the horsemans chest as he reached back for another arrow the throws huge power punched through a weak point in the cavalrymans mail shirt scattering a handful of broken rings from the point of impact and thrusting the spears steel point deep into the horsemans lungs eyes rolling upwards he fell backwards over the side of his horse and vanished under the hoofs of the horses surrounding him cyclops pointed to his one good eye shouting over the fights swelling volume less stabbing and more looking young sir he drew his sword nodding to marcus before charging into the whirling melee in search of another target for his wrath perennis kicked his horses sides hard galloping out of the knot of infantrymen which was growing bigger and nastier by the second as the rest of the tent party took on the asturians with their spears he was thirty paces distant when dubnuss arrow slammed through the back of his neck an inch above the top of his cuirasss protection and stayed in the saddle for another five seconds before collapsing stiffly over its hindquarters to land in a heap on the turf the few remaining asturians bolted thrashing their horses to escape as the fastest of the th centurys men arrived on the scene seeking targets for their unblooded spears marcus was the first man to reach perennis coming up short when he saw the arrowhead protruding from the tribunes throat and the mans desperate attempts to breathe frontinius ran up a moment later took one look and turned away with a grim smile hes got two minutes five at the best say hello to the ferryman for us perennis youll be across the river a while before we get there equitius walked up to them a haunted look on his face frontinius slapped him on the arm cheer up prefect it isnt every day that youre condemned to death and then reprieved inside a minute not such a reprieve first spear i his head lifted as he spotted a movement in the middle distance horsemen moving through the waving grass a long white banner twisting proudly in the breeze he smiled wanly at the sight i see licinius retains his impeccable sense of timing a single decurius of the petriana rode up to them prefect licinius dismounting before his horse had stopped moving grim faced he stared down at the fighting below for a moment before turning back to speak taking in the scene in front of him as he did gentlemen i the sight of the slowly choking perennis left him speechless for a moment who shot him frontinius shook his head imperceptibly at his prefect before speaking we did sir or rather one of my men whos a finer shot than ill ever be did and at my command tribune perennis had just admitted to an act of stupidity and treason whose result you can see down there and was attempting to murder prefect equitius licinius looked around him carefully fully digesting the scene which would explain the dead asturians scattered around not to mention the fact that several of your own men seem to have arrow wounds sir you can imagine how thats going to look if its reported back to rome where is the legatus by the way equitius stepped forward pointing down the slope hes down there licinius that young bastard suborned the asturians or at least enough of them to be able to carry out his plan he must have passed a message to calgus in some way while he was supposed to be shadowing the warband they let the sixth get into the open and then rushed them while the legion was still in column hes got some sort of warrant straight from the imperial palace empowers him to take command of the sixth if necessary so the bastard wanted to make sure sollemnis wouldnt survive licinius leaned in close and half whispered his next question glancing significantly at the unsuspecting marcus who was busy with his wounded does he know yet equitius shook his head no nor should he under the circumstances agreed what a fucking mess so apart from the fact that half a legion is being taken apart under our gaze whats the local situation equitius pointed in the direction that perennis had taken his command four cohorts of the sixth the second tungrians raetians frisians and the aquitani are somewhere over in that direction they were supposed to be the other half of a plan to attack the warband but bloody perennis took them away to where theyd be no use when this happened licinius pursed his lips my boys are half an hours ride back that way and i met a messenger a while back who said the second and the twentieth are ten miles down the main road the only problem is that that lot will have gutted the sixth and buggered off into the hills long before we can bring them into the action he walked to the edge of the slope and stared down for a long moment equitius sighed deeply and followed him licinius before my tame brigantian prince demonstrated his marksmanship with the hunting bow on perennis the little shit ordered us to make a stand on the slope here just in front of this wood he wanted to destroy us for harbouring the boy you understand but in his desire to see us all dead he actually issued the only order appropriate under the circumstances an order that i and my men will follow if you ask it of us licinius turned to face him youll likely all be dead within the hour unless i get lucky and find the other legions a lot closer than they ought to be equitius returned his gaze and you think that these men dont know the meaning of a roman soldiers honour licinius looked him straight in the eye seeing the other mans resolve in his steady stare my apologies to your command very well he walked quickly across to where perennis lay panting his last few breaths searching his body with swift efficiency until he found the imperial warrant scroll then leant over to speak into the dying mans eyes listen to me titus tigidius perennis you thought what you were doing was clever that the emperor would thank you for removing a traitor from imperial service you might well have been right your father however may not be so sanguine at the loss of his familys honour i will make it my sworn task to make sure the full story reaches rome to tell him how you connived to destroy half a legion and how when the time came another full cohort volunteered to face the same barbarians and give me a fighting chance to take revenge for those betrayed men and how i executed you to avoid your suffering anything that might be said to resemble an honourable death he drew his dagger and slit the dying tribunes throat wide open watching with satisfaction as life ebbed away from perenniss amazed eyes well that at least feels a little better prefect im off to find the other two legions best of luck he stood up and saluted equitius who gravely returned the gesture then vaulted back on to his horse and rode furiously away barking orders at his men the prefect watched him go for a moment then turned to address frontinius well sextus now its our turn to earn our corn the first spear smiled grimly dont think im immune to the irony of our situation prefect young perennis should be laughing now wherever he is equitius put a hand on his shoulder wherever he is first spear were quite likely to see at first hand soon enough frontinius led his centurions down the hunters path at the trot in a minute or so their centuries would follow them down the through the trees and in those few seconds he needed to lay the foundations of a successful defence if he mused humourlessly while his mind worked on their options for defending an apparently hopeless position the entire cohort not simply dying in the first barbarian assault could be termed a success ten yards from the forests edge he stopped and gathered his officers around him their faces betraying the same grim determination fixed in his own mind brothers there isnt time for any inspirational stuff or exhortations to heroism put simply weve been sent to fight and likely to die in order to buy time for the other legions to jump those bluenosed bastards from behind and put it to them the oldfashioned way your men are going to realise that soon enough when they see thousands of men coming up the hill for their heads they will look to you for an example give them one show them a grim face but not despair lead your centuries with aggression but keep them disciplined if we do this right we can still pull a victory out of this disaster but that depends solely on us we are now the most important ten men on this battlefield so lets live up to that burden in the next hour he paused looking at each man to take a gauge of their resolve good enough orders the cohort will come down this path in number order with the fifth at the rear and the ninth in their place in the centre the prefect will make sure of that take your centuries down the slope to the line i point out to you and set up for defence two men deep and no more threefoot spacing per man were lucky that the wood curves down on both sides to meet our flanks so we can anchor the line off the trees get the ground in front of you dirty as quickly as possible and get your caltrops out straight after that speaking of trees bear the big man stepped forward your axemen will be last down the path take them to left and right and make me an abatis as fast as you can three rows of fallen trees deep all the way from each end of the line back round to the path but leave the path clear of obstruction when the obstacles are in place widen the path enough to let four men down it abreast in the unlikely event of our being reinforced id like the way in behind us wide enough for a cohort to move down it at speed everyone clear and remember brothers win or lose this day will be sung about long after the rain washes our blood away lets make it a story worth telling the tungrians exploded out of the wood on to the open ground the centuries hurrying down to the line pointed out by frontinius as they cleared the trees the first spear barked at his centurions to speed up their deployment as he pointed each century to its place aware that the tribesmen pausing in their assault on the shrinking remnant of the sixth legion to watch the new development could turn and charge towards them at any second the wood behind the cohort echoed with the growing racket of eighty axes working furiously on the treefelling that would defend their flanks and rear each tree was under attack by two of the th centurys men as they laboured with expert blows to drop it neatly into position with its branches facing outwards presenting an impassable obstacle once the line was established each end anchored in the trees to either side as the wood curved around their defence he gave a small sigh of relief and shouted his next command get that slope dirtied up the cohorts long line marched a dozen paces down the gentle slope then stopped the troops fishing under their groin protectors to urinate on to the grass selected men ran to the small stream that ran through their new position and filled their helmets with water carrying the load carefully back to their places in the line before emptying the liquid on to the ground on command they stamped and twisted with their hobnailed boots digging at the wet ground beneath their feet ignoring the spray of acidicsmelling mud that spattered their lower legs and retreating gradually back towards their former positions to leave a fiveyard strip of ground in front of their line an oozing mess frontinius ignored the drama taking place below them as the th legions surviving troops huddled into three ever dwindling groups with the ground to their front made treacherously slippery he called for the last element of their defence obstacles and tribuli the centuries mustered the heavy fivefootlong staves each man had carried from the camp each one sharpened to a firehardened point at both ends and lashed them into giant obstacles each formed of three stakes tied together with rope bags full of the small iron tribuli were strewn around the obstacles presenting sharp points to the feet of the unwary attacker julius standing with his th century behind the main line of defence both escort to the cohorts standard and tactical reserve turned to speak to his chosen man you can keep an eye on this lot im going down to the front to get a better view and have a chat with my young roman friend i see no reason why he should get all the fun he strode down the slope clapping an arm around marcuss shoulders and pointing out across the warbands presently scattered force lowering his head to the younger mans ear he spoke quietly a gentle smile on his face well centurion there they are twenty thousand angry bluefaced men who will very shortly come up this buttock of a hill to take our heads are you ready to die with your men marcus nodded grimly ready enough but before they take my head ill send a good number to meet cocidius before me julius laughed slapping him delightedly on the back and you dont mind if i stay for the fun i cant stand being stuck back guarding that bloody statue while you get all the glory and i might be of some use when the shit starts flying marcus nodded but raised a finger in mock admonishment as long as you contain your contribution to swordplay and the occasional piece of advice its a deal if you want to command the scout century make sure you come second in the competition next year a horn sounded far out across the battlefield and the milling tribesmen hacking at the remnants of the th legions cohorts pulled back in temporary truce silence gradually fell across the field the panting britons taking an opportunity to get their breath tend to their wounded and remove their dead and dying from the bloodied grass trapped behind the unmoving wall of tribesmen the remaining legionaries did what they could for their own wounded little enough in the circumstances sollemnis squinted up the hill over the heads of the barbarians surrounding what was left of his command making out the auxiliary cohort arrayed in defence across its slope he tapped his first spear on the shoulder pointing at the tungrians what what do you think theyre about up there the other man grimaced as he drew breath the broken shaft of an arrow protruding through his armour from his abdomen the price of taking his turn in the cohorts rapidly contracting perimeter youve got me looks like a suicide mission well be welcoming them to hades soon enough sollemnis laughed grimly hefting his sword no doubt about that these bastards are just having a breather theyll be back for our heads once theyve got their wind back he glanced about him i need to hide this sword hope that it stays concealed from the bluenoses those are tungrians up there i can see their banner my sons up there with them and if he lives i want it found and passed to him the other man nodded blankly too shocked to wonder at the legates revelation sollemnis took up a dead soldiers gladius testing its balance this should serve well enough so many dead men the first spear coughed painfully and pointed to their dead standardbearer an arrow had ripped into the mans windpipe a few moments before dropping him to his knees as he choked out his life the eagle standard still stood proud above his corpse gripped in lifeless fingers youd best stick your sword under haruss body yes that ought to do it theyll take the eagle but likely leave his head if you strip away his bearskin unlike you and me well go to our graves in separate pieces sollemnis smiled again with genuine amusement this time it seems were to be collectors items then roman officers heads no mud hut should be without one a horn rang out with a sudden bray that jerked their attention back to the warband surrounding them the warriors charged into their pathetic remnant with a revived purpose their swords rising and falling in flashing arcs as they butchered the exhausted survivors of the th legions cohorts seeing the man in front of him go down under a powerful swordblow that cleaved his right arm at the shoulder sollemnis stepped into the fight alongside the few men of his bodyguard still standing with a snarl of frustration striking fast and hard at the man responsible and tasting brief satisfaction as the mans blood sprayed across his cuirass the feeling was short lived his appearance marking him out as a senior officer to the men facing him he landed one more blow putting his gladius deep into the chest of another warrior before the mans comrade thrust a spear deep into his unprotected thigh the first spear already felled by a sword thrust into his spine and numbly inert as the barbarians fought to strip him of his fine armour while his life ebbed away into the puddle of blood soaking the ground around him watched the scene with the unique detachment of a dying man sollemnis went down on one knee helpless to defend himself as the warriors around him gathered for the kill a sword skidded off his cuirass and sliced into the meat of his right arm and a vicious blow from a club cracked the elbow joint and left his borrowed sword dangling useless at his side hes mine a loud voice sounded over their clamour a magnificently armoured giant of a man stepping out of the attackers midst and calling a halt to their attacks with a simple bellowed command he batted aside a despairing swordthrust from the last of the legatuss bodyguard with his huge round shield contemptuously smashing the exhausted man to the ground with another punch of the shields heavy boss and stabbing down into the space between his helmets cheekpieces the other warriors backed away clearly too scared of the man to deny him the moment of triumph his helmet and armour were coal black inlaid with intricate silver patterns befitting his obvious status as a tribal champion heavy iron greaves protecting his thighs and calves to make him almost invulnerable as long as he could carry the weight only his booted feet lacked protection sollemnis teetered on the brink of falling on to his face only willpower keeping him on his knees as he looked up into the swordsmans face go on then get it over with ybastard his voice was no more than a croak the words bringing a smile to the big warriors face he hefted his sword in flashing arcs luxuriating in the pleasure of letting the legatus see what was coming for a long moment before swinging the blade to sever sollemniss head from his shoulders a warrior retrieved the grisly trophy and carried it back to the legatuss killer as the romans headless torso toppled slowly sideways to the bloody grass as the first spears consciousness slipped from his faltering grasp he saw the big man lift the legions eagle standard from the standardbearers lifeless fingers stamping down on the standard to separate the spreadwinged symbol of imperial power from its pole he tossed the broken shaft away took the foothigh statue by one wing and stalked away from the legatuss headless corpse back into the warbands seething mass of men as the cohort stood helplessly and watched the final destruction of their beleaguered colleagues in the valley below them a keeneyed tungrian called out a sighting pointing at the valleys far slope there made tiny by the distance moved a party of three war chariots accompanied by some fifty native cavalry cantering steadily across the battlefield a great dragon banner flew proudly in the wind of their passage its forked tail whipping eagerly from side to side the prefect stared out at the oncoming horsemen raising his eyebrows in question the infamous calgus coming for a look frontinius snorted probably wondering whats going on i doubt perennis actually told him that he intended to send us to our doom here and were on rising ground and in good order eight hundred spears could make a mediumsized mess of his warband before they roll over us and slow up his next move if hes the strategist i believe him to be hell be worried keen to take his prizes and get his men away before second and twentieth legions come over the horizon baying for blood id suggest that we might look a little more confident just to reinforce that nagging doubt perhaps we could make some noise equitius smiled hail calgus those about to die salute you something like that very well trumpeter sound prepare for defence the notes sang out sweetly hanging for a moment over the hill piercing the continual hammering of axes after the shortest of pauses frontinius heard his centurions shouting their commands then the soft rattle of spears being readied frontinius strode forward in front of the cohort as was his right drawing his sword and raising it above his head polished steel shining in the midmorning sun then turned back to face the ranks of grimfaced soldiers he swung the weapon down to waist height rapping the blades flat on to his shields scarred surface repeating the blow to establish a slow but steady rhythm that was easy for the soldiers to follow as they rapped their spears against the metal bosses of their shields the noise built quickly until the pulses of sound echoed distantly back from the slopes about them a basic intimidating noise that put heart back into the more timid troops and swelled the anger of the rest as they stood and waited for the chariots and horsemen to draw close the dragon banner snaked across the valley floor drooping limply back on to its standard as the horsemen came to a halt two hundred paces from the tungrian line after a moment a rider came forward cantering within shouting distance and then stopping to stare across the lines of hardfaced leanframed soldiers before calling out his message over their noise the lord calgus suggests negotiation man to man no others to attend safety is guaranteed he wheeled his horse riding back to the knot of barbarian cavalry without a backwards glance frontinius glanced over at the prefect seeing the romans jawline tighten as his lips pursed to a white line well prefect shall we go and meet the man that tarred and torched the inhabitants of fort habitus and roaring river the prefect stared at the distant dragon banner fitfully prancing in the gusts above his enemys bodyguard for a long moment before responding putting a hand on his first spears shoulder the invitation was for one ill go youll stay here and lead the cohort if this should be some sort of device to distract us or to capture a senior officer and if it is ill probably be joining my father rather sooner than ive previously thought would be the case as might the lord calgus he walked on down the slope watching his step on the treacherous strip of glutinous mud and stepping carefully to avoid the tribulis eager spikes and came to a stop halfway between his own troops and those of his enemy a figure had stepped from their ranks as he had and paced towards the field towards him carrying a bundle wrapped in a bloodied blanket until they were close enough for spoken conversation although beyond swordthrust they stared at each other for a moment the prefect eying the other mans bundle with unhappy certainty as to its contents until the briton chose to break the silence his latin unaccented well then prefect i am calgus lord of the northern tribes i broke the wall i despoiled your forts from three mountains all the way south to noisy valley and i pointing a thumb back over his shoulder caught your legatus in a trap of my careful making with his legion and now i have something to show you he allowed the bundle to fall open its contents dropping to the grass at his feet the highly polished bronze eagle from the th legions standard gleamed prettily in the morning sun its defiant spreadwinged pose incongruous under the circumstances while the helmeted head rolled slowly across the grass and came to a stop on its side sollemniss dead stare facing out towards the waiting tungrians equitius sank to his haunches staring intently into his friends lifeless eyes calgus put his hands on his hips and waited for a response while the prefect took a long moment before rising silently to his feet the roman nodded still staring down at his friends severed head his face stony then lifted his gaze to stare back at the waiting briton this man was my friend for more years than i care to recall we drank together chased women together in our younger days and we fought romes enemies together too men like you we tasted the barbarity of combat with men like you and we rose above it we kept our humanity but we always won those battles by doing whatever we had to so if youre hoping to unman me with this display youre going to be disappointed its nothing less than i expected and nothing less than i would have done in your place but it changes nothing he took a deep breath and squared his shoulders so calgus lets get this over with i am prefect septimus equitius of the st tungrian cohort i found your cattle in front of the hill and burned them to deny your men their flesh and prevent your attack on my fortress i lured your cavalry from the cover of the forest for the petriana to destroy and i and he in turn pointed back over his own shoulder am going to keep your warband here for long enough that the rest of our army will fall on them and utterly destroy them tungrians tungria lies over the water prefect closer to gaul than to britain those men are brigantes my people not yours i think youll find otherwise if youre unwise enough to send warriors up that slope to meet them local born they may be but their training and discipline are roman i think you know what that means they shared a quiet smile a spark of communication across the windwhipped ground the prefect pulled his cloak tighter about him seeking to keep out the winds questing fingers come on calgus lets drop the bombast youre an educated man roman educated if the stories are true i dont think you believe in shouting insults and arseslapping any more than i do the other man nodded his face staying neutral go on in truth i am more impressed than i expected to be your control of those tribesmen is better than ive seen before and your recruitment of a roman tribune to lure his legatus into your grasp was a clever stroke or more likely he recruited you eh equitius paused for a moment allowing the fact of his knowledge of perenniss treachery to sink in calguss green eyes narrowed with unasked questions so now that weve established that youve done a reasonable job so far lets get down to business you could just have sent that rabble to die on our swords but you chose to talk first and while id like to think thats because our reputation goes before us calgus smiled again shaking his head in amusement never let it be said you lacked a sense of humour prefect of the first tungrians i came to offer you the chance to leave this battlefield intact before you force me to send my men to slaughter yours will you save those lives my aims in making this war have always been limited to the goal of a negotiated peace with rome certain reasonable concessions for my people and honour for both sides after all without a settlement this war could last for several campaigning seasons and consume tens of thousands of roman lives soldiers and innocents both this victory combined with the threat my warbands pose to the frontier should be enough to bring your governor to the negotiating table our demands are simple enough and do not threaten an inch of roman territory so there should be no need for further loss of life after all i am as you suggest an educated and civilised man at heart the prefect wondered what the tribes demands were if not for some retreat from the frontier money in tribute and improved trading terms probably removal of all roman troops from their forts north of the wall for a certainty so you ask me to walk away from the fight and let you away from this place before the other two legions and the rest of the sixth arrive i think not calgus i think you know that the time youll need to break my line greatly increases the chance of our being rescued and by overwhelming force at the least we can buy your deaths with our own i think you know you already have the victory and want to save your own mens lives for another fight you know there are other legions out there but you dont know where because you havent got any mounted scouts to send out your mounted bodyguard alone wouldnt stand a chance not with the petriana roaming about looking for heads without that knowledge and now that i have your traitor you know you should disengage and get away cleanly but id guess that the tribal leaders wont let you walk away from a fight this unbalanced if we dont leave the field we force you to fight just by standing there true the briton smiled easily gesturing back towards his waiting warriors perhaps the one certainty is that if you and your men dont leave immediately then you will shortly pay the price for frustrating the will of a man with twenty times as many warriors as your entire cohort musters think about that while you walk back to your command you have a few minutes in which to spare us both further spilt blood otherwise the next time we meet your head will be stuck on a spears point the prefect nodded solemnly perhaps but youll have climbed a high wall of your own dead to enjoy the sight calgus walked back to his bodyguard his mind moving over the calculations he guessed at ten centuries in the tungrian line a full cohort given time they would make the thin lines flanks impossible to turn protected by impassable barricades of hastily felled trees and rows of sloping wooden spikes to impale the unwary attacker attack now or pull his men away to safety the victory already under his belt and a roman legatuss probably dead he stopped and looked up at the tungrian line again musing on the grim faces that had stared back at him his own people so familiar obdurate in defence incandescent in assault but with the overlay of roman discipline to temper their courage which made each one of them the equal of his best warriors in terms of simple killing power the difference the key difference was that no matter what the provocation the situation little would persuade them to break their wall of shields from behind which their short stabbing swords would flicker like the tongues of hundreds of deadly snakes refusing to enter the chaotic swirl of mantoman combat the tungrians could afford to fight several times their number the more numerous enemy without any means of applying that superiority in numbers just one cohort though eight hundred men against thousands of his own how long could that take even if he lost as many as he killed or even twice as many it was an exchange that made more than adequate sense he walked on jumping back into his chariot as he reached his bodyguard eyes turned to him awaiting his command the men ready to put their lives at risk they will not withdraw their prefect was disappointingly resolute aed raised his eyebrows indicating a desire to speak then we must fight my lord no warrior will willingly walk away from that many heads begging to be taken besides many are not yet blooded i agree but it must be fast the roman spoke of other legions and at the very least the other cohorts commanded by their legatus must be close at hand and their bloody petriana too handled properly their cavalry and even one full legion could carve us to ribbons if they caught us here even though we would be more than twice their number send a rider to emer and cataluss warbands theyve stood and watched the others kill romans they must be raring to get into the fight the tribal bands moved forward at the run eager after watching their fellows rip the guts out of the hopelessly outnumbered cohorts the younger men joshed each other as they ran boasting breathlessly of the heads they would take the older warriors straining to catch a glimpse of their adversaries and take their measure the two leaders met as they ran agreeing swiftly on a simple left and right split nothing fancy in the amount of time they had a straight forward charge and hack using their superior strength in numbers to overwhelm the auxiliaries on their slope the tungrians stood impassively still hammering out the menacing rhythm of spear and shield the noise numbing their senses to any fear replacing the emotion with an incoherent sense of common identity the cohort had ceased to be a collection of individuals and had become an engine of destruction ready to strike the relentless pulse of its fighting heart had stripped away the feeling of self from its members and left them in a state of detachment from reality ready for the impersonal fury shortly to be required for their survival they watched still pounding out their defiance as the enemy advanced quickly across the open ground to their front forming up into lines that roughly matched their own one hundred and fifty paces down the slope out of spears throw another brief command rang out from the trumpeter silencing the drumming and bringing their spears into the preparatory position for the throw in the sudden silence the slight noises of weapons and armour were suddenly magnified the dull clink of equipment ringing out across the slope as both sides made ready in the th centurys front line scarface and his mates braced themselves for the fight to come the veteran soldier talking quietly to the men around him even the tent partys watch officer deferred to the scarred soldiers twenty years of experience now lads this is going to be a right gang fuck once they get up the slope so heres how its going to go when uncle sextus gives the order well sling a volley of spears into them aim for the men whove lost their footing the ones too distracted to see your spear coming until its tickling their backbone youve carried the bloody thing on your back since the day you joined and never really had the chance to use it properly so make the fucking thing pay you back for all those miles youve carted it thatll be one less bluenose to wave a sword at you once the spears are gone we air our blades double quick and get the shields set strong ready for them to hit the line with everything theyve got you lads at the rear you get a good fucking grip of our belts and brace us to hold firm were on a nice slope so it shouldnt be too hard to hold them if we work together after that you just concentrate on the same old drills board and sword parry and thrust put your gladius into a bluenoses guts twist the fucker kick him off it and get back behind your board dont fucking stand there watching him die or his mate will carve you up just like you would if you was him he paused swelling his chest with a great draught of air breathe deep lads youll need all the air you can get in the next few minutes and just remember any of you bastards turn from this fight before its done and youll have me and my blade to deal with once were done with this shower of unwashed hairy arseholes we stand together along the tungrian line a few men quailed and were swiftly dealt with by the officers and their older comrades slaps and kicks putting them back into the line the majority listened to the cohorts veteran soldiers tell them how to deal with what was coming and stared impassively down the slope at their enemy prepared to kill in order to live a stark equation both understood and accepted in order to live through to see their women and children again they would have to slaughter the tribesmen in great numbers almost to a man the soldiers were ready to start the butchery in the tribal ranks men swiftly made their last preparations discarding heavy items of clothing that would restrict their movements in the coming melee muttering hasty prayers to their gods for victory the older warriors alive to the possibilities of the coming combat sensibly added the hope for a clean death should their time have come without the time to indulge in any lengthy diatribe against the invaders the chieftains looked to each other nodded their readiness then charged forward up the slope hurling thousands of warriors at the flimsy roman line the tungrian centurions looked to frontinius at the lines centre waiting for his signal as the barbarian horde surged up the gentle incline waiting with one arm raised he watched the shaggy warriors storm towards his men thirty yards twentyfive the usual range of the initial spearthrow twenty until at fifteen yards from the shield wall they hit the strip of greasy mud that his troops had painstakingly stamped into bubbling ruin the leading wave of attackers slowed fighting to stay on their feet as they bunched to avoid the giant wooden obstacles sharpened points crowded from behind and perilously close to falling headlong into the mud more than a few suddenly shouted their pain as the scattered metal caltrops half hidden in the mud pierced their feet the tribesmens attention was suddenly focused more downward than forward scarface raised his spear shouting encouragement to his comrades easing the weapon back and forth in readiness to throw as he searched for a target among the mass of tribesmen struggling towards the tungrian line frontinius whipped his hand downward in the preagreed signal a volley of spears arced flatly into the struggling tribesmen finding targets unprotected in their struggle to stay upright the front ranks shivered with the impact men screaming as flying steel spitted them through limb and trunk their flailing bodies adding to the chaos as the barbarian charge faltered the veteran soldier found his mark a big man carrying a sixfootlong sword momentarily distracted by the greasy footing and stepped forward to throw his spear arm outstretched as he followed the weapons flight through to his point of aim the barbarian jerked as the spears cruel steel head punched into his belly blood jetting from the wound as he sank to his knees drawing his sword with a smile of satisfaction scarface backed up the slope until he felt hands grab his belt to steady him lifting his shield into line with those to his right and left along the line the centurions bawled new commands their men drawing their swords and crouching deeper behind their shields as the barbarian wave regained some of its momentum shrugging aside the dead and dying to struggle towards the silent tungrian line seeing their momentary difficulty frontinius made a snap decision lifting his sword and pointing at the barbarians with its blade bawling the order that unleashed his men down the slope with a shrill of whistles from their officers the cohort lunged the few remaining paces down the hill into their enemy smashing into the struggling barbarian line with their heavy shields and bowling the enemy front line back into the warriors behind then stepped in with their swords scarface heard the whistle kicked back to disengage the soldier held fast to his belt and bounded down the slope alongside his comrades with a bloodcurdling howl punching his shields metal boss into the face of a warrior with his sword raised to strike then stabbing his swords point into the mans guts and kicking him off the blade in one fluid motion he shouted to his mates as he raised his shield into position line reform the line the cohorts front rank snapped their shields back into place presenting the barbarians with an unbroken wall to frustrate their attacks the soldiers repeatedly punched the metal bosses of their shields into the faces of the oncoming men upsetting their precarious balance then stabbed their short swords into their chosen targets aiming for the body points that centuries of experience had taught would kill a man in seconds blood flew across the gap between the two lines in hot sprays as men fell back from the point of combat weapons falling from their hands as they sought to halt the flow or hold intestines into torn bellies or simply explored agonising wounds with shocked bewilderment as life ebbed from their bodies the ground beneath their feet doused with a mixture of blood urine and faeces became steadily more treacherous the tungrian rear ranks role became one of keeping the men in front on their feet and not exposed to an enemy blow on the ground punching and thrusting at the seething throng that railed desperately at their shield wall parrying enemy sword and axe strokes and striving in turn to murder their deliverers the tungrians fought as men who understood that their only survival lay in slaughter cold blooded and clinically efficient in the ths front rank scarface crouched behind his shield his left arm shuddering with the shock of swordblows against its scarred wooden face watching the barbarians intently through the gap between his helmet and the shields top edge looking for any chance to strike the longhaired warrior facing him hemmed in by the men around him raised his sword to chop the blade downward in the only attack open to him and presented a fleeting opportunity that the experienced soldier took without hesitation stepping forward one pace he thrust his sword between the other mans ribs and dropped him doubled over with the sudden awful pain into the bloodspattered mud a tribesman already fallen with a spear through his thigh gathered his strength to strike at the romans extended leg but the wily soldier simply slammed the sharpened metal edge of his shield down across the mans sword arm slicing down to the bone before stepping quickly back into his place in the shield wall the man next to him slipped on the mud going down on to one knee and opening himself up to the blows of his attackers without conscious thought scarface shifted his shield to protect his mate for the critical seconds required for him to regain his footing ignoring his own peril the man to his right killed a tribesman shaping to attack the momentarily unprotected veteran ripping open his throat with a swift stab of his gladius within seconds their wall of shields was complete again steady against the barbarians railing at its unyielding face to marcus standing behind the double line of his men with a tent party of soldiers ready to thrust into holes hacked in the line it looked like a hopelessly unequal battle as the seconds passed he realised that most of the dying was being done on the other side of their shields relatively few of his own men had gone down despite the thick throng of enemy pressing up the slope stand fast ninth century parry and thrust dubnuss familiar booming voice gave him heart and he shouted his own encouragement above the screams and shouts of the battle a gap opened in the line in front of him a pair of men felled by the same massive axe blow and he instinctively pushed the replacements aside and stepped into the breach before any of the enemy could surge through the tribesman wielding the axe stamped down at his victim attempting to wrench the blade from deep in his victims chest then gaped as marcuss powerful chopping blow hacked away his right arm a heavy boot striking him under the chin the maimed man fell back into the wall of frenzied bluepainted faces that confronted marcus and was lost to view replaced by another who seeing marcuss rank leapt forward in attack only to be spitted by the cavalry swords length twisting the blade in a savage halfcircle inside the barbarians scrabbling hands to loosen it within the body cavity he punched forward with his shield at the dying mans chest ripping the sword free in a shower of gore that painted both the shield and his chest dark red to his left a man from the neighbouring century suddenly leapt forward into the mass of the enemy thrusting about him in a blood frenzy killing one then another barbarian then sank bloodsoaked into the throng of the enemy screaming as a dozen battlecrazed warriors bludgeoned him to death the centurys chosen man pushed a man into the gap bellowing at his men to keep their heads and hold the line to their front marcus reckoned as he parried and stabbed at the enemy in front of him with his men the onslaught was easing as the tiring tribesmen found it harder to stay on their feet with so many of their own dead and wounded underfoot one of the less seriously wounded attempted to cut at his ankles from the ground provoking a hacking stroke that neatly removed his arm at the elbow the man rolled back under his comrades feet tumbling two of them on top of him with his agonised writhing the mass of tribesmen in front of marcus parted without warning allowing a tall and heavily armoured man to step out into the gap between the two lines his black helmet and chest armour were intricately decorated with silver inlays and already coated with dried blood his thighs and calves protected by iron greaves he eyed the young centurion with cold appraisal for a moment then with a sudden lunge sprang to attack the officer three savage hacking blows from his heavy sword smashed into marcuss shield their power numbing his left arm and putting him on the defensive the big warrior paused in his attack laughing down into marcuss face his voice a grating boom over the noise of the battle ive already taken the head of a legatus today so i wont bother with yours ill leave it to the crows are you ready to die little roman marcus held his ground ignoring the taunts and readied himself for the next onslaught the big man sprang forward again but this time marcus met his sword not with his shield but blade to blade turning the blow aside and stepping close in to slam his shields iron frame down on the warriors unarmoured foot feeling bones crack under the impact as the warrior fought to control the pain he attacked again stabbing downward with his sword and spearing the blade through the mans shattered foot and into the soft ground below before twisting it savagely and ripping the sword free then while the huge warrior staggered where he stood paralysed by the crippling pain marcus raised his shield to the horizontal and chopped its harsh metal edge into his attackers undefended throat with all his strength with a stifled gurgle the tribal champion fell back from the shield wall fighting for breath that was never going to reach his lungs through a ruptured windpipe the barbarian line shivered and inched backwards away from the cheering tungrians as their hero fell to the ground his face darkening as he twisted in his death throes along the line the gap between the two forces widened a little as the tribesmen paused to regain their wind in dismay at the failure of their initial assault the tungrians straightened their line one eye for the man next to them one on the enemy horns blew to the warbands rear ordering the tribesmen to pull back and reform and they backed reluctantly down the hill still shouting defiance at the roman troops no command was given to follow their retreat on the slope before the panting tungrians lay hundreds of enemy warriors some dead some dying all spattered with blood some moaning pitifully with the pain of their wounds others screaming intermittently in their agony and distress the men of the th stared bleakly down at the scene some those few among them familiar with the sights and sounds of a full battle with numb indifference most simply wideeyed at the horror of the scene one or two made ineffectual efforts to wipe away the gore that had blasted across armour and flesh with each sword stroke but most restricted themselves to wiping the blood from their eyes and mouths knowing that there would be more to replace whatever they removed from their bodies and equipment soon enough julius sought out marcus pulling him from the front rank with a rebuke softened by the young officers wideeyed look of astonishment thats a good place to get killed stay behind the line next time and put your soldiers into the fight weve got a short time before they come back it would be a good opportunity for the century to drink some water ill check for casualties he looked down at the two men killed by the axeman one without head and right arm the other cloven a foot down into his chest best you remove these two theyre already with cocidius marcus pointed down at the wounded tribesmen to their front almost within touching distance what about them the reply was dismissive theyre dead they just havent realised it yet leave them there theyll slow down the next attack the young officer nodded jerkily calling for the water bottles to be passed along the line and commanding the closest men to carry the ruined corpses of their dead into the forest at their rear in the tungrian front rank scarface leaned on his shield grateful for the chance to get his breath back and take a mouthful of water to swill away the coppery taste of blood that was good enough we must have done twenty or so of the bastards and lost what two of ours who came forward to replace them the promoted rearrankers raised their hands sheepishly you two eh welcome to the front rank boys this is where the corn gets earned the hard way keep your heads for a few minutes more and youll have a place here for the rest of your time he laughed at their comical expressions as both men realised that their lives as soldiers had just changed for ever oh yes all that pisstaking the front rank always gives the girls at the back thatll be you giving rather than taking from now on welcome to my army the th drank gratefully the more composed soldiers discussing the fight almost conversationally leaning tiredly on their shields like pottery workers taking a break from the kilns some the more experienced and perceptive knowing the danger of the less experienced men losing themselves to the battle rage when the fight renewed itself worked on the men next to them coaxing them back to reality with words of home and family morban found marcus checking the edge of his sword with a careful eye and offered him a drink from his bottle nicely fought centurion you took that big bastards arm off like lopping a sapling and the way you did the boy in black armour with your shield was nothing short of poetic the ladsre already talking about the way you jumped into the line and got stuck in marcus nodded sheathing his sword and holding on to the hilt to hide the shaking of his hand thank you i hope your son escaped injury indeed i think so the little i could see of him from here a shout from the line of troops grabbed his attention pointing arms guiding his stare to the edge of the valley a mile or so to their right past the small forests edge there silhouetted against the skyline a mass of horsemen was moving into position perfectly placed to sweep down the slope and into the barbarian flank their long lances were held vertically the points making a winking glitter of razorsharp steel in the midmorning sunlight get the bluefaced bumfuckers give them the eightfoot enema a chorus of shouts implored the riders identified as the petriana and augustan cavalry wings by their twisting white banners two thousand men strong to attack the mass of men below but their inaction once their deployment was complete was just as equitius had expected an unsupported charge against so many warriors could end only in a glorious failure all the same anything that gave calgus one more thing to worry about and heartened his own men had to be good even as he watched a force of some five thousand men detached themselves from the barbarian mass on the plain below wheeling at speed to form a rough defensive line of archers and spears ready to absorb any charge he walked on to the point where his command ended and caeliuss started hailing his brother officer the other man strode down the line of barbarian corpses keeping one eye on the ground against the risk of being surprised by a wounded man feigning death hail two knives freshly blooded from the rumour passed down our line and from the blood painted across your mail i hope you offered that prayer for me marcus smiled wryly i was a little busy at the time ill be sure to mention you next time i can get to an altar good enough what do you think theyll do now both men stared downslope at the milling horde order gradually returning to their mass if i were leading them keep the cavalry safely at arms length put some archers and slingers out front harass us with darts and stones to keep our heads down and pull the rest away before two full legions take them dry from behind equitius was weighing the same question we came down here as bait to keep the warband in place until the main force can be moved up i dont believe weve been here long enough to have achieved that aim do you frontinius shook his head with pursed lips another hour at least id say i presume youd like to attract their attention some more rather than letting them slip away into the hills yes they can break into family bands and worm their way into the folds in the land we might only take a tenth of them if that happens the first spear called a man to him muttered instructions in his ear and then turned back to the conversation i have a way to hold them here but it wont be pleasant especially since theyll come back up that slope like wild animals the prefect nodded slowly as long as calgus doesnt pull his men away to safety the price will be justified do whatever you have to the first spear nodded impassively and turned away walking down the cohorts line at the hightide mark of barbarian dead inspecting the troops as if on peacetime parade giving an encouraging word here and there the man hed sent to help him search for a particular corpse had succeeded running down the line of shields with a freshly removed head dripping blood on his leggings the first spear took it from him examining the slack face with an intensity that was almost feral the owners hair was long and greasy the seams of his face dark with the grime of long days on the march his eyes stared glassily back their animation long departed along with the man that had formerly watched the world through their windows how do you know he was a chieftain the other man held out his hand showing his superior an impressively heavy torc stained dark red with blood the gold wrapped in a serpentine arc that had previously been around the dead mans neck frontinius took the heavy piece of jewellery weighing it in his hand and remembering the one like it that dubnuss father had always worn even after his dethronement somebody was important he turned to stare down at the barbarian warband quiet now waiting for a command and spoke again without taking his eyes off the mass of warriors go to the prefect warn him to be ready he stood silently on the slope for a moment the head dangling almost forgotten from one hand the torc in the other until the men below him alerted by those at the front grew silent at the sight calgus came to his decision with his usual speed and insight at his rear waited the bulk of his warband rested and ready to move to his right were the enemy cavalry at least temporarily neutralised by the screen of infantry and archers hed thrown out to cover that wing of the warband their spears stood out above them in a forest of wood and steel a full cohort from their density in front of him arrayed on the bloodied slope the tungrians stood motionless at the hightide mark of a thick carpet of dead and dying men waiting for his next move between them slowly regaining a sense of order the depleted tribal bands were reforming under new leaders preparing to storm the hill once more pull them back aed raised his eyebrows my lord they are not yet successful we i know but there are two more legions marching in these hills that prefect was far too relaxed for that cohort to be far from friendly spears if they come upon us here with the advantage of the slope and with those fucking horsemen well be dead meat no we leave now break into tribal bands and go back to the muster then we can a shout rang out across the open space some leatherlunged roman officer shouting the odds except calgus strained to hear the words a fresh premonition of disaster stroking the hairs on the back of his neck frontinius lifted head and torc the former dangling by its greasy hair the latter glinting in the early afternoon sun inflating his barrel chest he bellowed out across the mass of men below silencing their growing noise leave this place now or we will kill you all warriors you have failed once and you will fail again like the children that you are compared to real soldiers he paused for breath and allowed the silence to drag on for a long moment we killed your leaders and threw you back down this insignificant hill with ease you came seeking heads and left your own by the hundred if you come back up again we will do the same to you see the head of a defeated chieftain he swung the dead mans head in a lazy arc by its hair resisting the temptation to hurl its obscenity away from him and into the seething tribesmen raising the heavy torc to glint in the sunshine and be recognised as a symbol of authority you were weak and we punished you now run away before we treat you all like this feeling queasy he put the head to his crotch and pushed his hips at it in an unmistakable gesture then threw it high into the air above their heads with an angry roar the tribesmen surged forward charging up the hill in their mad fury frontinius ducked back into the line of soldiers shouting for them to ready their spears to the warbands rear calgus closed his eyes for a moment as the realisation hit him my lord i know i have no choice i must kill the prisoners and send the entire warband up that hill but not on their terms get me the tribal leaders the tungrians loosed their second and last volley of spears plunging the barbarian front rank into chaos once more then huddled into their own shields with swords ready the oncoming rush slowed to a walk across the slippery ground to a crawl over the wall of their dead and wounded until the tribesmen arrived in ones and twos in front of the roman shield wall with frontinius disdaining a charge against such disorganised opposition preferring to keep his men on firm ground they waited for their enemy to stagger exhaustedly on to their shields then began their slaughter with a professional ease even when more men had struggled through the obstacles in front of the cohorts line building the attacking force to a more respectable size the anger that had burnt out of them was replaced by a wary respect most of them holding off from the roman swords content to shout defiance at the tungrians scarfaces tent party crouched ready to engage behind their shields sensing that the fight had gone out of their opponents but unwilling to believe the battle could end so easily a single man leapt from the barbarian line a huge warrior swinging a sixfootlong blade around his head and bellowing abuse at the tungrians stripped naked and possessed by a mighty rage he swung his long sword over the top of the shield wall and opened the two new frontrankers throats with the blades end before whipping it back above his head to hack down into the tungrian shields scarfaces neighbour caught beneath the swords descending blade raised his shield twohanded in selfdefence he staggered backwards as the savage blow chopped through the iron frame and sank the razorsharp blade deep into his shields wooden layers both scarface and the soldier on the far side of the attacker stepped in and stabbed their swords deeply into the naked warriors sides scarface backhanding his stabbing stroke into the mans side and ripping the blade out through his stomach muscles to release a slippery rope of guts releasing the long swords hilt the warrior staggered back from the shield wall with blood pouring down his legs from his dreadful wounds the two men whose throats he had slashed died where they fell bleeding out from their severed arteries in less then a minute they were unceremoniously dragged away behind the line two more rear rankers taking their places the prefect and frontinius had little concern for their front however their attention being fixed on the mass of men gathering at the slopes foot hell put more men in to threaten our flanks to fix us perhaps throw in some skirmishers to keep our heads down then throw that mob up the middle and look to crush us under their numbers the prefect nodded unhappily as they watched the warbands bulk split into three groups two smaller groups split to left and right and began climbing the slope with grim purpose while a larger third body of men perhaps ten thousand strong started moving up to reinforce their attackers what would you advise frontinius shook his head unhappily all we can do is reposition some of the weakened centuries from the centre to the flanks and hope they can hold off the fixing attacks then strengthen the centre with our reserves it isnt much of an option prefect its no option at all either way well all be dead quite shortly unless prefect licinius manages to get some troops here within the next ten minutes the other man drew his sword glaring down at the mass of men moving up the hill to either side of their embattled position very well take the fourth and seventh out of the centre and put the fifth and tenth in to replace them i cant see a reserve being much use when this comes to knife fighting good luck to you first spear lets hope we meet again under more promising circumstances they clasped hands then frontinius strode down the slope bellowing orders to his centurions and setting their last desperate plan in motion the th and th centuries streamed down the slope to reinforce the centre of the line marcus and julius stood together behind the thin line of their men watching as their attackers beaten back once more by the cohorts swords gathered their strength rufius had strolled across to join them for a moment his vine stick now tucked into his belt and his sword drawn and bloody more and more men were clambering over the wall of dead and dying warriors to swell the numbers facing them to make matters worse smoke had begun to blow across their line from trees set ablaze in the forest upwind to their right making it harder by the moment to see their enemy the barbarians were hammering on their shields screaming abuse at the tungrians who understanding the depth of their situation were increasingly casting nervous glances to their rear rather than to the front julius stared out at the clamouring horde dispassionately if they attack in that strength well have to abandon the line and fight in pairs back to back marcus nodded his mouth dry as he squinted through the smoke it appeared that to either side of the position the battle was yet to begin the thousands of warriors in the flanking warbands apparently content to threaten the tungrian flanks and hold the bulk of the cohort in position rather than commit to an attack why dont they attack along our whole length surely they could push both flanks in and turn to roll us up with those numbers rufius answered him without taking his eyes off the advancing barbarians calgus wants to blood the men that havent fought yet give them back their manhood after uncle sextus put them down so cruelly the main attack will come through the middle right here and were the men that will have to stop it an interesting life and a short one eh brothers they turned finding frontinius standing behind them i thought your men might be feeling a little exposed so ive come to share in the fun and show them that were all in the same shitty boat julius its time your century stopped sitting about and actually did some fighting so ive brought them down to strengthen the line he pointed to their left and julius turned to see his men coming out of the smoke his chosen man guiding them into the gap opening up as the th century went to ground to let them through and into the line caelius so far unscathed pulled back with his soldiers shot frontinius a quick salute and then led the th off down the line following the first spears pointed direction julius smiled broadly at the sight of his men and about time excuse me brothers right ladies get your shields up and your spears ready to throw lets show these bluefaced bumfuckers the entrance to hades he trotted away to rejoin his men shouting encouragement as he ran to the right beyond rufiuss th the big men of the th century were replacing the battered th rufius nodded grimly thats going to be a nasty shock for the bluefaces a century of axes is a terrifying prospect when they start lopping off arms and cleaving heads the bears boys will be painted black from head to foot before this is over right id best go and get my lads ready he headed off to his century leaving frontinius and marcus alone behind the th the first spear watched the enemy massing to their front impassively from behind his borrowed shield keeping his eyes on the enemy as he addressed marcus for what would probably be the last time well centurion whether you be tribulus corvus or valerius aquila i think you can take comfort in the fact that youve proved an exemplary officer these last few days if i have to meet cocidius in the next few minutes ill be honoured to do so in your company marcus nodded thank you sir an arrow sailed past his head as a sudden barrage of missiles made the soldiers hunch deeper behind their shields the barbarian archers using the wall of corpses for cover began sending a continuous rain of missiles against the two centuries steeltipped arrows hummed and whirred through the line accurate shots punching into shields and clicking off helmets frontinius stood straight in the face of the barrage raising his voice to continue his monologue theyll keep this up for a moment or two pick a few of us off with lucky shots then charge in for the kill when they do you fight in pairs with your partner if hes dead find another or fight in a three watch each others backs and dont leave your partner if your partner is wounded concentrate on killing bluefaces not looking after him or youll be next and he stopped his eyes suddenly wide with the impact of an arrow between the greave that shielded his calf and the chain mail that ran down to midthigh the missile had skewered his leg above the knee toppling him unceremoniously on to the grass with a rivulet of blood seeping around the shaft with a delighted roar the barbarians that had crossed the wall of bodies surged forward en masse eager to take the one head that mattered to them above all the line disintegrated into a whirling melee marcus and dubnus going back to back over frontinius as a tide of tribal warriors washed past them several men moved to encircle them drawing a tightening circle of swords around the three men gathering themselves for the kill with an incoherent berserk scream antenoch hit the men facing marcus from behind thrusting his sword through ones back and stamping him off the blade before swinging fiercely at the others shield marcus and dubnus went on to the offensive killing two men and putting the other two to startled flight across the centurys frontage knots of men were fighting their own personal wars still parrying barbarian swords and thrusting back with their short swords but the fight was descending into a deadly mass brawl and without the disciplined protection of the shield wall the soldiers were horribly outnumbered ten yards in front of marcus two barbarians had a single soldier cornered one hammering at his shield while the other outflanked him and sank his sword into the beleaguered mans neck in the gap between helmet and mail the soldier crumpled instantly just as the sprinting centurion hit his attackers from behind running one man through with his cavalry sword and leaving the weapon sheathed in his back smashing the other to the ground with a shield swipe and drawing his gladius to finish the stunned warrior where he lay as the struggle hung in the balance and quite without fanfare a wave of fresh troops charged down the slope into the battle suddenly equalising the odds and chasing off the startled barbarians marcus and dubnus stood panting over their wounded superior as the reinforcements finished off the enemy wounded around them with swift unconsidered efficiency following the bellowed commands of their officers the new arrivals slotted into the line between the cohorts decimated centuries bolstering the defence to more than its original strength the men of the th century jeered as they recognised their new companions in adversity its the fucking second cohort well done lads you managed to find the battlefield at last then a solidly built watch officer muscled his way into the front rank his spear held ready to throw he shot scarface an indifferent glance his attention riveted on the regrouping warband thats better all frontrankers together just about now one of those bluefaced boys would have been hacking your head off to take home to frighten his kids with when they wouldnt go to their bed at night but some idiot officer said we had a duty to pull your knackers out of the fire what with you being our sister cohort he spat on the ground noisily sisters being just about right anyway here we are and here we stand no reason why you lot should get all the fun when does the next session start where the line had been thinning to the point of desperate vulnerability there were now three unbroken lines of shields the newcomers strength giving fresh heart to the desperately tired tungrians those of the cohorts survivors with the energy shouted the timeworn insults that had always been exchanged when the st and nd tungrians met in the field an officer walked out of the smoke that still drifted across the slope in pale grey curtains his sword drawn searching for the first spear frontinius winced as dubnus finished lashing a broken spear shaft to his wounded leg as a makeshift splint raising a weary hand in salute as the other man stopped in front of where he lay prefect bassus i can honestly say ive never been quite so pleased to see the second cohort the prefect laughed looking out over the rampart of bodies we heard your trumpet calls on the wind so faint that some men swore it was only the wind but the stand fast was clear enough for those with ears to hear it the other prefects insisted on following their orders but i never liked that greasy little shit perennis and seeing this lot proves i was right beside tungrians never leave their brothers dangling frontinius nodded climbing to his feet with marcuss help i fear all youve achieved is to dangle alongside us but i appreciate the company while we wait to die and now if youll excuse me the first spear hobbled off up the slope to make his report to equitius using another broken spear to support his weight on the wounded leg bassus looked to dubnus raising a questioning eyebrow excuse us for a moment chosen he waited for the big man to walk out of earshot before speaking to marcus his face suddenly dark with anger i received a message yesterday night a tablet from my wife respectfully asking me for a divorce it seems that she has tired of my company and i can only presume wishes for that of another while this is hardly the time for such a discussion i will be expecting a frank conversation with you once we have these barbarians running he turned on his heel and walked away to attend to his command julius strolled back across the slope with a sidelong glance at the senior officer trouble nothing i havent earned the other man smiled easily i dont think hell be troubling you after the battle not from what ive been hearing his troops say in the last couple of minutes marcus stared at him uncomprehendingly never mind everything in its time the two men took stock as corpses and the seriously wounded were carried away up the slope by the walking wounded counting another twenty casualties between their two centuries as their line clung to its ground with what was even with the reinforcement of another eight hundred men a tenuous hold through a gap in the smoke marcus saw the petriana waiting still on their ridgeline the sparse forest of their spears unreduced and unmoving julius followed his gaze then spat on the bloodied grass no help to be expected from that direction bloody cavalry are all the same good for the chase once the battles won just never around when the shit starts flying marcus nodded grimly watching the barbarians working themselves up for another charge julius spat on to the scarred turf again examining his swords edge this is it this time theyll throw everything they have at us here on the flanks everywhere and that will be it second tungrians or no second tungrians are you ready to die for the empire for the cohort the empire can kiss my hairy arse the older man laughed with a dark delight his eyes wild with the fight spoken like a real tungrian lets get into the line and get ready to go out in style up the slope the prefect was weighing his options watching as a medic carried out field treatment on frontinius the medic having cleaned the entry and exit wounds around the arrows shaft with water and a clean cloth took an exploratory grip of the feathered end that protruded from the first spears knee the prefect winced with his friends obvious pain frontinius leant back on the grass wearily closing his eyes as the bandage carrier took a firmer grip of the arrow with a sudden twist the medic snapped the arrows shaft then swiftly pulled the barbed end out of the back of the officers knee frontinius watched with narrowed eyes as he expertly bandaged the wound winding the cloth tightly as blood blossomed through its weave you can stand first spear but you have to keep the leg straight and keep your weight off it frontinius struggled to his feet accepting the prefects offered hand to pull him erect ill be separated from my head quite shortly sonny boy the knee can his retort trailed off as movement up the slope at the woods edge caught his eye the tungrians watched the wall of barbarians slowly wash up the hill towards them picking their way carefully across the wall of their dead there was no headstrong charge this time only a steady advance by the thousands of men to their front confident in their numerical advantage but made cautious by the sight and smell of the dead and dying littering the ground around them facing them men from both cohorts stood in an ordered line calm in their resignation for the most part a man close to scarface whimpered with fear quietening as the veteran soldier glared down the line at him and barked out his name the nd cohort watch officer nodded approvingly too late for second thoughts now my lads if you cant take a joke then you shouldnt have joined in the first place just make sure you take some of the bastards across the river with you with certain death at hand men tightened their sweatandbloodslickened grip on swords and shields waiting to kill for the last time the barbarian line passed over the wall of dead speeding up to walking pace with the obstacle crossed the lack of spears in roman hands having reduced it to a hindrance rather than the death trap it had been earlier in the morning twenty yards from the tungrians they stopped at a shouted command allowing calguss messenger to step into the gap between the two forces tungrians the lord calgus offers you one last chance to live surrender now and you will be well treated his voice tailed away as julius stepped forward his armour painted with the blood of a dozen men his shield scored and notched by swords the shafts of three arrows protruding from its wooden face one step more and ill send your cock back to the lord calgus while the rest of you stays here you want these he raised sword and shield into their fighting positions backing carefully into the line as the men to either side readied themselves in similar fashion then fucking well come and get them cum stain the messenger shrugged indifferently then turned away and was absorbed into the barbarian mass the warbands fresh warriors began banging their swords and shields creating a wall of sound that bore down oppressively on the tungrians first advancing one step then another some swinging their swords in extravagant arcs and screaming of the slaughter to come the tungrians waited hollow eyed for the barbarian line to charge across the narrowing gap and finish the unequal contest the barbarian line gathered itself to pounce the mass of shaggyhaired warriors baying for blood as the tungrian cohorts waited grimly for their assault frontiniuss voice rang out over the din his command the last marcus would have expected tungrians on the ground on the ground the line went to the ground after a seconds bewildered pause the brighter soldiers realising what it meant and twisting to look back to their rear as they fell the barbarian line wavered at the sight as a line of hardfaced soldiers fresh and unblooded came out of the smoke these men were different to those in the tungrian line their armour fashioned from overlaid plates rather than chain mail their javelins topped with slender iron shanks sprouting viciously barbed points scarface and the nd cohort watch officer exchanged looks of amazed glee legionaries fuck me its the sixth or whats left of em they must be gagging to get into this lot the watch officer nodded as he hugged the bloodsodden grass they do look a tiny bit pissed off halt prefect liciniuss voice was authoritative above the warbands din all urbanity lost in the harsh command the newcomers force stretched all the way across the small battlefield behind the tungrians three lines of men with spears held ready to throw more men were advancing out of the smoke behind them a lot more men front rank throw the advancing soldiers took an unhesitating threestep runup and launched a volley of spears into the warbands front rank front rank kneel second rank throw another rain of spears showered on to the barbarians second rank kneel third rank throw the warband shuddered under the third volley hundreds of men having fallen in the previous few seconds liciniuss voice hardened sixth legion on your feet form line for attack the legionaries were on their feet with their line dressed and ready in seconds a wall of shields and swords suddenly presented to their amazed enemy sixth legion for the honour of your fallen dead the hairs on the back of marcuss neck lifted with the emotion in the prefects voice a sudden silence descended on the battlefield as the warband grew quiet with apprehension their presumed easy victory suddenly impending disaster only the cries and moans of the wounded broke the silence licinius growled into the hush the last command that would be needed to start the slaughter his harsh voice audible from one end of the line to other no prisoners the depleted legions centurions echoed the command ordering the surviving cohorts forward in a deliberate advance their determined tread took them over and past the tungrians the supine bodies trampled by men fixated with the view to their front as the warbands front rank quailed at their remorseless advance unable to retreat owing to the sheer mass of men packed in behind them the legionaries closed the gap between them and started their slaughter with ruthless efficiency and barely restrained fury find the officers marcus recognised the voice and stood up in the shelter of the legions line no need prefect were here licinius nodded impassively then switched his gaze to stare out across the valley through the smokes dying efforts marcus could just make out a mass of men emerging from the cover of the wood to their right a cohort at the least the thick column kept on coming pouring on to the slope like a monstrous armoured snake julius staring at the mass of troops with eyes that seemed unfocused pulled off his helmet and scratched his sweaty scalp how many the prefect smiled grimly six thousand thats the entire twentieth legion and to our left is the second the other half of the nutcrackers these barbarian bastards are going to pay in blood for what theyve done today from the cover of the woods other arm another tide of men was washing down the other slope another legion in full cry on the crest above them the cavalrys armour still glittered in the morning sun but as marcuss eye found them they started to pour down off the hill the petriana on the move at last seeking targets for their lances the warband in severe danger of being encircled by the legions shivered under the shock of their sudden appearance on its flanks then broke into hundreds of family groups falling over each other in their haste to escape the battlefield marcus bent over putting his hands on his knees to provide support for suddenly weak limbs and was abruptly violently sick postumius avitus macrinus legatus of the imperial th legion stepped on to the bloodsoaked slope with a grim face the two centuries advancing up the hill ahead of him systematically butchering any of the wounded that had survived a stroke of luck had brought a petriana messenger to him as his own legion and the nd were marching less than five miles distant his leading cohorts had been driven forward towards the distant smoke of the battle at a merciless run by their centurions their exhaustion turning to cold purpose as they crested the final slope and saw thousands of the enemy below the barbarian warband had scattered like chaff under their combined attack put to flight in their tribal and family groups and pursued by a dozen cohorts with murder in their hearts and the guidance of questing cavalrymen eager for heads hed met with licinius briefly when the petrianas prefect had found the oncoming legions and had guided them in to attack from either side of the wood before taking the ths remaining cohorts down through the trees to reinforce the tungrians hed been unsurprised to have his request for the prefect to take over the remnants of the th legion refused without hesitation absolutely not legatus i was brought up on horseback and this style of fighting doesnt suit me besides you need the petriana out in front of your legions and im the best man to keep a foot firmly up their idle british arses go and talk to the man that made this possible hed pointed up the hill behind them at a cohortsized group of warriors arrayed behind an impressive rampart of dead barbarians and told the legate in swift economical sentences the story of titus tigidius perenniss betrayal of the th and the tungrians stand on the hillside both perenniss treachery and his parentage had come as a shock to the veteran officer jupiter sextus tigidius perenniss son did this the son of the praetorian prefect lured an imperial legion into a barbarian ambush every time i think ive seen it all nodding his understanding and clapping the tired prefect on the shoulder hed called a senior centurion to his side pointing up the hill im going up there you might want to send a few men with me in case any of those dead barbarians is faking behind him mute testimony to the effectiveness of perenniss betrayal thousands of roman bodies lay in untidy bloodstained heaps around a series of unseen diminishing circles the successive defence perimeters of the hopelessly outnumbered and disarrayed th legion cohorts taken in calguss trap he had already seen sollemniss body for himself needing to know that the man was really dead and not carried away as a hostage the legatuss sword had been hidden under another mans body concealment sufficient to foil the brief search of the fallen for valuables that had been all the ongoing battle had allowed the barbarians the weapon now rested in its scabbard once more carried by one of his staff he would have the difficult honour of passing it on to the mans oldest son he should have been at home himself his age advancing towards a mature fifty more quickly than he cared to consider after a lifetime fighting romes enemies the throne however or those behind it trusted him too well to leave him in retirement hed been called from his fireside to command the th barely three months before with instructions to look for signs that senior officers in the province were not to be trusted i wont be the imperial informer prefect perennis hed told the praetorian guards commander flatly pointing a thick finger at the emperors righthand man with whom hed served twenty years before in syria hed been respectfully summoned to dine with the imperial favourite a private dinner served by slaves who appeared deaf so little was their interest in the proceedings and no one expects you to senator least of all me i dont care if some of the younger and impressionable idiots believe all they hear from rome and take it into their stupid heads that commodus isnt fit for their respect every young emperor has to earn the regard of the army and he will given time what i want from you is hard intelligence on the british situation whos effective and who isnt the rumours reaching us here are that the governor is playing a foolish game not sending all of the gold intended to keep the northern tribal leaders happy to the right places and wed rather know the truth with enough time to act on it gods above us the last thing we need is another bloody revolt on the edge of the world on top of that youll provide us with a tested senior officer in place if anything does happen hed nodded able to accept the task he was bidden to take on perennis had smiled quietly and sipped his wine then put the cup down one thing though you could keep an eye open for the late senator valerius aquilas boy there are rumours that he might have buried himself out of sight in the wall army hed given the other man a darker look as unresolved as to his views on young aquila then as he was now hed known the senator in happier days and had viewed his death with a sickened resignation as one of the small dramas that play out across every change of power if the lad was still at large and not dead or enslaved he was mindful not to take too close an interest ignoring the misdemeanours of the men that surrounded the young emperor was one thing abetting them was quite another before him in increasing numbers as he climbed the incline slipping more than once on the treacherous footing were arrayed barbarian dead the leavings of the auxiliary cohorts defiant stand at the valleys head at first they lay alone wounded men killed as they had crawled away from the battle then in twos and threes the ground previously scattered with the blood of the wounded became slick with blood and faeces the earth pounded into a greasy bog under thousands of feet and the dead suddenly outnumbered the living an eyewatering stench pervaded the air unable to avoid committing the indignity of stepping upon the fallen the legatus climbed a wall of corpses three feet high men hacked and torn by grievous wounds dropped in their hundreds to form a rampart for the defenders to shelter behind a soldier to his right spotted some minute movement among the mangled warriors and stepped in to strike with his gladius the legatus returned his gaze to the front seeing auxiliary troops among the dead for the first time their bodies neatly laid in rows by their fellow troops and covered with their capes he winced at the number of their dead looking to the remaining troops to gauge their fitness for further action the cohort was standing to attention neatly paraded across the hillside by century a good sign in itself as was the fact that they had already washed most of the inevitable blood spray of battle from their faces if not their blackcaked armour the cohorts prefect stepped forward to meet him the mans grasp shaking slightly shock or fatigue he kept his demeanour brisk hoping to help the man a little with his battle weariness prefect equitius im legatus postumius avitus macrinus twentieth imperial legion and with the death of our esteemed colleague legatus gaius calidius sollemnis now general in command of this whole sorry mess he paused looking out across the sea of corpses you prefect seem to have gained us a victory the petrianas commander tells me that you held this place against many times your own number in order to keep calgus busy until reinforcement could arrive you paid a heavy price for that success i see the other man nodded his eyes far away you could consider this ground bought and paid for legatus a burly man passed them without recognition his hollow eyes fixed on the body cradled in his arms another casualty as you say bought and paid for the prefect watched morban deposit the corpse alongside the cohorts other dead with gentle care his son i fear ah a difficult moment for any man the senior officer waited a moment watching the other for signs of mental defeat but saw none im sorry but im new enough to this country not to know your unit by anything other than name forgive the question as simple ignorance of your mens resilience but can they fight on the prefect nodded slowly we have an overall casualty figure of one hundred and fiftyeight dead and another one hundred and three seriously wounded of whom at least half will die plus a couple of hundred with minor wounds cuts and bruises who can be treated in the field i am three officers short one dead and two wounded plus a first spear with an arrow wound that hes determined to ignore and ive lost half a dozen or so watch officers so it isnt pretty but yes we can fight given time to bury our dead and get some food into the troops good and yourself the other man raised an eyebrow im in better condition than most of my men they did the fighting here not me and yet your quick thinking coupled with their prowess made amends for what would otherwise have been a total disaster with calidius sollemnis dead im the only general officer left in this command which gives me the undisputed right to make battlefield promotions i feel are justified im also a recent appointment from the imperial court even the governor wouldnt consider challenging my authority on a question of promotion youre the man i need prefect to take whats left of the sixth legion and rebuild it legatus with respect the senior officer silenced him with a raised hand no prefect the respect comes from this side of our short relationship your auxiliaries fought like praetorians here you know how to manage soldiers and you come with a readymade reputation with perennis dead my only other option would be to promote a young man from my own staff and theres none of them your equal the petrianas prefect told me not to bother asking him and since theyre our most potent weapon im happy to leave him in post i cant guarantee you the position in the longer term but youll lead the sixth for the rest of the summer and youll have the title and status that go with the responsibility youll be able to retire to a nice civil job even if youre not confirmed in position and in the meanwhile your family will be quartered in the yew grove headquarters so dont tell me you wont accept my offer because im not minded to let you refuse the prefect closed his eyes for a moment wearily considering the options who succeeds me here i presume your first spears competent he nodded then theres no urgent need to find a man of the equestrian class to replace you let that wait for calmer days for the time being your men need a familiar face to look up to not a new one they didnt see on this bloody hillside today very well legatus i will accept your generous offer good take a few minutes to brief your people and then take command of the sixth at once youll find them regrouping at the far end of valley if my order to halt their pursuit reached them ill let you have the frisians and the raetians as temporary reinforcement to bring your legion up over halfstrength oh and have the two tungrian cohorts pull back to the wall i want some reararea security on the road between here and yew grove besides which it will give them a breather well need them back in the campaign soon enough sir the new legatus turned to go then turned back i presume that youve found legatus sollemniss body yes he died on his feet it seems hed been beheaded though i hear these wretched people sometimes preserve the head of an enemy in the oil of the cedar perhaps when you recover his lost eagle youll be able to bring him some peace too did you find his sword indeed my first spear has it ill return it to his family when i go back to rome at the end of the year i know sollemniss son better than most people it would be my honour to return the weapon to him the legate called his senior centurion over took an oilskinwrapped package from him and presented it with obvious relief im happy to have the responsibility off my shoulders ive never once enjoyed seeing the faces of the relatives when i pitch up with their loved ones personal effects anyway legatus away and get your new command pulled into shape ill see you at tonights commanders conference he turned away and picked his way gingerly down the hillside watched by the remaining tungrians frontinius hobbled over to the prefect a question on his face im a legatus sextus new commander of the sixth or whats left of them frontinius congratulated him with genuine warmth delighted for his friend you will always be able to count on our support legatus might i enquire as to your replacement for the time being youre in command here in the longer term i expect therell be a queue of suitable candidates frontinius nodded then ill make the most of my brief moment in the sun our orders get your dead underground with dignity and then move to join the legions theyll be camping back on the hill we used last night i believe i suggest that you use the sixth legions supplies since theyre several thousand men down on their establishment tomorrow morning youll be marching for the rock as fast as you can alongside the second cohort and will secure whats left of the fort equitiuss face creased into a frown and no it isnt a quiet option for you or any sign that i consider your command as unfit for battle there are probably several thousand barbarians still milling about to our rear in a variety of groupings and while i expect them to take to the hills once news of this action gets out some of them still might be tempted to try a run south instead in truth weve little enough between here and yew grove that we can trust to get in their way securing the crossroads south of the wall is my first priority after enjoying the sight of calguss head on a pole and seeing the sixths eagle back in the hands of a badtempered standardbearer ill ask for a century of cavalry from the petriana to scout ahead of you and to maintain contact with the main body of the army the new prefect nodded his understanding and now i must leave before i go i need one favour from you frontinius nodded legatus i need a bodyguard just a few tent parties these men dont know me and i dont know them id feel safer with a few close friends between me and the bluefaces got anybody in mind equitius looked out over the battlefield still amazed at the slaughter committed across the valleys green slopes i thought i might ask you for the ninth century or whats left of them young corvus ought to be safe enough with perennis out of the way and at some point i need to give him this frontinius peered inside the oilskin package as equitius opened it to display the weapon inside taking in the swords fine workmanship very pretty sollemnis yes tradition says it goes to his oldest son and now might not be quite the right time for that story to be told exactly frontinius nodded very well legatus the ninth it is just remember we want them back for the th the next month passed as quickly as the previous week sixth legion reinforced by the addition of the two auxiliary cohorts giving it an effective strength of six cohorts marched into the north while the th and the nd legions pulled back to hold the wall and start the task of rebuilding its shattered forts the legions task carried out day after unremitting day was to sweep the open countryside for tribal bands on the run after what had quickly became known to both army and the unwilling populace through which they moved as the battle of the lost eagle after the first week with the weather turning sour and winddriven drizzle working its way into armour and equipment bringing the scourge of rust without constant care the experience soon began to pall waking before dawn often in driving rain as a succession of cloud banks swept across the country the legion was routinely on its feet until after dark an eighteenhour day at that time of the year and longer for men standing guard in the night moving into the increasingly mountainous country in search of the fleeing barbarians exposed them to likely ambush and inevitable pinprick attacks knives in the dark and snatched bow shots from hidden archers who frequently escaped their clutches intelligence gathered by their native scouts told equitius that the captured eagle and with it sollemniss head went before them tantalisingly close to recapture and for the sake of his dead friend he pushed its pursuit for longer than might have been judged prudent each village and farm they encountered greeted their passing with forced indifference as if neither side knew that refugees from the battle were hidden close by even the petty revenges of searching the rough dwellings stealing any valuables their inhabitants were stupid enough not to have hidden and the confiscation and slaughter of the farm animals for food did little to lift the spirits of men who knew their enemy was laughing at their failure to retake the legions precious standard marcuss men held up well enough helped by the distraction of keeping morban from dwelling on his loss the burly standardbearer didnt sleep lost weight and volunteered for guard duty at every opportunity seeking activity to prevent opportunities to brood over his sons death in the battles last minutes some of the century attempted to use humour to keep his spirits up marcus overheard two of his men attempting to lighten the standardbearers mood in camp late one evening morban how many legion roadbuilders does it take to light a lamp no idea five one to light it and four lazy bastards leaning on their shovels to watch the other soldier chipped in morban how many stores staff does it take to light a lamp go on ten one to light it and nine to do the paperwork the first man started back in morban how many prostitutes does it take to light a lamp look just looks like one but shes only faking it morban smiled sadly as he stood to leave look lads i know youre just trying to cheer me up and that last one wasnt too bad but just give it a rest eh dubnus spoke darkly to marcus on the subject an unusual frown on his face the next action we see hell take his first chance to jump into the bluefaces and get killed which is bad enough but i wouldnt trust some of the lads not to jump in behind him and try to save him they agreed to keep an eye on their friend and in the event of impending battle to make sure he was kept away from the shield wall marcus knew it could only be a temporary solution with the legionnaires visibly losing their edge under the constant strain and without any indication that they might regain the legions badge of honour any time soon equitius was forced to bow to the inevitable standing in camp late one evening watching the troops labour over yet another turf wall in the orange light of the setting sun he turned to marcus and looked at the young centurion properly for the first time in over a week you look tired centurion in need of a decent bath and a cup of a decent red marcus straightened his back reflexively opening eyes that had narrowed to slits in anticipation and need of sleep relax i wasnt finding fault the gods know i could sweat a helmet full of dirt given the chance and as for a decent drink anyway ive come to a decision tomorrow well have a rest day give the cohorts a chance to get their tunics clean and polish the rust off their swords marcus nodded gratefully and the day after we turn south four or five days march ought to see us back to the wall were giving up the hunt yes theyre playing with us you know spreading rumours to lead us round the countryside like a bull being pulled round the farmyard by the ring in its nose soon enough calgus will lure us into some nasty ambush or other cost us more men we cant afford to lose and i dont intend to give him the satisfaction its time to go home and wait for reinforcements from gaul a shaft of orange sunlight lit the camp and equitius stretched luxuriously in the warm glow share a beaker with me centurion they sat in equitiuss private tent pitched alongside the massive command tent and sipped their wine for a while neither spoke at last equitius broke the silence i dont suppose the last year has been anything other than a waking nightmare for you if its any consolation youve acquitted yourself better than i could have imagined when we took you in back in the month of mars with hindsight though you were never going to fail this test not with your blood ive been waiting for the right time to give you something and now seems as good a time as any he pulled the oilskin package from under his camp bed putting it in marcuss hands with a smile it belonged to legatus sollemnis he wanted you to have it marcus unwrapped the sword looking closely at the hilts ornate decoration and inlay before pulling it from the scabbard and testing its fine balance its a beautiful weapon so it should be i was with him when he bought it and it cost him more money than i would ever have spent on a sword it served him with honour too right across the empire in the service of the emperor marcus aurelius im honoured but why me he spoke to me the night before the battle of the lost eagle perhaps he had a premonition i dont know but he asked me to make sure that the sword went to you if he should be killed the next day id say he wanted it to go to someone that will bring it further honour besides youre about the right age to have been the son he always wanted he hovered close to breaking his promise to frontinius at that moment resisting the urge to tell marcus the truth only with an effort of will and now centurion you can get that lamp fuel down your neck and fetch the senior centurions to come and see me the sooner that lot out there know theyve got a day of rest tomorrow the happier well all be the depleted legion turned south the day after next as promised and with thoughts of home in their hearts made the journey back to the wall in four days at noisy valley where buildings were being thrown up to replace those burned out to deny the warband their supplies the other legions had set about building a temporary camp to house them until they could march south to their fortresses at the campaigns end equitius went looking for the ths legate to make his report taking marcus and a tent party of his men as close escort they found the northern commands new general in his freshly erected wooden principia a clutch of legion tribunes and senior centurions gathered around him as they planned the campaigns next moves dismissing his escort for the time being equitius approached legatus macrinus and made his salute before joining the group marcus took his men outside to wait for the legatus sitting them down in the early afternoons warmth with a quiet order to dubnus to keep them busy polishing their helmets and to call him when equitius had completed his duties inside then headed for the infirmary the legionaries guarding the hospital confirmed that there were tungrian wounded inside he found a couple of dozen of them including five of his own men sporting bandages and in a couple of cases fracture splints their delight at the visit was obvious and they sat him down on a bed and plied him with questions on the state of the campaign it soon became clear that they knew more about what was going on than he did and the consensus was that there was another advance to the north planned before the end of the summer the tungrians had been sent back to the hill a few days before for a weeks leave and to do whatever recruiting was possible locally to boost their strength but were scheduled to return to the swiftly growing legionary fortress that noisy valley was becoming for further duty yes they were all well enough although several of their mates had died in the difficult days of the march south from the battlefield too badly hurt to survive for the most part but the care in the hospital had saved several others particularly that from one doctor the last said with much rolling of eyes and significant nods marcus knowing exactly where the conversation was going smiled weakly and took his leave promising to remember them to their friends and if time allowed to send their mates in to see them in truth hed forced himself to forget her assisted by the strains of the last month and being reminded of her existence was like having an icecold dagger twisted in his soul turning away he came face to face with felicia who had been standing watching him with his men with a small smile on her face he froze with uncertainty blushing uncontrollably centurion i trust you find your men in good condition recovering his wits he bowed formally yes maam im told that almost everyone that made it here survived the tungrian cohort is in your debt she smiled and marcuss heart leapt in his chest thats probably no recommendation for our care anyone that survived that journey was probably going to live anyway the more vocal of the tungrians butted in indignantly on her behalf one of them volunteering to remove his bandages and show marcus the truly horrible wound the doctor had cleaned with delicate care three times a day picking out the dead flesh so carefully that he hadnt even felt her working until marcuss irritation overcame his embarrassment and he shooed the men back to their beds with order restored he turned back to felicia with fresh confidence if their exuberance is any guide id say youve done a fine job on them doctor perhaps we could discuss their likely further treatment somewhere a little quieter and ill pass your diagnosis on to their prefect when i see him next she smiled a secret smile beckoning him down the ward and into her tiny office in the small room lit by the suns light through an open window he noticed that her tunic was not dark blue as hed supposed in the less wellilluminated ward but simple black she followed his gaze and pursed her lips my husband was killed in that battle you fought against the barbarians marcus frowned confused he was alive the last time i saw him it happened later in the day apparently during the pursuit his cohort cornered a barbarian band which turned and fought them to the death he was found dead after the fight it was a spear apparently although the circumstances seem to have been confused im sorry i mean i read your tablet and he told me that i know i hated the man for the last year of our marriage and his death has freed me to do whatever i want within reason but i still feel guilty about what happened marcus leaned back against the wall looking closely at her face im i yes centurion i would prefer it if you would call me marcus and id like to think given time of course that we might be together yes i thought so too i think i still do but i do need time to let all this work itself out come and see me next time youre in camp i wont be going anywhere in the meanwhile he nodded his understanding turning for the door centurion marcus maam firstly you could stop calling me maam as if i were some roman matron you know my forename he managed a smile in return yes clodia drusilla but if youll forgive me i wont use it until i know whether were to be friends or something more call it superstition and secondly maam you could hold me for a moment remind me what male affection feels like he took her in his arms holding her slim body against his armour and stroking her hair with his right hand after a long moment she pulled away smiling again next time we do that ill make a point of your not being dressed in twenty pounds of chain mail we dont all have a compulsion for men in uniform now off with you ive got work to do marcus ran the gauntlet of the wounded tungrians all of whom had stupid smiles on their faces and some of whom went so far as to wink and nod vigorously at him pulling his helmet on as he walked out past the guards to cover up his own stupid smile from the knowing looks and sideways glances he got from the men waiting for him outside the principia he guessed that the wounded had found some way of passing the news to their colleagues thinking what he would have to put up with from antenoch he shook his head only making his men smile more widely behind their hands when equitius emerged from the building half an hour later the look on his face was neutral neither happy nor troubled im in command for the rest of the summer at least and then well see what happens theres still the small matter of a lost eagle to be dealt with of course entire legions have been cashiered for losing their standards broken up for reinforcements so who knows whatll happen when the news reaches rometwentieth and second legions are going to camp here for three weeks since the barbarians will be too busy getting the harvest in to worry much about fighting us for the rest of the month im taking the sixth south to yew grove to collect three cohorts of reinforcements that are expected there from gaul within the week so you can head west to the hill and rejoin the cohort give uncle sextus my thanks for the loan of your men and tell him that ill have a couple of centuries of replacements put to one side for him for when he brings his people back to noisy valley that should get him back to full strength theres a troop convoy expected into arab town soon with initial reinforcements real tungrians from northern gaul apparently one more surprise awaited marcus before he turned his men west rounding a corner on his way to the stores he bumped into a squat man in uniform his hair cropped short in the military style young marcus quintus they embraced with delight rufius standing back to look his friend up and down a bit thinner a bit more muscle and a scar or two id bet not to mention an attachment to a rather attractive and recently widowed lady doctor from what ive heard marcus shook his head in mock anger isnt there anyone in this bloody camp that can mind their own business but why are you here and not at the hill i asked sextus for some leave and a chance to sort out some of my business affairs its amazing you go missing for a month or two and suddenly you have to get the money people owe you at the point of a sword anyway tell me what youve been up to in the hills since we turned south you young puppy the older man backed away as marcus prodded him playfully in the belly with his vine stick not so much of the puppy centurion ive done a good deal of growing up since we met on the road to yew grove rufius inclined his head gravely indeed you have do you have time for a drink and a natter they repaired to the officers mess and drank local beer while marcus related what had happened since their parting after the battle of the lost eagle at length rufius sat back nodding his head sagely you have been busy at least all this excitement has taken everyones mind off looking for a young man called marcus valerius aquila for a while lets hope that bastard perennis and his asturian cronies were the only people that knew enough about you to be dangerous you know that annius died soon after the battle of the lost eagle apparently he was found with an issue spear stuck right through him somebody strong must have taken a dislike to him anyway youre safe now thats to be seen i hardly look like one of the locals do i true but youre among friends anyway i must go im due back on the hill by nightfall tomorrow and theres still a nasty little shopkeeper that owes me three months rent on his premises he stood to go offering his hand to marcus one question rufius if i can answer it you were legatus sollemniss man why would he leave me this he tapped the swords hilt raising an eyebrow in question rufius looked at him with calculation lad the legatus was a good friend of your father think of the risk he took to look after you the way he did surely thats enough reason dont go looking for what isnt there to be found from the thoughtful look in marcuss eye he wasnt sure that his bluff had succeeded the next day eager to see the hill again the th took their leave of the legion and headed west along the road behind the wall a days easy march bringing them to the fort marcus dismissed his men to their barracks and a wellearned rest and went in search of frontinius he found the prefect enjoying a moment of quiet relaxation in the cohorts bathhouse sitting quietly in the deserted steam room in the quiet of the evening his wounded knee had healed well enough although he was careful to hold it out straight in front of him occasionally flexing the joint experimentally well centurion its good to see you back from the wilds how did the sixth fare after we parted company sit down for a sweat and tell me your story are you back with us to stay the ninth century is detached from service with the sixth legion prefect with fortynine effectives and five men still in the noisy valley base hospital legatus equitius wants us all back at the valley by the end of the month for reinforcement and in case the barbarians decide to have another try as to our story theres nothing much to tell really we marched round the mountains of the north chasing shadows and lies for a month and hardly saw a man of fighting age all hidden away from reprisals no doubt how are your men tired and homesick most of them just need a few days rest twelve hours sleep a day and no parades what about morban hes still in pieces his sons death seems to have robbed him of the will to live hmmm you might want to get yourself down into the vicus in that case his sons woman died suddenly a few days ago and i hear her mothers come to collect her grandchild if morbans been knocked sideways by his lads death id imagine hell be devastated when he finds hes about to lose his grandson as well marcus took his leave dressed hurriedly and headed down to the south gate stopping a retired soldier in the vicuss street to ask for directions at the door to the small house indicated he stopped hearing voices from within no morban the boy has to come with me whos going to look after him if he stays here you wont be around most of the time and what sort of example will you set to the boy by all accounts you drink you whore and i know for a fact that you swear all the time he comes with me but the lad will be well cared for whats your alternative marcus knocked respectfully at the door standing back and taking off his helmet it opened an older woman wiping at tearfilled eyes with the hem of her sleeve standing in the opening centurion maam im morbans officer and i heard he might be here could i come in for a moment she ushered him in the four of them practically filling the room morbans grandson crouched in a corner his knees pulled up to his chest and his head buried between them marcus squatted down to his level putting out a hand to touch the boys face lifting it with one finger under his chin guessing the boys age to be nine or ten he looked into his wet eyes and felt the loss and loneliness he was suffering memories of another little boy of the same age flooded over him reminding him of a past happiness he hadnt given thought to for many days he stood up again turning to the woman with a small bow maam so that you can understand my position regarding this unhappy situation my parents were both killed earlier this year as were my older sisters and younger brother if anyone in this room has an understanding of what that boys going through it would be me the womans face softened a little with the words you both think youve got a claim on the boy one through blood the other through an ability to provide the upbringing he needs now i could simply enforce the law and tell you that the cohort has first claim on the lad simple as that and maam there would be nothing you could do to stop me however he put a hand up to quell the rising concern he saw in her face shaking his head at morban as his mouth started to open however from my unique perspective i happen to believe that theres only one person in this room that can make the decision as to what should be done with him i also think you should both stop to consider the effect your argument is having on that person morban turned his head to look at the wall a single tear running down his face marcus squatted down again whats your name young man the boy lifted his tearstreaked face his voice quavering my mother called me corban dad used to call me lupus for a nickname very well little wolf you have a choice to make it isnt an easy one but nobody else can make it for you no matter how good their intentions might be you grandmother wants you to go home with her and live in her village therell be other boys of your age to play with and youll be able to learn a trade of some kind as you get older your grandfather wants you to stay here on the hill and grow up to be a soldier like him and your father but you cant join until youve seen fourteen summers which is still a long time away and you cant stay here without anyone to look after you before you choose ill give you a third choice ill take you on as my servant which will mean that you have to keep my clothes clean and polish my boots and armour every day ill have you taught to read and write and when youre old enough youll be able to choose whether you want to become a soldier or not also ill make sure that you go and see your grandmother twice a year so which do you choose the boy thought for a moment i want to be a soldier like my dad well you cant not yet youre too young for one thing and i dont think we have any armour in your size you can either take my offer or go back to your grandmothers village either way you can volunteer for service when youre old enough ill work for you centurion ill work for you centurion marcus stood up turning to face morban and the old woman hes made his decision you morban will be responsible for his good behaviour and for ensuring that he isnt corrupted by bad language and poor behaviour you will also be responsible for making sure that he spends time with his grandmother as promised when the cohort isnt on campaign and you maam should be aware that hes now effectively on imperial service albeit as a civilian i guarantee that hell be educated by the time hes old enough to volunteer for the military and that hell have the best possible start in life we can give him ive got at least one man in the century that has more learning than i do and well make sure he pays attention morban turned to face her putting a hand out to hold hers hell have fifty parents in the ninth i swear hell come to no harm she thought for a long moment and then nodded with resignation marcus looked her in the eyes feeling tears of his own distorting his vision if theres one thing i understand maam its how that youngsters feeling right now ill be his big brother for as long as he needs me after what these people have done for me its my chance to repay some of my debt he bent to the boy putting a hand out while the other wiped his eyes dry come on then wolf cub lets be about our business weve got a century to get into shape the pair walked out of the door hand in hand turning up the street towards the main gate drawing surprised glances from a pair of passing soldiers they turned to make a ribald comment from the security of the shadows saw the look on morbans face as he emerged behind them and immediately thought better of it the standardbearer watched his officer and his grandson from the doorway as they progressed up the hill losing sight of them as they passed the soldiers on guard he turned to follow them up the road muttering quietly under his breath to himself with a determination he hadnt felt for many days dont you worry centurion my lads are going to follow you any fucking place you command or ill know the reason why empire the story began in wounds of honour it continues in arrows of fury september ad the tungrian centurions gathered round their leader in the warm afternoon sunshine sharing a last moment of quiet before the fight to come marcus tribulus corvus winked at his friend and former chosen man dubnus now centurion of the th century which marcus had previously commanded then nudged the older man standing next to him his attention fixed on the ranks of soldiers arrayed on the hillside behind them stop mooning after these legionaries rufius youre a tungrian now whether you like it or not rufius caught his sly smile and tip of the head to julius the detachments senior centurion and picked up the thread i cant help it marcus just seeing all those professional soldiers standing waiting for battle takes me back to the days when i stood in front of them with a vine stick and thats my old cohort too julius turned from his scrutiny of their objective and scowled at the two men with an exasperation that was only partly feigned rufius nudged marcus back shaking his head solemnly now brother lets be fair to our colleague and give him some peace its not his fault that its taken all morning and half the afternoon to get two thousand men and a few bolt throwers into position even if my guts are growling like a shithouse dog and theres enough sweat running down my legs to make my boots squelch for a week dubnus leaned over and tapped the veteran centurion on the shoulder i think youll find we call that wet stuff piss in this cohort grandfather the older man smiled tolerantly very good dubnus just you concentrate on taking your lads into action as their centurion for the first time and ill worry about whether ill be able to hold my bladder in a fight for the fiftieth time youth eh julius julius having turned back to his study of the defences looming before them replied in a tired tone of voice that betrayed his growing frustration with their prolonged wait in front of the tribal hill fort they would shortly be attempting to storm might i suggest that you all shut the fuck up given that it looks like well actually be attacking soon just as soon as those idiots have been cleared from the top of their wall thatll be us on the march and ready for our starring role in tribune antoniuss great victory over the carvetii tribe when i send you back to your centuries you get your men ready to advance you repeat our orders to them all one last time and remember to keep your bloody heads down once were on the move julius cast a disparaging glance at the batteries of bolt throwers ranged alongside his four centuries their sweating crews toiling at the weapons hand winches as they ratcheted the heavy bowstrings back ready to fire he tugged at the strap of his helmet the crosswise crest that marked him as a centurion ruffled by the breeze as he turned back to stare at the wooden walled fort to their front i dont trust those lazy bastards not to underwind and drop the occasional bolt short and when we do attack let me remind you one last time that our objective is to break in and take the first rampart just that and only that tribune antonius has been crystal clear on the subject marcus managed to keep a straight face despite rufiuss knowing smile it was an open secret among the officers of the th legions expedition against the rebellious carvetii tribe that the legions senatorial tribune the legatuss secondincommand was desperate to prove his readiness to command a legion of his own before his short tenure in the position ended to make way for another aspiring general once the ways clear to the second gate we let the legionaries through to take their turn got it so clear any resistance behind the first wall and then hold your men in place no battle rage and no trying to win the fortification crown not that any of us would ever be so favoured with two cohorts of regulars all vying for the honour once weve done our bit ill call the bloody road menders forward and they can do the rest the officers clustered around him turned to watch as the boltthrower battery to the right of their soldiers loosed a volley of three missiles at the hill forts outer wooden palisade barely two hundred paces from the ranks of their soldiers at such close range the weapons crews were taking full advantage of their weapons accuracy and another of the barbarian warriors lining the forts wooden walls was plucked away by the bolts savage power most likely dead before he hit the ground behind the palisade after a moment the remaining defenders ducked into the cover of the forts thick wooden beams and the artillery crews grinned their satisfaction as their officer shouted at them to get back on their weapons hand winches and prepare to shoot again julius nodded thatll be it their heads are down get back to your centuries the four centurions saluted him and turned away heading for their places in the two columns of auxiliary infantry waiting to either side of the heavy wooden ram that was key to their assigned task of breaking into the hill fort dubnus the leader of the century that led the righthand column a tall and broadshouldered young centurion with the frame of an athlete and a heavy black beard spoke quickly to his chosen man who in turn set the centurys watch officers to one last check that every man was ready to fight while they fussed over armour and weapons for the final time dubnus shouted the centurys orders across their ranks repeating juliuss command to take the first rampart and then hold to allow the legions through with their assigned task complete that done he drew his gladius and picked up a shield hed left on the ground in front of his men smiling wryly at marcus who stood at ease beside him in front of the century with his helmet hanging from one hand when i got my vine stick last month i assumed id never have to carry a shield again in all my days his friends eyes were alive with the prospect of the impending action he was as tall as dubnus and if his body was less massive in its build it was still impressively muscled from the months of incessant conditioning since he had joined the cohort in the spring his hair was as black as a crows wing and his brown eyes were set in a darkerskinned face than was usual in the locally recruited auxiliary cohorts a long cavalry sword was sheathed on his left hip while the shorter infantry gladius which usually hung on his right hip was in his right hand its ornate eagleshead pommel gleamed in the afternoon sunlight the intricately worked silver and gold polished to a dazzling brilliance and yet here you are hefting a painted piece of board again as if you were still in the ranks perhaps youd rather go forward with just your vine stick for protection eh dubnus no ill put up with the burden this once thank you marcus those bluenosed idiots arent going to keep their heads down for long and theyll throw everything but the water troughs at us once were through the gate if we get through the gate now youre sure you dont want to lead the ninth century forward one last time his friend shook his head gesturing to the front rank of the century arrayed behind him no thank you these are your men now im only along for the ride after you centurion a sudden bray of trumpets stiffened their backs calling the waiting centuries to readiness for the inevitable command marcus pulled on his helmet his features suddenly rendered anonymous by the cheek guards brutal lines then took up his own shield infantry advance julius turned back to face his men from the head of the lefthand column drawing his sword and pointing it at the fort tungrians advance at his command the detachments two columns marched steadily forward down the gentle slope that ran down to the hill forts perch high above the valley below three sides of the forts position were utterly unassailable owing to the heavily forested and precipitously steep slopes that fell away from the pinnacle to the north south and east the only possible approach to the hill fort was from the west where a flat and treeless ridge angled up to meet the hill on which two legion cohorts and their supporting artillery were gathered ready to follow up on the advance of their tungrian auxiliaries bordered on both sides by the wild forest of oak and birch that made the hill forts steep approaches so difficult the space beneath the trees thick with holly alder and hazel that made it practically impassable the ridges wide path led arrow straight down to the forts massive outer gates only here was there any realistic prospect of an attackers advance meeting with anything but disastrous rebuff but in anticipation of such an obvious approach the forts occupiers had long since constructed an elaborate series of defences across the forts western face three successive palisades of thick wooden beams defended the innermost point of the fort the hills flat summit the tungrians hunched behind their shields as the forts wooden rampart loomed in front of them casting nervous glances at the thirty massively built barbarians striding purposefully between them an irontipped battering ram fashioned from a tree trunk hacked from the surrounding forest hung between the two ranks of prisoners and swung to and fro as they marched down the ridges slope each pair of men on either side of the ram was shackled together at the wrist their chains wrapped around the tree trunk to remove any chance of flight and every man was naked from the waist up while a legion centurion and a dozen hardfaced soldiers marched alongside them in grim silence with drawn swords the legion officer barked a command into the oppressive silence that greeted their advance when we reach the gate you barbarian bastards will swing that ram as if your lives depend on it which they do he waited a moment to allow the men among them that spoke some latin to translate his words for the others when the gates breached you will be released from your chains and you will then go forward into the fort and take on the defenders with any weapon that you can get your hands on any man that runs will be put down by the soldiers alongside you or behind you without a second thought so if you think thats a better choice than going through the gates you can think again those of you that survive the attack will be freed to return to your villages with your second brand some of the men glanced down at the mark crudely burned into their right forearms c for captivus let me remind you that if you decide to run and in the unlikely event that you actually get away with it the lack of that second brand to cancel out the first one will get you crucified when youre recaptured and that my lads is not a pleasant way to leave this life far better to die cleanly here in the sunlight than choking out your last miserable breaths in agony and with your back opened up like a side of bad meat dubnus nudged his friend keep your eyes open for them once were inside im pretty sure that half of them fought us at lost eagle i even recognise a couple of them and theyll probably be only too happy to take one or two of us with them especially men wearing crests on their piss buckets like you and me marcus nodded grimly as the attacking force came to a halt in front of the massive wooden gates archers ready he glanced back seeing the century of syrian archers arrayed behind their small force taking up positions from which to shower the ramparts with arrows if the defenders were sufficiently unwise to show themselves the legion centurion commanding the rams conscripted bearers pointed at the gates bellowing the command for them to start their assault with a collective grunt of effort the rambearers swung the tree trunk backwards then heaved it forward with a collective lunge the iron heads arc ending against the gates timbers with a rending crash sending a shower of dust cascading down on to the leading tungrian soldiers waiting alongside them a tribesman popped up from behind the wall and lifted his arms to hurl a rock down on to the rams bearers but fell back with an arrow in his neck and a dozen more studding the palisades wooden wall before the missile even left his hands twice more the ram swung back and hammered into the gates creaking timbers and with the fourth blow the lefthand gate sagged tiredly on to the ground ready to fall julius barked an order back into the expectant silence tungrians wait for my command the rams fifth collision with the forts defences ripped away the lefthand door its shattered remnants fell back into the gap between the forts first and second palisades in a cloud of dust and splinters without the strength of its support the righthand gate surrendered after another two blows of the rams massive iron head leaving the gateway open and empty the waiting legionary guards tossed keys to the barbarians chains to the shackled men waiting behind their shields with drawn swords as the prisoners freed themselves from the ram some of the barbarians gathered their chains to use as crude weapons while others simply looked about them at the roman troops gathered to all sides in a combination of hatred and simple terror with the last of them freed the centurion pointed his sword at the gateway go go and earn your freedom for a moment longer the prisoners hesitated until a shaggyhaired giant who had hefted the rams heavy nose with straining muscles bellowed his defiance and loped forward into the fort triggering a collective howl of anger and a sudden mad charge from the men behind him as the last of the barbarians vanished through the gateway julius flashed his sword down advance the four centuries trotted quickly towards the smashed gates opening flinching involuntarily as the bolt throwers on the hill behind them spat their heavy missiles over their heads in a salvo of shrieking iron as marcus rounded the gateway and stepped over the fallen gates shattered timbers a falling man rebounded from the palisade in front of him and hit the ground with a wet crunch of shattered bones a bolt buried deeply in his chest he stepped forward and hacked reflexively at the dying mans head to make sure of the kill then stared up and down the curved face of the inner wall there seemed to be no other target for his sudden urgent need to take his blade to another enemy only the halfnaked barbarian prisoners milling about between the walls to either side of them and a few scattered corpses of the bolt throwers earlier targets he started as a scream sounded from the rampart to his rear suddenly feeling horridly vulnerable to whatever was happening above and behind him instinctively raising his shield as he spun to face the outer wall he felt a clanging thud as a spear intended for his back found only the iron boss in the shields centre the spearman howled his frustration at the miss then staggered forward off the wall and turned a neat halfsomersault to the ground with an arrow buried in his neck the price of standing to make the throw a flicker of movement caught marcuss eye a mob of a hundred or more barbarians streaming round the forts inner wall from his right waving swords and axes in the air as they charged towards their attackers with berserk howls they ripped through the barbarian prisoners without mercy clearly aware of their former allies need for redemption through victory and taking no chances with their loyalties for whatever reason and whether it made sense or not the defenders had committed most of their strength to meeting the tungrian attack head on any chance that the legion cohorts would be bearing the brunt of the battle once the auxiliaries had broken the forts first line of defence was clearly no longer a reality dubnus had seen the barbarian charge and stepped forward with a bellowed command that cut through the moments confusion form a line a good part of the th century was through the gate already and in seconds they had an unbroken wall of shields raised across the gap between the first and second palisades the other centuries clustering to their rear in the thin space between the walls the wave of attackers crashed into them hammering at the shield wall with swords and axes while the tungrians held them at bay and stabbed back at them with practised skill aiming killing blows at their throats bellies and thighs stuck behind the line marcus craned his neck to see what was happening behind the forts enraged defenders as he watched the massively built prisoner who had headed the first wave of attackers through the gateway got back to his feet a dozen paces behind the rearmost enemy warrior a red smear across his forehead indicated that one of the defenders had clubbed him to the ground without taking the precaution of checking that the blow had been sufficient to put him out of the combat he was pointing to something that was out of sight to marcus around the inner walls curve bellowing words that were inaudible over the battles cacophony of screams and curses with a sudden flash of insight marcus realised what he must be pointing at the next gate he turned to dubnus pointing urgently past the seething mob of barbarians on the other side of their shield wall the second gates open give me ten men quickly he sheathed his spatha and tossed the shield aside climbing nimbly up the rough wooden ladder that led on to the walls wooden fighting platform with a sudden burst of energy born of his realisation that the way to the heart of the fort had been left open behind the mass of warriors throwing themselves on to the tungrians shields climbing on to the narrow platform he looked out for a moment across the ridge back to the legion cohorts waiting in the afternoons sunshine their standards gleaming prettily in the sunlight he waved down at the syrian archers with the agreed crossedfists gesture to indicate that the wall was taken the signal to stop shooting at anything that moved along the walls length the archers centurion waved back barking to his men to stand down and another man joined marcus on the rampart his face dimly remembered from his time commanding the th century earlier that summer their eyes met and as marcus raised a hand to beckon him on down the wall in his wake a hot spray of the soldiers blood stung his eyes a heavy bolt had opened his throat with the precision of a surgeons scalpel the mans blood fountaining across marcuss mail armour as the soldier toppled choking back into space and fell on to the men fighting below them another bolt slammed into the timber an inch below the top of the wall directly in line with marcuss stomach and the third screamed past his head with a handspan to spare and no more burying itself in the rough timber of the second palisade another man climbed on to the wall and marcus recognised scarface a th century soldier with little respect for the cohorts officers best keep you fuckin head down centurion or those legion tosspotsll put a dart clean through it marcus nodded ducking below the rampart and beckoning the other man on follow me he scuttled off down the line of the rampart bent almost double slipping and almost falling on a patch of stillwet blood and looked back to make sure that the men who had climbed up after him were following thirty paces around the outer palisades curve from the point he had climbed up he dropped from the platforms eightfoot elevation to land beside the massively muscled prisoner drawing both swords as the man spoke in rough latin his voice a bass rumble gate open we close they trap marcus nodded beckoning his men to jump down whats your name the briton spoke without taking his eyes from the open gate lugos come with me lugos i may need someone that speaks the language and youll be safer with us than staying here if this works youll be a free man by the end of this fight the big barbarian nodded curtly and marcus led his small party along the curve of the inner palisade to the gate still open despite the obvious risk to the forts security marcus peeped round its timber frame seeing a cluster of a dozen warriors standing next to the much smaller opening in the forts third and last wall he pulled his head back speaking quickly to his men theres only one more gate its still open and theyve only left a few men to guard it weve already captured this one and if we can stop them closing that one weve got the fort at our mercy are you with me the three th century men who had followed him nodded readily scarface glaring round at his comrades in a way they knew only too well while the three others from other centuries and therefore less used to his way of doing things stared back with a mixture of uncertainty and apprehension it would have to do the barbarian had acquired a spear from somewhere and stared down at him without any visible expression very well gentlemen lets go and win ourselves a fort he threw himself round the gates wooden frame and shouted a challenge at the warriors guarding the last gate wanting them to see the small number of men charging along the wall at them with a single officer at their head they dithered for a moment caught between the need to deny the romans the gate they were entrusted to guard and the opportunity to kill their enemy and in that time his sprinting pace halved the distance between them glancing back he saw that only the barbarian his three former soldiers and one other man had joined him but it was too late to do anything but face the enemy warriors suddenly confident as they realised that they outnumbered their roman attackers by two to one and came forward with their swords drawn jinking to right and left marcus batted aside the leading warriors swordthrust with the long blade of his spatha and hit the man hard with his right shoulder punching him back into the men behind him and gaining a moments confusion in which his small group could gather their strength spinning away from the tangled knot of barbarians he readied himself to take on another warrior only to see lugos leap at his intended victim with a bloodcurdling howl spitting him through the guts with a downward lunge of the spear he had found and leaving it buried deep in the man taking the sword from his nerveless fingers he raised the weapon over his head and hacked it down into another warriors unprotected head his eyes bulging wide with the bloodlust marcus dragged his gaze from the spectacle in time to parry a swordblow from his left with the gladius short blade spinning to his right and chopping the spathas heavy blade through his attackers spine severing the mans head in a shower of gore the headless corpse toppled stiffly backwards to the turf the other tungrian soldiers were in the fight now crowding in behind scarfaces lead and the gate guards were abruptly on the defensive as they found their strength almost halved marcus looked beyond them to the last gate knowing that their unexpected run of luck could still end in stalemate if the men remaining inside managed to get it closed the eightfoot timbers of the forts innermost palisade were more than stout enough to hold off the attackers for long enough for the remaining occupants to have time to make their escape over the walls on the forts far side and down the steep slopes into the surrounding wild forest whose secret paths only they knew scarface hold them you he pointed at the panting lugos hooking a thumb at the last gate with me the other man nodded understanding the roman officers purpose if not his words and the pair burst past the knot of fighting men and ran hard for the gate a single man hurried through the gap just as they reached it drawn by the sounds of battle and died on the barbarians sword without ever quite comprehending how badly the forts defence was undone the slippery rope of his guts falling through his torn stomach wall as lugos pushed him back against the timber rampart and lunged at him again shoving the swords blade up into his chest to skewer his heart marcus burst through the gate and stopped his swords held ready to fight as he took in the scene before him a wideopen space crowned the hills crest perhaps fifty paces in diameter and surrounded on all sides by the final wooden palisade a single timberbuilt hall stood against the enclosures far wall and the open space between gate and building was studded with smoking cooking pits and the scattered remnants of their last meal a single warrior stood outside the hall and as marcus stood breathing heavily in the gateway he shouted something through the door behind him a massively built warrior stalked through the doorway a fighting axe held in one hand and a round shield in the other the thick gold torc around his bull neck marking him as the tribes king he stood for a moment taking in the sudden reality of his defeat before setting off towards marcus at a lumbering trot with his bodyguard running alongside him the centurion looked back at the gateway behind him seeing that the prisoner was still the only man to have reached as far into the enemys defences he stabbed his spathas long blade into the grass at his feet pointing to the gate and chopping at the air with a bladed hand destroy the gate
