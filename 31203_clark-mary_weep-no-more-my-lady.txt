before her retirement helped me to plan this new book and christened it with the title weep no more my lady prologue july the kentucky sun was blazing hot eightyearold elizabeth huddled in a corner of the narrow porch trying to tuck herself into the thin band of shade from the overhang her hair was heavy on her neck even though she had tied it back with a ribbon the street was deserted almost everyone was taking a sundayafternoon nap or had gone to the local pool she wanted to go swimming too but she knew better than to ask her mother and matt had been drinking all day and theyd begun to quarrel she hated it when they fought especially in summer when the windows were open all the kids would stop playing and listen todays fight had been really loud her mother had screamed bad words at matt until he hit her again now they were both asleep sprawled on the bed with no cover on them the empty glasses on the floor beside them she wished her sister leila didnt work every saturday and sunday before she took the sunday job leila used to call ittheirday and shed taken elizabetharound with her most of the nineteenyearold girls like leila were hanging around with boys but leila never did she was going to go to new york to be an actress not get stuck in lumber creek kentucky the trouble with these hick towns sparrow is that everybody marries right out of high school and ends up with whiny little kids and pablum all over their cheerleader sweaters that wont be me elizabeth liked to hear leila talk about how it would be when she was a star but it was scary too she couldnt imagine living in this house with mama and matt without leila it was too hot to play quietly she stood up and smoothed her tshirt under the waistband of her shorts she was a thin child with long legs and a spray of freckles across her nose her eyes were wideset and maturequeen solemn face leila called her leila was always making up names for peoplesometimes funny names sometimes if she didnt like the people pretty mean ones if anything the inside of the house was hotter than the porch the glaring fouroclock sun shone through the dingy windows onto the couch with its sagging springs and the stuffing that was beginning to come out at the seams and the linoleum floor so old that you couldnt even tell what color it had been cracked and buckled under the sink theyd lived here for four years now elizabeth could vaguely remember the other house in milwaukee it was a little bit bigger with a real kitchen and two bathrooms and a big yard elizabeth was tempted to straighten up the living room but she knew that as soon as matt got up the room would be a mess again with beer bottles and cigar ashes and his clothes dropped where he shed them but maybe it would be worth atry snores unpleasant and gruff came from behind the open door of mamas bedroom she peeked in mama and matt must have made up their fight they were all wrapped up in each other his right leg thrown over her left his face buried in her hair she hoped theyd wake up before leila got home leila hated to see them like that you must bring your friends to visit mama and her fiance shed whisper to elizabeth in her actressy voice show off your elegantbackground leila must be working overtime the drivein was near the beach and sometimes on hot days a couple of the waitresses didnt show up ive got my period theyd whine to the manager on the phonereal bad cramps leila had told her about that and explained what it meant youre only eight and thats young but mama never got around to telling me and when it happened i could hardly walk home my back hurt so much and i thought i was dying i wont let that happen to you and i dont want other kids hinting around like its something crazy elizabethdid the best she could to make the living room look better she pulled down the shades threequarters of the way so that the sun didnt glare so much she emptied the ashtrays and washed the tops of the tables and threw away the beer bottles that matt and mama had emptied before their fight then she went into her room it was just big enough to hold a cot a bureau and a chair with a broken cane seat leila had given her a white chenille bedspread for her birthday and bought a secondhand bookcase which shed painted red and hung on the wall at least half the books in the bookcase were plays elizabeth selected one of her favorites our townleila had played emily last year in high school and shed rehearsed her part with elizabeth so often that elizabeth knew the part too sometimes in arithmetic class shed read a favorite play in her mind she liked it a lot more than chanting times tables she must have dozed off because when she opened her eyes matt was bending over her his breath smelled of tobacco and beer and when he smiled he breathed heavier and that made it worse elizabeth pulled back but there was no way to escape him he patted her leg must be a pretty dull book liz he knew that she liked to be called by her whole name is mama awake i can start to fix supper your mama is going to be sleeping for a while why dont i just have me a little liedown and maybe you and i can read together in an instant elizabeth was pushed against the wall and matt was taking up all the room on the cot she began to squirm i guess ill get up and start to make hamburgers she said trying not to sound scared his grip was tight on her arms give daddy a nice big squeeze first honey youre not my daddy suddenly she felt trapped she wanted to call mama to try to wake her up but now matt was kissingher youre a pretty little girl he said youre going to be a real beauty when you grow up his hand was moving up her leg now i dont likethatshe said like what baby and then over matts shoulder she could see leila in the doorway her green eyes were dark with anger in a second she was across the room pulling matts hair so hard his head yanked back shouting words at him that elizabeth didnt understand and then she screamed bad enough what those other bastards did to me but illkillyou before you start on her matts feet hit the floor with a thud he pulled to one side trying to get away from leila but she kept twisting his long hair so that every move he made hurt he began to yell back at leila and try to hit her mama must have heard the noise because her snoring stopped she came into the room a sheet wrapped around her her eyes circled and bleary her pretty red hair disheveled whats going on here she mumbled in a sleepy angry voice and elizabeth saw the bruise on her forehead you better tell this crazy kid of yours that when im just being nice and reading to her sister she better not act like theres something wrong with it matt sounded mad but elizabeth could tell he was scared and youd better tell this filthy child molester to get out of here or ill call the police with a final tug leila released matts hair stepped around him and sat on the cot with elizabeth hugging her tight mama started to yell at matt then leila started to yell at mama and in the end mama and matt went to their room and kept on fighting then there were long silences when they came out of the room they were dressed and said everything was a misunderstanding and as long as the girls were together theyd just go out for a while after they left leila said want to open a can of soup and maybe fix us a hamburger ive got to do some thinking obediently elizabeth went into the kitchen and prepared the meal they ate in silence and elizabeth realized how glad she was that mama and matt were gone when they were home they were either drinking and kissing or fighting and kissing either way it was awful finally leila said shell never change who mama shes a boozer and if it isnt one guy it will be another until she just runs out of all the men left alive but i cant leave youwith matt leave leila couldnt be leaving so get packed leila said if that creep is starting to paw you youre not safe here were going to take the late bus to new york then she reached over and tousled elizabeth s hair god alone knows how ill manage when we get there sparrow but i promise ill take care ofyou later elizabeth was to remember that moment so clearly leilas eyes emerald green again the anger gone but with a steely look in them leilas slim taut body and catlike grace leilas brilliant red hair brightened even more by the light from the overhead fixture leilas rich throaty voice saying dont be scared sparrow its time to shake the dust of our old kentucky home off our feet then with a defiant laugh leila began to sing weep no more my lady saturday august one pan american flight from rome began to circle on its final approach to kennedy airport elizabeth pressed her forehead against the glass drinking in the brilliance of the sun gleaming on the ocean the distant outline of the manhattan skyscrapers this was the moment she had once loved at the end of a trip the sense of coming home but today she passionately wanted to be able to stay on the plane to go wherever its next destination might be its a lovely sight isnt it when shed boarded the plane the grandmotherlylooking woman next to her had smiled pleasantly and opened her book elizabeth had been relieved the last thing shed anted was a sevenhour conversation with a stranger but now it was all right theyd be landing in a few minutes she agreed that it was a lovely sight this was my third trip to italy her seatmate continued but its the last time ill go in august tourists all over the place and so terribly hot what countries did you visit the plane banked and began its descent elizabeth decided it was just as easy to give a direct answer as to be noncommittal im an actress i was working on a film in venice how exciting my first impression was that you reminded me a little of candy bergen youre just about as tall as she is and have the same lovely blond hair and bluegray eyes should i know your name not at all there was a faint bump as the plane landed on the runway and began taxiing to deter any more questions elizabeth made a business of pulling her carryon bag from under the seat and checking its contents if leila were here she thought there wouldnt be any question about identifying her everyone recognized leila lasalle but leila would have been in first class not coach would have been after all these months it was time the reality of her death set in a newsstand just beyond the customs enclosure had stacks of the earlyafternoon edition of the globe she couldnt help seeing the headline trial begins september the lead read a visibly angry judge michael harris scathingly denied further postponements in the murder trial of multimillionaire ted winters the rest of the front page was filled with a blowup of teds face there was a stunned bitterness in his eyes a rigid set to his mouth it was a picture snapped after hed learned that the grand jury had indicted him for the murder of his fiancee leila lasalle as the cab sped toward the city elizabeth read the storya rehash of the details of leilas death and the evidence against ted pictures of leila were splashed over the next three pages of the paper leila at a premiere with her first husband leila on safari with her second husband leila with ted leila accepting her oscarstock publicity shots one of them caught elizabeth s eye in it leila had a hint of softness in her smile a suggestion of vulnerability that contrasted with the arrogant tilt of her chin the mocking expression in her eyes half the young girls in america had imitated that expression copied leilas way of tossing her hair back of smiling over her shoulder here we are lady startled elizabeth looked up the cab had stopped in front of the hamilton arms at fiftyseventh street and park avenue the paper slid off her lap she forced herself to try to sound calm im so sorry i gave you the wrong address i want to go to eleventh and fifth i already turned off the meter then start a new fare her hands shook as she fumbled for her wallet she sensed the doorman was approaching and did not raise her eyes she did not want to be recognized unthinkingly she had given leilas address this was the building where ted had murdered leila here in a drunken rage he had pushed her off the terrace of her apartment elizabeth began to shiver uncontrollably at the image she could not banish from her mind leilas beautiful body wrapped in the white satin pajamas her long red hair cascading behind her plummetfog forty stories to the concrete courtyard and always the questions was she conscious how much did she realize how awful those last seconds must have been for her if i had stayed with her elizabeth thought it never would have happened two after a twomonth absence the apartment felt close and stuffy but as soon as she opened the windows a breeze blew in carrying the peculiarly satisfying combination of scents that was so specially new york the pungent aura of the small indian restaurant around the corner a hint of the flowers from the terrace across the street the acrid smell of fumes from the fifth avenue buses a suggestion of sea air from the hudson river for a few minutes elizabeth breathed deeply and felt herself begin to unwind now that she was here it was good to be home the job in italy had been another escape another temporary respite but never out of her mind was the realization that eventually she would have to go to court as a prosecution witness against ted she unpacked quickly and placed her plants in the sink it was clear that the superintendents wife had not honored her promise to water them regularly after plucking away the dead leaves she turned to the mail that was stacked on the diningroom table rapidly she skimmed through it tossing out ads and coupons separating personal letters from bills she smiled eagerly at the beautiful handwriting on one envelope and the precise return address in the upper corner miss dora samuels cypress point spa pebble beach california sammy but before she read that one elizabeth reluctantly opened the businesssize envelope with the return address office of the district attorney the letter was brief it was a confirmation that she would phone assistant district attorney william murphy upon her return on august and make an appointment to review her testimony even reading the newspaper and giving leilas address to the cabbie had not prepared her for the shock of this official notice her mouth went dry the walls seemed to close in around her the hours she had testified at the grand jury hearings flashed through her mind the time she had fainted on the stand after being shown the pictures of leilas body oh god she thought it was starting all over again the phone rang her hello was barely audible elizabeth a voice boomed how are you youre on my mind it was min von schreiber of all people elizabeth instantly felt wearier min had given leila her first modeling job and now she was married to an austrian baron and owned the glamorous cypress point spa in pebble beach california she was an old and dear friend but elizabeth didnt feel up to her today still min was one of the people elizabeth could never say no to elizabeth tried to sound cheerful im fine min a little tired maybe i just got home a few minutes ago dont unpack youre coming to the spa tomorrow morning theres a ticket waiting at the american airlines counter the usual flight jason will pick you up at the airport in san francisco min i cant as myguest elizabeth almost laughed leila had always said those were the three hardest words for min to utter but min no buts when i saw you in venice you looked too thin that damn trial will be hell so come you need rest you need pampering elizabeth could see min her ravenblack hair coiled around her head always assuming in her imperious way that what she wanted was automatically granted after more futile protests in which she listed all the reasons why she should not come could not she heard herself agreeing to mins plans tomorrow then it will be good to see you min she was smiling when she put the receiver down three thousand miles away minna von schreiber waited for the connection to break then immediately began to dial another number when she reached her party she whispered you were right it was easy she agreed to come dont forget to act surprised when you see her her husband entered the room as she was talking he waited until the call was completed then burst out you did invite her then min looked up defiantly yes i did helmut von schreiber frowned his chinablue eyes darkened after all my warnings minna elizabeth could pull this house of cards down around our ears by the end of the week you will regret that invitation as you have never regretted anything in your life elizabeth decided to get her call to the district attorney over with immediately william murphy was obviously glad to hear from her miss lange i just started to sweat you out i told you id be back today i wouldnt have expected to find you in on saturday theres a lot of work we definitely go to trial on september eighth i read that ill need to review your testimony with you so it will be fresh in your mind its never not been in my mind elizabeth said i understand but i have to discuss the kind of questions the defense attorney will ask you i suggest you come in on monday for several hours and then lets plan to have long sessions next weekend you will be around im leaving tomorrow morning she told him cant we talk about everything on friday she was dismayed at the answer id rather have one preliminary meeting its only three oclock you could be down here in a cab in fifteen minutes reluctantly she agreed glancing at sammys letter she decided to wait until she came back to read it at least it would be something to look forward to showering quickly she twisted her hair into a topknot and put on a blue cotton jumpsuit and sandals half an hour later she was sitting across from the assistant district attorney in his crowded office the furniture consisted of his desk three chairs and a row of battleshipgray steel files there were expandable cardboard files piled on his desk on the floor and on top of the metal cabinets william murphy seemed unaware of the messiness of his work spaceor else elizabeth thought he had finally come to terms with what could not be changed a balding chubbyfaced man in his late thirties with a strong new york accent murphy conveyed an impression of keen intelligence and driving energy after the grand jury hearings he had told her that her testimony was the main reason ted had been indicted she knew he considered that high praise now he opened a thick file the people of the state of new york v andrew edward winters iii i know how hard this is for you he said youre going to be forced to relive your sisters death and with that all the pain you experienced and youre going to testify against a man you liked and trusted ted killed leila the man i knew doesnt exist there are no ifs in this case he deprived your sister of her life its my jobwith your helpto see that hes deprived of his freedom the trial will be a terrible ordeal for you but i promise that once its over it will be easier to get on with your own life after you are sworn you will be asked to state your name i know lange is your stage name be sure to tell the jury your legal name is lasalle lets review your testimony again you will be asked if you lived with your sister no when i left college i got my own apartment are your parents living no my mother died three years after leila and i came to new york and i never knew my father now lets review again your testimony starting with the day before the murder i had been out of town for three months with a stock company i got in on friday night march twentyeighth just in time to catch the last preview of leilas play how did you find your sister she was obviously under a terrible strain she kept forgetting her lines her performance was a shambles between acts i went to her dressing room she never drank anything but a little wine and yet she was drinking straight scotch i took it from her and poured it down the sink how did she respond she was furious she was a totally different person she had never been a big drinker but she was suddenly drinking a lot ted came into the dressing room she shouted at both of us to get out were you surprised by her behavior i think it would be more accurate to say that i was shocked did you discuss it with winters he seemed bewildered hed been away a lot too on business yes i suppose so the play went badly it was a disaster leila refused to come out for a curtain call when it was over we went on to elaines who do you mean by we leila ted and craig myself syd and cheryl baron and baroness von schreiber we were all close friends you will be asked to identify these people for the jury syd melnick was leilas agent cheryl manning is a wellknown actress baron and baroness von schreiber own cypress point spa in california min the baronessused to have a model agency in new york she gave leila her first job ted winters everyone knows who he is and he was leilas fiance craig babcock is teds assistant hes executive vicepresident of winters enterprises what happened at elaines there was a dreadful scene someone yelled to leila that hed heard her play was a turkey she went wild she shouted you bet its a turkey but im wringing its neck you hear that everybody i quit then she fired syd melnick she told him he had only stuck her in the play because he wanted his percentagethat for the last couple of years hed been putting her in anything he could because he needed the money elizabeth bit her lip you have to understand this wasnt the real leila oh sure she could get uptight when she was in a new play she was a star a perfectionist but she never behaved like that what did you do we all tried to calm her down but it only made her worse when ted tried to reason with her she took off her engagement ring and threw it across the room how did he respond he was furious but he tried not to show it a waiter brought the ring back and ted slipped it into his pocket he tried to make a joke of it he said something like ill hold it till tomorrow when shes in better shape then we got her to the car and brought her home ted helped me to put her to bed i told him id have her call him in the morning when she woke up now on the stand ill ask you what their living arrangements were he had his own apartment on the second floor in the same building i spent the night with leila she slept past noon when she woke up she felt rotten i gave her aspirin and she went back to bed i phoned ted for her he was in his office he asked me to tell her hed come up about seven oclock that evening elizabeth felt her voice quaver im sorry to have to keep going but try to think of this as a rehearsal the more prepared you are the easier it will be for you when you are actually on the stand its all right did you and your sister discuss the previous night no it was obvious she didnt want to talk about it she was very quiet she told me to go to my place and get settled i had literally dropped my bags home and rushed to her play she asked me to call her around eight and wed have dinner together i assumed she meant she and ted and i would have dinner together but then she said she wasnt going to take his ring back she was through with him miss lange this is very important your sister told you she was planning to break her engagement to ted winters yes elizabeth stared down at her hands she remembered how she had put those hands on leilas shoulders then run them across leilas forehead oh stop it leila you dont mean that but i do sparrow no you dont have it your way sparrow but call me around eightokay the last moment of being with leila of putting the cold compress on her forehead of tucking the blankets around her and thinking that in a few hours shed be herself again laughing and amused and ready to tell the story so i fired syd and threw teds ring and quit the play hows that for a fast two minutes in elaines and then shed throw back her head and laugh and in retrospect it would suddenly become funnya star having a public tantrum i let myself believe it because i wanted to believe it elizabeth heard herself telling william murphy in a rush she began the rest of her testimony i phoned at eight leila and ted were arguing she sounded as if shed been drinking again she asked me to call back in an hour i did she was crying they were still quarreling she had told ted to get out she kept saying she couldnt trust any man she didnt want any man she wanted me to go away with her how did you respond i tried everything i tried to calm her i reminded her that she always got uptight when she was in a new show i told her the play was really a good vehicle for her i told her ted was crazy about her and she knew it then i tried acting angry i told her elizabeth s voice faltered her face paled i told her she sounded just like mama in one of her drunks what did she say it was as if she hadnt heard me she just kept saying im finished with ted youre the only one i can ever trust sparrow promise youll go away with me elizabeth no longer tried to check the tears that welled in her eyes she was crying and sobbing and then ted came back he began shouting at her william murphy leaned forward the warmth disappeared from his voice now miss lange this will be a crucial point in your testimony on the stand before you can say whose voice you heard i have to lay a foundation so that the judge is satisfied that you truly recognized that voice so this is how well do it he paused dramatically question you heard a voice yes elizabeth said tonelessly how loud was that voice shouting what was the tone of that voice angry how many words did you hear that voice say in her mind elizabeth counted them eleven words two sentences now miss lange had you ever heard that voice before hundreds of times teds voice was filling her ears ted laughing calling to leila hey star hurry up im hungry ted deftly protecting leila from an overly enthusiastic admirer get in the car honey quick ted coming to her own opening performance last year off broadway im to memorize every detail to tell leila i can wrap it all up in three words you were sensational what was mr murphy asking her miss lange did you recognize whose voice shouted at your sister absolutely miss lange whose voice was that shouting in the background it was teds ted winters what did he shout unconsciously she raised her own voice put that phone down i told you put that phone down did your sister respond yes elizabeth stirred restlessly do we have to go through this it will be easier for you if you get used to talking about it before the trial now what did leila say she was still sobbing she said get out of here youre not a falcon and then the phone slammed down she slammed the phone down i dont know which one of them did it miss lange does the word falcon mean anything to you yes leilas face filled elizabeth s mind the tenderness in leilas eyes when she looked at ted the way she would go up and kiss him god falcon i love you why it was teds nickname my sisters pet name for him she did that you see the people close to hershe gave them special names did she ever call anyone else by that namethe name falcon no never abruptly elizabeth got up and walked to the window it was grimy with dust the faint breeze was hot and muggy she thought longingly of getting away from here only a few minutes more i promise miss lange do you know what time the phone was slammed down precisely nine thirty are you absolutely sure yes there must have been a power failure when i was away i reset my clock that afternoon im sure it was right what did you do then i was terribly upset i had to see leila i ran out it took me at least fifteen minutes to get a cab it was after ten when i got to leilas apartment and there was no one there no i tried to phone ted there was no answer at his place i just waited waited all night not knowing what to think halfworried halfrelieved hoping that leila and ted had made up and were out somewhere not knowing that leilas broken body was lying in the courtyard the next morning when the body was discovered you thought she must have fallen from the terrace it was a rainy march night why would she have gone out there she loved to go out and stand and just look at the city in any weather i used to tell her to be careful that railing wasnt very high i thought she must have leaned over she had been drinking she fell she remembered together she and ted had grieved hands entwined they had wept at the memorial service later he had held her when she could no longer control her racking sobs i know sparrow i know he said comforting her on teds yacht they had sailed ten miles out to sea to scatter leilas ashes and then two weeks later an eyewitness had come forth and sworn she had seen ted push leila off the terrace at nine thirtyone without your testimony that witness sally ross could be destroyed by the defense she heard william murphy saying as you know she has a history of severe psychiatric problems its not good that she waited that length of time before coming forward with her story the fact that her psychiatrist was out of town and she wanted to tell him first at least explains it somewhat without my testimony its her word against teds and he denies going back up to leilas apartment when she had heard about the eyewitness she had been outraged she had totally trusted ted until this man william murphy told her that ted denied going back to leilas apartment you can swear that he was there that they were quarreling that the phone was slammed down at nine thirty sally ross saw leila pushed off the terrace at nine thirtyone teds story that he left leilas apartment at about ten after nine went to his own apartment made a phone call then took a cab to connecticut doesnt hold up in addition to what you and that other woman testify we also have a strong circumstantial case the scratches on his face his skin tissue under leilas fingernails the testimony of the cabbie that he was white as a sheet and tremblinghe could hardly give directions to his place and why the hell didnt he send for his own chauffeur to take him to connecticut because he was in a panic thats why he cant come forward with proof of anyone he reached on the phone he has a motiveleila rejected him but one thing you have to realize the defense will harp on the fact that you and ted winters were so close after her death we were the two people who loved her best elizabeth said quietly or at least i thought we were please can i go now well leave it at that you do look pretty beat this is going to be a long trial and it wont be pleasant try to relax next week have you decided where youll be staying these next few days yes baroness von schreiber has invited me to be her guest at cypress point spa i hope youre joking elizabeth stared at him why would i joke about that murphys eyes narrowed his face flushed and his cheekbones suddenly became prominent he seemed to be struggling not to raise his voice miss lange i dont think you appreciate the seriousness of your position without you the other witness would be annihilated by the defense that means that your testimony is about to put one of the richest and most influential men in this country in prison for at least twenty years and thirty if i can make murder two stick if this were a mafia case id have you hidden away in a hotel under an assumed name and with a police guard until this trial is over baron and baroness von schreiber may be friends of yours but theyre also friends of ted winters and are coming to new york to testify for him and you seriously propose to stay with them at this time i know that min and the baron are testifying as character witnesses for ted elizabeth said they dont think hes capable of murder if i hadnt heard him with my own ears i wouldnt have believed it either theyre following their conscience im following mine we all do what we have to do she was not prepared for the tirade murphy let loose at her his urgent sometimes sarcastic words pounded in her ears theres something fishy about that invitation you should see that for yourself you claim the von schreibers loved your sister then ask yourself why the hell theyre going to bat for her murderer i insist you keep away from them if not for my sake or your own neck then because you want justice for leila in the end embarrassed at his obvious contempt for her naivete elizabeth agreed to call off the trip promised that instead shed go to east hampton and there either visit friends or stay in a hotel whether youre alone or with someone be careful murphy told her now that he had gotten his way he attempted a smile but it froze on his face and the expression in his eyes was both grim and worried never forget that without you as a witness ted winters walks even with the oppressive mugginess elizabeth decided to walk home she felt like one of those punching bags that were weighted with sand and flopped from side to side unable to avoid the blows rained on them she knew the district attorney was right she should have refused mins invitation she decided she wouldnt contact anyone in the hamptons shed check into a hotel and just lie on the beach quietly for the next few days leila had always joked sparrow youll never need a shrink put you in a bikini dunk you in the briny and youre in heaven it was true she remembered her delight in showing leila her blue ribbons for swimming eight years ago shed been a runnerup for the olympic team for four summers shed taught water aerobics at cypress point spa along the way she stopped to pick up groceries just enough to have a salad for dinner and a quick breakfast as she walked the last two blocks home she thought of how remote everything seemedas if she were seeing her whole life before leilas death through the far lens of a telescope sammys letter was on top of the mail on the dinette table elizabeth reached for the envelope and smiled at the exquisite handwriting it so vividly brought sammy to mindthe frail birdlike figure the wise eyes owlish behind rimless glasses the laceedged blouses and sensible cardigans sammy had answered leilas ad for a parttime secretary ten years ago and within a week had become indispensable after leilas death min had hired her as a receptionistsecretary at the spa elizabeth decided to read the letter over dinner it took only a few minutes to change into a light caftan fix a salad and pour a glass of chilled chablis okay sammy time for our visit she thought as she slit the envelope the first page of the letter was predictable dear elizabeth i hope this finds you well and as content as possible each day i seem to miss leila more and can only imagine how you feel i do think that after tne trial is behind you it will get better working for min has been good for me although i think i will be giving it up soon i really have never recovered from that operation elizabeth turned the page read a few lines then as her throat closed pushed aside the salad as you know ive continued to answer the letters from leilas fans there are still three large bags to finish the reason i am writing is i have just found a very troubling anonymous letter it is vicious and apparently was one in a series leila had not opened this one but she must have seen its predecessors perhaps they would explain why she was so distraught those last weeks what is so terrible is that the letter i found was clearly written by someone who knew her well i had thought to enclose it in this envelope but am not sure who is collecting your mail while you are away and would not want this seen by a strangers eyes will you call me as soon as you return to new york my love to you sammy with a growing sense of horror elizabeth read and reread sammys letter leila had been receiving unsigned very troubling vicious letters from someone who knew her well sammy who never exaggerated thought they might explain leilas emotional collapse for all these months elizabeth had lain awake trying to understand what had driven leila into hysteria poisonpen letters from someone who knew her well who why did sammy have any inkling she grabbed the phone and dialed the office at the spa let sammy answer she prayed but it was min who picked up the receiver sammy was away she told elizabeth she was visiting her cousin somewhere near san francisco and would be back monday night youll see her then mins tone became curious you sound upset elizabeth is it something about sammy that cant wait it was the moment to tell min that she was not coming elizabeth started to say min the district attorney then she glanced down at sammys letter the overwhelming need to see sammy swept over her it was the same kind of compulsion that had sent her rushing to leila that last fateful night she changed the sentence no hurry at all min ill see you tomorrow before she went to bed she wrote a note to william murphy with the address and phone number of the spa then she tore it up to hell with his warning she wasnt a mafia witness she was going to visit old friendspeople she loved and trusted people who loved and cared about her let him think she was in east hampton he had known for months that it would be necessary to kill elizabeth he had lived with the everpresent knowledge of the danger that she represented and had planned to eliminate her in new york with the trial coming her mind must be constantly reliving every moment of those last days inevitably she would realize what she alreadyknewthe fact that would seal his fate there were ways to get rid of her at the spa and make it seem to be an accident her death would cause less official suspicion in california than in new york he thought about her and her habits looking for a way he consulted his watch it was

thoughts baron and baroness helmut von schreiber one mins longtime chauffeur jason was waiting at the passenger gate his silvergray uniform gleaming in the sunny terminal he was a small man with a trim neat build who had been a jockey in his youth an accident had ended his racing career and he had been working as a stable hand when min hired him elizabeth knew that like all of mins people he was intensely loyal to her now his leathery face broke into welcoming furrows as he saw her approach miss lange its good to have you back he said she wondered if like her he was remembering that the last time she came to the spa she had been with leila she bent over to kiss him on the cheek jason will you cut that miss lange number youd think i was a paying guest or something she noticed the discreet card in his hand with the name alvirah meehan on it youre picking up someone else just one i thought shed be out by now firstclass passengers usually are elizabeth reflected that few people economized on air fare when they could afford to pay a minimum of three thousand dollars a week at cypress point spa with jason she studied the disembarking passengers jason held the card up prominently as several elegantly dressed women passed but they ignored it hope she didnt miss the flight he was murmuring as one final straggler came from the passageway she was a bulky woman of about fiftyfive with a large sharpfeatured face and thinning reddishbrown hair the purpleandpink print she was wearing was obviously expensive but absolutely wrong for her it bulged at the waist and thighs and hiked unevenly over her knees intuitively elizabeth sensed that this lady was mrs alvirah meehan she spotted her name on the card and approached them eagerly her smile delighted and relieved reaching out she pumped jasons hand vigorously well here i am she announced and boy am i glad to see you i was so afraid thered be a foulup and no one would meet me oh we never fail a guest elizabeth felt her lips twitch at jasons bewildered expression clearly mrs meehan was not the usual cypress point guest maam may i have your claim checks oh thats nice i hate to wait for luggage sort of a pain in the neck at the end of a trip course willy and i usually go greyhound and the bags are right there but even so i dont have too much stuff i was going to buy a lot but my friend may said alvirah wait and see what other people are wearing all these fancy places have shops youll pay through the nose she said but at least youll get the right thing you know what i mean she thrust her ticket envelope with the baggage stubs at jason and turned to elizabeth im alvirah meehan are you going to the spa too you sure dont look like you need to honey fifteen minutes later they were settled in the sleek silver limousine alvirah settled back against the brocaded upholstery with a gusty sigh now that feels good she announced elizabeth studied the other womans hands they were the hands of a working person thickknuckled and callused the brightly colored fingernails were short and stubby even though the manicure looked expensive her curiosity about alvirah meehan was a welcome respite from thinking about leila instinctively she liked the womanthere was something remarkably candid and appealing about her but who was she what was bringing her to the spa i still cant get used to it alvirah continued happily i mean one minute im sitting in my living room soaking my feet let me tell you cleaning five different houses a week is no joke and the friday one was the killersix kids and theyre all slobs and the mothers worse then we hit the lottery we had all the winning numbers willy and i couldnt believe it willy i said were rich and he yelled you bet we are you must have read about it last month forty million dollars and a minute before we didnt have two quarters to rub together you won forty million dollars in the lottery im surprised you didnt see it were the biggest single winners in the history of the new york state lottery how about that i think its wonderful elizabeth said sincerely well i knew what i wanted to do right away and that was to get to cypress point spa ive been reading about it for ten years now i used to dream about how it would be to spend time there and hobnob with the celebrities usually you have to wait months for a reservation but i got one just like that she snapped her fingers because min undoubtedly recognized the publicity value of alvirah meehans telling the world about her lifelong ambition to go to the spa elizabeth thought min never missed a trick they were on the coastal highway i thought this was supposed to be a beautiful drive alvirah said it dont look so hot to me a little farther on it becomes breathtaking elizabeth murmured alvirah meehan straightened up in the seat and turned to elizabeth studying her intently by the way ive been talking so much i missed your name elizabeth lange large brown eyes already magnified by thickrimmed glasses widened perceptibly i know who you are youre leila lasalles sister she was my favorite actress in the whole world i know all about leila and you i think the story of the two of you coming to new york when you were just a little girl is so beautiful two nights before she died i saw a preview of her last play oh im sorryi didnt mean to upset you its all right i just have a terrible headache maybe if i just rest a bit elizabeth turned her head toward the window and dabbed at her eyes to understand leila you had to have lived that childhood that trip to new york the fear and the disappointments and you had to know that however good it sounded in people magazine it wasnt a beautiful story at all it was a fourteenhour bus ride from lexington to new york elizabeth slept curled up in her seat her head on leilas lap she was a little scared and it made her sad to think of mama coming home to find them gone but she knew matt would say have a drink honey and pull mama into the bedroom and in a little while theyd be laughing and squealing and the springs of the bed would creak andgroan leila told her which states they were going through maryland delaware new jersey then the fields were replaced with ugly tanks and the road got more and more crowded at the lincoln tunnel the bus kept stopping and starting elizabeth s stomach began to feel kind of funnyleila noticed good god sparrow dont get sick now its just another few minutes she couldnt wait to get off the bus she just wanted to smell cool clean air but the air was heavy and it was so hothotter even than at home elizabeth felt fretful and tired she was about to complain but then she saw how tired leila looked they had just left the platform when a man came over to leila he was thin and his dark hair was curly but started pretty far back he had long sideburns and small brown eyes that got squinty when he smiled im lon pedsell he said are you the model the arbitron agency from maryland sent of course leila wasnt the model but elizabeth could tell she didnt want to just say no there wasnt anyone else my age on this bus was the way she answered him and obviously you are amodel im anactress the man brightened up as though leila had given him a present this is a break for me and i hope for you if you can use a modeling job youd be perfect the pay is one hundred dollars for thesitting leila put down her bags and squeezed elizabeth s shoulder it was her way of saying let me do thetalking i can tell that youre agreeable lon pedsell said come on ive got my car outside elizabethwas surprised at his studio when leila talked about new york shed thought that every place leila worked would be beautiful but lon pedsell took them to a dirty street about six blocks from the bus terminal lots of people were sitting on stoops and garbage was spilled all over the sidewalk i have to apologize for my temporary situation he said i lost the lease on my place across town and the new one is still beingequipped the apartment he brought them to was on the fourth floor and as messy as mamas house lon was breathing hard because he insisted on carrying the two big suitcases why dont i get a coke for your sister and she can watch television while you pose he said to leila elizabethcould tell that leila just wasnt sure what to do what kind of model am i supposed to be she asked its for a new swimsuit line actually im doing the test shots for the agency the girl they choose will do a whole series of ads youre pretty lucky you ran into me today i have a hunch youre just the type they have inmind he brought them into the kitchen it was a tiny dingy room with a small television set on a ledge over the sink he poured a coke for elizabeth and wine for leila and himself ill have a coke leila said suit yourself he turned on the television set now elizabeth im going to close the door so leila can concentrate you just stay here and keep yourselfamused elizabethwatched three programs sometimes she could hear leila saying in a loud voice i dont like that idea but she didnt sound scared just kind of worried after a while she came out im finished sparrow lets get our bags then she turned to lon do you know where we can get a furnished room would you like to stay here no just give me my hundreddollars if youll sign this release when leila signed he smiled over at elizabeth you must be proud of your big sister shes on her way to becoming a famous model leila handed him the paper give me the hundred dollars oh the agency will pay you heres their card just go over in the morning and theyll issue acheck but yousaid leila you really are going to have to learn the business photographers dont pay models the agency pays when it gets therelease he didnt offer to help them carry down their bags a hamburger and milk shake at a restaurant called chock full o nuts made both of them feel better leila had bought a street map of new york city and a newspaper she began to read the real estate section heres an apartment that sounds about right penthouse fourteen rooms spectacular view wraparound terrace someday sparrow i promise they found an ad for an apartment to share leila looked at the street map it doesnt look too bad she said ninetyfifth street and west end avenue isnt that far and we can get a bus the apartment turned out to be okay but the womans nice smile disappeared when she learned that elizabeth was part of the deal no kids she said flatly it was the same everywhere they went finally at seven oclock leila asked a cabdriver if he knew of any cheap but decent place to stay where she could bring elizabeth he suggested a rooming house in greenwich village the next morning they went to the model agency on madison avenue to collect leilas money the door of the agency was locked and a sign read put your composite in the mailbox the mailbox had a halfdozen manila envelopes in it already leila pressed her finger on the bell a voice came over the intercom do you have an appointment were here to pick up my moneyleila said she and the woman began to argue finally the woman shouted get lost leila pressed the bell again and didnt stop until someone yanked the door open elizabeth shrank back the woman had heavy dark hair all done up in braids on her head her eyes were coal black and her whole face was terribly angry the woman wasnt young but she was beautiful her white silk suit made elizabeth realize that the blue shorts she was wearing were faded and the dye on her polo shirt had run around the pocket she had thought leila looked so pretty when they started out but next to this woman leila seemed overdressed and shabby listen the woman said if you want to leave your picture you can you try barging in here again and ill have you arrested leila thrust out the paper in her hand you owe me one hundred dollars and im not leaving without it the woman took the paper read it and began to laugh so hard she had to lean against the door you reallyaredumb those jokers pull that stuff on all you hicks whered he pick you up in the bus terminal did you end up in the sack with him no i did not leila grabbed the paper tore it up and ground the pieces under her heel come on sparrow that guy made a fool of me but we dont have to give this bitch a good laugh about it elizabethcould see that leila was so upset she was about to cry and didnt want the woman to see it she shook leilas arm off her shoulder and stood in front of the woman i think youre mean she said that man acted nice and if he made my sister work for nothing you should feel sorry about it not make fun of us she spun around and tugged leilas handsletsgo they started for the elevator and the woman called after them come on back you two they ignored her then she yelled isaidcome back two minutes later they were in her private office youve got possibilities the woman told leila but those clothes you dont know a thing about makeup youll need a good haircut youll need composites did you pose in the raw for thatcreep yes terrific if youre any good ill submit you for an ivory soap commercial and right then is when your picture will show up in a girlie magazine he didnt take any movies of you did he no at least i dont thinkso thats something from now on i do the booking for you they left in a daze leila had a list of appointments at a beauty salon for the next day then she would meet the woman from the model agency at the photographers call me min the woman had said and dont worry about clothes ill bring everything you need elizabeth was so happy her feet could hardly touch the ground but leila was very quiet they walked down madison avenue welldressed people hurried by the sun was shining brightly hot dog carts and pretzel stands seemed to be on every corner buses and cars honked at each other nearly everyone ignored the red lights and sauntered through the heavy traffic elizabeth had a wonderful sense of being home i like it here she said so do i sparrow and you saved the day for me i swear i dont know whos taking care of who and min is good people but sparrow theres something ive found out from that stinking father of mine and from mamas lousy boyfriends and now from that bastard yesterday sparrowim never going to trust a man again two elizabeth opened her eyes the car was sliding noiselessly past pebble beach lodge along the treelined road where glimpses of estate homes could be seen through hedges of bougainvillea and azaleas it slowed down as it rounded a bend and the tree that gave cypress point spa its name came into view disoriented for a moment she brushed the hair back from her forehead and looked around alvirah meehan was beside her a blissful smile on her face you must be worn out poor thing alvirah said youve been asleep practically since we left the airport she shook her head as she gazed out the window now this is really something the car passed through the ornate iron gates and wound its way up toward the main house a rambling threestory ivory stucco mansion with pale blue shutters several swimming pools were dotted through the grounds near the clusters of bungalows at the north end of the property there was a patio with umbrella tables scattered around both sides of the olympicsize pool identical adobe buildings were on either side of the pool these are the mens and womens spas elizabeth explained the clinic a smaller edition of the main house was at its right a series of paths lined by high flowering hedges led to individual doorways the treatment rooms were entered through these doors and treatments were spaced far enough apart so that guests avoided encountering each other then as the limousine followed the curve of the driveway elizabeth gasped and leaned forward between the main house and the clinic but placed well behind them a huge new structure had come into view its black marble exterior accentuated by massive columns making it loom like an ominous volcano about to erupt or like a mausoleum elizabeth thought whats that alvirah meehan asked its a replica of a roman bath they had just broken ground for it when i was here two years ago jason is it open yet not finished miss lange the construction just goes on and on leila had openly mocked the plans for the bathhouse another of helmuts grand schemes for separating min from her money she said he wont be happy until min is officially declared a shoppingbag lady the car stopped at the steps of the main house jason leaped out and rushed to open the door alvirah meehan struggled back into her shoes and stooping awkwardly hoisted herself from the seat its like sitting on the floor she commented oh look here comes mrs von schreiber i know her from her pictures or should i call her baroness elizabeth did not answer she stretched out her arms as min descended the steps from the veranda her gait rapid but stately leila had always compared min in motion to the qe steaming into harbor min was wearing a deceptively simple adolfo print her luxurious dark hair was piled on her head in a swirling french knot she pounced on elizabeth and hugged her fiercely youre much too thin she hissed in a swimsuit i bet you look scrawny another bear hug and min turned her attention to alvirah mrs meehan the worlds luckiest woman we are enchanted to have you she eyed alvirah up and down in two weeks the world will think you were born with a fortymilliondollar spoon in your mouth alvirah meehan beamed thats the way i feel right now elizabeth you go up to the office helmut is waiting to see you ill escort mrs meehan to her bungalow then join you obediently elizabeth went into the main house and walked through the cool marblefloored foyer past the salon the music room the formal dining rooms and up the sweeping staircase that led to the private rooms min and her husband shared a suite of offices that overlooked the front and both sides of the property from there min could observe the movements of guests and staff as they went back and forth between the areas of activity at dinner she was frequently known to admonish a guest you should have been in aerobics when i saw you reading in the garden she also had an uncanny knack of noticing when an employee kept a guest waiting elizabeth knocked softly on the door of the private office suite when there was no answer she opened it like every room in cypress point spa the offices were furnished exquisitely an abstract watercolor by will moses hung on the wall over the oystercolored couch an aubusson rug shimmered on the dark tile the reception desk was authentic louis xv but there was no one seated there she felt an immediate sense of sharp disappointment but reminded herself that sammy would be back tomorrow night tentatively she walked to the partially open door of the office min and the baron shared then gasped in surprise baron helmut von schreiber was standing at the far wall where pictures of mins most famous clients were hung elizabeth s eyes followed him and she bit her lip to keep from crying out it was leilas portrait helmut was studying the one leila had posed for the last time she was here the vivid green of leilas dress was unmistakable the brilliant red hair that floated around her face the way she was holding up a champagne glass as though offering a toast helmuts hands were clasped tightly behind his back everything about his stance suggested tension elizabeth did not want him to know that he had been observed swiftly she retraced her steps to the reception room opened and closed the door with a loud thud then called anyone home an instant later he rushed from the inner office the change in his demeanor was dramatic this was the gracious urbane european she had always known with the warm smile the kiss on both cheeks the murmured compliment elizabeth you grow more beautiful every day so young so fair so divinely tall tall anyhow elizabeth stepped back let me look at you helmut she studied him carefully observing that no trace of tension showed in his babyblue eyes his smile was relaxed and natural his parted lips showed perfect white teeth how had leila described him i swear sparrow that guy makes me think of a toy soldier do you suppose min winds him up in the morning he may have decent ancestry but i bet he never had more than a nickel behind him till he latched on to min elizabethhad protested hes a plastic surgeon and certainly hes knowledgeable about spas the place isfamous it may be famous leila had retorted but it costs a bundle to run and id bet my last dollar even those prices cant carry that overhead listen sparrow i should know ive married two free loaders so far right sure he treats min like a queen but hes putting that tinted head on twohundreddollar pillowcases every night and besides what shes spent on the spa mins dumped a pile of dough into that brokendown castle of his inaustria like everyone else helmut had seemed griefstricken at leilas death but now elizabeth wondered if that had only been an act well tell me am i all right you look so troubled perhaps you have found some wrinkles his laugh was low well bred amused she made herself smile up at him i think you look splendid she said perhaps im just shocked to realize how long its been since ive seen you come he took her hand and led her to the grouping of art deco wicker furniture near the front windows he grimaced as he sat down i keep trying to convince minna that these objects were meant to be seen not used so tell me how has it been for you busy of course thats the way i want it to be why havent you come td see us before this because in this place i knew id be seeing leila everywhere i turned i did see min in venice three months ago and also the spa holds too many memories for you yes it holds memories but ive missed you two and im looking forward to seeing sammy how do you think shes feeling you know sammy she never complains but my guess would benot well i dont think shes ever recovered either from the surgery or from the shock of leilas death and she is past seventy now no great age physiologically but still the outer door closed with a decided thump and mins voice preceded her entrance helmut wait until you see the lottery winner you have your work cut out for you well need to arrange interviews for her shell make this place sound like seventh heaven she rushed across the room and embraced elizabeth fiercely if you knew the nights ive lain awake worrying about you how long can you stay not very long just until friday thats only five days i know but the district attorneys office has to review my testimony elizabeth realized how good it felt to have loving arms around her what do they have to review the questions theyll be asking me at the trial the questions teds lawyer will be asking me i thought telling the simple truth would be enough but apparently the defense will try to prove im mistaken about the time of the phone call do you think you might be mistaken mins lips were grazing her ear her voice a suggestive stage whisper startled elizabeth pulled back from the embrace in time to see the warning frown on helmuts face min do you think if i had the slightest doubt all right min said hastily we shouldnt talk about that now so you have five days youre going to be pampered youre going to rest i made out your schedule myself you start with a facial and massage this afternoon elizabeth left them a few minutes later the slanting rays of the sun danced on the beds of wildflowers along the path to the bungalow min had assigned her somewhere in her subconscious she experienced a sense of calm observing the brilliant checkerblooms the wood roses the flowering currant hedges but the momentary tranquillity could not mask the fact that behind the warm welcome and seeming concern min and helmut were different they were angry and worried and hostile and that hostility was directed at her three syd melnick did not find the drive from beverly hills to pebble beach enjoyable for the entire four hours cheryl manning sat like a stone rigid and uncommunicative in the seat beside him for the first three hours she had not allowed him to put the top down on the convertible she wasnt going to risk drying out her face and hair it was only when they approached carmel and she wanted to be recognized going through town that shed permitted the change occasionally during the long ride syd glanced over at her there was no question she looked good the blueblack hair exploding in a mass of tendrils around her face was sexy and exciting she was thirtysix now and what had once been a gamin quality had evolved into a sultry sophistication that became her well dynasty and dallas were getting long in the tooth audiences eventually got restless there was a definite move to say enough to the steamy love affairs of women in their fifties and in amanda cheryl had finally found the role that could make her a superstar when that happened syd in turn would be a bigtime agent again an author was as good as his last book an actor as bankable as his last picture an agent needed megabucks deals to be considered topflight it was again within his grasp to become a legend the next swifty lazar and this time he told himself he wouldnt screw it up at the casinos or blow it on the horses he would know in a few days if cheryl had the part just before they left at cheryls insistence he had phoned bob koenig at home twentyfive years ago bob fresh out of college and syd a studio gofer had met on a hollywood set and become friends now bob was president of world motion pictures he even looked the part of the new breed of studio head with his rugged features and broad shoulders syd knew that he himself could be typecast for the stereotypical brooklynite with his long slightly mournful face receding curly hair and slight paunch that even rigorous exercise didnt help it was another thing he envied bob koenig for today bob had let his irritation show look syd dont call me at home on a sunday to talk business again cheryl did a damn good test were still seeing other people youll hear one way or another in the next few days and let me give you a tip sticking her in that play last year when leila lasalle died was a lousy judgment call and its a big part of the problem with choosing her calling me at home on sunday is a lousy judgment call too syds palms began to sweat at the memory of the conversation oblivious of the scenery he pondered the fact that he had made the mistake of abusing a friendship if he wasnt more careful everyone he knew would be in conference when he phoned and bob was right he had made a terrible mistake talking cheryl into going into the play with only a few days rehearsal the critics had slaughtered her cheryl had been standing next to him when he called bob shed heard what bob said about the plays being the reason she might not get the part and of course that triggered an explosion not the first one nor the last that goddamn play hed believed in it enough to beg and borrow until he had a million dollars to invest in it it could have been a smash hit and then leila had started boozing and trying to act as if the play were the problem anger parched syds throat all he had done for that bitch and shed fired him in elaines in front of a roomful of showbusiness people cursing him out at the top of her voice and she knew how much hed sunk into the play he only hoped shed been conscious enough to know what was happening before she hit the concrete they were driving through carmel crowds of tourists on the streets the sun bright everybody looking relaxed and happy he took the long way and threaded along the busiest streets he could hear people comment when they started to recognize cheryl now of course she was smiling little miss gracious she needed an audience the way other people needed air and water they reached the gate to pebble beach he paid the toll they drove past pebble beach lodge the crocker woodland to the gates of the spa drop me off at my bungalow cheryl snapped i dont want to bump into anybody until i get myself together she turned to him and pulled off her sunglasses her extraordinary eyes blazed syd what are my chances of becoming amanda he answered the question as he had answered it a dozen times in the last week the best baby he said sincerely the best theyd better be he told himself or it was all over four the westwind banked turned and began its descent into monterey airport with methodical care ted checked the instrument panel it had been a good flight from hawaii smooth air every foot of the way the cloud banks lazy and floating like cotton candy at a circus funny he liked the clouds liked to fly over them and through them but even as a kid he had despised cotton candy one more contradiction in his life in the copilots seat john moore stirred a quiet reminder that he was there if ted elected to turn over the controls to him moore had been the chief pilot for winters enterprises for ten years but ted wanted to make this landing to see how smoothly he could bring the plane in set the wheels down land on his feet it was all one wasnt it craig had come forward an hour ago and urged him to let john take over cocktails are ready at your fahvoreet tahbl in the cornaire monsieur wintairs hed done his flawless imitation of the captain at the four seasons for christs sake ted had snapped no more of your impersonations today i dont need that now craig had known enough not to argue when ted decided to stay at the controls the runway was rushing toward them ted eased the nose of the plane up slightly how much longer would he be free to fly planes to travel to have a drink or not have a drink to function as a human being the trial would begin next week he didnt like his new lawyer henry bartlett was too pompous too conscious of his own image ted could imagine bartlett in a new yorker ad holding up a bottle of scotch the caption reading this is the only brand i ever serve my guests the main wheels touched the ground the impact inside the plane was almost unnoticeable ted threw the engines into reverse nice landing sir john said quietly wearily ted brushed his hand over his forehead he wished he could get john over the habit of calling him sir he also wished he could get henry bartlett over the habit of calling him teddy did all criminal lawyers think that because you need their services they have the right to be condescending an interesting question had circumstances been different he wouldnt have had anything to do with a man like bartlett but firing the man who was supposed to be the best defense lawyer in the country at a time when youre facing a long prison sentence wouldnt be smart he had always thought of himself as smart he wasnt so sure anymore a few minutes later they were in a limousine heading for the spa ive heard a lot about the monterey peninsula bartlett commented as they turned onto highway i still dont see why we couldnt have worked on the case at your place in connecticut or your new york apartment but youre paying the bills were here because ted needs the kind of relaxation he gets at cypress point craig said he did not bother to hide the edge in his voice ted was sitting on the right side of the roomy back seat henry beside him craig had taken the seat facing them next to the bar craig raised the lid of the bar and mixed a martini with a halfsmile he handed it to ted you know mins rules about booze youd better drink up fast ted shook his head i seem to remember another time when i drank up fast have you got a cold beer in there teddy i absolutely have to insist that you stop referring to that night in a way that suggests you dont have complete recall ted turned to look directly at henry bartlett absorbing the mans silver hair his urbane manner the faint hint of an english accent in his voice lets get something straight he said you are not i repeat not to call me teddy again my name in case you dont remember it from that very sizable retainer is andrew edward winters i have always been called ted if you find that too difficult to remember you may call me andrew my grandmother always did nod if you understand what i just said take it easy ted craig said quietly ill take it a lot easier if henry and i establish a few ground rules he felt his hand grip the glass he was unraveling he could feel it these months since the indictment hed managed to keep his sanity by staying at his place in maui doing his own analysis of urban expansion and population trends designing hotels and stadiums and shopping centers he would build when all this was over somehow hed managed to make himself believe that something would happen that elizabeth would realize she was wrong about the time of the phone call that the socalled eyewitness would be declared mentally incompetent but elizabeth was sticking to her story the eyewitness was adamant about her testimony and the trial was looming ted had been shocked when he realized his first lawyer was virtually conceding a guilty verdict that was when he had hired henry bartlett all right lets put this aside until later henry bartlett said stiffly he turned to craig if ted doesnt want a drink i do ted accepted the beer craig held out to him and stared out the window was bartlett right was it crazy to come here instead of just working from connecticut or new york but somehow whenever he was at the spa he had a sense of calm of wellbeing it came from all the summers hed spent on the monterey peninsula when he was a kid the car stopped at the gate to pebble beach onto the seventeen mile drive and the chauffeur paid the toll the estate homes overlooking the ocean came into view once he had planned to buy a house here he and kathy had agreed it would be a good vacation place for teddy and then teddy and kathy were gone on the left side the pacific sparkled clear and beautiful in the bright afternoon sun it wasnt safe for swimming herethe undertow was too strong but how good it would feel to dive in and let the salty water wash over him he wondered if he would ever feel clean again ever stop seeing those pictures of leilas broken body in his thoughts they were always there gigantically enlarged like billboards on a highway and in these last few months the doubts had begun quit thinking whatever youre thinking ted craig said mildly and stop trying to read my thoughts ted snapped then he managed a weak smile sorry no problem craigs tone was hearty and genial craig had always had a knack for defusing situations ted thought theyd met at dartmouth as freshmen craig had been chunky then at seventeen hed looked like a big blond swede at thirtyfour he was trim the chunkiness hardened into solid muscle the strong heavy features were more becoming to a mature man than to a kid craig had had a partial scholarship to college but had worked his backside off at every job he could getas a dishwasher in the kitchen as a room clerk in the hanover inn as an orderly in the local hospital and still hes always been around for me ted reminded himself after college hed been surprised to bump into craig in the washroom at the executive office of winters enterprises why didnt you ask me if you wanted a job here he hadnt been sure he was pleased because if im any good ill make it on my own you couldnt argue with that and hed made it clear up to executive vicepresident if i go to prison ted thought he gets to run the show i wonder how often he thinks about that a sense of disgust at his own mental processes washed over him i think like a cornered rat i am a cornered rat they drove past the pebble beach lodge the golf course the crocker woodland and the grounds of cypress point spa came into view pretty soon youll understand why we wanted to come here craig told henry he looked directly at ted were going to put together an airtight defense you know this place has always been lucky for you then as he glanced out the side window he stüfened oh my god i dont believe it the convertiblecheryl and syd are here grimly he turned to henry bartlett im beginning to think youre right we should have gone to connecticut five min had assigned elizabeth the bungalow where leila had always stayed it was one of the most expensive units but elizabeth was not sure that she was flattered everything in these rooms shouted leilas name the slipcovers in the shade of emerald green leila loved the deep armchair with the matching ottoman leila used to sprawl on that after a strenuous exercise classmy god sparrow if i keep this up they can measure me for a thin shroud the exquisite inlaid writing desksparrow remember the furniture in poor mamas place early garage sale in the short time elizabeth had been with min and helmut a maid had unpacked her bags a blue tank suit and ivory terrycloth robe were lying on the bed pinned to the robe was the schedule of her afternoon appointments four oclock massage five oclock facial the building housing the womens spa facilities was at one end of the olympic poola rambling selfcontained onestory structure built to resemble a spanish adobe placid from the outside it was usually a whirlwind of activity within as women of all ages and shapes hurried along the tiled floors in terrycloth robes rushing to their next appointments elizabeth braced herself to see familiar faces some of the regulars who came to the spa every three months or so and whom she had gotten to know well during her summers working here she knew that inevitably condolences would be offered heads shaken i never would have believed ted winters capable but she did not see one single familiar face in the array of women padding from exercise classes to beauty treatments nor did the spa seem as busy as usual at peak it accommodated about sixty women the mens spa held about the same number there were nothing like that many she reminded herself of the color coding of the doors pink for facial rooms yellow for massage orchid for herbal wraps white for steam cabinets blue for sloofing the exercise rooms were beyond the indoor pool and seemed to have been enlarged there were more individual jacuzzis in the central solarium with a touch of disappointment elizabeth realized it was too late to soak in one of them for even a few minutes tonight she promised herself shed go for a long swim the masseuse who had been assigned to her was one of the oldtimers small of frame but with powerful arms and hands gina was clearly delighted to see her youre coming back to work here i hope of course not no such luck the massage rooms had obviously been done over did min never stop spending money on this place but the new tables were luxuriously padded and under the expert hands of gina she could feel herself begin to relax gina was kneading her shoulder muscles youre in knots i guess i am you have plenty of reason elizabeth knew that that was ginas way of expressing her sympathy she knew too that unless she began a conversation gina would be silent one of mins firm rules to her help was that if guests wanted to talk it was all right to converse with them but dont you be yakking about your own problems min would say at the weekly staff meetings nobody wants to hear them it would be helpful to get ginas impressions of how the spa was doing it doesnt seem to be too busy today she suggested is everybody on the golf course i wish listen this place hasnt been busy in nearly two years relax elizabeth your arm feels like a board two years whats happened what can i say it started with that stupid mausoleum people dont pay these prices to look at mounds of dirt or listen to hammering and that place still isnt finished will you tell me why they needed a roman bath here elizabeth thought of leilas remarks about the roman bath thats what leila used to say she was right ill need to have you turn over now expertly the masseuse redraped the sheet and listen you brought up her name do you realize how much glamour leila gave this place people wanted to be around her theyd come here hoping to see her she was a onewoman ad for the spa and she always talked about meeting ted winters here nowi dont know theres something so different the baron spends money like a maniac you saw the new jacuzzis the interior work on that bathhouse goes on and on and min is trying to cut corners its a joke he puts in a roman bath and she tells us not to waste towels the facialist was new a japanese woman the unwinding that had begun with the massage was completed by the warm mask she applied after the cleansing and steaming elizabeth drifted off to sleep she was awakened by the womans soft voice have you had a nice nap i left you an extra forty minutes you looked so peaceful and i had plenty of time six while the maid unpacked her bags alvirah meehan investigated her new quarters she went from room to room her eyes darting about missing nothing in her mind she was composing what she would dictate into her brandnew recording machine will that be all madame the maid was at the door of the sitting room yes thank you alvirah tried to imitate the tone of her tuesday job mrs stevens a little hoitytoity but still friendly the minute the door closed behind the maid she raced to get her recorder out of her voluminous pocketbook the reporter from the new york globe had taught her how to use it she settled herself on the couch in the living room and began well here i am at cypress point spa and buhlieve me its the cats meow this is my first recording and i want to start by thanking mr evans for his confidence in me when he interviewed me and willy about winning the lottery and i told him about my lifelong ambition to come to cypress point spa he said that i clearly have a sense of the dramatic and the globe readers would love to know all about the goingson in a classy spa from my point of view he said that the kind of people ill be meeting would never think of me as a writer and so i might hear a lot of interesting stuff then when i explained id been a real fan of movie stars all my life and know lots about the private lives of the stars he said he had a hunch i could write a good series of articles and who knows maybe even a book alvirah smiled blissfully and smoothed the skirt of her purpleandpink traveling dress the skirt tended to hike up a book she continued being careful to speak directly into the microphone me alvirah meehan but when you think of all the celebrities who write books and how many of them really stink i believe i just might be able to do that to get to whats happened so far i rode in a limousine to the spa with elizabeth lange she is a lovely young woman and i feel so sorry for her her eyes are very sad and you can tell shes under a big strain she slept practically the whole way from san francisco elizabeth is leila lasalles sister but very different in looks leila was a redhead with green eyes she could look sexy and queenly at the same timekind of like a cross between dolly parton and greer garson i think a good way to describe elizabeth is wholesome shes a little too thin her shoulders are broad she has wide blue eyes with dark lashes and honeycolored hair that falls around her shoulders she has strong beautiful teeth and the one time she smiled she gave off just the warmest glow shes pretty tall about five foot nine i guess i bet she sings her speaking voice is so pleasant but not that exaggerated actressy voice you hear from so many of these young starlets i guess you dont call them starlets anymore maybe if i get friendly with her shell tell me some interesting things about her sister and ted winters i wonder if the globe will want me to cover the trial alvirah paused pushed the rewind button and then the replay it was all right the machine was working she thought she ought to say something about her surroundings mrs von schreiber escorted me to my bungalow i almost laughed out loud when she called it a bungalow we used to rent a bungalow in rockaway beach on ninetyninth street right near the amusement park the place used to shake every time the roller coaster went down the last steep drop which was every five minutes during the summer this bungalow has a sitting room all done in light blue chintz and oriental scatter rugs theyre handmadei checked a bedroom with a canopy bed a small desk a slipper chair a bureau a vanity table filled with cosmetics and lotions and two huge bathrooms each with its own jacuzzi theres also a room with builtin bookshelves a real leather couch and chairs and an oval table upstairs there are two more bedrooms and baths which of course i really dont need luxury i keep pinching myself baroness von schreiber told me that the day starts at seven am with a brisk walk which everyone in the spa is requested to take after that i will be served a lowcalorie breakfast in my own dining room the maid will also bring my personal daily schedule which will include things like a facial a massage a herbal wrap a sloofing treatment whatever that isthe steam cabinet a pedicure and a manicure and a hair treatment imagine after i have been checked out by the doctor they will add my exercise classes now im going to take a little rest and then it will be time to dress for dinner im going to wear my rainbow caftanwhich i bought at marthas on park avenue i showed it to the baroness and she said it would be perfect but not to wear the crystal beads i won at the shooting gallery in coney island alvirah turned off the recorder and beamed in satisfaction who ever said writing was hard with a recorder it was a cinch recorder quickly she got up and reached for her pocketbook from inside a zippered compartment she took out a small box containing a sunburst pin but not just any sunburst pin she thought proudly this one had a microphone and the editor had told her to wear it to record conversations that way he had explained no one can claim you misquoted them later on seven sorry to do this to you ted but we simply dont have the luxury of time henry bartlett leaned back in the upholstered armchair at the end of the library table ted was aware that his left temple was throbbing and shafts of pain were finding a target behind and above his left eye deliberately he moved his head to avoid the streams of lateafternoon sun that were coming through the window opposite him they were in the study of teds bungalow in the meadowcluster area one of the two most expensive accommodations at cypress point spa craig was sitting diagonally across from him his face grave his hazel eyes cloudy with worry henry had wanted a conference before dinner time is running out he had said and until we decide on our final strategy we cant make any progress twenty years in prison ted thought incredulously that was the sentence he was facing hed be fiftyfour years old when he got out incongruously all the old gangster movies hed used to watch late at night sprang into his mind steel bars tough prison guards jimmy cagney starring as a maddog killer he used to revel in them we have two ways we can go henry bartlett said we can stick to your original story my original story ted snapped hear me out you left leilas apartment at about ten after nine you went to your own apartment you tried to phone craig he turned to craig its a damn shame you didnt pick up the phone i was watching a program i wanted to see the telephone recorder was on i figured id call back anyone who left a message and i can swear the phone rang at nine twenty just as ted says why didnt you leave a message ted because i hate talking to machines and especially that one his lips tightened craigs habit of talking like a japanese houseboy on his recorder irritated ted wildly what were you calling craig about anyhow its blurry i was drunk my impression is that i wanted to tell him i was taking off for a while that doesnt help us probably if you had reached him it wouldnt help us not unless he can back you up that you were talking to him at precisely nine thirtyone pm craig slammed his hand on the table then ill say it im not in favor of lying under oath but neither am i in favor of ted getting railroaded for something he didnt do its too late for that youve already made a statement you change it now and the situation gets worse bartlett skimmed the papers he had pulled from his briefcase ted got up and walked to the window he had planned to go to the mens spa and work out for a while but bartlett had been insistent about this meeting already his freedom was being infringed how many times had he come to cypress point with leila in their threeyear relationship eight or ten probably leila had loved it here shed been amused by mins bossiness by the barons pretentiousness shed enjoyed long hikes along the cliffs all right falcon if you wont come with me play your darn golf and ill meet you at my pad later that mischievous wink the deliberate leer her long slender fingers running along his shoulders god falcon you do turn me on lying with her in his arms on the couch watching latenight movies her murmured min knows better than to give us any of those damn narrow antiques of hers she knows i like to cuddle with my fellow it was here that he had found the leila he loved the leila she herself wanted to be what was bartlett saying either we attempt to flatly contradict elizabeth lange and the socalled eyewitness or we try to turn that testimony to our benefit how does one do that god i hate this man ted thought look at him sitting there cool and comfortable youd think he was discussing a chess game not the rest of my life irrational fury almost choked him he had to get out of this spot even being in a room with someone he disliked gave him claustrophobia how could he share a cell with another man for two or three decades he couldnt at any price he couldnt do it you have no memory of hailing the cab of the ride to connecticut absolutely none your last conscious memory of that evening tell me again what was it i had been with leila for several hours she was hysterical kept accusing me of cheating on her did you no then why did she accuse you leila wasterribly insecure shed had bad experiences with men she had convinced herself she could never trust one i thought id gotten her over that as far as our relationship was concerned but every once in a while shed throw a jealous fit that scene in the apartment leila lunging at him scratching his face her wild accusations his hands on her wrists restraining her what had he felt anger fury and disgust you tried to give her back the engagement ring yes and she refused it then what happened elizabeth phoned leila began sobbing into the phone and shouting at me to get out i told her to put the phone down i wanted to get to the bottom of what had brought all this on i saw it was hopeless and left i went to my own apartment i think i changed my shirt i tried to call craig i remember leaving the apartment i dont remember anything else until the next day when i woke up in connecticut teddy do you realize what the prosecutor will do to that story do you know how many cases are on record of people who kill in a fit of rage and then have a psychotic episode where they block it out as your lawyer i have to tell you something that story stinks its no defense sure if it werent for elizabeth lange there wouldnt be a problem hell there wouldnt even be a case i could make mincemeat of that socalled eyewitness shes a nut a real offthewall nut but with elizabeth swearing you were in the apartment fighting with leila at nine thirty the nut becomes believable when she says you shoved leila off the terrace at nine thirtyone then what do we do about it craig asked we gamble bartlett said ted agrees with elizabeth s story he now remembers going back upstairs leila was still hysterical she slammed the phone down and ran to the terrace everybody who was in elaines the night before can testify to her emotional state her sister admits she had been drinking she was despondent about her career she had decided to break off her relationship with you she felt washed up she wouldnt be the first one to take a dive in that situation ted winced a dive christ were all lawyers so insensitive and then the image came of leilas broken body the garish police pictures he felt perspiration break out over his entire body but craig looked hopeful it might work what that eyewitness saw was ted struggling to save leila and when leila fell he blacked out thats when he had the psychotic episode that explains why he was almost incoherent in the cab ted stared through the window at the ocean it was unusually calm now but he knew the tide would soon be roaring in the calm before the storm he thought right now were having a clinical discussion in nine days ill be in the courtroom the people of the state of new york v andrew edward winters iii theres one big hole in your theory he said flatly if i admit i went back to that apartment and was on the terrace with leila im putting my head in a noose if the jury decides i was in the process of killing her ill be found guilty of murder two its a chance you may have to take ted came back to the table and began to stuff the open files into bartlett s briefcase his smile was not pleasant im not sure i can take that chance there has to be a better solution and at any cost i intend to find it i will not go to prison eight min sighed gustily that feels good i swear youve got better hands than any masseuse in this place helmut leaned down and kissed her cheek liebchen i love touching you even if its only to ease your shoulders they were in their apartment which covered the entire third floor of the main house min was seated at her dressing table wearing a loose kimono she had unpinned her heavy ravencolored hair and it fell below her shoulders she looked at her reflection in the mirror today she was no ad for this place shadows under her eyeshow long since shed had her eyes done five years something hard to accept was happening she was fiftynine years old until this last year she could have passed for ten years younger no more helmut was smiling at her in the mirror deliberately he rested his chin on her head his eyes were a shade of blue that always reminded her of the waters in the adriatic sea around dubrovnik where she had been born the long distinguished face with its pictureperfect tan was unlined the dark brown sideburns untouched by gray helmut was fifteen years her junior for the first years of their marriage it hadnt mattered but now she had met him at the spa in badenbaden after samuel died five years of catering to that fussy old man had paid off hed left her twelve million dollars and this property she hadnt been stupid about helmuts sudden attentiveness to her no man becomes enamored of a woman fifteen years his senior unless theres something he wants at first she had accepted his attentions cynically but by the end of two weeks she had realized that she was becoming deeply interested in him and in his suggestion that she convert the cypress point hotel into a spa the cost had been staggering but helmut had urged her to consider it an investment not an expenditure the day the spa opened he had asked her to marry him she sighed heavily minna what is it how long had they been staring at each other in the mirror you know he bent down and kissed her cheek incredibly theyd been happy together she had never dared tell him how much she loved him instinctively afraid to hand him that weapon always watching for signs of restlessness but he ignored the young women who flirted with him it was only leila who had seemed to dazzle him only leila who had made her churn in an agony of fear perhaps she had been wrong if one could believe him helmut had actually disliked leila even hated her leila had been openly contemptuous of him but then leila had been contemptuous of every man she knew well the shadows had become long in the room the breeze from the sea was sharply cooler helmut reached his hands under her elbows rest a little youll have to put up with the lot of them in less than an hour min clutched his hand helmut how do you think shell react very badly dont tell me that she wailed helmut you know why i have to try its our only chance nine at seven oclock chimes from the main house announced the arrival of the cocktail hour and immediately the paths to the main house became filled with peoplesingles couples groups of three or four all were well dressed in semiformal wear the women in elegant caftans or flowing tunics the men in blazers slacks and sport shirts blazing gemstones were mixed with amusing costume pieces famous faces greeted each other warmly or nodded distantly soft lights glowed on the veranda where waiters in ivoryandblue uniforms served delicate canaps and alcoholfree cocktails elizabeth decided to wear the dustypink silk jumpsuit with a magenta sash that had been leilas last birthday present to her leila always wrote a note on her personal stationery the note that had accompanied this outfit was tucked in the back of elizabeth s wallet a talisman of love shed written its a long long way from may to december love and happy birthday to my darling capricorn sister from the taurus kid somehow wearing that outfit rereading that note made it easier for elizabeth to leave the bungalow and start up the path to the main house she kept a halfsmile on her face as she finally saw some of the regulars mrs lowell from boston who had been coming here since min opened the place countess daronne the brittle aging beauty who was at last showing most of her seventy years the countess had been an eighteenyearold bride when her much older husband was murdered shed married four times since then but after every divorce petitioned the french courts to restore her former title you look gorgeous i helped leila pick out that jumpsuit on rodeo drive mins voice boomed in her ear mins arm was solidly linked in hers elizabeth felt herself being propelled forward a scent of the ocean mingled with the perfume of roses the wellbred voices and laughter of the people on the veranda hummed around her the background music was serber playing mendelssohns concerto for violin in e minor leila would drop everything to attend a serber concert a waiter offered her a choice of beveragesnonalcoholic wine or a soft drink she chose the nonalcoholic wine leila had been cynical about mins firm noalcohol rule listen sparrow half the people who go to that joint are boozers they all bring some stuff with them but even so they have to cut down a lot so they lose some weight and min claims credit for the spa dont you think the baron keeps a supply in that study of his youbethe does i should have gone to east hampton elizabeth thought anywhereanywhere but here it was as if she were filled with a sense of leilas presence as if leila were trying to reach her elizabeth mins voice was sharp sharp but also nervous she realized the countess is talking to you im terribly sorry affectionately she reached out to grasp the aristocratic hand that was extended to her the countess smiled warmly i saw your last film youre developing into a very fine actress cherie how like countess daronne to sense she would not want to discuss leila it was a good role i was lucky and then elizabeth felt her eyes widen min coming down the path isnt that syd and cheryl yes they just called this morning i forgot to tell you you dont mind that theyre here of course not its only her voice trailed off she was still embarrassed over the way leila had humiliated syd that night in elaines syd had made leila a star no matter what mistakes hed talked her into those last few years they didnt stack up against the times hed nailed down the parts she wanted and cheryl under the veneer of friendship she and leila had shared an intense professional and personal rivalry leila had taken ted from cheryl cheryl had almost wrecked her career by stepping into leilas play unconsciously elizabeth straightened her back on the other hand syd had made a fortune off leilas earnings cheryl had tried every trick in the book to get ted back if only shed succeeded elizabeth thought leila might still be alive they had spotted her they both looked as surprised as she felt the countess murmured not that dreadful tart cheryl manning they were coming up the steps toward her elizabeth studied cheryl objectively her hair was a tangled web around her face it was much darker than it had been the last time she had seen her and very becoming the last time that had been at leilas memorial service reluctantly elizabeth conceded to herself that cheryl had never looked better her smile was dazzling the famous ambercolored eyes assumed a tender expression her greeting would have fooled anyone who didnt know her elizabeth my darling i never dreamed id see you here but how wonderful has it gone fairly well then it was syds turn syd with his cynical eyes and mournful face she knew hed put a million dollars of his own money into leilas playmoney he had probably borrowed leila had called him the dealer sure he works hard for me sparrow but thats because i make a lot of money for him the day i quit being an asset to him hell walk over my dead body elizabeth felt a chill as syd gave her a perfunctory showbusiness kiss you look good i may have to steal you from your agent i didnt expect to see you till next week next week of course the defense was probably going to use cheryl and syd to testify to leilas emotional state that night in elaines are you filling in for one of the instructors cheryl asked elizabeth is here because i invited her min snapped elizabeth wondered why min seemed so terribly nervous mins eyes were darting around and her hand was still gripping elizabeth s elbow as though she were afraid of losing her cocktails were offered to the newcomers friends of the countess drifted over to join them the host of a famous talk show greeted syd genially next time you want us to book one of your clients make sure hes sober that ones never sober then she heard a familiar voice coming from behind her an astonished voice elizabeth what are you doing here she turned and felt craigs arms around herthe solid dependable arms of the man who had rushed to her when he heard the news flash who had stayed with her in leilas apartment listening as she babbled out her grief who had helped her to answer the questions of the police who had finally located ted shed seen craig three or four times in the last year hed look her up when she was filming i cant be in the same city without at least saying hello hed say by tacit agreement they avoided discussing the impending trial but they never got through a dinner without some reference to it it was through craig that shed learned that ted was staying in maui that he was jumpy and irritable that he was practically ignoring business and out of touch with his friends it was from craig inevitably that shed heard the question are you sure the last time shed seen him shed burst out how can anyone be sure of anything or anybody and asked him not to contact her again until after the trial i know where your loyalty has to be but what was he doing here now shed have thought hed be with ted preparing for the trial and then as she stepped back from his embrace she saw ted coming up the steps of the veranda she felt her mouth go dry her arms and legs trembled her heart beat so wildly she could hear its pounding in her ears somehow in these months she had managed to bar his image from her conscious mind and in her nightmares he was always shadowyshed seen only the murderous hands pushing leila over the railing the merciless eyes watching her fall now he was walking up these stairs with his usual commanding presence andrew edward winters iii his dark hair contrasting with the white dinner jacket his strong even features deeply tanned looking all the better for his selfimposed exile in maui outrage and hatred made elizabeth want to lunge at him to push him down those steps as he had pushed leila to scratch that composed handsome face as leila had scratched it trying to save herself the brackish taste of bile filled her mouth and she gulped trying to fight back nausea there he is cheryl cried in an instant she was sliding through the clusters of people on the veranda her heels clattering the scarf of her red silk evening pajamas trailed behind her conversation stopped heads turned as she threw herself into teds arms like a robot elizabeth stared down at them it was as though she were looking through a kaleidoscope loose fragments of colors and impressions rotated before her the white of teds jacket the red of cheryls outfit teds dark brown hair his long wellshaped hands holding cheryls shoulders as he tried to free himself at the grand jury hearing elizabeth remembered she had brushed past him filled with selfloathing that she had been so deceived so taken in by his performance as leilas griefstricken fiance now he glanced up and she knew he had seen her he looked shocked and dismayedor was that just another act pulling his arm away from cheryls clinging fingers he came up the steps unable to move she was dimly aware of the hushed silence of the people around them the murmurs and laughter of those farther away who did not realize what was happening of the last strains of the concerto of the bouquet of fragrances from the flowers and ocean he looked older the lines around his eyes and mouth that had appeared at the time of leilas death had deepened and were now permanently etched on his face leila had loved him so and he had killed her a fresh passion of hatred surged through elizabeth all the intolerable pain the awful sense of loss the guilt that permeated her soul like a cancer because at the end she had failed leila this man was the cause of all of it elizabeth how dare he speak to her shocked out of her immobility she spun around stumbled across the veranda and into the foyer she heard the click of heels behind her min had followed her in elizabeth turned to her fiercely damn you min what in hell do you think youre pulling in here mins head jerked toward the music room she did not speak until she had closed the door behind them elizabeth i know what im doing i dont with an acute sense of betrayal elizabeth stared at min no wonder she had seemed nervous and she was even more nervous nowshe who always seemed impervious to stress who always gave off the commanding air of one who could change and resolve any problem was actually trembling elizabeth when i saw you in venice you told me yourself that something in you still couldnt believe ted would hurt leila i dont care how it looks ive known him longer than youyears longer youre making a mistake dont forget i was in elaines that night too listen leila had gone crazy theres no other way of saying it and you knew it you say you set your clock the next day you were distraught about her are you so infallible that maybe you didnt set it wrong when leila was on the phone with you just before she died were you watching the clock look at ted these next few days as if hes a human being not a monster think about how good he was to leila mins face was impassioned her low intense voice was more piercing than a scream she grasped elizabeth s arm youre one of the most honest people i know from the time you were a little girl you always told the truth cant you face the fact that your mistake means that ted will rot in prison for the rest of his life the melodious sound of chimes echoed through the room dinner was about to be served elizabeth put her hand on mins wrist forcing min to release her incongruously she remembered how a few minutes ago ted had pulled away from cheryl min next week a jury will begin to decide who is telling the truth you think you can run everything but youre out of your element this time get someone to call me a taxi elizabeth you cant leave cant i do you have a number where i can reach sammy no exactly when is she expected back tomorrow night after dinner min clasped her hands beseechingly elizabeth i beg you from behind her elizabeth heard the door open she whirled around helmut was in the doorway he put his hands on her arms in a gesture that both embraced and restrained her elizabeth his voice was soft and urgent i tried to warn minna she had the crazy idea that if you saw ted you would think of all the happy times would remember how much he loved leila i implored her not to do this ted is as shocked and upset as you are he should be will you please let go of me helmuts voice became soothing pleading elizabeth next week is labor day the peninsula is alive with tourists there are hundreds of college kids having one last fling before school opens you could drive around half the night and not find a room stay here be comfortable see sammy tomorrow night then go if you must it was true elizabeth thought carmel and monterey were meccas for tourists in late august elizabeth please min was weeping i was so foolish i thought i believed that if you just saw ted not in court but here im sorry elizabeth felt her anger drain away to be replaced by boneweary emptiness min was min incongruously she remembered the time min had sent a reluctant leila to a casting for a cosmetics commercial min had stormed listen leila i dont need you to tell me they didnt ask to see you get over there force your way in youre just what theyre looking for you make your breaks in this world leila got the job and became the model the cosmetic company used in all its commercials for the next three years elizabeth shrugged which dining room will ted be in the cypress room helmut answered hopefully syd cheryl the same where did you plan to put me with us as well but the countess sends her love and asks you to join her table in the ocean room all right ill stay over till i see sammy elizabeth looked sternly at min who seemed almost to cringe min im the one whos warning you now she said ted is the man who killed my sister dont dare try to arrange any more accidental meetings between him and me ten five years before in an attempt to resolve the vociferous differences between smokers and nonsmokers min had divided the spacious dining room into two areas separating them by a glass wall the cypress room was for nonsmokers only the ocean room accommodated both the seating was open except for the guests who were invited to share min and helmuts table when elizabeth stood at the door of the ocean room she was waved to a table by countess daronne the problem she soon realized was that from her seat she had an unbroken view of mins table in the other room it was with a sense of deja vu that she saw them all sitting together min helmut syd cheryl ted craig the two other people at mins table were mrs meehan the lottery winner and a distinguishedlooking older man several times she caught him glancing over at her somehow she got through the dinner managing to nibble at the chop and salad to make some attempts at conversation with the countess and her friends but as though drawn to a magnet she found herself again and again watching ted the countess noticed it naturally despite everything he looks quite wonderful doesnt he oh im sorry my dear i made a pact with myself not to mention him at all its just that you do realize ive known ted since he was a little boy his grandparents used to bring him here when this place was a hotel as always even among celebrities ted was the center of attention everything he did was effortless elizabeth thoughtthe attentive bend of his head toward mrs meehan the easy smile for the people who came to his table to greet him the way he allowed cheryl to slip her hand into his then managed to disengage it casually it was a relief to see him and craig and the older man leave the table early she did not linger for the coffee that was served in the music room instead she slipped out onto the veranda and down the path to her bungalow the mist had blown off and stars were brilliant in the dark night sky the crashing and pounding of the surf blended with the faint sounds of the cello there was always a musical program after dinner an intense sense of isolation came over elizabeth an indefinable sadness that was beyond leilas death beyond the incongruity of the company of these people who had been so much a part of her life syd cheryl min shed known them since she was the eightyearold miss tag along the baron craig ted they went back a long way these people whom she had considered close friends and who had now closed ranks on her who sympathized with leilas murderer who would come to new york to testify for him when she reached her bungalow elizabeth hesitated and then decided to sit outside for a while the veranda furniture was comfortablea padded sofa swing and matching deck chairs she settled on a corner of the sofa and with one foot against the floor set it moving here in the almostdark she could see the lights of the big house and quietly think about the people who had incongruously been gathered here tonight gathered at whose request and why eleven for a ninehundredcalorie dinner it wasnt bad henry bartlett came from his bungalow carrying a handsome leather case he placed it on the table in teds sitting room and opened it revealing a portable minibar he reached for the courvoisier and brandy snifters gentlemen craig nodded assent ted shook his head i think you should know that one of the firm rules at this spa is no liquor when ior should i say youpay over seven hundred dollars a day for me to be at this place i decide what i drink he poured a generous amount into the two glasses handed one to craig and walked over to the sliding glass doors a full creamy moon and a galaxy of brilliant silver stars lighted the inky darkness of the ocean the crescendo of the waves attested to the awesome power of the surf ill never know why balboa called this the pacific ocean bartlett commented not when you hear that sound coming from it he turned to ted having elizabeth lange here could be the break of the century for you shes an interesting girl ted waited craig turned the stem of the glass in his hand bartlett looked reflective interesting in a lot of ways and most particularly for something neither one of you could have seen every expression in the gamut marched across her face when she saw you teddy sadness uncertainty hatred shes been doing a lot of thinking and my guess is that something in her is saying two plus two doesnt equal five you dont know what youre talking about craig said flatly henry pushed open the sliding glass door now the crescendo of the ocean became a roar hear that he asked makes it kind of hard to concentrate doesnt it youre paying me a lot of money to get ted out of this mess one of the best ways to do it is to know what im up against and what i have going for me a sharply cool gust of air interrupted him quickly he pulled the door shut and walked back to the table we were very fortunate the way the seating worked out i spent a good part of the dinner studying elizabeth lange facial expressions and body language tell a lot she never took her eyes off you teddy if ever a woman was caught in a lovehate situation shes it now my job is to figure out how we can make it work for you twelve syd walked an unnaturally silent cheryl back to her bungalow he knew that dinner had been an ordeal for her shed never gotten over losing ted winters to leila now it must absolutely gall her that even with leila out of the way ted wouldnt respond to her in a crazy way that lottery winner had been a good diversion for cheryl alvirah meehan knew all about the series told her she was perfect for the role of amanda you know how sometimes you can just see a star in a role alvirah had said i read till tomorrow when it was in paperback and i said willy that would make a great television series and only one person in the world should play amanda and thats cheryl manning of course it was unfortunate she had also told cheryl that leila was her favorite actress in the whole world they were walking along the highest point of the property back to cheryls bungalow the paths were lighted with groundlevel japanese lanterns which threw shadows on the cypress trees the night was sparkling with stars but the weather was supposed to change and already the air was carrying the touch of dampness that preceded a typical monterey peninsula fog unlike the people who considered pebble beach the nearest spot to heaven syd had always felt somewhat uncomfortable around cypress trees with their crazy twisted shapes no wonder some poet had compared them to ghosts he shivered matteroffactly he took cheryls arm as they turned from the main path to her bungalow still he waited for her to begin to talk but she remained silent he consoled himself with the thought that hed had enough of her moods anyway for one day but when he started to say good night she interrupted him come inside groaning to himself he followed her in she wasnt ready to quit on him yet wheres the vodka he asked locked in my jewelry case its the only place these damn maids dont check for booze she tossed him the key and settled herself on the striped satin couch he poured vodka on ice for the two of them handed her a glass and sat down opposite her sipping his drink watching her make a production out of tasting hers finally she looked squarely at him what did you think about tonight im not sure i get your meaning she looked scornful of course you do when ted drops his guard he looks haunted its obvious craig is worried sick min and the baron make me think of a pair of highwire acrobats on a slippery rope that lawyer never took his eyes off elizabeth and she was spying on our table all night ive always suspected she had a case on ted as for that crazy lottery winnerif min puts me next to her tomorrow night ill strangle her the hell you will listen cheryl you may get the part great theres still always the chance the series will die in the ratings a slight chance i grant you but a chance if that happens youre going to need a movie role there are plenty of them around but movies need backing that ladys gonna have a lot of bucks for investment capital keep smiling at her cheryls eyes narrowed ted could be talked into financing a movie for me i know he could he told me it wasnt fair that i was stuck with the play last year get this straight craig is a lot more cautious than ted if ted goes to prison hell run the show and another thing youre crazy if you think elizabeth has the hots for ted if she did why the hell would she be putting a noose around his neck all she has to do is say she was wrong about the time and how wonderful ted was to leila period case dismissed cheryl finished her drink and imperiously held out her empty glass silently syd got up refilled it and added a generous splash of vodka to his own men are too dumb to see cheryl told him as he placed the drink in front of her you remember the kind of kid elizabeth was polite but if you asked her a direct question you got a direct answer and she never made excuses she just doesnt know how to lie shed never lie for herself and unfortunately she wont lie for ted but before this is over shes going to look under stones to try to find some sort of positive proof of what happened that night that can make her very dangerous something else syd you heard that nutty alvirah meehan say she read in a fan magazine that leila lasalles apartment was like a motel that leila gave out keys to all her friends in case they wanted to stay over cheryl got up from the couch walked over to syd sat beside him and put her hands on his knees you had a key to the apartment didnt you syd so did you i know it leila got a kick out of patronizing me knowing i couldnt afford one room in that building never mind a duplex but when she died the bartender in the jockey club can testify i was lingering over a drink my dinner date was late you were my dinner date syd dear how much did you put up for that goddamn play syd felt his knuckles harden and hoped that cheryl could not feel the instant rigidity of his body what are you driving at the afternoon before leila died you told me you were going to see leila to beg her to reconsider you had at least a million tied up in that play your million or borrowed money syd you shoved me into that disaster as a replacement just the way youd send a lamb to slaughter why because you were willing to risk my career on the faint chance that maybe the play could still work and my memory has improved a lot youre always on time that night you were fifteen minutes late you came into the jockey club at nine fortyfive you were dead white your hands kept trembling you spilled a drink on the table leila had died at nine thirtyone her apartment was less than a tenminute walk from the jockey club cheryl put her hands on the sides of his face syd i want that part see that i get it if i do i promise you drunk or sober ill never remember that you were late that night that you looked terrible that you had a key to leilas apartment and that leila had virtually driven you into bankruptcy now get the hell out of here i need my beauty sleep thirteen min and helmut kept their smiles fixed and warm until they were safely in their own apartment then wordlessly they turned to each other helmut put his arms around min his lips brushed her cheeks with practiced skill his hands massaged her neck liebchen helmut was it as bad as i think his voice was soft minna i tried to warn you it would be a mistake to bring elizabeth here yes you understand her now shes furious at you but beyond that something else has happened your back was to her at dinner but i could see the way she was observing us from her table it was as if she were seeing us for the first time i thought if she just saw ted you know how much she cared about him ive always suspected that she was in love with him herself i know what you thought but it hasnt worked so no more about it tonight minna get into bed im going to make a cup of hot milk for you and give you a sleeping pill tomorrow youll be your usual overbearing self min smiled wanly and allowed him to lead her toward the bedroom his arm was still around her she was halfleaning against him her head fitted into the crook of his shoulder after ten years she still loved the scent of him the hint of expensive cologne the feel of his superbly tailored jacket in his arms she could forget about his predecessor with his cold hands and his petulance when helmut returned with the hot milk she was propped up in bed the silken pillows framing her loosened hair she knew the rosetinted shade on the night table threw a flattering glow on her high cheekbones and dark eyes the appreciation she saw in her husbands eyes when he handed her the delicate limoges cup was gratifying liebchen he whispered i wish you knew how i feel about you after all this time you still dont trust that feeling do you seize the moment she had to do it helmut something is terribly wrong something you havent told me what is it he shrugged you know whats wrong spas are springing up all over the country the rich are restless people fickle the cost of the roman bath has exceeded my expectationi admit it nevertheless i am sure that when we finally open it helmut promise me one thing no matter what we wont touch the swiss account id rather let this place go at my age i cant be broke again min tried to keep her voice from rising we wont touch it minna i promise he handed her the sleeping pill so as your husband as a doctor i order you to swallow this immediately ill take it gladly he sat on the edge of the bed as she sipped the milk arent you coming to bed her voice was drowsy not yet ill read for a bit thats my sleeping pill after he turned out the light and left the room min felt herself drifting off to sleep her last conscious thought became an inaudible whisper helmut she pleaded what are you hiding from me fourteen at quarter of ten elizabeth saw the guests begin to stream from the main house she knew that in a few minutes the whole place would be silent curtains drawn lights extinguished the day began early at the spa after the strenuous exercise classes and the relaxing beauty treatments most people were more than ready to retire by ten oclock she sighed when she saw one figure leave the main path and turn in her direction instinctively she knew it was mrs meehan i thought you might be a little lonesome alvirah said as uninvited she settled herself on one of the deck chairs wasnt dinner good youd never guess you were counting calories would you buhlieve me i wouldnt weigh one hundred and sixtyfive pounds if id eaten like this all my life she rearranged the shawl on her shoulders this thing keeps slipping she looked around its a beautiful night isnt it all those stars i guess they dont have as much pollution here as in queens and the ocean i love that sound what was i saying oh yesdinner you could have knocked me over when the waiteror was he a butlerput that tray in front of me with the spoon and fork you know at home we just kind of dig in i mean who needs a spoon and fork to get at string beans or an itsybitsy lamb chop but then i remembered the way greer garson helped herself from the fancy silver platter in valleyof decision and i was okay you can always count on the movies unwillingly elizabeth smiled there was something so genuinely honest about alvirah meehan honesty was a rare commodity at the spa im sure you did fine alvirah fiddled with her sunburst pin to tell the truth i couldnt take my eyes of ted winters i was all set to hate him but he was so nice to me boy was i surprised at how snippy that cheryl manning is she certainly hated leila didnt she elizabeth moistened her lips what makes you think that i just happened to say at dinner that i thought leila would become a legend like marilyn monroe and she said that if its still fashionable to consider a washedup drunk a legend leila just might make it alvirah felt a pang of regret at having to tell this to leilas sister but as shed always read a good reporter gets the story how did the others respond to that elizabeth asked quietly they all laughed except ted winters he said that was a sickening thing to say you cant mean min and craig thought it was funny its hard to be sure alvirah said hastily sometimes people laugh when theyre embarrassed but even that lawyer whos with ted winters said something like its pretty clear leila wouldnt win any popularity contests around here elizabeth stood up it was nice of you to drop by mrs meehan im afraid i have to change now i always like to take a swim before i go to bed i know they talked about that at the table craigis that his name mr winters assistant yes he asked the baroness how long you were going to stay she told him probably until day after tomorrow because you were waiting to see someone named sammy thats right and syd melnick said that he has a hunch youre going to avoid all of them then the baroness said that the one place you can always find elizabeth is swimming in the olympic pool around ten oclock at night i guess she was right she knows i like to swim do you know your way to your cottage mrs meehan if not ill walk with you it can be confusing in the dark no im fine i enjoyed talking to you alvirah pulled herself up from the chair and ignoring the path began to cut across the lawn to her bungalow she was disappointed that elizabeth hadnt said anything that would be helpful for her articles but on the other hand she had gotten a lot of material at dinner she certainly could do a meaty article on jealousy wouldnt the reading public be interested to hear that leila lasalles very best friends all acted as if they were glad she was dead fifteen carefully he drew the shades and extinguished the lights he was frantic to hurry it might already be too late but there was no way he could have ventured out before now when he opened the outside door he shivered for a moment the air had become chilly and he was wearing only swim trunks and a dark tshirt the grounds were quiet lighted only by the nowdimmed lanterns along the footpaths and in the trees it was easy to stay hidden in the shadows as he hurried toward the olympic pool would she still bethere the change in wind had caused a mist to blow in from the sea in minutes the stars had been covered by clouds the moon had disappeared even if anyone happened to stand at a window and look out he would not be seen elizabethplanned to stay at the spa until she saw sammy tomorrow night that gave him only a day and a halfuntil tuesday morningto arrange her death he stopped at the shrubbery that edged the patio around the olympic pool in the darkness he could barely see elizabeth s moving form as she swam with swift sure strokes from one end of the pool to the other carefully he calculated his chance of success the idea had come to him when min said elizabeth was always in this pool around ten oclock even strong swimmers have accidents a sudden cramp no one within hearing distance if she cried out no marks no signs of struggle his plan was to slip into the pool when she was almost at the opposite end wait and pounce on her as she passed him hold her down until she stopped struggling now he edged his way from behind the shrubbery it was dark enough to risk a closer look he had forgotten how fast she swam though she was so slender the muscles in her arms were like steel suppose she was able to fight long enough to attract attention and she was probably wearing one of those damn whistles min insisted lone swimmers put on his eyes narrowed in anger and frustration as he crouched nearer and nearer the edge of the pool ready to spring not sure if this was the precisely right moment she was a faster swimmer than he was in the water she might have the advantage over him he could not afford to make a second mistake in aqua sanitas the romans had chiseled the motto into the walls of their bathhouses if i believed in reincarnation i would think i had lived in those times elizabeth thought as she glided across the dark recess of the pool when she had begun to swim it had been possible to see not only the perimeter of the pool but the surrounding area with its lounge chairs and umbrella tables and flowering hedges now they were only dark silhouettes the persistent headache shed had all evening began to ebb the sense of enclosure faded once again she began to experience the release she had always found in water do you think it started in the womb shed once joked to leila i mean this absolute sensation of being free when im immersed leilas answer had shocked her maybe mama was happy when she was carrying you sparrow ive always thought that your father was senator lange he and mama had a big thing going after my daddydear split the scene when i was in the womb i gather they called me the mistake it was leila who had suggested that elizabeth use the stage name lange it probably should be your real name sparrow she had said why not as soon as leila began making money she had sent a check to mama every month one day the check was returned uncashed by mamas last boyfriend mama had died of acute alcoholism elizabeth touched the far wall brought her knees to her chest and flipped her body over changing from a backstroke to a breaststroke in one fluid movement was it possible that leilas fear of personal relationships had begun at the moment of conception can a speck of protoplasm sense that the climate is hostile and can that realization color a whole life wasnt it because of leila that shed never experienced that terrible sense of parental rejection she remembered her mothers description of bringing her home from the hospital leila took her out of my arms she moved the crib into her room she was only eleven but she became that childs mother i wanted to call her laverne but leila put her foot down she said her name is elizabeth one more reason to be grateful to leila elizabeth thought the soft ripple that her body made as she moved through the water masked the faint sound of footsteps at the other end of the pool she had reached the north end and was starting back for some reason she began to swim furiously as though sensing danger the shadowy figure edged its way along the wall he coldly calculated the speed of her swift graceful progress timing was essential grab her from behind as she passed lie over her body hold her face in the water until she stopped struggling how long would it take a minute two but suppose she wasnt that easy to subdue this had to appear to be an accidental drowning then an idea came to him and in the darkness his lips stretched in the semblance of a smile why hadnt he thought of the scuba equipmentearlier wearing the oxygen tank would make it possible for him to hold her at the bottom of the pool until he was certain she was dead the wet suit the gloves the mask the goggles were a perfect disguise if anyone happened to see him cutting across the grounds he watched as she began to swim toward the steps the impulse to get rid of hernowwas almost overwhelming tomorrow night he promised himself carefully he moved closer as she placed her foot on the bottom step of the ladder and straightened up his narrowed eyes strained to watch as she slipped on her robe and began to walk along the path to her bungalow tomorrow night he would be waiting here for her the next morning someone would spot her body at the bottom of the pool as the workman had spotted leilas body in the courtyard and he would havenothing left to fear monday august quote for the day a witty woman is a treasure a witty beauty is a power george meredith good

now in just a moment well be greeting you on our morning walk hurry and join us and remember another day at cypress point spa means another set of dazzling hours dedicated to making you a more beautiful person the kind of person people long to be with to touch to love baron and baroness helmut von schreiber one elizabeth woke long before dawn on monday morning even the swim had not performed its usual magic for what seemed most of the night she had been troubled with broken dreams fragments that came and went intermittently they were all in the dreams mama leila ted craig syd cheryl sammy min helmuteven leilas two husbands those transitory charlatans who had used her success to get themselves into the spotlight the first an actor the second a wouldbe producer and socialite at six oclock she got out of bed pulled up the shade then huddled back under the light covers it was chilly but she loved to watch the sun come up it seemed to her that the early morning had a dreamy quality of its own the human quiet was so absolute the only sounds came from the seabirds along the shore at six thirty there was a tap on the door vicky the maid who brought in the wakeup glass of juice had been with the spa for years she was a sturdy sixtyyearold woman who supplemented her husbands pension by what she sardonically called carrying breakfast roses to fading blossoms they greeted each other with the warmth of old friends it feels strange to be on the guest end of the place elizabeth commented you earned your right to be here i saw you in hilltop youre a damn good actress i still feel surer of myself teaching water aerobics and princess di can always get a job teaching kindergarten come off it she deliberately waited until she was sure that the daily procession called the cypress hike was in progress by the time she went out the marchers led by min and the baron were already nearing the path that led to the coast the hike took in the spa property the crocker wooded preserve and cypress point wound past the pebble beach golf course circled the lodge and backtracked to the spa in all it was a brisk fiftyminute exercise followed by breakfast elizabeth waited until the hikers were out of sight before she began jogging in the opposite direction from them it was still early and traffic was light she would have preferred to run along the coast where she could have an unbroken view of the ocean but that would have meant risking being noticed by the others if only sammy were back she thought as she began to quicken her pace i could talk to her and be on a plane this afternoon she wanted to get away from here if alvirah meehan was to be believed cheryl had called leila a washedup drunk last night and except for ted her murderer everyone else had laughed min helmut syd cheryl craig ted the people who had been closest to leila the weeping mourners at her memorial service oh leila elizabeth thought incongruously lines from a song she had learned as a child came back to her though all the world betray thee one sword at least thy rights shallguard one faithful heart shall praise thee ill sing your praises leila tears stung her eyes and she dabbed at them impatiently she began to jog faster as if to outrun her thoughts the earlymorning mist was being burned away by the sun the thick shrubbery that bordered the homes along the road was bathed in morning dew the sea gulls arced overhead and swooped back to the shore how accurate a witness was alvirah meehan there was something oddly intense about the woman something that went beyond her excitement at being here she was passing the pebble beach golf links early golfers were already on the course she had taken up golf in college leila had never played she used to tell ted that someday shed make time to learn she never would have elizabeth thought and a smile touched her lips leila was too impatient to traipse after a ball for four or five hours her breath was coming in gulps and she slowed her pace im out of shape she thought today she would go to the womens spa and take a full schedule of exercises and treatments it would be a useful way to pass the time she turned down the road that led back to the spaand collided with ted he grasped her arms to keep her from falling gasping at the force of the impact she struggled to push him away from her let go of me her voice rose i said let go of me she was aware that there was no one else on the road he was perspiring his tshirt clinging to his body the expensive watch leila had given him glistened in the sun he released her stunned and frightened she watched as he stared down at her his expression inscrutable elizabeth ive got to talk to you he wasnt even going to pretend he hadnt planned this say what you have to say in court she tried to pass him but he blocked her way inadvertently she stepped back was this what leila had felt at the end this sense of being trapped i said listen to me it seemed that he had sensed her fear and was infuriated by it elizabeth you havent given me a chance i know how it looks maybeand this is something i just dont knowmaybe youre right and i went back upstairs i was drunk and angry but i was also terribly worried about leila elizabeth think about this if you are right if i did go back up if that woman is right who says she saw me struggling with leila wont you at least grant that i might have been trying to save her you know how depressed leila was that day she was almost out of her mind if you went back upstairs are you telling me now that youre willing to concede you went back upstairs elizabeth felt as though her lungs were closing the air seemed suddenly humid and heavy with the scent of stilldamp cypress leaves and moist earth ted was just over six feet tall but the threeinch difference in their heights seemed to disappear as they stared at each other she was aware again of the intensity of the lines that seared the skin around his eyes and mouth elizabeth i know how you must feel about me but there is something you have to understand i dont remember what happened that night i was so damn drunk so damn upset over these months ive begun to have some vague impression of being at the door of leilas apartment of pushing it open so maybe youre right maybe you did hear me call something to her but i have absolutely no memory beyond thatthat is the truth as i know it the next question do you think drunk or sober that im capable of murder his dark blue eyes were clouded with pain he bit his lip and held his hands out imploringly well elizabeth in a quick move she darted around him and ran for the gates of the spa the district attorney had predicted this if ted didnt think he could lie his way out of being on the terrace with leila he would say he was trying to save her she didnt look back until she was at the gates ted had not attempted to follow her he was standing where she had left him staring after her his hands on his hips her arms were still burning from the force with which his hands had grabbed her she remembered something else the district attorney had told her without her as a witness ted would go free two at eight am dora sammy samuels backed her car out of her cousin elsies driveway and with a sigh of relief began the drive from the napa valley to the monterey peninsula with any luck shed be there about two oclock originally shed planned to leave in the late afternoon and elsie had been openly annoyed that shed changed her mind but she was eager to get back to the spa and go through the rest of the mailbags she was a wiry seventyoneyearold woman with steelgray hair pulled back in a neat bun oldfashioned rimless glasses sat on the bridge of her small straight nose it had been a year and a half since an aneurism had nearly killed her and the massive surgery had left her with a permanent air of fragility but until now she had always impatiently shaken off any talk of retirement it had been a disquieting weekend her cousin had always disapproved of doras job with leila answering fan mail from vapid women was the way she put it i should think with your brains youd find a better way to spend your time why dont you do volunteer teaching long ago dora had given up trying to explain to elsie that after thirtyfive years of teaching she never wanted to see a textbook again that the eight years shed worked for leila had been the most exciting of her own uneventful life this weekend had been particularly trying because when elsie saw her going through the sack of fan mail shed been astonished you mean to tell me that seventeen months after that woman died youre still writing to her fans are you crazy no she wasnt dora told herself as she drove well within the speed limit through the wine country it was a hot lazy day but even so busloads of sightseers were already passing her heading for vineyard tours and winetasting parties she had not tried to explain to elsie that sending personal notes to the people who had loved leila was a way of assuaging her own sense of loss she had also not told her cousin the reason why she had brought up the heavy sack of mail she was searching to see if leila had received other poisonpen letters than the one she had already found that one had been mailed three days before leila died the address on the envelope and the enclosed note were put together with words and phrases snipped from magazines and newspapers it read leila how many times do i haie to write cant you get it straight that ted is sick of you his new girl is beautiful and much youngerthan you i told you that the emerald necklace he gave her matches the bracelet he gave you it cost twice as much and looks ten times better i hear your play is lousy you really should learn your lines ill write again soon your friend thinking of that note of the others that must have preceded it brought a fresh burst of outrage leila leila she whispered who would do that to you she of all people had understood leilas terrible vulnerability understood that her outward confidence her flamboyant public image was the facade of a deeply insecure woman she remembered how elizabeth had gone off to school just at the time shed started working for leila shed seen leila come back from the airport lonely devastated in tears god sammy she said i cant believe i may not see sparrow for months but a swiss boarding school wont that be a great experience for her a big difference from lumber creek high my alma mater then she said hesitantly sammy im not doing anything tonight will you stay and lets get something to eat the years went by so quickly dora thought as another bus honked impatiently and passed her today for some reason the memory of leila seemed particularly vivid to her leila with her wild extravagances spending money as fast as she made it leilas two marriages dora had begged her not to marry the second one havent you learned your lesson yet she pleaded you cant afford another leech leila with her arms hugging her knees sammy hes not that bad he makes me laugh and thats a plus if you want to laugh hire aclown leilas fierce hug oh sammy promise youll always say it straight youre probably right but i guess ill go through withit getting rid of the funnyman had cost her two million dollars leila with ted sammy it cant last nobodys that wonderfulwhat does he see in me are you crazy have you stopped looking in themirror leila always so apprehensive when she started a new film sammy i stink in this part i shouldnt have taken it its notme come off it i saw the dailies tooyoure wonderful shed won the oscar for that performance but in those last few years she had been miscast in three films her worry about her career became an obsession her love for ted was equaled only by her fear of losing him and then syd had brought her the play sammy i swear i dont have to act in this one i just have to be me i love it then it was over dora thought in the end each of us left her alone i was sick she told herself elizabeth was touring with her own play ted was constantly away on business and someone who knew leila well attacked her with those poisonpen letters shattered that fragile ego precipitated the drinking dora realized that her hands were trembling she scanned the road for signs of a restaurant perhaps she would feel better if she stopped for a cup of tea when she got to the spa she would begin going through the rest of the unopened mail she knew that elizabeth would somehow find a way to trace the poisonpen mail back to its sender three when elizabeth reached her bungalow she found a note from min pinned with her schedule to the terrycloth robe folded on the bed it read my dear elizabeth i do hope that while you are here you will enjoy a day of treatment and exercise at the spa as you know it is necessary that all new guests consult briefly with helmut before beginning any activities i have scheduled you for his first appointment please know that your ultimate happiness and wellbeing are very important to me the letter had been written in mins florid sweeping penmanship quickly elizabeth scanned her schedule interview with dr helmut von schreiber at aerobic dance class at massage at trampoline at advanced water aerobics at that had been the class she taught when she worked here facial at cypress curves herbal wrap at noon the afternoon schedule included a loofah a manicure a yoga class a pedicure two more water exercises she would have preferred to avoid seeing helmut but she didnt want to make an issue of it her interview with him was brief he checked her pulse and blood pressure then examined her skin under a strong light your face is like a fine carving he told her you are one of those fortunate women who will become more beautiful as you age its all in the bone structure then as if he were thinking aloud he murmured wildly lovely as leila was her beauty was the kind that peaks and begins to slip away the last time she was here i suggested that she begin collagen treatments and we had planned to do her eyes as well did you know that no elizabeth realized with a pang of regret that her reaction to the barons remark was to be hurt that leila had not confided her plans to her or was he lying i am sorry helmut said softly i should not have brought up her name and if you wonder why she did not confide in you i think you must realize that leila had become very conscious of the threeyear age difference between her and ted i was able to assure her honestly that it made no difference between people who love each otherafter all i should knowbut even so she had begun to worry and to see you growing lovelier as she began to find those small signs of age in herself was a problem for her elizabeth got up like all the other offices at the spa this one had the look of a wellappointed living room the blueandgreen prints on the couches and chairs were cool and restful the draperies tied back to allow the sunshine to stream in the view included the putting green and the ocean she knew helmut was studying her intently his extravagant compliments were the sugar coating on a bitter pill he was trying to make her believe that leila had begun to consider her a competitor but why remembering the hostility with which he had studied leilas picture when he thought he was unobserved she wondered if helmut was viciously trying to get even for leilas barbs by suggesting she had been beginning to lose her beauty leilas face flashed in her mind the lovely mouth the dazzling smile the emeraldgreen eyes the glorious red hair like a blazing fire around her shoulders to steady herself she pretended to be reading one of the framed ads about the spa one phrase caught her eye a butterfly floating on a cloud why did it seem familiar the belt of her terrycloth robe had loosened as she tightened it she turned to helmut if one tenth of the women who spend a fortune in this place had even a fragment of leilas looks youd be out of business baron he did not reply the womens spa was busier than it had been the previous afternoon but certainly not at the level she remembered elizabeth went from exercise class to treatment glad to really work out again then equally glad to relax under the skillful hands of the masseuse or facialist she encountered cheryl several times in the tenminute breaks between appointments a washedup drunk she was barely civil to cheryl who didnt seem to notice cheryl acted preoccupied why not ted was on the premises and cheryl was obviously still dazzled by him alvirah meehan was in the same aerobic dance classa surprisingly agile alvirah with a good sense of rhythm why in the name of heaven did she wear that sunburst pin on her robe elizabeth noticed that alvirah fiddled with the pin whenever she got into a conversation she also noticed with some amusement cheryls unsuccessful efforts not to be cornered by mrs meehan she went back to her own bungalow for lunch she did not want to risk running into ted again by lunching at one of the poolside tables as she ate the freshfruit salad and sipped the iced tea she phoned the airline and changed her reservation she could get a tenoclock flight to new york from san francisco the next morning she had been frantic to get out of new york now with equal fervor she wanted to be out of here she put on her robe and prepared to go back to the spa for the afternoon session all morning she had tried to push teds face from her mind now it filled her vision again painracked angry imploring vengeful what expression had she seen in it and would she spend the rest of her life trying to escape it after the trialand the verdict four alvirah collapsed on her bed with a grateful sigh she was dying for a nap but knew it was important to record her impressions while they were fresh in her mind she propped herself on her pillows reached for the recorder and began to speak it is four oclock and i am resting in my bungalow i have finished my first full day of activities at the spa and i must report i am absolutely exhausted go go go we started with a hike then i came back here and the maid brought in my schedule for the day on my breakfast tray breakfast was a poached egg on a couple of crumbs of wholewheat toast and coffee my schedule which is on a tag that you tie to your robe showed me as having two water aerobics classes a yoga class a facial a massage two dance classes a warm hose treatment fifteen minutes in the steam box and a whirlpool dip the water aerobics classes are very interesting i push a beach ball around in the water which sounds very easy but now my shoulders hurt and ive got muscles in my thighs i didnt know existed the yoga class wasnt bad except that i cant get my knees in the lotus position the dance exercise was fun if i do say so myself i was always a good dancer and even though this is just hopping from one foot to the other and doing a lot of kicking i put some of the younger women to shame maybe i should have been a rockette the warm hose treatment is another word for crowd control i mean they turn these powerful hoses on you while youre standing in the buff and you hang on to a metal bar hoping you wont get washed away but supposedly it breaks down fatty cells and if so im ready for two treatments a day the clinic is a very interesting building from the outside it looks just like the main house but inside its totally different all the treatment rooms have private entrances with high hedges leading to them the idea is that people dont bump into each other coming and going for appointments i mean i really dont care that the whole world knows im going to have some collagen injections to fill out the lines around my mouth but i can well understand why someone like cheryl manning would be very upset if that was general knowledge i had my interview with baron von schreiber about my collagen injections this morning the baron is a charming man so handsome and the way he bowed over my hand made me very fluttery if i were his wife i think id be pretty nervous about holding him especially if i had fifteen years on him i think it is fifteen years but ill check that when i write my article the baron examined my face under a strong light and said that i had remarkably tight skin and the only treatment he would suggest besides the regular facials and a peeling mask would be the collagen injections i explained to him that when i made my reservations his receptionist dora samuels suggested that i have a test to see if id be allergic to collagen and i did im not allergic but i told the baron how scared i am of needles and how many would he have to use he was so nice he said that a lot of people feel that way about needles and when i go for my treatment the nurse will give me a doublestrength valium and by the time hes ready to start the injections ill think im just getting a couple of mosquito bites oh one more thing the barons office has lovely paintings in it but i was really fascinated by the ad for the spa that has appeared in magazines like architectural digest and town and country and vogue he told me theres a copy of it on the wall in all the bungalows its so cleverly worded the baron seemed pleased that i noticed he said hed had a hand in creating it five ted spent the morning working out in the gym in the mens spa with craig at his side he rowed stationary boats pedaled stationary bicycles and methodically made his way through the aerobics machines they decided to finish with a swim and found syd pacing laps in the indoor pool impulsively ted challenged him and craig to a race he had been swimming daily in hawaii but finished barely ahead of craig to his surprise even syd was only a few feet behind him youre keeping in shape he told him he had always thought of syd as sedentary but the man was surprisingly strong ive had time to keep in shape sitting in an office waiting for the phone to ring gets boring with unspoken consent they walked to deck chairs far enough away from the pool to avoid being overheard i was surprised to find you here syd when we talked last week you didnt tell me you were coming craigs eyes were cold syd shrugged you didnt tell me you people were coming either this place isnt my idea cheryl made the decision he glanced at ted she must have found out youd be around min would know better than to blab syd interrupted craig with one finger he beckoned to the waiter who was going from table to table offering soft drinks perrier make it three craig said do you want to swallow it for me too ted snapped ill have a coke he told the waiter you never drink colas craig commented mildly his light hazel eyes were tolerant he amended the order bring two perriers and an orange juice syd chose to ignore the byplay min wouldnt blab but dont you think there are people on the staff who get paid to tip the columnists bettina scuda called cheryl yesterday morning she probably put the bug in her ear that you were on the way whats the difference so she makes a play for you again is that new use it shes dying to be a witness for you at the trial if anyone can convince a jury how nutty leila acted in elaines cheryl can and ill back her up he put a friendly hand on teds shoulder this whole thing stinks were going to help you beat it you can count on us translated that means you owe him one craig commented as they walked back to teds bungalow dont fall for it so what if he lost a million bucks in that goddamn play you lost four million and he talked you into investing i invested because i read the play and felt that someone had managed to capture the essence of leila created a character who was funny and vulnerable and willful and impossible and sympathetic all at the same time it ought to have been a triumph for her it was a fourmilliondollar mistake craig said sorry ted but you do pay me to give you good advice henry bartlett spent the morning in teds bungalow reviewing the transcript of the grand jury hearing and on the phone to his park avenue office in case we go for a temporaryinsanity defense well need plenty of documentation of similar successful pleas he told them he was wearing an opennecked cotton shirt and baggy khaki walking shorts the sahib ted thought he wondered if bartlett wore knickers on the golf course the library table was covered with annotated piles of paper remember how leila and elizabeth and you and i used to play scrabble at this table he asked craig and you and leila always won elizabeth was stuck with me as leila put it bulldogs cant spell whats that supposed to mean henry asked oh leila had nicknames for all her close friends craig explained mine was bulldog im not sure id have been flattered yes you would have when leila gave you a nickname it meant you were part of her inner circle was that true ted wondered when you looked up the definitions of the nicknames leila bestowed there was always a double edge to them falcon a hawk trained to hunt and kill bulldog a shorthaired squarejawed heavily built dog with a tenacious grip lets order lunch henry said weve got a long afternoon of work ahead of us over a club sandwich ted described his encounter with elizabeth so you can forget yesterdays suggestion he told henry its just as i thought if i admit the possibility that i went back to leilas apartment when elizabeth gets through testifying ill be on my way to attica it was a long afternoon ted listened as henry bartlett explained the theory of temporary insanity leila had publicly rejected you she had quit a play in which you invested four million dollars the next day you pleaded with her for a reconciliation she continued to insult you to demand that you match her drink for drink i could afford the tax writeoff ted interrupted you know that i know it but the guy on the jury whos behind in his car payments wont believe it i refuse to concede that i might have killed leila i wont even consider it bartlett s face was becoming flushed ted youd better understand im trying to help you all right you were smart to get a reading on elizabeth langes reaction today so we cant admit you might have gone back upstairs if we dont claim a total blackout on your part we have to destroy both elizabeth langes testimony and the eyewitness one or the other maybe ive told you this before both no theres one possibility id like to explore craig suggested weve got psychiatric information on that socalled eyewitness id suggested to teds first lawyer that we put a detective on her trail and get a more rounded picture of her i still think thats a good idea it is bartlett s eyes disappeared beneath a heavylidded frown i wish it had been done a long time ago they are talking about me ted thought they are discussing what can and cannot be done to win my eventual freedom as though i werent here a slow hard anger that now seemed to be part of his persona made him want to lash out at them lash out at them the lawyer who supposedly would win his case the friend who had been his eyes and ears and voice these last months but i dont want them to take my life out of my hands ted thought and tasted the acid that suddenly washed his mouth i cant blame them but i cant trust them either no matter what its as ive known right along i have to take care of this myself bartlett was still talking to craig have you an agency in mind two or three weve used them when theres been an internal problem we had to solve without publicity he named the investigative agencies bartlett nodded theyre all fine see which one can get right on the case i want to know if sally ross is a drinker if she has friends she confides in if shes ever discussed the case with them if any of them were with her the night leila lasalle died dont forget everyones taking her word that she was in her apartment and happened to be looking at leilas terrace at the precise moment leila plunged off it he glanced at ted with or without teddys help when craig and henry finally left him at quarter of five ted felt drained restlessly he switched on the television set and in a reflex gesture switched it off he certainly wouldnt clear his mind by watching soap operas a walk would feel good a long long walk where he could breathe in the salty spray of the ocean and maybe wander past his grandparents house where hed spent so much time as a kid instead he elected to shower he went into the bathroom and for a moment stared at his reflection in the paneled mirror that covered half the wall around the oversize marble sink flecks of gray around his temples signs of strain around his eyes a tautness around his mouth stress manifests itself both mentally and physically hed heard a pop psychologist deliver that line on a morning news program no kidding he thought craig had suggested that they might share a twobedroom unit ted hadnt answered and obviously craig got the message he hadnt pursued the idea wouldnt it be nice if everybody understood without being told that you needed a certain amount of space he stripped and tossed his discarded clothes into the bathroom hamper with a halfsmile he remembered how kathy his wife had gotten him out of the habit of dropping clothes as he stepped out of them i dont care how rich your family is she would chide i think its disgusting to expect another human being to pick your laundry off the floor but its distinguished laundry his face in her hair the scent she always used a twentydollar cologne save your money i cant wear expensive perfume it overwhelms me the icy shower helped to relieve the dull throbbing headache feeling somewhat better ted wrapped the terrycloth robe around him rang for the maid and requested iced tea it would have been enjoyable to sit on the deck but too much of a risk he didnt want to get into a conversation with someone walking by cheryl it would be just like her to accidentally pass good god would she never get over their casual affair she was beautiful she had been amusing and she did have a certain hardheaded ability to cut through the bullbut even if he didnt have the trial hanging over his head there was no way he would get involved with her again he settled on the couch where he could look out on the ocean and watch the sea gulls arcing over the foaming surf beyond the threat of the undertow beyond the power of the waves to crash them against the rocks he felt himself begin to perspire as the prospect of the trial loomed in his mind impatiently he got up and pushed open the door to the side deck late august usually carried this welcome tang of chill he put his hands on the railing when had he begun to realize that he and leila wouldnt make it in the long run the mistrust for men so ingrained in her head had become intolerable was that the reason hed overruled craigs advice and put the millions in her play subconsciously had he hoped that she would get so caught up in a smash hit that she would decide she didnt want to accept the social demands of his life or his desire for a family leila was an actressfirst last always she talked about wanting a child but it wasnt true she had satisfied her maternal instincts by raising elizabeth the sun was beginning to lower over the pacific the air was filled with the humming of the crickets and the katydids evening dinner he could already see the expressions on the faces around the table min and helmut phony smiles worried eyes craig trying to read his mind syd a certain defiant nervousness about him how much did syd owe the wrong people for the money hed put into the play how much was syd hoping to borrow how much was his testimony worth cheryl all seductive enticement alvirah meehan fiddling with that damn sunburst pin her eyes snapping with curiosity henry watching elizabeth through the glass partition elizabeth her face cold and scornful studying them all ted glanced down the bungalow was set on sloping ground and the side veranda jutted out over a tenfoot drop he stared at the redflowered bushes below images formed in his mind and he rushed back inside he was still trembling when the maid came with the iced tea heedless of the delicate satin puff he threw himself down on the massive kingsize bed he wished that dinner were over that the night with all it entailed were over his mouth curved in a grim attempt at a smile why was he wishing the evening away what kind of dinners do they serve in prison he wondered he would have plenty of evenings to find out six dora arrived back at the spa at two oclock dropped her bag in her room and went directly to her desk in the reception office min had allowed her to keep the sacks of unanswered fan mail in a closet in the file room dora usually took out a handful at a time and kept them in the bottom drawer of her desk she knew the sight of leilas mail was an irritant to min now she didnt care if min was annoyed she had the rest of the day off and she intended to search for any further letters for the tenth time since she had found it dora reexamined the poisonpen letter with each reading her conviction grew that there might have been at least an element of truth in it happy as leila had been with ted her distress over the last three or four films had often made her temperamental and moody dora had noticed teds increasing impatience with the outbursts had he become involved with another woman that was exactly the way leila would have been thinking if she opened this kind of letter or a series of these letters it would explain the anxiety the drinking the despondency of those last months leila often said there are just two people i know i can trust in this world sparrow and falcon now you sammy are getting there dora had felt honored and the qetwoleilas name for min is a doordie friend provided theres a buck in it for her and it doesnt conflict with anything the toy soldier wants dora reached the office and was glad to see that min and helmut werent there outside the day was sunny the breeze from the pacific gentle far down on the rocky embankments over the ocean she could see the traces of ice plants the hennaandgreenandrustshaded leaves that lived on water and air elizabeth and ted had been water and air to leila quickly she went into the file room with mins passion for beautiful surroundings even this small storage area was extravagantly designed the custommade files were a sunny yellow the ceramictile floor was in shades of gold and umber a jacobean sideboard had been converted into a supply cupboard there were still two full sacks of letters to leila they ranged from lined paper torn from a child notebook to expensive perfumed stationery dora scooped a batch of them into her arms and brought them to her desk it was a slow process she could not assume that another anonymous letter would necessarily come addressed with snipped and pasted words and numbers like the one she had found she began with the letters already opened the ones leila had seen but after forty minutes shed gotten nowhere most of the mail was the usual youre my favorite actress i named my daughter after you i saw you on johnny carson you looked beautiful and you were so funny but there were also several surprisingly harsh critical notes thats the last time i spend five dollars to see you what a lousy movie do you read your scripts leila or just take what roles you can get her rapt concentration caused her to be unaware of min and helmuts fouroclock arrival one minute she was alone the next they were approaching her desk she looked up tried to summon a natural smile and with a casual movement of her hand slid the anonymous letter into the pile it was clear that min was upset she did not seem to notice that dora was early sammy get me the file on the bathhouse min waited while she went for it when she returned helmut reached out his hand to take the manila folder but min literally grabbed it first min was ghastly pale helmut patted her arm minna please you are hyperventilating min ignored him come inside she ordered dora ill just tidy up first dora indicated her desk forget it its not going to make any difference there was nothing she could do if she made any attempt to put the anonymous letter into her drawer min would demand to see it dora patted her hair and followed min and helmut into their private office something was dreadfully wrong and it had to do with that blasted roman bath min went to her own desk opened the file and began to race through the papers in it most of the correspondence was in the form of bills from the contractor five hundred thousand down three hundred thousand twentyfive thousand she kept reading her voice going higher and higher and now another four hundred thousand dollars before he can continue working on the interior rooms she slapped the papers down and slammed her fist on them dora hurried to get a glass of ice water from the office refrigerator helmut rushed around the desk put his hands on mins temples and made soft shushing sounds minna minna you must relax think about something pleasant youll bring on high blood pressure dora handed the glass to min and looked contemptuously at helmut that spendthrift she thought would put min in her grave with his crazy projects min had been absolutely right when shed suggested that they add a selfcontained budgetprice spa on the back half of the property that would have worked secretaries as well as socialites were going to spas these days instead this pompous fool had persuaded min to build the bathhouse it will make a statement about us to the world was his favorite phrase when he talked min into plunging into debt dora knew the finances of this place as well as they did it couldnt go on she cut through helmuts soothing minna minna stop work on the bathhouse immediately she suggested crisply the outside is finished so the place looks all right say the special marble you ordered for the interior has been held up no one will know the difference the contractors pretty much paid to date isnt he very nearly helmut agreed he smiled brightly at dora as though she had just solved an intricate puzzle dora is right minna well put off finishing the bathhouse min ignored him i want to go over those figures again for the next halfhour they had their heads together comparing the contracts the estimates and the actual figures at one point min and then helmut left the room dont let them go to my desk dora prayed she knew the minute min calmed down she would be annoyed to see clutter in the reception area finally min tossed the original sketches across her desk i want to talk to that damn lawyer it looks to me as if the contractor is entitled to price overruns on every phase of the job this contractor has soul helmut said he understands the concept of what we are doing minna we stop building for the moment dora is right we turn the problem into a virtue we are awaiting shipment of carrara marble we still settle for nothing less yes so we shall be admired as purists liebchen dont you know that to create a desire for something is every bit as important as fulfilling it dora was suddenly aware of another presence in the room she looked up quickly cheryl was standing there her shapely body curved against the doorframe her eyes amused have i come at a bad time she asked brightly without waiting for an answer she strolled over and leaned past dora oh i see youre going over the sketches of the roman bath she bent over to examine them four pools steam rooms saunas more massage rooms sleeping rooms i love the idea of nap time after a strenuous romp through the mineral baths incidentally wont it cost a fortune to provide real mineral water for the baths do you intend to fake it or pipe it in from badenbaden she straightened up gracefully it looks as though you two could use a little investment capital ted respects my opinion you know in fact he used to listen to me quite a bit before leila got her fangs into him see you people at dinner at the door she turned back and looked over her shoulder oh by the way min dear i left my bill on doras desk im sure it was just an oversight that one was left in my bungalow i know you planned to have me as your guest dear cheryl had left the bill on her desk dora knew that meant she had gone through the mail cheryl was what she was she had probably seen the letter to leila min looked at helmut frustrated tears welled in her eyes she knows were in a bad financial bind and it would be just like her to tip the columnists off now we have another freebieand dont think she wont use this place as a second home despairingly min jammed the scattered bills and sketches back into the file dora took it from her and replaced it in the file room her heart fluttering rapidly she went back to the reception room the letters to leila were scattered on her desk the poisonpen one was missing dismayed dora tried to assess what harm that letter might do could it be used to blackmail ted or was whoever sent it anxious to have it back just in case someone tried to trace it if only she hadnt been reading it when min and helmut came in dora sat down at her desk only then did she notice that propped against her calendar was cheryls bill for her week at the spa scrawled across it cheryl had written paid in full seven at six thirty the phone in elizabeth s bungalow rang it was min elizabeth i want you to have dinner with helmut and me tonight ted his lawyer craig cheryl sydtheyre all going out for a moment she sounded like the familiar min imperious brooking no refusal then before elizabeth could answer her tone softened please elizabeth youre going home in the morning we have missed you is this another one of your games min i was absolutely wrong to have forced that meeting last night i can only ask you to forgive me min sounded weary and elizabeth felt reluctant sympathy if min chose to believe in teds innocence so be it her scheme to throw them together had been outrageous but that was mins way youre certain none of them will be in the dining room i am certain do join us elizabeth youre leaving tomorrow ive hardly seen you it was totally out of character for min to plead this would be her only chance to visit with min and besides elizabeth was not sure she welcomed the prospect of a solitary dinner she had had a full afternoon at the spa including a loofah treatment two stretchexercise classes a pedicure and manicure and finally a yoga class in the yoga class shed tried to free her mind but no matter how much she concentrated she could not obey the soothing suggestions of the instructor over and over against her will she kept hearing teds question if i did go back upstairs was i trying to save her elizabeth elizabeth gripped the phone and glanced around drinking in the restful monochromatic color scheme of this expensive bungalow leila green min called it min had been sickeningly highhanded last night but she had certainly loved leila elizabeth heard herself accepting the invitation the large bathroom included a stepin tub whirlpool stall shower and personal steamroom facility she chose leilas favorite way to wind down lying in the tub she took advantage of both steam and whirlpool eyes closed her head cushioned by a terrycloth neck rest she felt tension slip away under the soothing mist and churning water again she marveled at the cost of this place min must be racing through the millions shed inherited she had noticed that that worry was shared by all the oldtimers on the staff rita the manicurist had told her virtually the same story that shed heard from the masseuse i tell you elizabeth she had complained cypress point just doesnt have the same excitement since leila died the celebrity followers are going to la costa now sure you see some pretty big names but the word is half of them arent paying after twenty minutes the steam automatically turned off reluctantly elizabeth stood under a cold shower then draped herself in a thick terry robe and twisted a towel around her hair there was something else she had overlooked in her anger at finding ted here min had genuinely loved leila her anguish after leilas death had not been faked but helmut the hostile way he had looked at leilas picture his sly suggestion that leila was losing her looks what had provoked that venom surely not just the cracks about his being a toy soldier that leila made at his expense when he overheard them he was always amused she remembered the time hed arrived for dinner at leilas apartment wearing the tall oldfashioned cap of a toy soldier i was passing a costume shop saw it in the window and couldnt resist he explained as they all applauded leila had laughed uproariously and kissed him youre a good sport your lordship she said then what had triggered his anger elizabeth toweled her hair dry brushed it back and caught it in a psyche knot as she applied makeup and touched her lips and cheeks with gloss she could hear leilas voice my god sparrow you get betterlooking all the time i swear you were lucky mama was having an affair with senator lange when you were conceived you remember some of her other men how would you like to have been marts kid last year shed been in summer stock when the show got to kentucky shed gone to the leading newspaper in louisville and searched for references to everett lange his obituary notice was four years old at that time it gave details of his family background his education his marriage to a socialite his achievements in congress in his photograph she had seen a masculine version of her own features would her life have been different if she had known her father she suppressed the thought it was a fact of life that everyone at cypress point spa dressed for dinner she decided to wear a white silk jersey tunic with a knotted cord belt and silver sandals she wondered if ted and the others had gone to the cannery in monterey that used to be his favorite spot one night three years ago when leila had to leave unexpectedly to shoot extra scenes ted had taken her to the cannery they had sat for hours talking and he had told her about spending summers with his grandparents in monterey about his mothers suicide when he was twelve about how much he had despised his father and he told her about the automobile accident that took the lives of his wife and child i couldnt function he said for nearly two years i was a zombie if it hadnt been for craig id have had to turn over executive control of my business to someone else he functioned for me he became my voice he practically was me the next day he told her youre too good a listener she had known that he was uncomfortable about having revealed so much of himself to her she deliberately waited until the cocktail hour was nearly over before she left her bungalow as she followed the path that led to the main house she stopped to observe the scene on the veranda the lighted main house the welldressed people standing in twos and threes sipping their makebelieve cocktails talking laughing separating forming into new social units she was acutely aware of the breathtaking clarity of the stars against the backdrop of the sky the artfully placed lanterns that illuminated the path and accentuated the blossoms on the hedges the placid slap of the pacific as it washed against the shoreline and behind the main house the looming shadow of the bathhouse its black marble exterior glistening in the reflected light where did she belong elizabeth wondered when she was in europe working it had been easier to forget the sense of isolation the alienation from every other human being that had become a fact of her existence as soon as the movie was in the can she rushed home so sure that her apartment would be a haven the familiarity of new york a welcoming comfort but in ten minutes she had been frantic to flee had grasped at mins invitation like a drowning woman now she was marking the hours until she could go back to new york and the apartment she felt as if she had no home would the trial be a purge for her emotions would knowing that she had helped to bring about the punishment of leilas murderer in some way release her let her reach out to other people start a new life for herself excuse me a young couple were behind her she recognized him as a topseeded tennis player how long had she been blocking their path im sorry i guess im woolgathering she stepped aside and he and the young woman whose hand was entwined in his smiled indifferently and passed her she followed them slowly to the end of the path up the steps of the veranda a waiter offered her a drink she accepted it and quickly moved to the far railing she had no small talk in her min and helmut were circulating among their guests with the practiced skill of veteran party givers min was triumphantly visible in a flowing yellow satin caftan and cascading diamond earrings with a measure of surprise elizabeth realized that min was really quite slim it was her full breasts and overbearing manner that created the imposing illusion as always helmut was impeccable in a navy silk jacket and light gray flannel slacks he exuded charm as he bowed over hands smiled raised one perfectly arched eyebrowthe perfect gentleman but why did he hate leila tonight the dining rooms were decorated in peach peach tablecloths and napkins centerpieces of peach roses lenox china in a delicate peachandgold design mins table was set for four as elizabeth approached it she saw the maitre d touch mins arm and direct her to the phone on his desk when min came back to the table she was visibly annoyed nevertheless her greeting seemed genuine elizabeth at last a little time to be with you i had hoped to give both you and sammy a happy surprise sammy returned early she must have missed my note and didnt realize you were here i invited her to join us at table but shes just phoned to say she doesnt feel very well i told her you were with us and shell see you in your bungalow after dinner is she ill elizabeth asked anxiously she had a long drive still she ought to eat i wish she had made the effort min clearly wanted to dismiss any more discussion elizabeth watched as with a practiced eye min surveyed the surroundings woe to a waiter who did not have the proper demeanor who rattled or spilled or brushed against the chair of a guest the thought struck her that it was not like min to invite sammy to join her table was it possible that min had guessed there was a special reason she had waited to see sammy and wanted to know what it was and was it possible that sammy had shrewdly avoided that trap im sorry im late alvirah meehan yanked out the chair before the waiter could help her the cosmetician did a special makeup after i got dressed she said beaming how do you like it alvirah was wearing a scoopnecked beige caftan with intricate brown beading it looked very expensive i bought this in the boutique she explained you have lovely things there and i bought every single product the makeup woman suggested she was so helpful as helmut came to the table elizabeth studied mins face with amusement one was invited to join min and helmutsomething which mrs meehan did not understand min could explain that and place her at another table on the other hand mrs meehan was in the most expensive bungalow in the spa she was clearly buying everything in sight and offending her could be very foolish a strained smile tugged at the corners of mins lips you look charming she told alvirah tomorrow i shall personally help you select other outfits thats very nice of you alvirah fiddled with her sunburst pin and turned to helmut baron i have to tell you i was rereading your adyou know the one you have framed in the bungalows yes elizabeth wondered if it was just her imagination that made helmut suddenly seem wary well let me tell you that everything you say about the place is true remember how the ad says at the end of a week here you will feel as free and untroubled as a butterfly floating on a cloud the ad reads something like that yes but you wrote itdidnt you tell me that i had some input i said we have an agency nonsense helmut mrs meehan obviously agrees with the text of the ad yes mrs meehan my husband is very creative he personally writes the daily greeting and ten years ago when we converted the hotel into the spa he simply would not accept the advertising copy we were given and rewrote it himself that ad won many awards which is why we have a framed copy in every bungalow it certainly made important people want to come here alvirah told them how i wish id been a fly on the wall to listen to all of them she beamed at helmut or a butterfly floating on a cloud they were eating the lowcalorie mousse when it dawned on elizabeth how skillfully mrs meehan had drawn out helmut and min they had told her stories elizabeth had never heard before about an eccentric millionaire who had arrived on opening day on his bicycle with his rollsroyce majestically trailing him or about how a chartered plane had been sent from arabia to pick up a fortune in jewels that one of a sheikhs four wives had left behind on a table near the pool as they were about to leave the table alvirah posed her final question who was the most exciting guest youve ever had without hesitation without even looking at each other they answered leila lasalle for some reason elizabeth shivered elizabeth did not linger for coffee or the musical program as soon as she reached her bungalow she phoned sammy there was no answer in her apartment puzzled she dialed sammys office sammys voice had an excited urgency to it when she answered elizabeth i nearly fainted when min told me you were here no im perfectly all right ill be right over ten minutes later elizabeth flung open the door of her bungalow and threw her arms around the frail fiercely loyal woman who had shared with her the last years of leilas life sitting opposite each other on the matching sofas they took each others measure elizabeth was shocked to see how much dora had changed i know dora said with a wry smile i dont look that hot you dont look well sammy elizabeth said hows it really going dora shrugged i still feel so guilty you were away and couldnt see the daytoday change in leila when she came to visit me in the hospital i could see it something was destroying her but she wouldnt talk about it i ought to have contacted you i feel i let her down so terribly and now its as if i have to find out what happened i cant let it rest until i do elizabeth felt tears begin to spill from her eyes now dont you dare get me started she said for the entire first year i had to carry dark glasses with me i just never knew when id start crying i used to call the glasses my grief equipment she clasped her hands together sammy tell me is there any chance im wrong about ted i was not mistaken about the time and if he pushed leila off that terrace he has to pay for it but is it possible he was trying to hold her why was she so upset why was she drinking you heard her talk about how disgusted she was with people who drank too much that night a few minutes before she died i was nasty to her i tried to do what she used to do to mamashock her make her see what she was doing to herself maybe if id been more sympathetic sammy if id only asked her why in a spontaneous gesture they moved together doras thin arms encircled elizabeth felt the trembling in the slender young body and remembered the teenager who had so worshiped her big sister oh sparrow she said unthinkingly using leilas name for elizabeth what would leila think about the two of us going on like this shed say quit moaning and do something about it elizabeth dabbed at her eyes and managed a smile exactly with quick nervous movements dora smoothed the thin strands of hair that always wanted to slip out from her bun lets backtrack had leila started to act upset before you left on the tour elizabeth frowned as she tried to focus to weed out extraneous memories it was just before i left that leilas divorce had come through shed been with her accountant it was the first time in years id seen her worried about money she said something like sparrow ive made an awful lot of loot and honest to god now im on thin ice i told her that two deadbeat husbands had put her in that bind but i didnt consider being about to marry a multimillionaire like ted being on thin ice and she said something like ted really does love me doesnt he i told her to for gods sake get off that line i said you keep doubting him and youll drive him away hes nuts about you now go earn the four million bucks he just invested in you what did she say dora asked she started to laughyou know that big gorgeous laugh of hersand she said as usual youre right sparrow she was terribly excited about the play and then when you were gone and i was sick and ted was traveling someone began a campaign to destroy her dora reached into the pocket of her cardigan today the letter i wrote you about was stolen from my desk but just before you phoned i found another one in leilas mail she never got to read it eitherit was still sealedbut it speaks for itself horrified elizabeth read and reread the uneven carelessly pasted words leila why wont you admit ted is trying to dump you his new girl is getting tired of waiting that four million dollars was his kissoff to you and more than youre worth dont blow it honey the words out its a lousy play and youre ten years too old for the part too your friend dora watched as elizabeth s face turned stony pale leila hadnt seen this elizabeth asked quietly no but she must have been receiving a series of them who could have taken the other one today briefly dora filled her in on the explosion over the expenses for the bathhouse and about cheryls unexpected arrival i know cheryl was at my desk she left her bill there but so could anyone else have taken it this smacks of cheryls touch elizabeth held the letter by the corner loath to handle it i wonder if this can be traced fingerprints that and typeface has a code even knowing what magazines and newspapers these words were snipped from could be helpful wait a minute elizabeth went into the bedroom and returned with a plastic bag carefully she slipped the anonymous note into it ill find out where to send this to be analyzed she sat down again and folded her arms on her knees sammy do you remember exactly what the other letter said i think so then write it down just a minute theres paper in the desk dora wrote crossed out rewrote finally handed the paper to elizabeth thats pretty close leila how many times do i have to write cant you get it straight that ted is sick of you his new girl is beautiful and much younger than you i told you that the emerald necklace he gave her matches the bracelet he gave you it cost twice as much and looks ten times better i hear your play is lousy you really should learn your lines ill write again soon your friend this letter elizabeth read and reread that bracelet sammy when did ted give it to leila sometime after christmas the anniversary of their first date wasnt it she had me put it in the safetydeposit box because she was starting rehearsals and knew she wouldnt be wearing it thats what i mean how many people could have known about that bracelet ted gave it to her at a dinner party who was there the usual people min helmut craig cheryl syd ted you and i and the same group of people knew how much ted put into the play remember he didnt want it publicized sammy have you finished going through the mail besides the one i started this afternoon theres one more large sack it may have six or seven hundred letters in it tomorrow morning im going to help you go through them sammy think about who might have written these letters min and the baron had nothing to do with the play they had everything to gain by having ted and leila together here with all the people they attracted syd had a million dollars in the play craig acted as though the four million ted invested was out of his own pocket he certainly wouldnt do anything to wreck the plays chances but cheryl never forgave leila for taking ted from her she never forgave leila for becoming a superstar she knew leilas vulnerabilities and she would be the very one whod want the letters back now what good are they to her elizabeth stood up slowly she walked to the window and pushed back the curtain the night was still brilliantly clear because if some way they can be traced to her they can ruin her career how would the public feel if it learned that leila had been driven to suicide by a woman she considered a friend elizabeth did you hear what you just said elizabeth turned dont you think im right you have just conceded the fact that leila might have committed suicide elizabeth gasped she stumbled across the room fell to her knees and put her head on sammys lap sammy help me she pleaded i dont know what to believe anymore i dont know what to do eight it was at henry bartletts suggestion that they went out for dinner and invited cheryl and syd to join them when ted protested that he did not want to get involved with cheryl henry cut him off sharply teddy like it or not you are involved with cheryl she and syd melnick can be very important witnesses for you i fail to see how if we dont admit that you may have gone back upstairs weve got to prove that elizabeth lange was confused about the exact time of that phone conversation and weve got to make the jury believe that leila may have committed suicide what about the eyewitness she saw a tree on the terrace moving her lively imagination decided it was you struggling with leila shes a nut case they went to the cannery a chattering happy endofsummer crowd filled the popular restaurant but craig had phoned ahead and there was a window table with a sweeping view of monterey harbor awaiting them cheryl slipped in beside ted her hand rested on his knee this is like old times she whispered she was wearing a lame halter and matching skintight pants a buzz of excitement had followed her as she walked across the room in the months since hed seen her cheryl had phoned him repeatedly but hed never returned the calls now as her warm restless fingers caressed his knee ted wondered if he was being a fool for not taking what was being offered to him cheryl would say anything he wanted that might help his defense but at what price syd bartlett and craig were visibly relieved to be here instead of at the spa wait till you start eating syd told henry youll know what seafood is all about the waiter came bartlett ordered a johnnie walker black label his champagnetoned linen jacket was an impeccable fit his sport shirt in the exact champagne shade and cinnamoncolored trousers were obviously custommade his thick but meticulously barbered white hair contrasted handsomely with his unlined tanned face ted imagined him by turn informing wooing scolding a jury a grandstander obviously it worked for him but what percentage of the time he started to order a vodka martini and changed it to a beer this was no time to dull any of his faculties it was early for dinner only seven oclock but he had insisted on that craig and syd were having an animated conversation syd seemed almost cheerful testimony for sale ted thought make leila sound like a maniacal drunk it could all backfire kids and if it does im the one who pays craig was asking syd about his agency was sympathizing with him over the money hed lost in leilas play we took a bath too he said he looked over at cheryl and smiled warmly and we think you were a hell of a good sport to try to save the ship cheryl for gods sake dont shovel it on ted bit his lip to keep from shouting at craig but everyone else was smiling broadly he was the alien in the group the unidentified flying object he could sense the eyes of the other diners on this table on him he might as well have been able to overhear the sotto voce conversations his trial starts next week do you think he did it with his money hell probably get off they always do not necessarily impatiently ted looked out at the bay the harbor was filled with boatslarge small sailing vessels yachts whenever she could his mother had brought him to visit here it was the only place where shed been happy teds mothers family came from monterey craig was telling henry bartlett again ted experienced the wild irritation that craig had begun to trigger in him when had it started in hawaii before that dont read my thoughts dont speak for me im sick of it leila used to ask him if he didnt get sick of having the bulldog at his heels all the time the drinks came bartlett took over the conversation as you know you are all listed as potential defense witnesses for teddy obviously you can testify to the scene at elaines so can about two hundred other people but on the stand id like you to help me paint for the jurors a more complete picture of leila you all know her public image but you also know that she was a deeply insecure woman who had no faith in herself who was haunted by a fear of failure a marilyn monroe defense syd suggested with all the wild stories about monroe s death everyone has pretty well conceded that she committed suicide exactly bartlett favored syd with a friendly smile now the question is motive syd tell me about the play syd shrugged it was perfect for her it could have been written about her she loved the script the rehearsals started like a cakewalk i used to tell her we could open in a week and then something happened she came into the theater smashed at nine in the morning after that it was all downhill stage fright lots of people get stage fright helen hayes threw up before every performance when jimmy stewart finished a movie he was sure no one would ever ask him to be in another one leila threw up and worried thats show biz thats just what i dont want to hear on the stand henry said sharply i intend to paint the picture of a woman with a drinking problem who was experiencing severe depression a teenager was standing over cheryl could i please have your autograph he plunked a menu in front of her of course cheryl beamed and scrawled her signature is it true youre going to be amanda in that new series keep your fingers crossed i think so cheryls eyes drank in the adolescents homage youll be great thank you now if we just had a tape of this to send to bob koenig syd said drily when will you know craig asked maybe in the next few days craig held up his glass to amanda cheryl ignored him and turned to ted arent you going to drink to that he raised his glass of course he meant it the naked hope in her eyes was in an odd way touching leila had always overshadowed cheryl why had they kept up the farce of friendship was it because cheryls endless quest to become bigger than leila had been a challenge for leila a constant prod that she welcomed that kept her on her mettle cheryl must have seen something in his face because her lips brushed his cheek he did not pull away it was over coffee that cheryl leaned her elbows on the table and cupped her chin in her hands the champagne she had drunk had clouded her eyes so that they now seemed to smolder with secret promises her voice was slightly blurred as she halfwhispered to bartlett suppose leila believed that ted wanted to dump her for another woman what would that do to help the suicide theory i was not involved with another woman ted said flatly darling this isnt true confessions you dont have to say a word cheryl chided henry answer my question if we had proof that ted was interested in someone else and that leila knew it we give leila a reason to be despondent we damage the prosecutors claim that ted killed leila because she rejected him are you telling me there was something going on between you and ted before leila died bartlett asked hopefully ill answer that ted snapped no you didnt listen cheryl protested i said i may have proof that leila thought ted was ready to dump her for someone else cheryl i suggest you shut up you dont know what youre talking about syd told her now lets get out of here youve had too much to drink youre right cheryl said amiably youre not often right syd dear but this time you are just a minute bartlett interrupted cheryl unless this is some sort of game youd better put your cards on the table anything that clarifies leilas state of mind is vital to teds defense what do ou call proof maybe something that wouldnt even interest you cheryl said let me sleep on it craig signaled for a check i have a feeling this conversation is a waste of time it was nine thirty when the limousine dropped them at the spa i want ted to walk me to my place now cheryls voice had an edge on it ill walk you syd snapped ted will walk me cheryl insisted she leaned against him as they went down the path toward her bungalow other guests were just beginning to leave the main house wasnt it fun to be out together cheryl murmured cheryl is this proof talk one of your games ted pushed the cloud of black hair away from her face i like it when you touch my hair they were at her bungalow come in darling no ill say good night she pulled his head down until their lips were barely apart in the starlight her eyes blazed up at him had she faked the business of acting tight he wondered darling she whispered feverishly dont you understand that im the one who can help you walk out of that courtroom a free man craig and bartlett said good night to syd and made their way to their bungalows henry bartlett was visibly satisfied teddy looks as if hes finally getting the message having that little lady in his corner at the trial will be important what do you think she meant by that mumbo jumbo about ted being involved with another woman wishful thinking she probably wants to volunteer for the part i see if hes smart hell accept they reached craigs bungalow id like to come in for a minute bartlett told him its a good chance to talk alone inside the bungalow he glanced around this is a different look its mins masculine rustic effect craig explained she didnt miss a trickpine tables wideplanked floors the bed even has a cord spring she automatically puts me in one of these units i think she subconsciously views me as the simple type are you i dont think so and even though i lean to kingsize beds with box springs this is a hell of a step up from avenue b and eighth street where my old man had a deli bartlett studied craig carefully bulldog was an apt description for him he decided sandy hair neutral complexion cheeks that would fold into jowls if he let himself put weight on a solid citizen a good person to have in your corner ted is lucky to have you he said i dont think he appreciates it thats where youre wrong ted has to rely on me now to front for him in the business and he resents it to clarify that he only thinks he resents me the problem is my very presence in his place is a symbol of the jam hes in craig went to the closet and pulled out a suitcase like you i carry my private supply he poured courvoisier into two glasses handed one of them to bartlett and settled on the couch leaning forward turning his glass in his hand ill give you the best example i can my cousin was in an accident and flat on her back in the hospital for nearly a year her mother knocked herself out taking care of the kids you want to know something my cousin was jealous of her mother she said her mother was enjoying her children and she should be the one with them its like that with ted and me the minute my cousin got out of the hospital she was singing her mothers praises for the good job she did when ted is acquitted things will be back to normal between us and let me tell you id a lot rather put up with his outbursts than be in his boots bartlett realized that he had been too quick to dismiss craig babcock as a glorified lackey the problem he told himself sourly of being too cocky he chose his response carefully i see your point and i think youre quite perceptive unexpectedly perceptive craig asked with a halfsmile bartlett chose to ignore the bait i also am starting to feel somewhat better about this case we might be able to put together a defense that will at least create reasonable doubt in a jurys mind did you take care of the investigative agency yes weve got two detectives finding out everything they can about the ross woman weve got another detective trailing her maybe thats overkill but you never know nothing that helps is overkill bartlett moved to the door as you can certainly see ted winters resents the hell out of me for probably the same reason hes jumping at you we both want him to walk out of that courtroom a free man one line of defense that i hadnt considered before tonight is to convince the jury that shortly before leila lasalle died he and cheryl had gotten back together and the money he put in the play was a kissoff for leila bartlett opened the door and glanced back over his shoulder sleep on it and come back to me in the morning with a game plan he paused but weve got to prevail on teddy to go along with us when syd reached his bungalow the message light on the phone was flashing he sensed immediately that it was bob koenig the president of world motion pictures was famed for his habit of placing afterhours calls it could only mean that a decision had been made about cheryl and the role of amanda he broke into a cold sweat with one hand he reached for a cigarette with the other for the phone as he barked syd melnick he cradled the receiver against his shoulder and lit the cigarette glad you reached me tonight syd i had a sixoclock call in to you in the morning id have been awake who can sleep in this business i sleep like a top myself syd ive got a couple of questions he had been sure that cheryl had lost the part something about the flashing light had signaled doom but bob had questions no decision had been made he could visualize bob at the other end of the line leaning back in the leather swivel chair in his library at home bob hadnt gotten to be head of the studio by making sentimental decisions cheryls test was great syd told himself hopefully but then what shoot he said trying to sound relaxed were still battling it out between cheryl and margo dresher you know how tough it is to launch a series margos a bigger name cheryl was good damn goodprobably better than margo even though ill deny having said that but cheryl hasnt done anything big in years and that fiasco on broadway kept coming up at the meeting the play once again the play leilas face drifted across syds mind the way shed screamed at him in elaines he had wanted to bludgeon her then to drown out that cynical mocking voice forever that play was a vehicle for leila i take full blame for rushing cheryl into it syd weve been through all that im going to be absolutely candid with you last year as all the columnists reported margo had a little drug problem the public is getting damn sick of stars who spend half their lives in drugrehab centers i want it straight is there anything about cheryl that could embarrass us if we choose her syd gripped the phone cheryl had the inside track a burst of hope made his pulse fluctuate wildly sweat poured from his palms bob i swear to you everybody swears to me try telling me the truth instead if i put myself on the line and decide on cheryl will it backfire on me if it ever does syd youre finished i swear i swear on my mothers grave syd hung up the phone hunched over and put his face in his hands clammy perspiration broke over his entire body once again the golden ring was within his grasp only this time it was cheryl not leila who could screw it up for him nine when she left elizabeth dora carried the plasticwrapped anonymous letter in the pocket of her cardigan they had decided that she would make a copy of the letter on the office machine and in the morning elizabeth would take the original to the sheriffs office in salinas scott alshorne the county sheriff was a regular dinner guest at the spa hed been friendly with mins first husband and was always discreetly helpful when a problem like missing jewelry arose leila had adored him poisonpen letters arent the same as missing jewelry dora warned elizabeth i know but scott can tell us where to send the letter for analysis or if i should just give it to the district attorneys office in new york anyway i want a copy myself then let me make it tonight tomorrow when min is around we cant risk having her reading it as dora was leaving elizabeth wrapped her in her arms you dont believe ted is guilty do you sammy of calculated murder no i simply cant believe that and if he was interested in another woman there was no motive for him to kill leila dora had to go back to the office anyhow shed left mail scattered on the desk and the unsearched plastic bags on the floor of the reception room min would have a fit if she saw them her dinner tray was still on a table near her desk almost untouched funny how little appetite she had these days seventyone really wasnt that old it was just that between the operation and losing leila there was a spark gone the old zest that leila had always teased her about the copy machine was camouflaged by a walnut cabinet she opened the top of the cabinet and turned on the machine took the letter from her pocket and slipped it free of the plastic bag carefully touching it only by the edges her movements were quick there was always the worry that min might take it into her head to come down to the office helmut was undoubtedly locked in his study he was an insomniac and read late into the night she happened to glance out the halfopen window just the sound of the pacificits truculent roar and the smell of the salty breeze were invigorating she did not mind the rush of cool air that caused her to shiver but what had caught her attention all the guests were settled by now lights were visible from behind the curtained windows of the bungalows just against the horizon she could see the outlines of the umbrella tables around the olympic pool to the left the silhouette of the roman bathhouse loomed against the sky the night was starting to turn misty it was getting harder to see then dora leaned forward someone was walking not on the path but in the shadows of the cypress trees as though afraid of being seen she adjusted her glasses and was astonished to realize that whoever was there was wearing a scubadiving outfit what ever was he doing on the grounds he seemed to be heading toward the olympic pool elizabeth had told her she was going swimming an unreasoning fear gripped dora shoving the letter into the pocket of her cardigan she hurried out of the office and as swiftly as she could move her arthritic body rushed down the stairs across the darkened foyer and out the seldomused side door now the interloper was passing the roman bathhouse she hurried to cut him off it was probably one of the college kids who were staying at pebble beach lodge she told herself every once in a while theyd sneak onto the grounds and go for a swim in the olympic pool but she didnt like the idea of this one coming upon elizabeth if she was alone there she turned and realized that he had seen her the lights of the security guards golf cart were coming up the hill from near the gates the figure in the scuba outfit ran toward the roman bathhouse dora could see that the door was ajar that fool helmut probably hadnt bothered to close it this afternoon her knees were trembling as she hurried behind him the guard would drive by in a moment and she didnt want the intruder to get away tentatively she stepped inside the doorway of the bathhouse the entrance foyer was a giant open expanse of marbled walls with twin staircases at the far end there was enough light from the japanese lanterns in the trees outside for dora to see that this area was empty they actually had done quite a bit more work since shed looked in a few weeks ago through the open doorway to the left she saw the beam of a flashlight the archway led to the lockers and beyond was the first of the saltwater pools for an instant her indignation was replaced by fear she decided to go out and wait for the guard dora in here the familiar voice made her weak with relief carefully making her way across the darkened foyer she went through the locker room and into the area of the indoor pool he was waiting for her flashlight in hand the blackness of the wet suit the thick underwater goggles the bend of the head the sudden convulsive movement of the flashlight made her step back uncertainly for goodness sake dont shine that thing at me i cant see she said one hand thick and menacing in the heavy black glove stretched out toward her reaching for her throat the other flashed the light directly in her eyes blinding her horrified dora began to back up she raised her hands to protect herself and was unaware that she had brushed the letter from her pocket she barely felt the empty space under her feet before her body toppled backward her last thought as her head smashed against the piles of jagged concrete at the bottom of the pool was that at last she knew who had killed leila ten elizabeth swam from one end of the pool to the other at a demanding furious pace the fog was just beginning to roll inuneven bits of mist that at one moment blew like a dark vapor over the surrounding area the next were gone she preferred it when it was dark she could work every inch of her body knowing that the punishing physical effort somehow would diffuse the builtup emotional anxiety she reached the north end of the pool touched the wall inhaled turned pivoted and with a furious breaststroke began racing toward the opposite end now her heart was pounding with the strain of the pace she had set herself it was crazy she wasnt in condition for this kind of swimming but still she raced trying with the expenditure of physical energy to outrun her thoughts at last she felt herself begin to calm down and flipping onto her back she began to tread water her arms rotating in even sweeping motions the letters the one they had the one someone had taken the others they might find in the unopened mail the ones leila had probably seen and destroyed why didnt leila tell me about them why did she shut me out she always used me as a sounding board she always said i could snap her out of taking criticism too seriously leila hadnt told her because she had believed that ted was involved with someone else that there was nothing she could do about it but sammy was right if ted was involved withsomeone else he had no motive to kill leila but i wasnt mistaken about the time of the call suppose leila had fallenhad slipped from his graspand hed blacked out suppose those letters had driven her to suicide ive got to find out who sent them elizabeth thought it was time to go in she was dead tired and at last somewhat calmer in the morning shed go through the rest of the mail with sammy shed take the letter theyd found to scott alshorne he might want her to take it directly to the district attorney in new york was she handing ted an alibi and whom had he been involved with as she climbed the ladder from the pool she shivered the night air was chilly now and shed stayed longer than shed realized she slipped on her robe and reached into the pocket for her wristwatch the luminous dial showed that it was halfpast ten she thought she heard a rustling sound from behind the cypress trees that bordered the patio whos there she knew her voice sounded nervous there was no answer and she walked to the edge of the patio and strained her eyes to see past the hedges and between the scattered trees the silhouettes of the cypress trees seemed grotesque and ominous in the dark but there was no movement other than the faint rustling of the leaves the cool sea breeze was becoming more forceful that was it of course with a gesture of dismissal she wrapped the robe around her and pulled the hood over her hair but somehow the feeling of uneasiness persisted and her footsteps quickened along the path to her bungalow he hadnt touched sammy but there would be questions what was she doing in the bathhouse he cursed the fact that the door had been open that he had run in there if he had simply gone around it shed never have caught him something so simple could betray him but the fact that she had the letter with her that it had fallen from her pocketthat had been simple good luck should he destroy it he wasnt sure it was a doubleedged sword now the letter was buried against his skin inside the wet suit the door of the bathhouse was snaplocked the guard had made his desultory rounds and wouldnt be back tonight slowly with infinite caution he made his way toward the pool would she be there probably should he take the chance tonight two accidents was that more risky than letting her live elizabeth would demand answers when sammys body was found had elizabeth seen thatletter he heard the lapping of the water in the pool cautiously he stepped from behind the tree and watched the swiftly moving body he would have to wait until she slowed down by then she would be tired it might be the time to go ahead two unrelated accidents in one night would the ensuing confusion keep people off the track he took a step forward toward the pool and saw him standing behind the shrubbery watching elizabeth what was he doing there did he suspect she was in danger or had he too decided she was an unacceptable risk the wet suit glistened with mist as its wearer slipped behind the sheltering branches of cypress and vanished into the night tuesday september quote for the day to the best to the most beautiful who is my joy and wellbeing charles baudelaire good morning bonjour

consuming a fascinating thought beauty is in the eye of the beholder but when you look in the mirror you are the beholder baron and baroness helmut von schreiber one the first hint of dawn found min lying wide awake in the canopied kingsize bed she shared with helmut moving carefully to keep from disturbing him she turned her head and pulled herself up on one elbow even in sleep he was a handsome man he was lying on his side facing her his one hand outstretched as though reaching for her his breath now quiet and soft he had not slept like that all night she didnt know what time hed come to bed but at two shed awakened to the awareness of agitated movement his head shaking his voice angry and muffled there had been no more sleep for her when she heard what he was saying damn you leila damn you instinctively she had laid her hand on his shoulder murmured a soft shushing sound and he had settled back would he remember the dream remember that he had cried out she had given no indication of having heard him it would be useless to expect him to tell her the truth incredible as it seemed had something been going on between him and leila after all or had it been a onesided attraction on helmuts part toward leila that didnt make it any easier the light more golden than rosy now began to brighten the room carefully min eased out of bed even in her heartsick distress she felt a moment of appreciation for the beauty of this room helmut had chosen the furnishings and color scheme who else would have visualized the exquisite balance of the peach satin draperies and bedding against the deep blueviolet tone of the carpet how much longer would she be living here this could be their last season the million dollars in the swiss account she reminded herself just the interest on that will be enough enough for whom herself maybe helmut never shed always known that a large part of her attraction for him was this place the ability to strut around with this background to mingle with celebrities did she really think hed be content to follow a relatively simple lifestyle with an aging wife noiselessly min glided across the room slipped on a robe and went down the stairs helmut would sleep for another halfhour she always had to awaken him at six thirty in this halfhour it would be safe to go through some of the records particularly the american express bills in those weeks before leila died helmut had been away from the spa frequently hed been asked to speak at several medical seminars and conventions hed lent his name to some charity balls and flown in to attend them that was good for business but what else had he been doing when he was on the east coast that was the time ted had been traveling a great deal she understood helmut leilas obvious scorn for him would be a challenge had he been seeing her the night before leila died theyd attended the last preview of her show theyd been at elaines theyd stayed at the plaza and in the morning flown to boston to attend a charity luncheon hed put her on a plane to san francisco at six thirty in the evening had he gone to the dinner he was supposed to attend in boston or had he taken the sevenoclock shuttle to new york the possibility haunted her at midnight california time three am eastern time helmut had phoned to make sure she was home safely she had assumed he was calling from the hotel in boston that was something she could check at the bottom of the staircase min turned left and key in hand went to the office the door was unlocked her senses were assaulted by the condition of the room the lights were still on a dinner tray was on a table at one side of doras desk the desk itself was piled with letters plastic bags their contents spilling on the floor bordered the desk the window was partly open and a cold breeze was rustling the letters even the copy machine was on min stalked over to the desk and flipped through the mail angrily she realized that everything was fan mail to leila her lips tightened ominously she was sick to death of that mournful look dora got whenever she answered those letters at least till now shed had the brains not to mess up the office with that silly drivel from now on if she wants to do that mail shell do it in her apartment period or maybe it was time to get rid of anyone who insisted on canonizing leila what a field day cheryl would have had if shed come in here and started going through the personal files dora had probably gotten tired and decided to wait to clear up the office this morning but to leave the copy machine and the lights on was unforgivable in the morning shed tell dora to start making plans for her retirement but now she had to get about the reason she had come here in the storage room min went to the file marked travel expenses baron von schreiber it took less than two minutes to find what she wanted the phone call from the east coast to the spa the night leila died was listed on his telephone creditcard bill it had been made from new york two sheer fatigue made elizabeth fall into sleep but it was a restless sleep filled with dreams leila was standing in front of stacks of fan mail leila was reading the letters to her leila was crying i cant trust anyone i cant trust anyone in the morning there was no question in her mind of going on the walk she showered pulled her hair into a topknot slipped on her jogging suit and after waiting just long enough for the hikers to be on their way headed for the main house she knew sammy was always at her desk by a few minutes after seven it was a shock to find the usually impeccable receptionists office cluttered with stacks of mail on and around doras desk a large sheet of paper with the ominous words see me and signed by min clearly revealed that min had seen the mess how unlike sammy never once in all the years shed known her had sammy left her desk cluttered it was unthinkable shed have chanced leaving it this way in the reception area it was a surefire way of bringing on one of mins famous rages but suppose she was ill quickly elizabeth hurried down the stairs to the foyer of the main house and rushed to the stairway leading to the staff wing dora had an apartment on the second floor she knocked briskly at the door but there was no answer the sound of a vacuum came from around the corner the maid nelly was a longtime employee who had been here when elizabeth was working as an instructor it was easy to get her to open sammys door with a growing sense of panic elizabeth walked through the pleasant rooms the sitting room in shades of lime green and white with sammys carefully tended plants on the windowsills and tabletops the single bed primly neat with sammys bible on the night table nelly pointed to the bed she didnt sleep here last night miss lange and look nelly walked to the window her cars in the parking lot do you suppose she felt sick and sent for a cab or something to go to the hospital that would be just like miss samuels you know how independent she is but there was no record of a dora samuels having signed herself into the community hospital with growing apprehension elizabeth waited for min to come back from the morning walk in an effort to keep her mind from the fearful worry that something had happened to sammy she began to scan the fan mail where was the unsigned letter dora had planned to copy was she still carrying it three at five of seven syd walked up the path to join the others for the morning hike cheryl could read him like a book hed have to be careful bob wasnt making his final decision until this afternoon if it werent for that damn play it would be in the bag now you hear that everybodyi quit and you wiped me out you bitch he thought he managed to twist his face into the contortion of a smile the greenwich connecticut set were there all turned out for the morning hike every hair in place flawless skin manicured hands pretty clear none of them had ever hung by their fingernails waiting for a call ever clawed their way up in a cutthroat business ever had someone throw them into the financial gutter with the toss of a head it would be a perfect pebble beach day the sun was already warming the cool morning air the faint smell of salt from the pacific mingled with the fragrance of the flowering trees that surrounded the main house syd remembered the tenement in brooklyn where hed been raised the dodgers had been in brooklyn then maybe they should have stayed there maybe he should have stayed there too min and the baron came out onto the veranda syd was immediately aware of how drawn min looked her expression was frozen on her face the way people get when theyve witnessed an accident and cannot believe what theyve seen how much had she guessed he did not glance at helmut but instead turned his head to watch cheryl and ted coming up the path syd could read teds mind hed always felt guilty about dumping cheryl for leila but it was obvious he didnt want to pick up with her again obvious to everyone except cheryl what in hell had she meant with that dumb remark about proof that ted was innocent what was she up to now good morning mr melnick he turned to see alvirah meehan beaming up at him why dont we just walk together she asked i know how disappointed you must be that margo dresher is probably going to be amanda in the series im telling you theyre making a terrible mistake syd did not realize how hard he had grasped her arm until he saw her flinch sorry mrs meehan but you dont know what youre talking about too late alvirah realized that only the insiders had that tipthe reporter from the globe who was her contact for her article had told her to study cheryl mannings reaction when she got the news shed made a bad slip oh am i wrong she asked maybe its just that my husband was saying that he read its neck and neck between cheryl and margo dresher syd made his voice confidential mrs meehan do me a favor wont you dont talk about that to anyone it isnt true and you can imagine how it would upset miss manning cheryl had her hand on teds arm whatever she had been saying she had him laughing she was a hell of a good actressbut not good enough to keep her cool if she lost the amanda role and shed turn on him like an alley cat then as syd watched ted raised his hand in a careless salute and started jogging toward the front gate good morning everyone min boomed in a hollow attempt at her usual vigor let us be on our way remember a brisk pace and deep breathing please alvirah stepped back as cheryl caught up with them they fell into line on the walkway that led to the woods scanning the clusters of people ahead syd picked out craig walking with the lawyer henry bartlett the countess and her entourage were directly behind them the tennis pro and his girlfriend were holding hands the talkshow host was with his date for the week a twentyyearold model the various other guests in twos and threes were unfamiliar when leila made this place her hangout she put it on the map syd thought you never knew when youd find her here min needs a new superstar he had noticed the way all eyes drank in ted as he jogged away ted was a superstar cheryl was clearly in a buoyant mood her dark hair exploded around her face her coalblack brows arced above the huge amber eyes her petulant mouth was carved into a seductive smile she began to hum that old feeling her breasts were high and pointed under her jogging suit no one else could make a jogging suit look like a second coat of skin weve got to talk syd told her quietly go ahead not here cheryl shrugged then later dont look so sour syd breathe deeply get rid of poisonous thoughts dont bother being cute with me when we get back ill come to your place what is this about cheryl clearly did not want to have the euphoric mood spoiled syd glanced over his shoulder alvirah was directly behind them syd could almost feel her breath on his neck he gave cheryls arm a warning pinch when they reached the road min continued to lead in the direction of the lone cypress tree and helmut began dropping back to chat with the hikers good morning wonderful day try to pick up the pace youre doing marvelously his artificial cheerfulness grated on syd leila had been right the baron was a toy soldier wind him up and he marches forward helmut stopped abreast of cheryl i hope you two enjoyed your dinner last night his smile was dazzling and mechanical syd could not remember what he had eaten it was okay good helmut dropped back to ask alvirah meehan how she was feeling absolutely fine her voice was hard and stri dent you might say im as bright as a butterfly floating on a cloud her noisy laugh sent a chill through syd had even alvirah meehan caught on henry bartlett was not feeling good about the world or his particular situation when he was asked to take on the case of ted winters hed rearranged his calendar immediately few criminal lawyers would be too busy to represent a prominent multimillionaire but there was an ongoing problem between him and ted winters the definitive word was chemistry and it was bad between them as he grudgingly plodded on the forced march behind min and the baron henry admitted to himself that this place was luxurious that the setting was beautiful that under different circumstances he could come to appreciate the charms of the monterey peninsula and cypress point spa but now he was on a countdown the trial of the people of the state of new yorkvandrew edward winters iii would begin in exactly one week publicity was eminently desirable when you won a headline case but unless ted winters started cooperating this case would not be won min was picking up the pace henry quickened his footsteps he hadnt missed the appreciative glances of the fiftyish ashblonde who was with the countess under different circumstances hed check that out but not now craig was marching at a solid steady pace behind him henry still couldnt put his finger on what made craig babcock tick on the one hand hed talked about pops deli on the lower east side on the other he was clearly the hatchet man for ted winters it was a pity that it was too late for him to testify that he and ted had been on the phone when that socalled eyewitness claimed she saw ted that thought reminded henry of what he wanted to ask craig whats with the investigator on sally ross i put three investigators on hertwo for background one to shadow her it should have been done months ago i agree teds first lawyer didnt think it was necessary they were leaving the path that exited the spa grounds and proceeding onto the road that led to the lone cypress how did you arrange to get reports the head guy will call me every morning nine thirty new york time six thirty here i just spoke to him nothing too important to report yet pretty much what we know already shes been divorced a couple of times she fights with her neighbors shes always accusing people of staring at her she treats like its her own personal hot line always calling to report suspiciouslooking characters i could chew her up and spit her out on the stand bartlett said without elizabeth langes testimony the prosecution would be flying on one wing incidentally i want to know how good her eyesight is if she needs glasses what strength glasses when they were changed last and so on everything about her vision good ill phone it in for a few minutes they walked in silence the morning was silvery bright the sun was absorbing the dew from the leaves and bushes the road was quiet with only an occasional car passing the narrow bridge that led to the lone cypress was empty bartlett glanced over his shoulder id hoped to see ted holding hands with cheryl he always jogs in the morning maybe he was holding hands with her all night i hope so your friend syd doesnt look happy the rumor is syds broke he was riding high with leila as a client hed sign her up for a picture and part of the deal was theyd use a couple of his other clients somewhere else thats how he kept cheryl working without leila and with all the money he lost in that play hes got problems hed love to put the arm on ted right now i wont let him he and cheryl are the most important defense witnesses we have henry snapped maybe youd better be more generous in fact im going to make that suggestion to ted they had passed the pebble beach lodge and were on the way back to the spa well get to work after breakfast bartlett announced ive got to decide the strategy of this case and whether to put ted on the stand my guess is that hell make a lousy witness for himself but no matter how much the judge instructs the jury it makes a big psychological difference when a defendant wont subject himself to questioning syd walked back to cheryls bungalow with her lets make this short she said when the door closed behind them i want to shower and i invited ted for breakfast she pulled the sweat shirt over her head stepped out of the sweat pants and reached for her robe what is it always practicing arent you syd snapped save it for the dopes honey id rather wrestle with a tiger for a long minute he studied her she had darkened her hair for the amanda audition and the effect was startling the softer color had obliterated the brassy cheapatthecore look shed never quite conquered and had accentuated those marvelous eyes even in a terrycloth robe she looked like someone with class inside syd knew she was the same scheming little hooker hed been dealing with for nearly two decades now she smiled dazzlingly at him oh syd lets not fight what do you want ill be happy to make it brief why did you suggest that leila might have committed suicide why would she have believed that ted was involved with another woman proof what kind of proof a letter quickly she explained i went up to see min yesterday they had the nerve to leave a bill here when they know perfectly well im a draw for this place they were inside and i just happened to notice all that fan mail on sammys desk and when i looked around i saw this crazy letter and i took it you took it of course let me show it to you she hurried into her bedroom brought it back and leaning over his shoulder read it with him leila how many times do i have to write cant you get it straight that ted is sick of you his new girl is beautiful and much younger thanyoui told you that the emerald necklace he gave hmatches the bracelet he gave you it cost twice as much and looks ten times better i hear your play is lousy you really should learn your lines ill write again soon your friend dont you see ted must have been having a fling with someone else but wouldnt that make him glad to break up with leila and if he wants to say it was with me thats fine ill back him up you stupid bitch cheryl straightened up and walked over to the other couch she sat down leaned forward and spoke precisely as though she were addressing a notverybright child you dont seem to realize that this letter is my chance to make ted understand that i have his best interests at heart syd walked over grabbed the letter from cheryls hand and shredded it last night bob koenig phoned me to make sure there was nothing unfavorable that might come out about you you know why as of this minute you have the inside track for amanda because margo dreshers had more than her share of lousy publicity what kind of publicity do you think youd get if leilas fans find out you drove her to suicide with poisonpen letters i didnt write that letter the hell you didnt how many people knew about that bracelet i saw your eyes when ted gave it to leila you were ready to stab her right then those rehearsals were closed how many people knew leila was having trouble with her lines you knew why because i told you myself you wrote that letter and others like it how much time did it take you to cut and paste im surprised you had the patience how many more are there and are they likely to show up cheryl looked alarmed syd i swear to you i did not write that letter or any others syd tell me about bob koenig now it was syd who enunciating slowly repeated the conversation when he finished cheryl reached out her hand got a match you know i gave up smoking syd watched as the shredded letter with its bizarre uneven scraps of print curled and disappeared in the ashtray cheryl came over to him and put her arms around his neck i knew you were going to get that part for me syd youre right about getting rid of the letter i think i should still testify at the trial the publicity will be wonderful but dont you think my attitude should be shock that my very dearest friend was so distraught and depressed then i could explain how even those of us at the top have terrible periods of anxiety her eyes opened wide two tears ran down her cheeks i think bob koenig would like that approach dont you four elizabeth mins startled voice made her jump is something wrong where is sammy min and helmut were in matching jogging outfits mins black hair was pulled regally into a chignon but her makeup only partially masked the unfamiliar wrinkles around her eyes the puffiness of her lids the baron seemed as always to be striking a pose his legs slightly parted his hands clasped behind his back his head bent forward his eyes puzzled and guileless briefly elizabeth told them what had happened sammy was missing her bed had not been slept in min looked alarmed i came down at about six oclock the lights were on the window was open the copy machine was on i was annoyed i thought sammy was getting careless the copy machine was on then she did come back to the office last night elizabeth darted across the room did you look to see if the letter she wanted to copy is in the machine it was not there but next to the copier elizabeth found the plastic bag the letter had been wrapped in within fifteen minutes a search party had been quietly organized reluctantly elizabeth acceded to mins pleadings not to call the police immediately sammy was very ill last year min reminded her she had a slight stroke and was disoriented it may have happened again you know how she hates fuss let us try to find her first ill give it until lunchtime elizabeth said flatly and then im going to report her missing for all we know if she did have some kind of attack shes wandering on the beach somewhere minna gave sammy a job out of pity helmut snapped the essence of this place is privacy seclusion we have deputies swarming about and half the guests will pack up and go home elizabeth felt redhot anger but it was min who answered too much has been concealed around here she said quietly we will delay calling the sheriffs office for sammys sake not for ours together they scooped the piledup letters back into the bags this is leilas mail elizabeth told them she twisted the tops of the bags into intricate knots ill take these to my bungalow later she studied the knots and was satisfied no one could undo them without tearing the bags then youre planning to stay helmuts attempt to sound pleased did not come off at least until sammy is found elizabeth told him now lets get some help the search party consisted of the oldest and most trusted employees nelly the maid who had let her into doras apartment jason the chauffeur the head gardener they stood huddled at a respectful distance from mins desk waiting for instructions it was elizabeth who addressed them to protect miss samuels privacy we dont want anyone to suspect that there is a problem crisply she divided their responsibilities nelly check the empty bungalows ask the other maids if theyve seen dora be casual jason you contact the cab companies find out if anyone made a pickup here between nine oclock last night and seven this morning she nodded to the gardener i want every inch of the grounds searched she turned to min and the baron min you go through the house and the womens spa helmut see if shes anywhere in the clinic im going around the neighborhood she looked at the clock remember noon is the deadline for finding her as she headed for the gates elizabeth realized it had not been for min and helmut that she had made the concession but because she knew that for sammy it was already too late five ted flatly refused to begin working on his defense until hed spent an hour in the gym when bartlett and craig arrived at his bungalow he had just finished breakfast and was wearing a blue sport shirt and white shorts looking at him henry bartlett could understand why women like cheryl threw themselves at him why a superstar like leila lasalle had been head over heels in love with him ted had that indefinable combination of looks and brains and charm which attracted men and women alike over the years bartlett had defended the rich and the powerful the experience had left him cynical no man is a hero to his valet or to his lawyer it gave bartlett a certain sense of power of his own to get guilty defendants acquitted to shape a defense on loopholes in the law his clients were grateful to him and paid his huge fees with alacrity ted winters was one of a kind he treated bartlett with contempt he was the devils advocate of his own defense strategy he did not pick up the hints bartlett threw to him the hints which ethically bartlett could not bluntly state now he said you start planning my defense henry im going to the gym for an hour and then i might just take a swim and possibly jog again by the time i get back id like to see exactly what your line of defense is and see if i can live with it i assume you understand that i have no intention of saying yes perhaps maybe i did stumble back upstairs teddy i ted stood up he pushed the breakfast tray aside his posture was menacing as he stared at the older man let me explain something teddy is the name of a twoyearold boy ill describe him for you he was what my grandmother used to call a towhead very very blond he was a tough little guy who walked at nine months and spoke sentences at fifteen months he was my son his mother was a very sweet young woman who unfortunately could not get used to the idea she had married a very rich man she refused to hire a housekeeper she did her own marketing she refused to have a chauffeur she wouldnt hear of driving an expensive automobile kathy lived in fear that folks from iowa city would think she was getting uppity one rainy night she was driving back from grocery shopping andwe thinka goddamn can of tomato soup rolled out of the bag and under her foot and so she couldnt stop at the stop sign and a trailer truck plowed into that goddamn piece of tin she called a car and she and that little boy teddy died that was eight years ago now have you got it straight that when you call me teddy i see a little blond kid who walked early and talked early and would be ten years old next month teds eyes glistened now you plan my defense youre being paid for it im going to the gym craig take your pick ill work out with you they left the bungalow and started toward the mens spa where did you find him ted asked for christs sake have a heart ted hes the best criminal lawyer in the country no he isnt and ill tell you why because he came in with a preconceived notion and hes trying to mold me into the ideal defendant and its phony the tennis player and his girlfriend were coming out of their bungalow they greeted ted warmly missed you at forest hills last time the pro told ted next year for sure were all rooting for you this time it was the pros girlfriend with her models smile flashing ted returned the smile now if i can just get you on the jury he raised his hand in a gesture of acknowledgment and walked on the smile disappeared i wonder if they have celebrity tennis in attica you wont have to give a damn one way or the other it will have nothing to do with you craig stopped look isnt that elizabeth they were almost directly in front of the main house from across the vast lawn they watched as the slender figure ran down the steps of the veranda and turned toward the outer gates there was no mistaking the honeycolored loop of hair twirled on the top of her head the thrust of the chin the innate grace of her movements she was dabbing at her eyes and as they watched she pulled sunglasses from her pocket and put them on i thought she was going home this morning teds voice was impersonal somethings wrong do you want to see what it is obviously my presence would only upset her more why dont you follow her she doesnt think you killed leila ted for gods sake knock it off id put my hand in the fire for you and you know it but being a punching bag isnt going to make me function any better and i fail to see how it helps you ted shrugged my apologies youre quite right now see if you can help elizabeth ill meet you back at my place in about an hour craig caught up with her at the gate quickly she explained what had happened his reaction was comforting you mean to say that sammy may have been missing for hours and the police havent been called theyre going to be as soon as the grounds are searched and i thought id just see if maybe elizabeth could not finish she swallowed and went on you remember when she had that first attack she was so disoriented and then so embarrassed craigs arm was around her okaysteady lets walk a bit they crossed the road toward the path that led to the lone cypress the sun had dispersed the last of the morning mist and the day was bright and warm sandpipers flurried over their heads circled and returned to their perches on the rocky shoreline waves broke like foaming geysers against the rocks and retreated to the sea the lone cypress always a tourist attraction was already the center of attention of the camera buffs elizabeth began to question them were looking for an older lady she may be ill shes quite small craig took over he gave an accurate description of dora what was she wearing elizabeth a beige cardigan a beige cotton blouse a tan skirt sounds like my mother commented a tourist in a red sport shirt with a camera slung over his shoulder shes kind of everybodys mother elizabeth said they rang doorbells of the secluded homes hidden by shrubbery from the road maids some sympathetic some annoyed promised to keep an eye out they went to the pebble beach lodge sammy has breakfast here sometimes on her days off elizabeth said with a clutch of hope she searched the dining rooms praying that her eyes would find the small straight figure that sammy would be surprised at all the fuss but there were only the vacationers dressed in casually expensive sport clothes most of them awaiting their teeoff time elizabeth turned to leave but craig held her arm ill bet you didnt have any breakfast he signaled to the headwaiter over coffee they surveyed each other if theres no sign of her when we get back well insist on calling the police he told her somethings happened to her you cant be sure of that tell me exactly when you saw her whether she said anything about going out elizabeth hesitated she was not sure if she wanted to tell craig about the letter sammy was going to copy or about the letter that had been stolen she did know that the deep concern on his face was a tremendous comfort that if it became necessary he would put the awesome power of winters enterprises into the search for sammy her response was careful when sammy left me she said she was going back to the office for a while i cant believe that shes so overworked she has to burn midnight oil elizabeth halfsmiled not quite midnight nine thirty to avoid further questions she gulped the rest of the coffee craig do you mind if we go back now maybe theres been some word but there was not and if the maids the gardener and the chauffeur could be believed every inch of the grounds had been searched now even helmut agreed not to wait until noon that it was time to phone in a missingperson report thats not good enough elizabeth told them i want you to ask for scott alshorne she waited for scott at sammys desk do you want me to hang around craig asked no he glanced at the trash bags whats all that leilas fan mail sammy was answering it dont start going through it it will only upset you craig glanced into min and helmuts office they were sitting side by side on the art deco wicker couch speaking in low tones he leaned over the desk elizabeth you have to know im between a rock and a hard place but when this is over no matter how it ends weve got to talk ive missed you terribly in a surprisingly agile move he was around the desk his hand was on her hair his lips on her cheek im always here for you he whispered if anything has happened to sammy and you need a shoulder or an ear you know where to find me elizabeth clutched at his hand and for an instant held it against her cheek she felt its solid strength its warmth the width of his blunt fingers and incongruously thought of teds longfingered graceful hands she dropped his hand and pulled away watch out or youll get me crying she tried to make her voice light to dispel the intensity of the moment craig seemed to understand he straightened up and said matteroffactly ill be in teds bungalow if you need me waiting was the hardest it was like the night when shed sat in leilas apartment hoping praying that leila and ted had made up had gone off together and knowing with every nerve in her body that something was wrong sitting at sammys desk was agony she wanted to run in a dozen different directions to walk along the road and ask people if theyd seen her to search the crocker woodland in case shed wandered in there in a daze instead elizabeth opened one of the bags of fan mail and brought out a handful of envelopes at least she could accomplish something she could search for more anonymous letters six sheriff scott alshorne had been a lifelong friend of samuel edgers mins first husband the man who had built the cypress point hotel he and min had liked each other from the start and it had pleased him to see that min kept her part of her bargain she gave the ailing and cantankerous octogenarian a new lease on life for the five years she was married to him scott had watched with mingled curiosity and awe as min and that titled jerk she married next had taken a comfortable profitable hotel and turned it into a selfconsuming monster min now invited him at least once a month to dinner at the spa and in the last year and a half hed come to know dora samuels well that was why when min called with the news of her disappearance he instinctively feared the worst if sammy had had some kind of stroke and started wandering around shed have been noticed old sick people didnt get overlooked on the monterey peninsula scott was proud of his jurisdiction his office was in salinas the seat of monterey county and twentytwo miles from pebble beach crisply he issued instructions for the posting of a missingperson notice and directed that deputies from the pebble beach area meet him at the spa he was silent on the drive the deputy who chauffeured him noticed there were unusually deep creases in his bosss forehead that the craggy tanned face under the wealth of unmanageable white hair was furrowed in thought when the chief looked like this it meant he anticipated a big problem it was ten thirty when they drove through the gates the houses and grounds had an air of tranquillity there were few people walking around scott knew that most of the guests were in the spas working out being pummeled and patted and scrubbed and plucked so that when they went home at the end of their stay their families and friends would gush over how marvelous they looked or they were in the clinic having one of helmuts sophisticated and ultraexpensive treatments he had heard that ted winters private jet had landed at the airport on sunday afternoon and that ted was here hed debated with himself as to whether or not to call him ted was under indictment for seconddegree murder he was also the kid who used to delight in sailing with his grandfather and scott knowing that ted was booked at the spa caused scott to register openmouthed astonishment when he saw elizabeth sitting at sammys desk she had not heard him come up the stairs and he took a moment to study her unobserved she was deathly pale and her eyes were redrimmed strands of hair had slipped from the knot on top of her head and curled around her face she was pulling letters from envelopes glancing at them and tossing them aside impatiently clearly she was searching for something he noticed that her hands were trembling he knocked loudly on the open door and watched her jump up relief and apprehension mingled in her expression spontaneously she ran around the desk and with outstretched arms hurried toward him just before she reached him she stopped abruptly im sorry i mean how are you scott its good to see you he knew what she was thinking because of his longtime friendship with ted he might regard her as the enemy poor kid he gathered her in a quick bear hug to disguise his own emotion he said gruffly youre too skinny i hope youre not on one of mins celebrity diets im on a getfatfast banana splits and brownies good together they went into mins office scott raised his eyebrows when he saw the haggard expression on mins face the wary veiled eyes of the baron they were both worried and somehow he felt it went beyond concern for sammy his direct questions garnered the information he needed id like to take a look at sammys apartment min led the way elizabeth and helmut trailed behind somehow scotts presence gave elizabeth a faint touch of hope at least something would be done she had seen the disapproval in his face at the realization they had waited so long to phone him scott glanced around the sitting room and walked into the bedroom he pointed to the suitcase on the floor near the closet was she planning to go somewhere she just got back min explained then looked puzzled its not like sammy not to unpack immediately scott opened the bag there was a cosmetic case on top filled with pill bottles he read the directions one every four hours twice a day two at bedtime he frowned sammy was careful about her medication she didnt want another siege min show me the condition of the office as you found it it was the copy machine that seemed to intrigue him most the window was open the machine was on he stood in front of it she was about to copy something she looked out the window and then what she felt dizzy she wandered outside but where was she trying to go he stared out the window this view took in the expanse of the north lawn the scattered bungalows along the way to the olympic pool and the roman baththat godawful monstrosity you say every inch of the grounds every building was searched yes helmut answered first i personally saw to it scott cut him off well start all over elizabeth spent the next hours at sammys desk her fingers were dry from handling the dozens of letters she examined they read alikerequests for leilas autograph requests for her picture there was so far no sign of any more anonymous letters at two oclock elizabeth heard a shout she raced to the window in time to see one of the policemen gesturing from the door of the bathhouse her feet flew on the stairs at the nexttolast step she tripped and fell smashing her arms and legs against the polished tiles heedless of the sharp sting in her palms and knees she ran across the lawn to the bathhouse arriving as scott disappeared inside she followed him through the locker room into the pool area a policeman was standing at the side of the pool pointing down at sammys crumpled body later she vaguely remembered kneeling beside sammy reaching her hand to brush back the matted bloody hair from her forehead feeling scotts iron grasp hearing his sharp command dont touch her sammys eyes were open her features frozen in terror her glasses still caught on her ears but dropped down on her nose her palms outstretched as though pushing something back her beige cardigan was still buttoned the wide patch pockets suddenly prominent see if she has the letter to leila elizabeth heard herself say look in the pockets then her own eyes widened the beige wool cardigan became leilas white satin pajamas and she was kneeling over leilas body again mercifully she fainted when she regained consciousness she was lying on the bed in her bungalow helmut was bending over her holding something that smelled harsh and pungent under her nostrils min was chafing her hands uncontrollable sobs racked her body and she heard herself wailing not sammy too not sammy too min held her tightly elizabeth dont dont helmut muttered this will help you the prick of a needle in her arm when she awoke the shadows were long in the room nelly the maid who had helped in the search was touching her shoulder im so sorry to disturb you miss she said but i did bring tea and something for you to eat the sheriff cant wait any longer he has to talk with you seven the news of doras death rippled through the spa like an unwelcome rainstorm at a family picnic there was mild curiosity what ever was she doing wandering in that place a sense of mortality how old was she did you say an attempt to place heroh you mean that prim little woman in the officethen a quick return to the pleasant activities of the spa this was after all an extremely expensive retreat one came here to escape problems not find them in midafternoon ted had gone for a massage hoping to obtain some relief from tension in the pounding hands of the swedish masseur hed just returned to his bungalow when craig told him the news they found her body in the bathhouse she must have gotten dizzy and fallen ted thought of the afternoon in new york when sammy had had that first stroke they were all in leilas apartment and in the middle of a sentence sammys voice had trailed off it was he who had realized there was something seriously wrong how is elizabeth taking it he asked craig pretty badly i gather she fainted she was close to sammy she ted bit his lip and changed the subject wheres bartlett on the golf course i wasnt aware i brought him out here to play golf ted come off it hes been on the job since early this morning henry claims he can think better if he gets some exercise remind him that i go on trial next week hed better curtail his exercise ted shrugged it was crazy to come here i dont know why i thought it would help me calm down its not working give it a chance it wouldnt be any better in new york or connecticut oh i just bumped into your old friend sheriff alshorne scotts here then they must think theres something peculiar about sammys death i dont know about that its probably just routine for him to show up does he know im here yes as a matter of fact he asked about you did he suggest that i call him craigs hesitation was barely perceptible well not exactlybut look it wasnt a social conversation another person avoiding me ted thought another person waiting to see the full evidence laid out in court restlessly he wandered around the living room of his bungalow suddenly it had become a cage to him but all rooms had seemed like that since the indictment it must be a psychological reaction im going for a walk he said abruptly then to forestall craigs offer of company he added ill be back in time for dinner as he passed the pebble beach lodge he wondered at the sense of isolation that made him feel so totally apart from the people who wandered along the paths heading for the restaurants the tourist shops the golf courses his grandfather had started bringing him to these courses when he was eight his father had detested california and so when they came it was just his mother and himself and hed seen her shed her nervous mannerisms and become younger lighthearted why hadnt she left his father he wondered her family didnt have the winters millions but she would certainly have had enough money wasnt it because she was afraid of losing custody of him that shed stayed in that cursed marriage his father had never let her forget that first suicide attempt and so she had stayed and endured his periodic drunken rages his verbal abuse his mimicking of her mannerisms his scorn of her private fears until one night she had decided she couldnt endure any more unseeingly ted walked along the seventeen mile drive unaware of the pacific glimmering and gleaming below the houses that rose above stillwater cove and carmel bay unaware of the luxuriant bougainvillea heedless of the expensive cars that sped past him carmel was still crowded with summer tourists college students getting in one last fling before the fall semester when he and leila walked through town shed stopped traffic the thought made him pull his sunglasses from his pocket in those days men used to look at him with envy now he was aware of hostility on the faces of strangers who recognized him hostility isolation fear these last seventeen months had disrupted his entire life had forced him to do things he would not have believed possible now he accepted the fact that there was one more monumental hurdle he had to overcome before the trial drenching perspiration soaked his body at the image of what that would be eight alvirah sat at the dressing table in her bungalow happily surveying the shiny rows of creams and cosmetics that had been presented to her in the makeup class that afternoon as the instructor had told her she had flat cheekbones that could be beautifully enhanced with a soft blush rather than the crimson rouge she favored she also had been persuaded to try wearing a brown mascara instead of the jet black which she believed drew attention to her eyes less is better the makeup expert had assured her and truth to tell there was a difference in fact alvirah decided the new makeup combined with the way theyd toned down her hair to a rich brown made her look just like the way she remembered aunt agnes and agnes always was the beauty in the family it also felt good that her hands were starting to lose their calluses no more heavy cleaning for her ever period and if you think you look good now wait till you see how glamorous you are when baron von schreiber is finished with you the makeup lady had said his collagen injections will make those little lines around your mouth nose and forehead disappear its almost miraculous alvirah sighed she was bursting with happiness willy had always claimed that she was the finestlooking woman in queens and that he liked being able to put his arms around her and feel that he had something to hold on to but these last years shed put on weight wouldnt it be good to really look classy when they were hunting for a new house not that she had any intention of trying to get in with the rockefellersjust middleclass people like themselves whod made good and if she and willy made out a lot better than most others were luckier than just about anybody else it was nice to know that they could do some good for other people after she finished the articles for the globe she really would write that book her mother had always said alvirah youve got such a lively imagination youre going to be a writer someday maybe someday was here alvirah pursed her lips and carefully applied coral lip gloss with her newly acquired brush years ago in the belief that her lips were too narrow shed gotten into the habit of making a kind of kewpie doll curve to accentuate them but now shed been persuaded that that wasnt necessary she put down the brush and surveyed the results somehow she really did feel a little guilty about being so happy and interested in everything when that nice little lady was stretched out somewhere in the morgue but she was seventyone alvirah comforted herself and it must have been real quick thats the way i want to go when its my turn not that she expected it to be her turn for a long time to come as her mother said our women make old bones her mother was eightyfour and still went bowling every wednesday night her makeup adjusted to her satisfaction alvirah took her tape recorder from her suitcase and inserted the cassette from sunday nights dinner as she listened a puzzled frown creased her forehead funnywhen youre just listening to people you get a different perspective than when youre sitting with them like syd melnick was supposed to be a big agent but he sure let cheryl manning push him around and she could turn on a dime one minute hassling syd melnick about the water shed spilled herself and then all sweetness and light asking ted winters if she could go with him sometime to see the winters gym at dartmouth college dartmuth alvirah thought not dartmouth craig babcock had corrected her on that he had such a nice calm voice shed told him that you sound so educated hed laughed you should have heard me in my teens ted winters voice was so wellbred alvirah knew he hadnt had to work on it the three of them had a nice talk on that subject alvirah checked her microphone to see that it was securely in place in the center flower of her sunburst pin and delivered an observation voices she declared tell a lot about people she was surprised to hear the phone ring it was only nine oclock new york time and willy was supposed to be at a union meeting she wished that hed quit his job but he said to give him time he wasnt used to being a millionaire it was charley evans the special features editor of the new york globe hows my star reporter he asked any problems with the recorder it works like a charm alvirah assured him im having a wonderful time and meeting some very interesting people any celebrities oh yes alvirah couldnt help bragging i came from the airport in a limousine with elizabeth lange and im at the same dinner table as cheryl manning and ted winters she was rewarded by an audible gasp on the other end of the phone are you telling me that elizabeth lange and ted winters are together oh not exactly together alvirah said hastily in fact she wouldnt go near him at all she was going to leave right away but she wanted to see her sisters secretary the only trouble is leilas secretary was found dead this afternoon in the roman bathhouse mrs meehan hold on a minute i want you to repeat everything you just said very slowly someone will be taking it down nine at scott alshornes request the coroner of monterey county performed an immediate autopsy on the remains of dora samuels death had been caused by a severe head injury pressure on the brain from skull fragments contributing cause a moderately severe stroke in his office scott studied the autopsy report in reflective silence and tried to pinpoint the reasons he felt there was something sinister about dora samuels death that bathhouse it looked like a mausoleum it had turned out to be sammys sepulcher who the hell did mins husband think he was to have foisted that on her incongruously scott thought of the contest leila had run should the baron be called the tin soldier or the toy soldier twentyfive words or less leila bought dinner for the winner why had sammy been in the bathhouse had she just wandered in there was she planning to meet someone that didnt make sense the electricity wasnt turned on it would have been pitch black min and helmut had both stated that the bathhouse should have been locked but theyd also admitted they had left it in a hurry yesterday afternoon minna was upset by the overrun costs helmut had explained i was worried about her emotional state it is a heavy door possibly i did not pull it shut sammys death had been caused by the injuries to the back of her head she had toppled backward into the pool but had she fallen or been pushed scott got up and began backing across his office a practical if not a scientific test he decided no matter how dazed or confused you are most people dont start walking backward unless theyre backing away from someone or something he settled at his desk again he was supposed to attend a civic dinner with the mayor of carmel hed have to pass he was going back to the spa and he was going to talk to elizabeth lange it was his hunch that she knew what urgent business had made sammy go back to the office at nine thirty at night and what document had been so important to copy on the drive back to the spa two words flashed in his mind fallen pushed then as the car passed the pebble beach lodge he realized what had been bothering him that was the same question that was bringing ted winters to trial on a murder indictment ten craig spent the rest of the afternoon in teds bungalow going through the bulky package of mail that had been expressed from the new york office with a practiced eye he skimmed memos reviewed printouts studied projection charts his frown deepened as he read that group of harvard and wharton business mbas ted had hired a couple of years ago were a constant irritant to him if they had their way ted would be building hotels on space platforms at least they had had the brains to recognize that they couldnt try to go around craig anymore the memos and letters were all addressed to him and ted jointly ted got back at five oclock obviously the walk hadnt relaxed him any he was in a foul mood is there any reason you cant work in your place was his first question none except that it seemed simpler to be here for you craig indicated the business files there are some things id like to go over im not interested do what you think best i think best would be for you to have a scotch and unwind a little and i think best for winters enterprises is to get rid of those two assholes from harvard their expense accounts amount to armed robbery i dont want to go into that now bartlett came in pinkfaced from his afternoon in the sun craig noticed the way teds mouth tightened at bartlett s genial greeting there was no question ted was starting to unravel he drank the first scotch quickly and didnt protest when craig refilled it bartlett wanted to discuss the list of defense witnesses craig had prepared for him he read it off to teda glittering array of famous names you dont have the president on it ted said sarcastically bartlett fell into the trap which president of the united states of course i used to be one of his golf partners bartlett shrugged and closed the file obviously this isnt going to be a good working session are you planning to eat out tonight no im planning to stay right here and right now im planning to nap craig and bartlett left together you do realize this is getting hopeless bartlett told him at six thirty craig received a call from the agency hed hired to investigate the eyewitness sally ross there was some excitement in rosss apartment building he was told the woman who lives directly above her walked in on an attempted burglary they caught the guya petty thief with a long record ross didnt go out at all at seven oclock craig met bartlett at teds bungalow ted wasnt there they started toward the main house together youre about as popular as i am with teddy these days bartlett commented craig shrugged listen if he wants to take it out on me its all right in a way i brought this on him how do you figure that one i introduced him to leila she was my date first they reached the veranda in time to hear the newest witticism at cypress point for four thousand dollars a week you get to use some of the pools for five thousand you get to use the ones with water in them there was no sign of elizabeth during the cocktail hour craig watched for her to come up the path but she did not appear bartlett drifted over to the tennis pro and his girlfriend ted was talking to the countess and her group cheryl was hanging on his arm a moroselooking syd was standing off by himself craig went over to him that business about proof was cheryl drunk last night or just talking her usual drivel he asked he knew syd wouldnt have minded taking a swing at him syd considered him to be like all the parasites in teds world the bottleneck to teds largesse craig considered himself more of a goalie you had to pass him to score i would say syd told him that cheryl was giving her usual splendid dramatic performance min and helmut did not appear in the dining rooms until after the guests had settled craig noticed how gaunt they looked how fixed their smiles were as they visited from table to table why not they were in the business of staving off old age illness and death this afternoon sammy had proved it was a pointless game as she sat down min murmured an apology for being late ted ignored cheryl whose hand clung persistently to his how is elizabeth helmut answered him shes taking it very hard i gave her a sedative would alvirah meehan never stop fooling with that damn pin craig wondered she had parked herself between him and ted he glanced around min helmut syd bartlett cheryl ted the meehan woman himself there was one more place setting next to him he asked min who would be joining them sheriff alshorne he just came back hes talking to elizabeth now min bit her lip please we all know how sad we feel about losing sammy but i think it would be better if we do not discuss it during dinner why does the sheriff want to talk to elizabeth lange alvirah meehan asked he doesnt think theres anything funny about miss samuels dying in that bathhouse does he seven stony pairs of eyes discouraged further questions the soup was chilled peach and strawberry a specialty of the spa alvirah sipped hers contentedly the globe would be interested to learn that ted winters was very clearly concerned about elizabeth she could hardly wait to meet the sheriff eleven elizabeth stood at the window of her bungalow and glanced at the main house just in time to see the guests drifting inside for dinner she had insisted that nelly leave youve had a long day and im perfectly all right now shed propped herself up in bed for the tea and toast then showered quickly hoping that the splashing cold water would clear her head the sedative had left her groggy an offwhite cableknit sweater and tan stretch pants were her favorite comfortable clothes somehow wearing them her feet bare her hair twisted up casually she felt like herself the last of the guests had disappeared but as she watched she saw scott cut across the lawn in her direction they sat across from each other leaning slightly forward anxious to communicate wary of how to begin looking at scott with his kind questioning eyes made elizabeth remember how leila had once said hes the kind of guy i would have liked for a father last night sammy had suggested that they take the anonymous letter to him im sorry i couldnt wait until the morning to see you scott told her but there are too many things about sammys death that trouble me from what ive learned so far sammy drove six hours from napa valley yesterday arriving at about two oclock she wasnt due till late evening she must have been pretty tired but she didnt even stop to unpack she went directly to the office she claimed she wasnt feeling well and wouldnt come down to the dining room for dinner but the maid tells me she had a tray in the office and was busily going through bags of mail then she came to visit you and left around nine thirty sammy should have been pretty beat by then but she apparently went back to the office and turned on the copy machine why elizabeth got up and walked into the bedroom from her suitcase she took the letter from sammy that had been waiting for her in new york she showed it to scott when i realized ted was here i would have left immediately but i had to wait and see sammy about this she told him about the letter that had been taken from sammys office and showed him the transcript sammy had made from memory this is pretty much the text of it her eyes filled as she looked at sammys graceful penmanship she found another poisonpen letter in one of those sacks last evening she was going to make a copy for me and we were planning to give the original to you ive written it down as i remembered we had hoped the original could be traced the typeface for magazines is coded isnt it yes scott read and reread the transcripts of the letters stinking business somebody was systematically trying to destroy leila elizabeth said somebody doesnt want those letters found somebody took one from sammys desk yesterday afternoon and perhaps the other one from sammys body last night are you saying that you think sammy may have been murdered elizabeth flinched then looked directly at him i simply cant answer that i do know that someone was worried enough about those letters to want them back i do know that a series of those letters would have explained leilas behavior those letters precipitated that quarrel with ted and those letters have something to do with sammys death i swear this to you scott im going to find out who wrote them maybe theres no criminal prosecution possible but there has to be a way of making that person pay its someone who was very close to leila and i have my suspicions fifteen minutes later scott left elizabeth the transcripts of both anonymous letters in his pocket elizabeth believed cheryl had written those letters it made sense it was cheryls kind of trick before he went into the dining room he walked around to the right side of the main house up there was the window where sammy had stood when she turned on the copy machine if someone had been on the steps of the bathhouse and signaled to her to come down it was possible but of course he told himself sadly sammy wouldnt have come down except for someone she knew and trusted the others were halfway through the main course when he joined them the empty seat was between craig and a woman who was introduced as alvirah meehan scott took the initiative in greeting ted presumption of innocence ted had always had outstanding looks it was no wonder that a woman would go to any extreme to separate him from another woman scott did not miss the way cheryl constantly managed to touch teds hand to brush her shoulder against his he helped himself to lamb chops from the silver tray the waiter was offering him theyre delicious alvirah meehan confided her voice barely a whisper theyll never go broke in this place from the size of the portions but im telling you when youre finished you feel as though youve had a big meal alvirah meehan of course hed read in the monterey review about the forrymiftiondollar lottery winner who was going to realize her fondest dream by coming to cypress point spa are you enjoying yourself mrs meehan alvirah beamed i sure am everyone has been just wonderful and so friendly her smile encompassed the entire table min and helmut attempted to return it the treatments make you feel like a princess the nutritionist said that in two weeks i should be able to lose five pounds and a couple of inches tomorrow im having collagen to get rid of the lines around my mouth im scared of injections but baron von schreiber will give me something for my nerves ill leave here a new woman feeling like like a butterfly floating on a cloud she pointed to helmut the baron wrote that isnt he a real author alvirah realized she was talking too much it was just that she felt kind of guilty being an undercover reporter and wanted to say nice things about these people but now shed better be quiet and listen to see if the sheriff had anything to say about dora samuels death but disappointingly no one brought it up at all it was only when they had just about finished the vanilla mousse that the sheriff asked not quite casually you people will all be around here for the next few days no one has plans to leave our plans are undetermined syd told him cheryl may have to go back to beverly hills on short notice i think it would be better if she checks with me before she goes to beverly hills or anywhere else scott said pleasantly and by the way baron those bags of leilas fan mail ill be taking them with me he put down the spoon he was holding and began to push back his chair its funny he said but its my guess that one of the people at this table with the exception of mrs meehan may have been writing some pretty rotten letters to leila lasalle im real anxious to find out who that might be to syds dismay scotts now steely glance rested squarely on cheryl twelve it was nearly ten oclock before they were alone in their apartment min had agonized all day about whether or not to confront helmut with the proof that he had been in new york the night leila died to confront him was to force the admission that he had been involved with leila not to confront him was to allow him to remain vulnerable how stupid he had been not to destroy the record of the telephone call he went directly into his dressing room and a few minutes later she heard the whirling of the jacuzzi in his bathroom when he came back she was waiting in one of the deep armchairs near the bedroom fireplace impersonally she studied him his hair was combed as precisely as though he were leaving for a formal ball his silk dressing gown was knotted by a silk cord his military posture made him seem taller than his true height five feet ten inches was barely above the average for men these days he prepared a scotch and soda for himself and without asking poured a sherry for her its been a difficult day minna you handled it well he said still she did not speak and at last he seemed to sense that her silence was unusual this room is so restful he said arent you glad you let me have my head with this color scheme and it suits you strong beautiful colors for a strong and beautiful woman i would not consider peach a strong color it becomes strong when it is wedded with deep blue like me minna i become strong because i am with you then why this from the pocket of her robe she pulled out the telephonecreditcard bill and watched as his expression changed from bewilderment to fear why did you lie to me you were in new york that night were you with leila had you gone to her he sighed minna im glad you have found this i wanted so much to tell you tell me now you were in love with leila you were having an affair with her no i swear not youre lying minna i am telling the truth i did go to heras a friendas a doctor i got there at nine thirty the door to her apartment was just barely open i could hear leila crying hysterically ted was shouting at her to put the phone down she screamed back at him the elevator was coming i didnt want to be seen you know the right angle the foyer takes i went around that corner helmut sank to the floor at mins feet minna it has been killing me not to tell you minna ted did push her i heard her scream dont dont and then her shriek as she fell min paled who got off the elevator did anyone see you i dont know i ran down the fire stairs then as if his composure his sense of order had abandoned him he leaned forward his head in his hands and began to cry wednesday september quote for the day beauty is bought by judgment of the eye shakespeare good morning treasured guests are you feeling a bit lazy this morning never mind after a few days we all begin to unwind into delicious and refreshing slumber and think that maybe just maybe this morning we shall lie abed no no we beckon to you join us in that wonderful and invigorating morning walk through our beautiful grounds and along the coast you will be glad perhaps by now you have already learned the pleasure of meeting new friends of revisiting old ones on our sunbright journey a gentle reminder all guests who swim in any of the pools alone must wear the regulation spa whistle it has never been needed but it is a safety factor that we deem essential look in the mirror isnt all the exercise and pampering starting to show arent your eyes brighter isnt your skin firmer wont it be fun showing off the new you to your family and friends and a final thought whatever troubles you brought with you to the spa should by now be completely forgotten think happy baron and baroness helmut von schreiber one elizabeth s phone rang at six oclock sleepily she groped for it her eyelids were heavy and drooping the aftereffects of the sedative made it impossible to think clearly it was william murphy the new york assistant district attorney his opening words snapped her awake miss lange i thought you wanted your sisters killer convicted without waiting for her to answer he rushed on can you please explain to me why you are in the same spa with ted winters elizabeth pulled herself up and swung her feet onto the floor i didnt know he was going to be here i havent been near him that may be true but the minute you saw him you should have been on the next plane home take a look at this mornings globe theyve got a picture of you two in a clinch i was never it was at the memorial service but the way youre looking at each other is open to interpretation get out of there now and whats this about your sisters secretary shes the reason i cant leave here she told him about the letters about sammys death i wont go near ted she promised but i am staying here until friday that gives me two days to find the letter dora was carrying or to figure out who took it from her she would not change her mind and finally murphy hung up with a parting shot if your sisters killer walks look to yourself for the reason he paused and i told you before be careful she jogged into carmel the new york papers would be on the stands there once again it was a glorious latesummer day sleek limousines and mercedes convertibles followed each other on the road to the golf course other joggers waved at her amiably privacy hedges protected the estate homes from the curious eyes of the tourists but in between glimpses of the pacific could be seen a glorious day to be alive elizabeth thought and she shuddered at the mental image of sammys body in the morgue over coffee in a breakfast shop on ocean avenue she read the globe someone had snapped that picture at the end of the memorial service she had started to weep ted was beside her his arm had come around her and hed turned her to him she tried not to remember how it had felt to be in his arms with a surge of heartsick contempt for herself she laid money on the table and left the restaurant on the way out she tossed the paper into a wastebasket she wondered who at the spa had tipped off the globe it could have been one of the staff min and helmut were plagued with leaks it could have been one of the guests who in exchange for personal publicity fed items to the columnists it also could have been cheryl when she got back to her bungalow scott was sitting on the porch waiting for her youre an early bird she told him there were circles under his eyes i didnt do much sleeping last night something about sammy falling backward into that pool just doesnt sit right with me elizabeth winced as she thought of sammys bloodstained head im sorry scott told her its all right i feel exactly the same way did you find any more of those letters in the mailbags no ive got to ask you to go through sammys personal effects with me i dont know what im looking for but you might spot something id miss give me ten minutes to shower and change youre sure it wont upset you too much elizabeth leaned against the porch railing and ran her hand through her hair if that letter had been found i could believe sammy might have had some sort of attack and wandered into the bathhouse but with the letter gone scott if someone pushed her or frightened her so that she backed away that person is a murderer the doors of the bungalows around them were opening men and women in identical ivory terrycloth robes headed for the spa buildings treatments start in fifteen minutes elizabeth said massages and facials and steam baths and god knows whatall isnt it incredible to think that one of the people being pampered here today left sammy to die in that godawful mausoleum craigs earlymorning call was from the private investigator and it was obvious he was troubled nothing more on sally ross he said but the word is that the burglar who was picked up in her building claims he has information about leila lasalles death hes trying to make a deal with the district attorney what kind of information this might be the break were looking for my contact doesnt get that feeling whats that supposed to mean the district attorney is happy you have to conclude his case is stronger not weaker craig phoned bartlett and reported the conversation ill put my office on it bartlett said my people may be able to find out something well have to sit tight until we find out whats up in the meantime i intend to see sheriff alshorne i want a full explanation of those poisonpen letters he talked about youre sure teddy wasnt involved with another woman somebody he may be protecting he doesnt seem to realize how much that could help his case maybe you might mention that to him syd was about to leave for the hike when his telephone rang something told him it would be bob koenig he was wrong for three endless minutes he pleaded with a loan shark for a little more time to pay the rest of his debts if cheryl gets this part i can borrow against my commissions he argued i swear she has the edge over margo dresher koenig told me himself i swear when he hung up the receiver he sat on the edge of the bed trembling he had no choice he had to go to ted and use what he knew to get the money he needed time had run out there was something indefinably different about sammys apartment elizabeth felt it was as though her aura as well as her physical being had departed her plants had not been watered dead leaves rimmed the planters min was in touch with sammys cousin about the funeral arrangements scott explained where is her body now it will be picked up from the morgue tomorrow and shipped to ohio for burial in the family plot elizabeth thought of the concrete dust that had smudged sammys skirt and cardigan can i give you clothes for sammy she asked is it too late its not too late the last time shed performed this service had been for leila sammy had helped her select the dress in which leila would be buried remember the casket wont be open sammy had reminded her it isnt that elizabeth had said you know leila if she ever wore anything that didnt feel right she was uncomfortable all evening even if everyone else thought she looked great if theres such a thing as knowing sammy had understood and together they had decided on the green chiffonandvelvet gown leila had worn the night she won the oscar they were the only two who had seen her in the casket the undertaker had skillfully covered the bruises had reconstructed the beautiful face now curiously peaceful at last for a time they had sat together reminiscing sammy holding elizabeths hand finally reminding her that it was time to allow the fans to file past the bier that the funeral director needed time to close the casket and drape it in the floral blanket that elizabeth and ted had ordered now with scott watching her elizabeth examined the closet the blue tie silk she murmured the one leila gave her for her birthday two years ago sammy used to say that if shed had clothes like this when she was young her whole life might have been different she packed a small overnight case containing underthings stockings shoes and the inexpensive pearl necklace sammy always wore with her good dresses at least thats one thing i know i can do for her she told scott now lets get about the business of finding what happened to her sammys dresser drawers revealed only personal items her desk held her checkbook daily memo pad personal stationery on a shelf of the closet pushed back behind a stack of sweaters they found a yearold appointment book and a bound copy of merrygoround by clayton anderson leilas play elizabeth said i never did get to read it she opened the folder and flipped through the pages look its her working script she always made so many notes and changed lines so that they sounded right for her scott watched as elizabeth ran her fingers over the ornate penmanship that dotted the margins of the pages why dont you take that he asked id like to he opened the appointment book the entries were in the same curlicued handwriting this was leilas too there were no entries after march on that page leila had printed opening night scott flipped through the earlier pages most of them had the daily entry marked rehearsal with a line drawn through there were appointments indicated for the hairdresser for costume fittings visit sammy at mount sinai send flowers sammy publicity appearances in the last six weeks more and more of the extraneous appointments had been crossed out there were also notations sparrow la ted budapest sparrow montreal ted bonn she seems to have kept both your schedules right in front of her she did so shed know where to reach us scott stopped at one page you two were in the same city that night he turned the pages more slowly actually ted seems to have shown up fairly regularly in the same cities where your play was booked yes wed go out for supper after the performance and call leila together scott scrutinized elizabeth s face for just an instant something else had come over it was it possible that elizabeth had fallen in love with ted and refused to face that fact and if so was it possible that a sense of guilt was subconsciously demanding that ted be punished for leilas death knowing that she would be punishing herself at the same time it was a disquieting thought he tried to dismiss it this appointment book probably doesnt have any bearing on the case but i still think the district attorney in new york should have it he said why no particular reason but it could be considered an exhibit there was nothing more to be found in sammys apartment ive got a suggestion scott told her go over to the spa and follow whatever schedule you had planned as i told you there are no more anonymous letters in that fan mail my boys went through everything in those bags last night our chance of finding out who sent them is remote ill talk to cheryl but shes pretty cagey i dont think shell give herself away together they walked down the long hall that led to the main house you havent gone through sammys desk in the office have you scott asked no elizabeth realized how tightly she was gripping the script something was compelling her to read it shed only seen that one terrible performance shed heard it was a good vehicle for leila now she wanted to judge for herself reluctantly she accompanied scott to the office that had become another place she wanted to avoid helmut and min were in their private office the door was open henry bartlett and craig were with them bartlett lost no time in demanding an explanation for the anonymous letters they may very well contribute to my clients defense he told scott we have a right to be fully briefed on them elizabeth watched henry bartlett as he absorbed scotts explanation of the anonymous letters his look grew intense his face was all sharp planes his eyes were hard this was the man who would be crossexamining her in court he looked like a predator watching for prey let me get this straight bartlett said miss lange and miss samuels agreed that leila lasalle may have been profoundly upset by poisonpen letters suggesting that ted winters was involved with someone else those letters have now disappeared on monday night miss samuels wrote her impressions of the first letter miss lange has transcribed the second one i want copies i see no reason why you cant have them scott told him he placed leilas appointment book on mins desk oh for the record this is something else im sending on to new york he said it was leilas calendar for the last three months of her life without asking for permission henry bartlett reached for it elizabeth waited for scott to protest but he did not watching bartlett thumb through leilas personal daily diary she felt an enormous sense of intrusion what business had he she threw an angry glance at scott he was looking at her impassively hes trying to prepare me for next week she thought bleakly and realized that maybe she should be grateful next week all that leila was would be laid out for twelve people to analyze her own relationship with leila with tednothing would be hidden no privacy beyond violation ill look through sammys desk she said abruptly she was still holding the script of the play she laid it on sammys desk and quickly went through the drawers there was absolutely nothing personal in them spa letterheads spa publicity folders spa followup memos the usual office paraphernalia min and the baron had followed her out she glanced up to see them standing in front of sammys desk both of them were staring at the leatherbound folder with the bold title merrygoround on the cover leilas play min asked yes sammy kept leilas copy ill take it now craig bartlett and the sheriff came out of the private office henry bartlett was smilinga selfsatisfied smug chilly smile miss lange youve been a great help to us today but i think i should warn you that the jury wont take kindly to the fact that as a woman scorned you put ted winters through this hellish nightmare elizabeth stood up her lips white what are you talking about im talking about the fact that in her own handwriting your sister made the connection between you and ted happening to be in the same city so often im talking about the fact that someone else also made that connection and tried to warn her with those letters im talking about the look on your face when ted put his arms around you at the memorial service surely youve seen this mornings paper apparently what may have been a mild flirtation for ted was serious to you and so when he dropped you you discovered a way to take your revenge you filthy liar elizabeth did not know she had thrown the copy of the play at henry bartlett until it struck him in the chest his expression was impassive even pleased bending he picked up the script and handed it back to her do me a favor young lady and stage that kind of outburst in front of the jury next week he said theyll exonerate ted two while craig and bartlett went to confront the sheriff ted worked out with the nautilus equipment in the mens spa each piece of equipment he used seemed to emphasize his own situation the rowboat that went nowhere the bicycle that no matter how furiously pedaled stayed in place on the surface he managed to exchange pleasantries with some of the other men in the gymthe head of the chicago stock exchange the president of atlantic banks a retired admiral he sensed in all of them a wariness they didnt know what to say to him didnt want to say good luck it was easier for themand for himwhen they got busy with the machines and concentrated on building muscles men in prison tended to get pretty soft not enough exercise boredom pallid skin ted studied his own tan it wouldnt last long behind bars he was supposed to meet bartlett and craig in his bungalow at ten oclock instead he went for a swim in the indoor pool hed have preferred the olympic pool but there was always the chance elizabeth might be there he didnt want to run into her he had swum about ten laps when he saw syd dive in at the opposite end of the pool they were six lanes apart and after a brief wave he ignored syd but after twenty minutes when the three swimmers between them had left he was surprised to see that syd was keeping pace with him he had a powerful backstroke and moved with swift precision from one end of the pool to the other ted deliberately set out to beat him syd obviously caught on after six laps they were in a dead heat they left the water at the same time syd slung a towel over his shoulders and came around the pool nice workout youre in good shape ive been swimming every day in hawaii for nearly a year and a half i should be the pool at my health club isnt like hawaii but it keeps me fit syd looked around there were jacuzzis in two corners of the glassenclosed room ted i have to talk to you privately they went to the opposite end there were three new swimmers in the pool but they were well out of earshot ted watched as syd rubbed the towel through his dark brown hair he noticed that the hair on syds chest was completely gray thatll be the next thing he decided he would grow old and gray in prison syd did not hedge ted im in trouble big trouble with guys who play rough it all began with that damn play i borrowed too much i thought i could sweat it out if cheryl gets this part im on my way up again but i cant stall them anymore i need a loan ted i mean a loan but i need it now how much six hundred thousand dollars ted its small change for you and its a loan but you owe it to me i owe it to you syd looked around and then stepped closer his mouth was within inches of teds ear id never have said this never even told you i knew but ted i saw you that night you ran past me a block from leilas apartment your face was bleeding your hands were scratched you were in shock you dont remember do you you didnt even hear me when i called you you just kept running syds voice dropped to a whisper ted i caught up with you i asked what had happened and you told me leila was dead that she had fallen off the terrace ted then you said to me i swear to god you said to me my father pushed her my father pushed her you were like a little kid trying to blame what you did on someone else you even sounded like a little kid ted felt waves of nausea i dont believe you why would i lie ted you ran into the street a cab came along you nearly got run over stopping it ask that cabbie who took you to connecticut hes going to be a witness isnt he ask him if he didnt almost sideswipe you ted im your friend i know how you felt when leila went nuts in elaines i know how i felt when i saw you i was on my way to try to talk sense to leila i was mad enough to kill her myself have i mentioned this once to you to anyone i wouldnt do it now except im desperate youve got to help me if i dont come up with that money in fortyeight hoursim finished youll have the money oh christ ted i knew i could count on you god thanks ted syd put his hands on teds shoulders get away from me teds voice was almost a shout the swimmers looked at them curiously ted shook himself free grabbed his towel and ran blindly out of the pool area three scott questioned cheryl in her bungalow this one was furnished in a splashy yellowandgreenandwhite print with white carpeting and white walls scott felt the thickness of the carpet under his feet all wool top quality sixty seventy dollars a yard no wonder min had that haunted look scott knew exactly how much old samuel had left her there couldnt be much left after what shed poured into this place cheryl was not happy about having been paged in the spa to meet him she was wearing her own version of the standard tank suit a skimpy scrap of material which did not quite cover her breasts and arched up on either side of her hipbones the terrycloth robe was slung on her shoulders she did not attempt to conceal her impatience im due in a calisthenics class in ten minutes she told him well lets hope you make it he said his throat muscles tightened as the active dislike he felt for cheryl swelled within him your chances will improve a lot if you give me some straight answers like did you write some pretty nasty letters to leila before she died as he had anticipated the interrogation was at first fruitless cheryl cleverly dodged his questions anonymous letters why would she be interested in sending them break up ted and leila what difference would it have made if they had ended up married it wouldnt have lasted leila didnt have it in her to stick with one man she had to hurt men before they hurt her the play she had no idea of how the rehearsals for leilas play had gone frankly she hadnt been that interested finally scott had had enough listen cheryl i think theres something youd better realize im not satisfied that sammys death was from natural causes the second anonymous letter she was carrying is missing you went to sammys desk you left a bill marked paid in full an anonymous letter was on top of the desk with other fan mail and then the letter disappeared granted someone else may have entered the reception area so quietly that even though the door was open neither min nor the baron nor sammy heard anyone come in but thats a bit unlikely isnt it he did not share with cheryl the fact that min and the baron both had had access to the desk out of sammys presence he was rewarded by a faint glow of alarm in cheryls eyes she licked her lips nervously youre not suggesting i had anything to do with sammys death im suggesting that you took that first letter from sammys desk and i want it now that is states evidence in a murder trial she looked away and as scott studied her he saw an expression of naked panic come over her face he followed her gaze and saw a sliver of charred paper wedged under the baseboard cheryl lunged from the couch to pick it up but he was too quick for her on the ragged piece of cheap paper were pasted three words learn your lines scott took out his wallet and carefully inserted the tiny scrap in it so you did steal that letter he said destroying evidence is a felony punishable by imprisonment what about the second letter the one sammy was carrying did you destroy that one too and how did you get it from her youd better get yourself a lawyer lady cheryl clutched his arm scott my god please i swear i didnt write those letters i swear the only time i saw sammy was in mins office all right i took this letter from sammys desk i thought it might help ted i showed it to syd he said people would think i wrote it he tore it up i didnt i swear thats as much as i know tears were spilling down her cheeks scott any publicity any publicity about this at all could kill my chances of being amanda scott please scott heard the contempt in his voice i really dont give a damn how publicity affects your career cheryl why dont we make a bargain ill hold off bringing you in for formal questioning and you do some hard thinking maybe your memory will suddenly get better for your sake i hope so four in a state of dazed relief syd headed back to his bungalow ted was going to lend him the money it had been so tempting to make the story stronger to say that ted had outright admitted killing leila but at the last instant hed changed his mind and quoted ted exactly god ted had sounded creepy when hed rambled about his father that night syd still felt a violent wrench in his gut whenever he thought of running after ted it had been immediately obvious that ted had been in some sort of psychotic state after leilas death hed waited to see whether ted would ever sound him out about that meeting his reaction today proved he had no memory of it he cut across the lawn deliberately avoiding the path he didnt want to make small talk with anyone thered been some new arrivals yesterday one of them he recognized as a young actor whod been leaving his photos at the agency and phoning constantly he wondered what old broad was paying his way today of all days syd didnt want to spend his time dodging eager wouldbe clients his first move when he reached the privacy of his own place was to make a drink he needed one he deserved one his second was to phone his earlymorning caller ill have the money to you by the weekend he said with newfound confidence now if he could just hear from bob koenig the phone rang before he could complete the thought the operator asked him to hold on for mr koenig syd felt his hands begin to tremble he caught a look at his reflection in the mirror the expression wasnt of the kind that inspired confidence in los angeles bobs first words were congratulations syd cheryl had the part syds mind began clicking percentages with two words bob had put him in the big time again i dont know what to say his voice became stronger more confident bob im telling you youve made the right choice cheryls going to be fantastic i know all that syd the bottom line is that rather than risk any bad press with margo were going with cheryl i talked her up so what if shes boxoffice poison now thats what they said about joan collins and look what shes done bob thats what ive been telling you all along wed better both be right ill arrange a press reception for cheryl at the beverly hilton for friday afternoon about five oclock well be there syd this is very important from now on we treat cheryl as a superstar and by the way tell cheryl to plaster a smile on her face amanda is a strong but likable character i dont want to read about any more outbursts at waiters or limo drivers and i mean it five minutes later syd was confronting a hysterical cheryl manning you mean you admitted to scott that you took that letter you dumb bitch he grabbed her shoulders shut up and listen to me are there any more letters let go youre hurting me i dont know cheryl tried to shrink away from him i cant lose that part i cant i am amanda you bet you cant lose that part syd shoved her backward and she toppled against the couch fury replaced fear cheryl brushed back her hair and clenched her teeth her mouth became a thin menacing slash do you always push when youre angry syd youd better get something straight you tore up that letter i didnt and i didnt write that letter or any others scott doesnt believe me so you march yourself over to him and tell him the truth that i planned to give that letter to ted to help his defense you convince scott do you hear me syd because on friday im not going to be here im going to be at my press reception and there isnt going to be a whisper to connect me to any poisonpen letters or destroyed evidence they glared at each other in a frenzy of frustration syd realized that she might be telling the truth and that by destroying the letter he might have thrown away the series if one hint of unfavorable publicity hit the papers before friday if scott refused to let cheryl leave the spa ive got to think he said ill figure something out he had one last card to play the question was how to play it five when ted returned to his bungalow he found henry bartlett and craig waiting for him a jubilant bartlett did not seem to notice his silence i think weve had a break he announced as ted took his place at the table bartlett told him about the discovery of leilas diary in her own hand shed checked off when you and elizabeth lange were in the same cities did you see her every time you were there ted leaned back and folded his arms behind his head and closed his eyes it seemed so long ago ted at least here i can help you craigs enthusiasm was a quality that had for a long time been missing from his voice and demeanor you kept elizabeth s schedule on your desk i can swear that you adjusted your travel plans so that youd be able to see her ted did not open his eyes will you kindly explain that henry bartlett had been driven past irritation listen mr winters i wasnt hired to take on this case so that you could wipe your feet on me its the rest of your life but its also my professional reputation if you cant or wont cooperate in your own defense maybe its not too late for you to get another attorney he shoved his files across the table and watched as papers spilled from them you insisted on coming here when it would have been much better to have ready access to my staff you disappeared for a long walk yesterday when we were supposed to work you were supposed to be here an hour ago and were twiddling our thumbs waiting for you youve blackballed one line of defense that might work now we have a decent shot at destroying elizabeth langes credibility as a witness and youre not interested ted opened his eyes slowly he lowered his arms until they rested on the table oh but i am interested tell me about it bartlett chose to ignore the sarcasm listen were going to be able to produce a facsimile of two letters leila received that suggest you were involved with someone else cheryl is one possibility as that someone else we know shed say anything but theres a better way you did try to coordinate your schedule with elizabeth s ted interrupted him elizabeth and i were very good friends we liked each other we enjoyed each others company if i had my choice of being in chicago on wednesday and dallas on friday or the other way around and found that a good friend with whom i could enjoy a late supper and relax was in those same cities yes i would arrange my schedule to do that so what come off it ted you did it half a dozen times in the same weeks that leila started to fall apart when she was receiving those letters ted shrugged ted henry is trying to plan your defense craig snapped at least pay attention to him bartlett continued what we are trying to show you is this step one leila was receiving letters saying that you were involved with someone else step two craig is witness to the fact that you synchronized your schedule with elizabeth s step three in her own handwriting leila made the obvious connection between you two in her diary step four you had no reason to kill leila if you were no longer interested in her step five what to you was a mild flirtation was very very different to elizabeth she was head over heels in love with you triumphantly henry threw the copy of the globe at ted look at that picture ted studied it he remembered the moment at the end of the service when some fool had asked the organist to play my old kentucky home leila had told him about singing that to elizabeth when they took off for new york beside him elizabeth had gasped then the tears that shed held back flooded her face hed put his arms around her turned her to him and whispered dont sparrow she was in love with you henry continued when she realized that for you it was simply a flirtation she turned on you she took advantage of that wackos crazy accusation to destroy you im telling you teddy we may be able to make this stick ted tore the paper in half apparently my job is to be the devils advocate lets suppose your scenario is true elizabeth was in love with me but lets carry it one step further suppose i had come to realize that life with leila would be a succession of constant ups and downs of tantrums of an insecurity that resulted in jealous accusations every time i spoke pleasantly to another woman suppose id come to realize that leila was an actress first last and always that she didnt want a child suppose id realized that in elizabeth i had found something id been looking for all my life ted slammed his fist on the table dont you know that you have just given me the very best reason in the world for killing leila because do you think that elizabeth would have looked at me twice while her sister was alive he pushed back his chair with a vehemence that caused it to topple over why dont you two play golf or go for a swim or do anything that makes you feel good dont waste your time here i dont plan to bartlett s face turned crimson ive had enough he snapped listen mr winters you may know how to run hotels but you dont know a damn thing about what goes on in a criminal courtroom you hired me to keep you out of prison but i cant do it alone whats more i dont intend to either you start cooperating with me or get yourself another lawyer calm down henry craig said no i wont calm down i dont need this case i can possibly win it but not the way its going now he pointed at ted if you are so sure that any defense i raise wont work why dont you pleabargain right now i might get you a maximum of seven to ten years is that what you want say so or else sit down at that table ted picked up the chair he had knocked over lets get to work he said tonelessly i probably owe you an apology i realize youre the best in your field but i guess you can understand how trapped i feel do you really think there is a chance for an acquittal ive gotten acquittals in cases as rough as this bartlett told him what you dont seem to fathom he added is that being guilty has nothing to do with the verdict six somehow min managed to get through the rest of the morning she was too busy fielding phone calls from the media to even think of the scene in the office between elizabeth and teds lawyer they had all left immediately after the blowup bartlett and elizabeth furious craig distressed scott grimfaced helmut had escaped to the clinic he had known she wanted to talk to him he had avoided her this morning as hed avoided her last night when after telling her that hed heard ted attacking leila hed locked himself in his study who in hell had tipped off the press that elizabeth and ted were here she answered the persistent inquiries with her standard reply we never release the names of our guests she was told that both elizabeth and ted had been spotted in carmel no comment any other time shed have loved the publicity but now she was asked if there was anything unusual about her secretarys death certainly not at noon she told the operator to hold all calls and went to the womens spa she was relieved to see that the atmosphere there was normal there seemed to be no more talk about sammys death she made it a point to chat with the guests lunching around the pool alvirah meehan was there she had spotted scotts car and tried to pepper min with questions about his presence when min got back to the main house she went directly up to the apartment helmut was sitting on the couch sipping a cup of tea his face was a sickly gray ah minna he attempted a smile she did not return it we have got to talk she told him abruptly what is the real reason you went to leilas apartment that night were you having an affair with her tell me the truth the cup rattled in the saucer as he put it down an affair minna i hated that woman min watched as his face blotched and his hands clenched do you think i was amused at the way she ridiculed me an affair with her he slammed his fist on the cocktail table minna you are the only woman in my life there has never been another woman since i met you i swear that to you liar min rushed over to him bent down and grabbed his lapels look at me i tell you look at me stop the phony aristocratic crap and the dramatics you were dazzled by leila what man wasnt every time you looked at her you raped her with your eyes you were all like that the pack of you ted syd even that clod craig but you were the worst love hate its all one and in your entire life youve never put yourself out for anyone i want the truth why did you go to her that night she released him suddenly drained and exhausted he jumped to his feet his hand brushed the teacup and it tipped over sending splatters of tea onto the table and carpet minna this is impossible i will not have you treating me like a germ under a microscope disdainfully he glanced at the mess send for someone to clean this up he ordered i have to get to the clinic mrs meehan is due for her collagen injections this afternoon his tone became sarcastic take heart my dear as you know thats another outrageous fee in the till i saw that dreary woman an hour ago min said youve made yet another conquest she was gushing about how talented you are and how you are going to make her feel like a butterfly floating on a cloud if i hear that idiotic expression from her once more she broke off helmuts knees had begun to sag she grabbed him before he could fall tell me what is wrong she shrieked tell me what youve done seven when she left mins office elizabeth rushed back to her bungalow furious at herself for allowing bartlett to goad her he would say anything do anything to discredit her testimony and she was playing into his hands to distract herself she opened the script of leilas play but the words were a jumble she could not focus on them was there the ring of truth to bartlett s accusationshad ted deliberately sought her out she thumbed through the script restlessly deciding to read it later then her glance fell on one of leilas marginal notes shocked she sank down on the couch and turned back to the first page merrygoround a comedy by clayton anderson she read the play through rapidly then sat for a long time totally absorbed in her thoughts finally she reached for a pen and pad and began rereading slowly making her own notations at two thirty she laid the pen down pages of the pad were filled with her jottings she became aware that she had skipped lunch that her head ached dully some of leilas markings in the margin had been almost indecipherable but eventually shed made them all out clayton anderson the playwright of merrygoround the wealthy college professor who had invested one million dollars of his own money in the play but whose true identity was known to no one who was he he had known leila intimately she phoned the main house the operator told her that baroness von schreiber was in her apartment but was not to be disturbed ill be right there elizabeth told her crisply tell the baroness i have to see her min was in bed she did look ill there was no bravado no bossihess in her demeanor or voice well elizabeth shes afraid of me elizabeth thought with a rush of her old affection she sat by the bed min why did you bring me here min shrugged because believe it or not i was worried about you because i love you i believe that and the other reason because i am appalled at the idea that ted may spend the rest of his life in prison sometimes people do terrible things in anger because they are out of control things they might never do if they were not goaded beyond their ability to stop themselves i believe that happened i know that happened to ted what do you mean you know that happened nothing nothing min closed her eyes elizabeth you do what you must but i warn you you will have to live with destroying ted for the rest of your life someday you will again face leila i think she will not thank you you know how she was after she had been utterly outrageous contrite loving generous all of it min isnt there another reason why you want ted to be acquitted it has to do with this place doesnt it what do you mean i mean that just before leila died ted was considering putting a cypress point spa in all his new hotels what happened to that plan ted has not gone ahead with plans for new hotels since his indictment exactly so there are a couple of reasons why you want ted acquitted min who is clayton anderson i have no idea elizabeth i am very tired perhaps we can talk later min come on youre not that tired the sharper tone in her voice made min open her eyes and pull herself up on the pillows i was right elizabeth thought shes not so much sick as afraid min i just read and reread that play leila was in i saw it with all of you that last preview but i didnt pay attention to it i was too worried about leila min someone who knew leila inside and out wrote that play thats why it was so perfect for her someone even used helmuts expressions in ita butterfly floating on a cloud leila noticed it too she had a notation in the margin tell the baron someone is stealing his thunder min they stared at each other as the same thought struck them helmut wrote the ads for this place elizabeth whispered he writes the daily bulletins maybe there is no wealthy college professor min did helmut write the play i dont know min struggled out of bed she was wearing a loose caftan that suddenly seemed too large as if she were shriveling inside it elizabeth will you excuse me i have to make a call to switzerland eight with an unfamiliar sense of worry alvirah walked reluctantly down the hedged path that led to treatment room c the instructions the nurse had given her were reconfirmed by the note that had been on her breakfast tray this morning the note was friendly and reassuring but even so now that the time had come alvirah still felt squeamish to ensure absolute privacy the note said patients entered the treatment rooms by the individual outside doors alvirah was to go to treatment room c at three pm and settle herself on the table in view of the fact that mrs meehan had an aversion to needles she would be given a specialstrength valium and allowed to rest until three thirty at which time dr von schreiber would perform the treatment she would continue to rest for an additional halfhour to allow the valium to wear off the flowering hedges were over six feet high and walking between them made her feel like a young girl in a bower the day had become really warm but in here the hedges held moisture and the azaleas made her think of her own azalea plants in front of the house theyd been really pretty last spring she was at the treatmentroom door it was painted a pale blue and a tiny gold c confirmed that she was in the right place hesitantly she turned the handle and went in the room looked like a ladys boudoir it had flowered wallpaper and a pale green carpet a little dressing table and a love seat the treatment table was made up like a bed with sheets that matched the wallpaper a pale pink comforter and a laceedged pillow on the closet door was a giltframed mirror with beveled edges only the presence of a cabinet with medical supplies suggested the real purpose of the room and even that was finished in white wood with leaded glass doors alvirah removed her sandals and placed them neatly side by side under the table she had a size nine foot and didnt want the doctor tripping when he was giving the collagen injections she lay down on the table pulled up the comforter and closed her eyes they sprang open a moment later when the nurse came in she was regina owens the chief assistant the one who had taken her medical history dont look so worried miss owens said alvirah liked her she reminded her of one of the women whose houses she cleaned she was about forty with dark short hair nice wide eyes and a pleasant smile she brought a glass of water and a couple of pills to alvirah these will make you feel nice and drowsy and you wont even know youre getting made gorgeous obediently alvirah put them into her mouth and swallowed the water i feel like a baby she apologized not at all youd be amazed how many people are terrified of needles miss owens came behind her and began massaging her temples you are tense now im going to put a nice cool cloth over your eyes and you just let yourself drift off to sleep the doctor and i will be back in about a halfhour by then you probably wont even know were here alvirah felt the strong fingers press against her temples that feels good she murmured ill bet it does for a few minutes miss owens continued to knead alvirahs forehead the back of her neck alvirah felt herself drifting into a pleasantly dreamy state then a cool cloth was placed over her eyes she barely heard the click of the door when miss owens tiptoed out there were so many thoughts running through her head like loose threads that she couldnt quite pull together a butterfly floating on a cloud she was beginning to remember why that seemed familiar it was almost there can you hear me mrs meehan she hadnt realized that baron von schreiber had come in his voice sounded low and a little hoarse she hoped the microphone would pick it up she wanted everything on record yes her own voice sounded far away dont be afraid youll barely feel a pinprick he was right she felt hardly anything just a tiny sensation like a mosquito bite and to think shed been worried she waited the doctor had told her hed be injecting the collagen in ten or twelve spots on each side of her mouth what was he waiting for it was getting hard to breathe she couldnt breathe help she cried but the word wouldnt come out she opened her mouth gasping desperately she was slipping away her arms her chest nothing moved oh god help me help me she thought then darkness overcame her as the door opened and nurse owens said briskly well here we are mrs meehan all set for your beauty treatment nine what does it prove elizabeth asked herself as she walked from the main house along the path to the clinic if helmut wrote that play he must be going through hell the author had put one million dollars into the production that was why min was calling switzerland her nest egg in a numbered account was a standing joke ill never be broke she had always bragged min had wanted ted acquitted so that she could license cypress point spas in all his new hotels helmut had a much more compelling reason if he was clayton anderson he knew that even the nest egg was gone she would force him to tell her the truth elizabeth decided the foyer of the clinic was hushed and quiet but the receptionist was not at her desk from down the hall elizabeth heard running feet raised voices she hurried toward the sounds doors were open on the corridor as guests in the process of treatment peeked out the room at the end of the hall was open it was from there that the sounds were coming room c dear god that was where mrs meehan was going to have the collagen treatment there wasnt anyone in the spa who hadnt heard about it had something gone wrong elizabeth almost collided with a nurse coming out of the room you cant go in there the nurse was trembling elizabeth pushed her aside helmut was bent over the treatment table he was compressing alvirah meehans chest an oxygen mask was on alvirahs face the noise of a respirator dominated the room the coverlet had been pulled back her robe was crumpled under her the incongruous sunburst pin gleaming upward as elizabeth watched too horrified to speak a nurse handed helmut a needle he attached it to tubing and started an intravenous in alvirahs arm a male nurse took over compressing her chest from the distance elizabeth could hear the wail of an ambulance siren screeching through the gates of the spa it was four fifteen when scott was notified that alvirah meehan the fortymilliondollar lottery winner was in the monterey peninsula hospital a possible victim of an attempted homicide the deputy who phoned had responded to the emergency call and accompanied the ambulance to the spa the attendants suspected foul play and the emergencyroom doctor agreed with them dr von schreiber claimed that she had not yet received a collagen treatment but a drop of blood on her face seemed to indicate a very recent injection alvirah meehan scott rubbed his hands over suddenly weary eyes that woman was bright he thought of her comments at dinner she was like the child in the fable the emperors new clothes who says but he has no clothes on why would anyone want to hurt alvirah meehan scott had hoped she wouldnt get caught up with charlatans trying to invest her money for her but the thought that anyone might deliberately try to kill her was incredible ill be right there he said as he slammed down the phone the waiting room of the community hospital was open and pleasant with greenery and an indoor pond not unlike the lobby of a small hotel he never saw it without remembering the hours he had sat here when jeanie was a patient he was informed that the doctors were working on mrs meehan that dr whitley would be available to see him shortly elizabeth came in while he was waiting how is she i dont know she shouldnt have had those injections she really was afraid she had a heart attack didnt she we dont know yet how did you get here min we came in her car shes parking it now helmut rode in the ambulance with mrs meehan this cant be happening her voice rose people in nearby chairs turned to stare at her scott forced her to sit on the sofa beside him elizabeth get hold of yourself you only met mrs meehan a few days ago you cant let yourself get this upset wheres helmut mins voice coming from behind them was as flat as though there were no emotion left in her she too seemed to be in a state of disbelief and shock she came around the couch and sank into the chair facing them he must be so distraught she broke off here he is to scotts practiced eye the baron looked as though he had seen a ghost he was still wearing the exquisitely tailored blue smock that was his surgical costume he sank heavily into the chair beside min and groped for her hand she is in a coma they say she had some sort of injection min it is impossible i swear to you impossible stay here scotts look included the three of them from the long corridor that led to the emergency area he had seen the chief of the hospital beckon to him they spoke in the private office she was injected with something that brought on shock dr whitley said flatly he was a tall lean sixtythreeyearold whose usual expression was affable and sympathetic now it was steely and scott remembered that his longtime friend had been an army fighter pilot in world war ii will she live absolutely impossible to say shes in a coma which may become irreversible she tried to say something before she went totally under what was it it sounded like voy thats as much as she got out thats no help what does the baron have to say does he have any idea how this could have happened we didnt let him near her scott frankly i gather you dont think much of the good doctor i have no reason to doubt his medical capabilities but theres something about him that shouts phony at me every time i see him and if he didnt inject mrs meehan then who the hell did scott pushed back his chair thats just what i intend to find out as he left the office whitley called him back scott something that might help uscould someone check mrs meehans rooms and bring in any medication she may have been taking until we reach her husband and get her medical history we dont know what we may be dealing with ill take care of it myself elizabeth drove back to the spa with scott on the way he told her about finding the shred of paper in cheryls bungalow then she did write those letters elizabeth exclaimed scott shook his head i know it sounds crazy and i know cheryl can lie as easily as most of us can breathe but ive been thinking about this all day and my gut feeling is shes telling the truth what about syd did you talk to him not yet shes bound to tell him she admitted that she stole the letter and that he tore it up i decided to let him stew before i question him that sometimes works but im telling you im inclined to believe her story but if she didnt write the letters who did scott shot a glance at her i dont know he paused then said what i mean is i dont know yet min and the baron followed scotts car in her convertible min drove the only way i can help you is to know the truth she told her husband did you do something to that woman the baron lit a cigarette and inhaled deeply his chinablue eyes watered the reddish tint in his hair seemed brassy under the lateafternoon sun the top of the convertible was down a cool land breeze had dispelled the last of the daytime warmth a sense of autumn was in the air minna what crazy talk is that i went into the room she wasnt breathing i saved her life what reason would i have to hurt her helmut who is clayton anderson he dropped the cigarette it fell on the leather seat beside him min reached over and picked it up youd better not ruin this car there wont be a replacement i repeat who is clayton anderson i dont know what youre talking about he whispered oh i think you do elizabeth came to see me she read the play thats why you were so upset this morning isnt it it wasnt the appointment book it was the play leila had made notes in the margin she picked up that idiotic phrase you use in the ads elizabeth caught it too so did mrs meehan she saw one of the previews thats why you tried to kill her isnt it you were still hoping to conceal the fact you wrote that play minna i am telling youyou are crazy for all we know that woman was selfinjecting thats nonsense she talked constantly about her fear of needles that could have been a coverup the playwright put over a million dollars in that play if you are that playwright where would you have gotten the money they were at the gates of the spa min slowed down and glanced at him unsmiling i tried to phone switzerland to check on my balance of course it was after business hours there i will call tomorrow helmut i hopefor your sakethat money is in my account his expression was as bland as ever but his eyes were those of a man about to be hanged they met on the porch of alvirah meehans bungalow the baron opened the door and they went in scott saw that min had clearly taken advantage of alvirahs naivete this was the most expensive of their accommodationsthe rooms the first lady used when she saw fit to seek randr at the spa there were a living room a dining room a library a huge master bedroom two full baths on the first floor you sure socked it to her scott thought his inspection of the premises was relatively brief the medicine chest in the bathroom alvirah used contained only overthecounter drugsmaximumstrength bufferin allerest a nasal spray a jar of vicks vaporub bengay a nice lady whose nasal passages get stuffed up at night and who probably has a few twinges of arthritis it seemed to him that the baron was disappointed under scotts careful scrutiny he insisted on opening all the bottles spilling out the contents examining them to see if any extra medication was mixed with the ordinary tablets and pills was it an act how good an actor was the toy soldier alvirahs closet revealed wellworn brushed flannel nightgowns side by side with expensive dresses and caftans most of them carrying labels from martha park avenue and cypress point spa boutique an incongruous note was the expensive japanese recorder in the carryon bag that was part of the louis vuitton matching luggage scott raised his eyes sophisticated professional equipment he wouldnt have expected it of alvirah meehan elizabeth watched as he thumbed through the cassettes three of them were marked in numerical sequence the rest were blank scott shrugged put them back and closed the bag he left a few minutes later elizabeth walked with him to his car on the ride over she had not told him her suspicion that helmut might have written the play she wanted to be sure first to demand the truth from helmut himself it was still possible that clayton anderson existed she told herself it was exactly six oclock when scotts car disappeared past the gates it was getting cool elizabeth shoved her hands into her pockets and felt the sunburst pin she had taken it off alvirahs robe after the ambulance left obviously it had great sentimental value they had sent for alvirahs husband she would give the pin to him tomorrow ten ted returned to his bungalow from town at six thirty pm he had come back the long way through the crocker woodland to the service entrance of the spa he hadnt missed the cars halfhidden in the brush beside the road leading to the cypress point grounds reporters like dogs on a scent following the lead that the globe article suggested he peeled off his sweater it had been too hot to wearbut on the other hand at this time of year you could be surprised on the peninsula the winds could shift and become favorable or unfavorable at a moments notice he drew the shades switched on the lights and was startled to see the gleam of dark hair that rose over the back of the couch it was min it is important that i speak with you the tone was the same hed always known warm and authoritative a curious blend that at one time had inspired confidence she was wearing a long sleeveless jacket over some sort of glittery onepiece outfit ted sat opposite her and lit a cigarette i gave these up years ago but its amazing how many bad habits you can take on again when youre faced with a lifetime in prison so much for discipline im not very presentable minbut then im not used to having unexpected guests in quite this way unexpected and uninvited mins eyes swept over him youve been jogging no ive been walking quite a long distance it gives one time to think your thoughts cant be very pleasant these days no theyre not ted waited may i have one of those min indicated the pack of cigarettes he had tossed on the table ted offered her one and lit it for her i too gave them up but in times of stress min shrugged i gave up many things in my life while i was clawing my way up well you know how it is launching a model agency and trying to keep it going when there was no money corning in marrying a sick old man and being his nurse his mistress his companion for five endless years oh i thought i had reached a point of certain security i thought i had earned it and you havent min waved a hand its lovely here isnt it this spot is ideal the pacific at our feet the magnificent coastline the weather the comfort and beauty of these accommodations the unparalleled facilities of the spa even helmuts monstrosity of a roman bath could be a stunning draw nobody else would be fool enough to try to build one nobody else would have the flair to run it no wonder shes here ted thought she couldnt risk talking to me with craig around it was as though min read his mind i know what craig would advise but ted youre the entrepreneur the daring businessman you and i think alike helmut is utterly impracticali know that but he also has vision what he needs and has always needed is the money to bring his dreams to fruition do you remember a conversation we had the three of uswhen your damn bulldog craig wasnt around we talked about your putting a cypress point spa in all your new hotels its a fabulous idea it would work min if im in prison there wont be new hotels weve stopped building since the indictment you know that then lend me money now mins mask dropped ted i am desperate i will be bankrupt in weeks it need not be this place lost something in these past few years helmut has not been bringing in new guests i think i know now why hes been in a terrible state but it could change why do you think i brought elizabeth here to help you min you saw her reaction to me if anything youve made things worse im not sure about that this afternoon i begged her to reconsider i told her she would never forgive herself if she destroyed you min crushed the cigarette into the ashtray ted i know what im saying elizabeth is in love with you she always has been make it work for you its not too late she grasped his arm he shook off her grip min you dont know what youre talking about im telling you what i know its something i sensed from the first time she laid eyes on you dont you know how difficult it was for her to be around you and leila wanting leila to be happy loving you both she was torn in two thats why she took that play before leila died it wasnt a role she wanted sammy talked to me about it she saw it too ted elizabeth is fighting you because she feels guilty she knows leila goaded you beyond endurance make it work for you and ted i beg you help me now please i beg you with naked appeal she looked at him he had been perspiring and his dark brown hair was matted in ringlets and waves a woman would kill for that head of hair min thought his high cheekbones accentuated the narrow perfectly shaped nose his lips were even his jaw just square enough to impart a look of strength to his face his shirt was clinging to his body his limbs were tanned and muscular she wondered where he had been and realized he might not have heard yet about alvirah meehan she did not want to talk about that now min i cant go ahead with spas in hotels that wont be built if i go to prison i can bail you out now and i will but let me ask you something has it ever occurred to you that elizabeth might be wrong might be mistaken about the time has it even occurred to you that im telling the truth when i say i did not go back upstairs mins smile of relief turned to astonishment ted you can trust me you can trust helmut he hasnt told a soul except me he never will tell a soul he heard you shouting at leila he heard her begging for her life eleven should she have told scott what she suspected about the baron elizabeth wondered as she went into the welcome calm of her bungalow her senses absorbed the emeraldandwhite color scheme splashy print on thick white carpeting she could almost imagine there was a lingering hint of joy mixed with the salty sea air leila red hair emerald eyes the pale skin of the natural redhead the billowing white satin pajamas that shed been wearing when she died those yards of material must have floated around her as she fell my god my god elizabeth slipped the double lock and huddled on the couch her head in her hands appalled at the vision of leila floating down through the night to her death helmut had he written merrygoround if so had he cleaned out mins untouchable swiss account to finance it he would have been frantic when leila said she was quitting the show how frantic alvirah meehan the ambulance attendants the speck of blood on alvirahs face the incredulous tone when the paramedic spoke to helmut what do you mean you hadnt started the injections who do you think youre kidding helmuts hands compressing alvirahs chest helmut starting the intravenous but helmut must have been frantic hearing alvirah talk about a butterfly floating on a cloud alvirah had seen a preview of the play leila had made the connection to helmut had alvirah meehan made it as well she thought about mins speech to her this afternoon about ted she had virtually acknowledged teds guilt then tried to persuade her that leila had provoked him over and over again was that true was min rightthat leila would never want to see ted behind bars for the rest of his life and why did min sound so positive about teds guilt two days ago shed been saying it must have been an accident elizabeth locked her arms around her knees and laid her head on her hands i dont know what to do she whispered to herself she had never felt lonelier in her life at seven oclock she heard the faint chimes that indicated cocktail hour had begun she decided to have dinner served in the bungalow it was impossible to envision going through the motions of socializing with any of those people knowing that sammys body was in the morgue awaiting shipment to ohio that alvirah meehan was fighting for her life in monterey hospital two nights ago she had been at the table with alvirah meehan two nights ago sammy had been in this room with her who would be next at quarter of eight min called elizabeth everyone is inquiring about you are you all right of course i just need to be quiet youre sure youre not ill you should know ted especially is very concerned hand it to min she never gives up im really fine min would you have them send a tray ill take it a bit easy and go for a swim later dont worry about me she hung up the phone walked around the room restlessly already longing to be in the water in aqua sanitas the inscription read for once helmut was right water would soothe her turn off her mind twelve he was reaching for the tank when there was a sharp knock on the door frantically he yanked the mask from his face and pulled his arms out of the cumbersome wet suit he jammed the tank and the mask into the closet then rushed into the bathroom and turned on the shower the knocking was repeated an impatient staccato he managed to get free of the suit dropped it behind the couch and grabbed his robe making his voice sound annoyed he shouted all right all right and opened the door the door was pushed open what took you so long weve got to talk it was nearly ten oclock when he was at last able to go to the pool he reached it just in time to see elizabeth walking down the path to her bungalow in his hurry he brushed against a chair at the edge of the patio she turned around and he barely had time to step back into the bushes tomorrow night there was still a chance to get to her here if not a different kind of accident would have to be arranged like alvirah meehan she had picked up the scent and was leading scott alshorne along the trail that scraping noise it had been the sound of a chair grating against the patio tiles the air had become cool but was very still there was no breeze to set anything in motion shed turned quickly and for just an instant had thought shed seen someone moving but that was foolish why would anyone bother to stand in the shadows of the trees even so elizabeth quickened her steps and was glad to be back in the bungalow with the door locked she phoned the hospital there was no change in mrs meehans condition it took a long time to fall asleep what was eluding her something that had been said something she ought to have seized on finally she drifted off she was searching for someone she was in an empty building with long dark halls her body was aching with need her arms were outstretched what was that poem shed read somewhere is there yet one oh eyes and lips remembered who turns and reaches for me in the night she whispered it over and over she saw a staircase she hurried down it he was there his back to her she threw her arms around him he turned and caught her and held her his mouth was on hers ted i love you i love you she said over and over again somehow she managed to wake up for the rest of the night miserable and despairing she lay numbly in the bed where leila and ted had so often slept together determined not to sleep not to dream thursday september quote for the day the power of beauty i remember yet dryden dear cypress point spa guest a cheery good morning to you i hope as you read this you are sipping one of our

experience trace on our face remember collagen like a gentle hand is waiting to smooth them away be serene be tranquil be merry and have a pretty day baron and baroness helmut von schreiber one long before the first rays of the sun proclaimed yet another brilliant day on the monterey peninsula ted lay awake thinking about the weeks ahead the courtroom the defendants table where he would sit feeling the eyes of the spectators on him trying to get a sense of the impact of the testimony on the jurors the verdict guilty of murder in the second degree why second degree he had asked his first lawyer because in new york state first degree is reserved for killing a peace officer for what its worth it amounts to about the same as far as sentencing goes life he told himself a life in prison at six oclock he got up to jog the morning was cool and clear but it would be a hot day without a sense of where he wanted to run he let his feet follow whatever roads they chose and was not surprised to find himself after forty minutes in front of his grandfathers house in carmel it was on the ocean block it used to be white but the present owners had painted it a moss greenattractive enough but he preferred the way the white paint used to gleam in the afternoon sun one of his earliest memories was of this beach his mother helped him to build a castle laughing her dark hair swirling around her face so happy to be here instead of new york so grateful for the reprieve that bloody bastard who was his father the way hed ridiculed her mimicked her hammered at her why what gives anyone a streak of cruelty like that or was it simply alcohol that brought out something savage and evil in his father until he was drinking so much that the savage streak became his personality all there was the bottle and the fists and had he inherited the same savage streak ted stood on the beach staring at the house seeing his mother and grandmother on the porch seeing his grandparents at his mothers funeral hearing his grandfather say we should have made her leave him his grandmother whispered she wouldnt leave himit would have meant giving up ted had it been his fault he wondered as a child he still asked himself the same question there was still no answer there was someone watching him from a window quickly he continued to jog down the beach bartlett and craig were waiting in his bungalow theyd already had breakfast he went to the phone and ordered juice toast coffee ill be right back he told them he showered and put on shorts and a tshirt the tray was waiting when he came out quick service here isnt it min really knows how to run a spa it would have been a good idea to franchise this place for new hotels neither man answered him they sat at the library table watching him seeming to know that he neither expected nor wanted comment he swallowed the orange juice in one gulp and reached for the coffee im going to the spa for the morning he said i might as well have a decent workout well leave for new york tomorrow craig call an emergency board meeting for saturday morning im resigning as president and chairman of the company and appointing you in my place his expression warned craig not to argue he turned to bartlett his eyes icecold ive decided to pleabargain henry give me the best and worst possible scenarios of what kind of sentence i can expect to get two elizabeth was still in bed when vicky brought in her breakfast tray she set it down next to the bed and studied elizabeth youre not feeling well elizabeth propped her pillows against the headboard and sat up oh i guess ill survive she attempted a smile one way or another we have to dont we she reached over and picked up the vase with the single flower from the tray whats that you always say about carrying roses to fading flowers i dont mean you vickys angular face softened i was off the last two days i just heard about miss samuels what a nice lady she was but will you tell me what she was doing in the bathhouse she once told me just looking at that place gave her the creeps she said it reminded her of a tomb even if she wasnt feeling well that would be the last place shed go after vicky left elizabeth picked up the schedule that was on the breakfast tray she hadnt intended to go to the spa for either treatments or exercise but changed her mind she was slated for a massage with gina at ten oclock employees talk just now vicky had underscored her own belief that sammy would never have gone into the bathhouse on her own when she had arrived on sunday and had the massage gina had gossiped about the financial problems of the spa she might be able to hear more gossip if she asked the right questions as long as she was going there elizabeth decided to go through the full schedule the first exercise class helped her to limber up but it was hard not to look across the room to the place in the front row where alvirah meehan had been the other day she had labored so hard to bend and twist that at the end of the class she had been puffing furiously her face bright red but i kept up she had told elizabeth proudly she ran into cheryl in the corridor leading to the facial rooms cheryl was wrapped in a terrycloth robe her finger and toenails were painted a brilliant bluishpink elizabeth would have passed her without speaking but cheryl grasped her arm elizabeth ive got to talk to you about what those poisonpen letters is there any chance of finding any more of them without waiting for an answer she rushed on because if you have any more or find any more i want them analyzed or tested or fingerprinted or whatever you and the world of science can do to trace them back to the sender idid not send them got it elizabeth watched her sweep down the corridor as scott had commented she sounded convincing on the other hand if she was reasonably sure that those last two letters were the only ones likely to be found it would be the perfect attitude for her to take how good an actress was cheryl at ten oclock elizabeth was on the massage table gina came into the room pretty big excitement around this place she commented i would say so gina wrapped elizabeth s hair in a plastic cap i know first miss samuels then mrs meehan its crazy she poured cream on her hands and began to massage elizabeth s neck the tensions there again this has been a lousy time for you i know you and miss samuels were close it was easier not to talk about sammy she managed to murmur yes we were then asked gina did you ever have mrs meehan for a treatment sure did monday and tuesday shes some character what happened to her theyre not sure theyre trying to check her medical history id have thought she was sound as a dollar a little chunky but good skin tone good heartbeat good breathing she was scared of needles but that doesnt give anyone cardiac arrest elizabeth felt the soreness in her shoulders as ginas fingers kneaded the tight muscles gina laughed ruefully do you think there was anyone in the spa who didnt know mrs meehan was having a collagen injection in treatment room c one of the girls overheard her ask cheryl manning if shed ever had collagen there can you imagine no i cant gina the other day you told me the spa hasnt been the same since leila died i know she attracted the celebritywatchers but the baron used to bring in a pretty healthy bunch of new faces every year gina poured more cream into her palms its funny about two years ago that dried up nobody can figure out why he was making enough trips but most of them were in the new york area remember he used to work the charity balls in a dozen major cities personally present the certificate for a week at the spa to whoever came up with the winning ticket and by the time he got finished talking the lucky winner had three of her friends going along for the rideas paying guests why do you think it stopped gina lowered her voice he was up to something no one could figure out whatincluding min i guess she started to travel with him a lot she was getting plenty worried that his royal highness or whatever he calls himself had something going in new york something going as gina kneaded and pounded her body elizabeth fell silent was that something a play called merrygoround and if so had min guessed the truth long ago three ted left the spa at eleven oclock after two hours of using the nautilus equipment and swimming laps hed had a massage and then sat in one of the private openair jacuzzis that dotted the enclosure of the mens spa the sun was warm there was no breeze a flock of cormorants drifted overhead like a floating black cloud in an otherwise cloudless sky waiters were setting up for lunch service on the patio the striped umbrellas in soft tones of lime green and yellow that shaded the tables complemented the colorful slates on the ground again ted was aware of how well the place was run if things were different hed put min and the baron in charge of creating a dozen cypress point spas all over the world he almost smiled not completely in chargeall the barons proposed expenditures would be monitored by a hawkeyed accountant bartlett had probably been on the phone with the district attorney by now he would have some idea of the kind of sentence he might expect it still seemed absolutely incredible something he had no memory of doing had forced him to become a totally different person had forced him to lead a totally different life he walked slowly to his bungalow nodding distantly to the guests whod cut the last exercise class and were lazing by the olympic pool he didnt want to get into a conversation with them he didnt want to face the discussions he would have with henry bartlett memory a word that haunted him bits and pieces going back up in the elevator being in the hall swaying hed been so goddamn drunk and then what why had he blotted it out because he didnt want to remember what he had done prison confinement in a cell it might be better to there was no one in his bungalow that at least was a break hed expected to find them again around the library table he should have given bartlett this unit and taken the smaller one himself at least then hed have more peace the odds were theyd be back for lunch craig he was a good detail man the company wouldnt grow with him at the helm but he might be able to keep it on a holding course he should be grateful for craig craig had stepped in when the plane with eight top company executives had crashed in paris craig had been indispensable when kathy and teddy died craig was indispensable now and to think how many years would he have to serve seven ten fifteen there was one more job he needed to do he took personal stationery from his briefcase and began to write when he had finished he sealed the envelope rang for a maid and asked her to deliver it to elizabeth s bungalow he would have preferred to wait until just before he left tomorrow but perhaps if she knew there wouldnt be any trial she might stay here a little longer when she returned to her bungalow at noon elizabeth found the note propped on the table the sight of the envelope white bordered in cerise the flag colors of winters enterprises with her name written in the firm straight hand that was so familiar made her mouth go dry how many times in her dressing room had a note on that paper in that handwriting been delivered between acts hi elizabeth just got into town how about late supperunless youre tied up first act was great love ted theyd have supper and call leila from the restaurant watch my guy for me sparrow dont let some painted bitch try to stake him out theyd both have their ears pressed to the phone you staked me out star ted would say and she would be aware of his nearness of his cheek grazing hers and dig her fingers into the phone always wishing shed had the courage not to see him she opened the envelope she read two sentences before she let out a stifled cry and then had to wait before she could force herself to go back to finishing teds letter dear elizabeth i can only tell you that i am sorry and that word is meaningless you were right the baron heard me struggling with leila that night syd saw me on the street i told him leila was dead theres no use any longer in trying to pretend i wasnt there believe me i have absolutely no memory of those moments but in light of all the facts i am going to enter a plea of guilty to manslaughter when i return to new york at least this will bring this terrible affair to a conclusion and spare you the agony of testifying at my trial and being forced to relive the circumstances of leilas death god bless and keep you long ago leila told me that when you were a little girl and leaving kentucky to come to new york you were frightened and she sang that lovely song to you weep no more my lady think of her as singing that song to you now and try to begin a new and happier chapter in your life ted for the next two hours elizabeth sat hunched up on the couch her arms locked around her knees her eyes staring ahead unseeingly this was what you wanted she tried to tell herself hes going to pay for what he did to leila but the pain was so intense it gradually retreated into numbness when she got up her legs were stiff and she moved with the cautious hesitancy of the old there was still the matter of the anonymous letters now she would not rest until she had found out who had sent them and precipitated this tragedy it was past one oclock when bartlett phoned ted we have to talk right away henry said shortly get over as soon as you can is there any reason we cant meet here ive got some calls from new york coming in i dont want to risk missing them when craig opened the door for him ted did not waste time on preliminaries whats up something you wont like bartlett was not at the oval dinette table he used as a desk in this suite instead he was leaning back in an armchair one hand on the phone as though expecting it to leap into his hand he had a meditative expression ted decided not unlike that of a philosopher confronted with a problem too difficult to solve how bad is it ted asked ten years fifteen years worse they wont take a plea a new eyewitness has come forward briefly even brusquely he explained as you know we put private investigators on sally ross we wanted to discredit her in every way possible one of the investigators was in her apartment building night before last a thief was caught redhanded trying to rob the apartment one floor above mrs rosss hes been making a deal of his own with the district attorney he was in that apartment once before the night of march twentyninth he claims he saw you push leila off the terrace he watched the sickly pallor that stole over teds face change his deep tan to a muddy beige no plea bargain ted whispered his voice was so low that henry had to lean forward to catch the words why should they with a witness like that from what my people tell me theres no question that his view was unobstructed sally ross had that eucalyptus tree on the terrace obscuring her line of vision one floor higher up and the tree wasnt in the way i dont care how many people saw ted that night craig blurted he was drunk he didnt know what he was doing ill perjure myself ill say he was on the phone with me at nine thirty you cant perjure yourself bartlett snapped youre already on record as saying you heard the phone ring and didnt pick it up dont even think of it ted jammed clenched fists into his pockets forget the goddamned phone what exactly does this witness claim he saw so far the district attorney has refused to take my calls ive got a few inside connections there and from what theyve been able to find out this guy claims leila was struggling to save herself then i could be facing the maximum the judge assigned to this case is an imbecile hell let a throatslasher from the ghetto off with a slap on the wrist but he likes to show how tough he is when he deals with important people and youre important the phone rang bartlett had it at his ear before the second ring ted and craig watched as his frown deepened he moistened his lips with his tongue then bit his lower lip they listened as he barked out instructions i want a rap sheet on that guy i want to know what kind of deal he was offered i want pictures taken from that womans terrace on a rainy night get on with it when he put down the receiver he studied ted and craig noticing how ted had slumped in his chair and craig had straightened in his we go to trial he said that new eyewitness has been in the apartment before he described the inside of several of the closets this time they caught him when he barely got his feet in the entrance hall he says he saw you teddy leila was clawing at you trying to save herself you picked her up you held her over that railing and you shook her until she let go of your arms it wont be a pretty scene when its described in court i held her over the railing before i dropped her ted picked up a vase from the table and threw it across the room at the marble fireplace it smashed and sprays of delicate crystal cascaded across the carpet no its not possible he turned and ran blindly for the door he slammed it behind him with a force that shattered the window panel they watched as he ran across the lawn to the trees that separated the spa grounds from the crocker woodland hes guilty bartlett said theres no way i can get him off now give me a cleancut liar and i can work with him if i put him on the stand the jury will find teddy arrogant if i dont well have elizabeth describing how he shouted at leila and two eyewitnesses to tell how he killed her and im supposed to work with that he closed his eyes by the way hes just proved to us that he has a violent temper there was a special reason for that outburst craig said quietly when ted was eight years old he saw his father in a drunken rage hold his mother over the terrace of their penthouse he paused to catch his breath the difference is his father decided not to drop her four at two oclock elizabeth phoned syd and asked him to meet her at the olympic pool when she got there a mixed wateraerobics class was starting men and women holding beach balls were studiously following the directions of the instructor hold the ball between your palms swing from side to side no keep it underwater thats where we get the pull music was turned on she chose to sit at a table at the far end of the patio there was no one nearby ten minutes later she heard a scraping sound behind her and gasped it was syd he had cut through the bushes and pushed aside a chair to get onto the patio he nodded in the direction of the pool we had the janitors apartment in brooklyn when i was growing up its amazing how much muscle tone my mother got swinging a broom his tone was pleasant enough but his manner was guarded the polo shirt and shorts he was wearing revealed the wiry strength of his arms and the taut muscles in his legs funny elizabeth thought i always considered syd softlooking maybe because he has such a poor carriage thats a mistake the scraping sound had she heard a chair being moved last night when she was leaving the pool and monday night she thought she had seen something or someone moving was it possible shed been watched while she was swimming it was a fleeting but upsetting thought for a place that costs so much to relax in there are quite a few uptight people around here syd said he sat down across from her and im the most uptight i suppose syd you had your own money in merrygoround you brought the script to leila you handled some of the script revisions i have to talk to the playwright clayton anderson where can i get in touch with him i have no idea i never met him the contract was negotiated through his lawyer tell me the lawyers name no thats because there is no lawyer right syd helmut wrote that play didnt he he brought it to you and you brought it to leila helmut knew min would throw a fit if she found out about it that play was written by a man obsessedby leila thats why for leila the play would have worked his face turned a dull red you dont know what youre talking about she handed him the note ted had written to her dont i tell me about meeting ted the night leila died why didnt you come forward with that information months ago syd scanned the note he put that in writing hes a bigger fool than i realized elizabeth leaned forward according to this the baron heard ted struggling with leila and ted told you that leila was dead did it ever occur to either of you to see what had happened if there was any chance to help her syd shoved his chair back ive listened to you long enough no you havent syd why did you go to leilas apartment that night why did the baron go there she didnt expect either one of you syd stood up anger made his face ugly listen elizabeth your sister wiped me out when she quit that play i went to ask her to reconsider i never got inside that apartment building ted ran past me on the street i chased him he told me she was dead who lives after a fall like that i stayed out of it i never saw the baron that night he threw teds letter back at her arent you satisfied teds going to jail thats what you want isnt it dont leave syd ive still got lots of questions the letter cheryl stole why did you destroy it it might have helped ted i thought you were so anxious to help him syd sat down heavily look elizabeth ill make a deal with you tearing up that letter was my mistake cheryl swears she didnt write that one or any like it i believe her elizabeth waited she was not going to concede that scott believed cheryl as well youre right about the baron syd continued he wrote the play you know how leila put him down he wanted to have power over her make her indebted to him another guy would want to drag her into bed he waited elizabeth if cheryl cant leave tomorrow and be at her press reception shell lose this series the studio will drop her if they find out shes being detained youve got scotts ear persuade him to leave cheryl out of this and ill give you a hint about those letters elizabeth stared at him syd seemed to take her silence for assent as he spoke he tapped the table with his fingertips the baron wrote merrygoround ive got his handwritten changes on the early scripts lets play suppose elizabeth suppose the play is a hit the baron doesnt need min anymore hes tired of the spa game now hes a broadway playwright and constantly with leila how could min prevent that from happening by making sure the play is a flop how does she do that by destroying leila and she was just the one who knew how ted and leila were together for three years if cheryl wanted to get on their case why would she have waited that long he did not wait for her response the chair made the same grating sound as it had when hed arrived elizabeth stared after him it was possible it made sense she could hear leila say god sparrow mins really got the hots for the toy soldier hasnt she id hate to be the one who got cozy with him min would be on the warpath with a hatchet or with scissors and paste syd disappeared through the hedges watching him elizabeth could not see the grim smile he allowed himself as he passed from her vision it might work syd thought hed been wondering how to play this card and she had made it easy for him if she fell for it cheryl might be in the clear the smile disappeared might be but what about himself five unseeing and motionless elizabeth sat at the pool until the brisk voice of the wateraerobics instructor cut through the increasing shock she felt as her mind analyzed the enormity of mins possible betrayal she got up and followed the path to the main house the afternoon had fulfilled the mornings promise the sun was golden warm there was no breeze even the cypress trees looked mellow their dark leaves shimmering the craggy shapes unthreatening the cheerful clusters of petunias geraniums and azaleas perky from recent watering were now straining toward the warmth the blossoms open and radiant in the office she found a temporary receptionist a thirtyish pleasantfaced woman the baron and baroness had gone to the monterey peninsula hospital to offer their assistance to mrs meehans husband theyre just heartsick about her the receptionist seemed deeply impressed by their concern theyd been heartsick when leila died elizabeth remembered now she wondered how much of mins grief had resulted from guilt she scribbled a note to helmut and sealed it please give this to the baron as soon as he comes back she glanced at the copy machine sammy had been using that machine when for some reason shed wandered into the bathhouse suppose she really had had some sort of attack that disoriented her suppose she had left that letter in the copier min had come down early the next morning min might have found it and destroyed it wearily elizabeth went back to her bungalow shed never know who had sent those letters no one would ever admit it why was she staying here now it was all over and what was she going to do with the rest of her life in his note ted had told her to start a new and happier chapter where how her head was achinga dull steady pounding she realized that she had skipped lunch again shed call and inquire after alvirah meehan and then start packing funny how awful it is when theres no place in the world you want to go no single human being you want to see she pulled a suitcase out of the closet opened it then stopped abruptly she still had alvirahs sunburst pin it was in the pocket of the slacks shed been wearing when shed gone to the clinic when she took it out and held it she realized it was heavier than it looked she was no expert on jewelry but clearly this was not a valuable piece turning it over she began to study the back it didnt have the usual safety catch instead there was an enclosed device of some sort she turned the pin again and studied the face the small opening in the center was a microphone the impact of her discovery left her weak the seemingly artless questions the way alvirah meehan had fiddled with that pinshed been pointing the microphone to catch the voices of the people she was with the suitcase in her bungalow with the expensive recording equipment the cassettes there elizabeth knew she had to get them before anyone else did she rang for vicky fifteen minutes later she was back in her own bungalow the cassettes and recorder from alvirah meehans suitcase in her possession vicky looked flustered and somewhat apprehensive i hope no one saw us go in there she told elizabeth im giving everything to sheriff alshorne elizabeth assured her i just want to be certain they wont disappear if mrs meehans husband tells anyone about them she agreed that tea and a sandwich would taste good when vicky returned with the tray she found elizabeth earphones on her head her notebook in her lap a pen in her hands listening to the tapes six scott alshorne did not like having a suspicious death and a suspicious neardeath unresolved dora samuels had suffered a stroke just before her death how long before alvirah meehan had had a drop of blood on her face which suggested an injection the lab report showed a very low blood sugar possibly the result of an injection the barons efforts had fortunately saved her life so where did that leave him mrs meehans husband had not been located last night until late eveningone am new york time hed chartered a plane and arrived at the hospital at seven am local time early in the afternoon scott went there to talk to him the sight of alvirah meehan ghostly pale barely breathing hooked to machines was incredible to scott people like mrs meehan werent supposed to be sick they were too hearty too filled with life the burly man whose back was to him didnt seem to notice his presence he was bending over whispering to alvirah meehan scott touched his shoulder mr meehan im scott alshorne the sheriff of monterey county im sorry about your wife willy meehan jerked his head toward the nurses station i know all about how they think she is but im telling you shes going to be just fine i told her that if she up and died on me i was going to take that money and spend it on a blond floozy she wont let that happenwill you honey tears began to stream from his eyes mr meehan i have to speak with you for just a few minutes she could hear willy talking to her but she couldnt reach him alvirah had never felt so weak she couldnt even move her hand she was so tired and there was something she had to tell them she knew what had happened now it was so clear she had to make herself talk she tried moving her lips but she couldnt she tried to wiggle her finger willys hand was covering hers and she couldnt get up the strength to make him understand that she was trying to reach him if she could just move her lips just get his attention he was talking about the trips they were going to take a tiny stab of irritation flared through her mind keep quiet and listen to me she wanted to shout at him oh willy please listen the conversation in the corridor outside the intensivecare unit was unsatisfactory alvirah was healthy as a horse she was never sick she was on no medication scott did not bother to ask if there was a possibility that she used drugs there wasnt and he wouldnt insult this heartbroken man with the question she was looking forward so much to this trip willy meehan said as he put his hand on the door of the intensivecare unit she was even writing articles about it for the globe you should have seen how excited she was when they were showing her how to record peoples conversations she was writing articles scott exclaimed she was recording people he was interrupted a nurse rushed out mr meehan will you come in shes trying to talk again we want you to speak to her scott rushed in behind him alvirah was straining to move her lips voi voi willy grasped her hand im here honey im here the effort was so much she was getting so tired she was going to fall asleep if she could just get even one word out to warn them with a terrible effort alvirah managed that word she said it loud enough that she could hear it herself she said voices seven the afternoon shadows deepened as unmindful of time elizabeth listened to alvirah meehans tapes sometimes she stopped and rewound a segment of the tape and listened to it several times her lined pad was filled with notes those questions that had seemed so tactless had actually been so clever elizabeth thought of how she had sat at the table with the countess wishing she could overhear the conversations at mins table now she could some of the talk was muffled but she could hear enough to detect stress evasion attempts to change the subject she began to systematize her notations creating a separate page for everyone at the table at the bottom of each page she scribbled questions as they came to mind when she finished the third tape it seemed to her that she merely had a jumble of confusing sentences leila how i wish you were here you were too cynical but so many times you were right about people you could see through their facades something is wrong and im missing it what isit it seemed to her that she could hear leilas answer as if she were in the room for heavens sake sparrow open your eyes stop seeing what people want you to see start listening think for yourself didnt i teach you that much she was just about to put the last cassette from alvirahs sunburst pin into the recorder when the phone rang it was helmut you left a note for me yes i did helmut why did you go to leilas apartment the night she died she heard him gasp elizabeth do not talk on the phone may i come to you now while she waited she hid the recording equipment and her pad she had no intention of letting helmut become aware of the tapes for once his rigid military carriage seemed to have deserted him he sat opposite her his shoulders slumped his voice low and hurried his german accent more pronounced as he spoke he told her what he had told min he had written the play he had gone to plead with leila to reconsider you took the money out of mins swiss account he nodded minna has guessed what is the use is it possible that she always knew that she sent those letters because she wanted to upset leila enough to destroy her performance no one knew leilas emotional state better than min the barons eyes widened but how magnificent it is just the sort of thing minna would do then she may have known all along that there was no money left could she have been simply punishing me elizabeth did not care if her face showed the disgust she felt i dont share your admiration for that scheme if it was mins doing she went to the desk and got a fresh pad you heard ted struggling with leila yes i did where were you how did you get in how long were you there exactly what did you hear it helped to be writing to concentrate on taking down word for word what he said he had heard leila pleading for her life and he had not tried to help her when he had finished perspiration was glistening on his smooth cheeks she wanted to get him out of her sight but she could not resist saying suppose instead of running away you had gone into that apartment leila might be alive right now ted might not be pleabargaining for a lighter sentence if you hadnt been so worried about saving yourself i dont believe that elizabeth it happened in seconds the barons eyes widened but havent you heard there is no plea bargain its been on the news all afternoon a second eyewitness saw ted hold leila over the terrace before he dropped her the district attorney wants ted to get life leila had not toppled over the railing in a struggle he had held her then deliberately dropped her that leilas death had taken a few seconds longer seemed to elizabeth even more cruel than her worst fears i should be glad theyre going for the maximum penalty she told herself i should be glad to have the chance to testify against him she wanted desperately to be alone but she managed to ask the baron one more question did you see syd near leilas apartment that night could she trust the look of astonishment on his face no i did not he said firmly was he there it is finished elizabeth told herself she put in a call to scott alshorne the sheriff was out on official business could someone else help her no she left a message for him to phone her she would turn over alvirah meehans recording equipment to him and get on the next plane to new york no wonder theyd all sounded so on edge from alvirahs relentless questioning most of them had something to hide the sunburst pin she started to put it into a bag with the recorder and then realized she hadnt listened to the last cassette it occurred to her that alvirah had been wearing the pin in the clinic she managed to extract the cassette from the tiny container if alvirah was so concerned about the collagen injections would she have left the recorder on during the treatment she had elizabeth turned up the volume and held the recorder to her ear the cassette began with alvirah in the treatment room talking with the nurse the nurse reassuring her talking about valium the click of the door alvirahs even breathing the click of the door again the barons somewhat muffled and indistinct voice reassuring alvirah starting the injection the click of the door alvirahs gasps her attempt to call for help her frenzied breath a click of the door again the nurses cheerful voice well here we are mrs meehan all set for your beauty treatment and then the nurse upset on the edge of panic saying mrs meehan whats the matter doctor there was a pause then the voice of helmut barking orders open that robecalling for oxygen there was a pounding soundthat must have been when he was compressing her chest then helmut called for an intravenous that was when i was there elizabeth thought he tried to kill her whatever he gave her was meant to kill her alvirahs persistent references to that sentence about a butterfly floating on a cloud her constantly saying that that reminded her of something her calling him a clever authordid he perceive that as her toying with him had he still hoped that somehow min wouldnt learn the truth about the play about her swiss bank account she replayed the last tape again and again there was something about it she didnt understand what was it what was she missing not knowing what she was looking for she reread the notes she had taken when helmut described leilas death her eyes became riveted to one sentence but thats wrong she thought unless like an exhausted climber within inches of an icy summit she reviewed the notes she had made from alvirah meehans tapes and found the key it had always been there waiting for her did he realize how close she had been to the truth yes he did she shivered remembering the questions that had seemed so innocent her own troubled answers that must have been so threatening to him her hand flew to the phone she would call scott and then she withdrew her fingers from the dial tell him what there wasnt a shred of proof there never would be unless she could force his hand eight for over an hour scott sat by alvirahs bedside hoping she would say something else then touching willy meehans shoulder he said ill be right back he had seen john whitley at the nurses station and followed him into his office have you anything more you can tell me john no the doctor looked both angry and perplexed i dont like not knowing what im dealing with her blood sugar was so low that without a history of severe hypoglycemia we have to suspect that somebody injected her with insulin she sure as hell has a puncture mark where we found the spot of blood on her cheek if von schreiber claims he didnt inject her face at all somethings screwy what are her chances scott asked john shrugged i dont know its too soon to tell if she has incurred any brain damage if willpower can bring her back that husband of hers will manage it hes doing everything right talking to her about chartering a plane to get here about fixing the house when they go home if she can hear him shell want to stay around johns office overlooked the garden scott walked to the window wishing he could spend some time alone think this through we cant prove mrs meehan was the victim of an attempted murder we cant prove miss samuels was the victim of murder i dont think you can make either one stick no so that means even if we can make a stab at figuring who would want those women deadand have the guts to attempt to kill them at a place like the spawe still may not be able to prove anything thats more your line of work than mine but id agree scott had one parting question mrs meehan has been trying to talk she finally came out with a single wordvoices is it likely that someone in her condition is really trying to communicate something that makes sense whitley shrugged my impression is that her coma is still too deep to be certain as to her recall but i could be wrong it wouldnt be the first time again scott conferred with willy meehan in the corridor alvirah was planning to write a series of articles the editor of the new york globe had told her to get all the inside information she could on celebrities scott remembered her endless questions the night he had been at the spa for dinner he wondered what alvirah might unwittingly have learned at least it gave some reason for the attack on herif there had been an attack and it explained the expensive recording equipment in her suitcase he was scheduled to meet with the mayor of carmel at five oclock on his twoway car radio he learned that elizabeth had phoned him twice the second call was urgent some instinct made him cancel his appointment with the mayor for the second time in two days and go directly to the spa through the picture window he could see elizabeth on the phone he waited until she put the receiver down before he knocked in the thirtysecond interval he had a chance to study her the afternoon sun was sending slanted rays into the room which created shadows on her face and revealed the high cheekbones the wide sensitive mouth the luminous eyes if i were a sculptor id want her to model for me he thought she has an elegance that goes beyond beauty eventually she would have surpassed leila elizabeth turned the tapes over to him she indicated the writing pad with its lines of notations do me a favor scott she asked him listen to these tapes very very carefully this oneshe indicated the cassette she had taken from the sunburst pin is going to shock you play it over and see if you dont catch what i think ive heard now there was a determined thrust to her jaw a glitter in her eyes elizabeth what are you up to he asked something that i have to dothat only i can do despite scotts increasingly stern demands for an explanation she would not tell him more he did remember to tell her that alvirah meehan had managed to utter one word does voices suggest anything to you elizabeth s smile was enigmatic you bet it does she said grimly nine ted had bolted from the spa grounds in early afternoon by five oclock he had still not returned henry bartlett was visibly chafing to go back to new york we came here to prepare teds defense he said i hope he realized his trial is scheduled to start in five days if he wont meet with me im not doing any good sitting around here the phone rang craig jumped to answer it elizabeth what a nice surprise yes its true id like to think we can still persuade the district attorney to accept a plea but thats pretty unrealistic we hadnt talked about dinner yet but of course it would be good to be with you oh that i dont know it just didnt seem funny anymore and it always annoyed ted fine see you at dinner scott drove home with the windows of the car open appreciating the cool breeze that had begun to blow in from the ocean it felt good but he could not shake the sense of apprehension that was overcoming him elizabeth was up to something and every instinct told him that whatever it was it might be dangerous a faint mist was setting in along the shoreline of pacific grove it would develop into a heavy fog later on he turned the corner and pulled into the driveway of a pleasant narrow house a block from the ocean for six years now he had been coming home to this empty place and never once not felt that moment of nostalgia that jeanie was no longer here waiting for him he used to talk cases through with her tonight he would have asked her some hypothetical questions would you say that there is a connection between dora samuels death and alvirah meehans coma another question jumped into his mind would you say that there is a connection between those two women and leilas death and finally jeanie what the hell is elizabeth up to to clear his head scott showered changed into old slacks and a sweater he made a pot of coffee and put a hamburger on the grill when he was ready to eat he turned on the first of alvirahs tapes he began listening at quarter of five at six oclock his notebook like elizabeth s was filled with jottings at quarter of seven he heard the tape that documented the attack on alvirah that son of a bitch von schreiber he muttered he did inject her with something but with what suppose he had started the collagen and seen her go into some sort of attack he had returned almost immediately with the nurse scott replayed the tape then played it a third time and finally realized what elizabeth had wanted him to hear there was something odd about the barons voice the first time he spoke to mrs meehan it was hoarse guttural startlingly different from his voice a moment or two later when he was shouting orders to the nurse he phoned the hospital and asked for dr whitley he had one question for him do you think an injection that drew blood is the kind that a doctor would have administered ive seen some sloppy injections given by topflight surgeons and if a doctor gave the shot that was meant to harm mrs meehanhe may have had the grace to be nervous thanks john dont mention it he was reheating the coffee when his bell rang in quick strides he reached the door flung it open to face ted winters his clothes were rumpled his face smudged with dirt his hair matted vivid fresh scratches covered his arms and legs he stumbled forward and would have fallen if scott had not reached out to grasp him scott youve got to help me somebodys got to help me its a trap i swear it is scott i tried for hours and i couldnt do it i couldnt make myself do it easy easy scott put his arm around ted and guided him to the couch youre ready to pass out he poured a generous amount of brandy into a tumbler come on drink this after a few sips ted ran his hand over his face as if trying to erase the naked panic he had shown his attempt at a smile was a wan failure and he slumped with weariness he looked young vulnerable totally unlike the sophisticated head of a multimilliondollar corporation twentyfive years vanished and scott felt that he was looking at the nineyearold boy who used to go fishing with him have you eaten today he asked not that i remember then sip that brandy slowly and ill get you a sandwich and coffee he waited until ted had finished the sandwich before he said all right youd better tell me all about it scott i dont know whats happening but i do know this i could not have killed leila the way theyre trying to say i did i dont care how many witnesses come out of the woodworksomething is wrong he leaned forward now his eyes were pleading scott you remember how terrified mother was of heights she had good cause to be that bastard of a father of yours ted interrupted him he was disgusted because he could see that i was developing that same phobia one day when i was about eight he made her stand out on the terrace of the penthouse and look down she began to cry she said come on teddy and we started to go inside he grabbed her and picked her up and that son of a bitch held her over the railing it was thirtyeight floors up she was screaming begging i was clawing at him he didnt pull her in until shed fainted then he just dropped her on the terrace floor and said to me if i ever see you look frightened out here ill do the same thing to you ted swallowed his voice broke this new eyewitness says i did that to leila today i tried to make myself walk down the cliffs at point sur icouldnt do it i couldnt make my legs go to the edge people under stress can do some pretty funny things no no if id killed leila id have done it some other way i know that to say that drunk or sober i could hold her over the railing syd swears i told him that my father pushed leila off the terrace he may have known that story about my father maybe everybodys lying to me scott ive got to remember what happened that night with compassionate eyes scott studied ted taking in the exhausted droop of his shoulders the fatigue that emanated from his body hed been walking all afternoon trying to make himself stand at the edge of a cliff battling his own personal demon in search of the truth did you tell them this when they began questioning you about leilas death it would have sounded ridiculous i build hotels where we make people want terraces ive always been able to avoid going out on them without making an issue of it darkness was setting in beads of perspiration like unchecked tears were running down teds cheeks scott switched on a light the room with its comfortable overstuffed furniture the pillows jeanie had embroidered the tallbacked rocking chair the pine bookcase came to life ted did not seem to notice he was in a world where he was trapped by other peoples testimony on the verge of being confined to prison for the next twenty or thirty years hes right scott decided his only hope is to go back to that night are you willing to have hypnosis or sodium pentothal he asked either both it doesnt matter scott went to the phone and called john whitley at the hospital again dont you ever go home he asked i do get there now and again in fact im on my way now im afraid not john we have another emergency ten craig and bartlett walked together toward the main house they had deliberately skipped the cocktail hour and could see the last of the guests leaving the veranda as the muted gong announced dinner a cool breeze had come up from the ocean and the webs of lichen hanging from the giant pines that formed the border of the north end of the property swayed in a rhythmic solemn movement that was accentuated by the tinted lights scattered throughout the grounds i dont like it bartlett told craig elizabeth lange is up to something pretty strange when she asks to have dinner with us i can tell you the district attorney isnt going to like it one damn bit if he hears his star witness is breaking bread with the enemy former star witness craig reminded him still star witness that ross woman is a total nut the other one is a petty thief i wont mind being the one to crossexamine those two on the stand craig stopped and grabbed his arm you mean you think ted may still have a chance hell of course not hes guilty and hes not a good enough liar to help himself there was a placard in the foyer tonight there would be a fluteandharp recital bartlett read the names of the artists theyre firstrate i heard them in carnegie hall last year you ever go there sometimes what kind of music do you like bach fugues and i suppose that surprises you frankly i never thought about it one way or another bartlett said shortly christ he thought ill be glad when this case is over a guilty client who doesnt know how to lie and a secondincommand with a chip on his shoulder who would never get over his inferiority complex min the baron syd cheryl and elizabeth were already at the table only elizabeth seemed perfectly relaxed she rather than min had somehow assumed the role of hostess the place on either side of her was vacant when she saw them approaching she reached out her hands to them in a welcoming gesture i saved these seats specially for you and what the hell is that supposed to mean bartlett wondered sourly elizabeth watched as the waiter filled their glasses with nonalcoholic wine she said min i dont mind telling you that when i get home ill enjoy a good stiff drink you should be like everyone else syd told her wheres your padlocked suitcase its contents are much more interesting than liquor she told him throughout dinner she led the conversation reminiscing on the times they had been together at the spa once dessert was served it was bartlett who challenged her miss lange ive had the distinct impression that youre playing some sort of game and i for one dont believe in participating in games unless i know the rules elizabeth was raising a spoonful of raspberries to her lips she swallowed them then put down the spoon youre quite right she told him i wanted to be with all of you tonight for a very specific reason you should all know that i no longer believe ted is responsible for my sisters death they stared at her their faces shocked lets talk about it elizabeth said someone deliberately destroyed leila by sending those poisonpen letters to her i think it was you or you she pointed at cheryl then at min you are absolutely wrong min said indignantly i told you to come up with more letters and trace them cheryl spat out the words i may do just that elizabeth told her mr bartlett did ted tell you that both syd and the baron were around my sisters apartment house the night she died she seemed to enjoy his look of astonishment there is more to my sisters death than has come out i know that one maybe two of you know that you see theres another possible scenario syd and helmut had money in that play syd knew helmut was the playwright they went together to plead with leila something went wrong and leila died it would have been considered an accident if it hadnt been for that woman who swore she saw ted struggling with leila at that point my testimony that ted had come back trapped him the waiter was hovering over them min waved him away bartlett realized that people at the surrounding tables were watching them sensing the tension ted doesnt remember anything about going back to leilas apartment elizabeth said but suppose he did go back suppose he left immediately suppose one of you struggled with leila youre all about the same size it was raining that ross woman might have seen leila struggling and simply assumed it was ted you two agreed to let ted take the blame for leilas death and concocted the stories you told him its possible isnt it minna this girl is crazy the baron sputtered you must know i deny absolutely that i was in that apartment that night syd said you admit you ran after ted but from where the apartment because hed seen you pushing leila it would have been a stroke of luck if he was so traumatized that he blocked it out the baron claims he heard leila and ted quarreling but i heard them too i was on the telephone and i did not hear what he claims he heard elizabeth leaned her elbows on the table and looked searchingly from one angry face to the next im very grateful for this information henry bartlett told her but you seem to have forgotten theres a new witness a very convenient new witness elizabeth said i spoke to the district attorney this afternoon this witness turns out not to be very bright the night he claims he was in that apartment watching ted drop leila off the terrace he was in jail she stood up craig would you walk me to my place ive got to finish packing and i want to get a swim in it may be a long time before im here again if ever outside the darkness was now absolute the moon and stars were again covered with a misty fog the japanese lanterns in the trees and bushes were hazy dots of light craig put his arm around her shoulders that was quite a performance he said it was just that a performance i cant prove anything if they stick together there isnt a shred of evidence do you have any more of those letters that leila was receiving no i was bluffing about that thats a shocker about the new witness i was bluffing about that too he was in jail that evening but he was released on bond at eight oclock leila died at nine thirtyone the most they can do is cast doubt on his credibility she leaned against him as they reached her bungalow oh craig its all so crazy isnt it i feel as if im digging and digging for the vein of truth the way the old prospectors dug for a vein of gold the only trouble is im out of time so i had to start blasting but at the very least i may have upset one of them enough so that heor shewill make a slip his hand smoothed her hair youre going back tomorrow yes how about you ted still hasnt turned up he may be on a bender i cant say i blame him though it wouldnt be like him obviously well wait for him but when this is over when youre readypromise that youll call me and get your japanesehouseboy imitation on the recorder oh i forgot you said you changed it why did you do that craig i always thought it was pretty funny so did leila he looked embarrassed she did not wait for him to answer this place used to be such fun elizabeth murmured remember when leila invited you here that first time before ted came of course i remember how did you meet leila i forget she was staying at the beverly winters i sent flowers to her suite she called to thank me and we had a drink she was on her way here and she invited me along and then she met ted elizabeth kissed his cheek pray that whatever ive done tonight works if ted is innocent i want him off just as badly as you do i know you do youre in love with him arent you i have been from that first day you introduced him to leila and me inside the bungalow elizabeth put on her swimsuit and robe she went to the desk and wrote a long letter addressed to scott alshorne then she rang for the maid it was a new girl one shed never seen before but she had to take the chance she put the envelope for scott inside a new one and scribbled a brief note give this to vicky in the morning she instructed the girl no one else is that clear of course the girl was slightly offended thank you elizabeth watched the girl leave and wondered what she would say if she could have read the note to vicky it read in case of my death deliver this to sheriff alshorne immediately at eight oclock ted walked into a private room in the monterey peninsula hospital dr whitley introduced a psychiatrist who was waiting to administer the injection a video camera had already been set up scott and a deputy sheriff were to be witnesses to the statements given under sodium pentothal i still think you ought to have your lawyer here scott told him ted was grimfaced bartlett has been the very one urging me not to undergo this test i dont intend to waste any more time talking about it let the truth come out he slipped his feet out of his shoes and lay down on the contour couch a few minutes after the injection had taken effect he began to answer questions about the last hour he spent with leila she kept accusing me of cheating on her had pictures of me with other women group pictures i told her that that was part of my job the hotels i was never with any woman alone i tried to reason with her she had been drinking all day i was drinking with her sick of it i warned her she had to trust me i couldnt face those scenes the rest of my life she told me she knew i was trying to break off with her leila leila she went wild i tried to calm her down she scratched my hands the phone rang it was elizabeth leila kept shouting at me i got out went to my apartment downstairs looked at myself in the mirror blood on my cheek on my hands tried to phone craig knew i couldnt live like that anymore knew it was over but thought maybe leila would do something to herself better stay with her till i can get elizabeth god im so drunk the elevator leilas floor door open leila screaming scott leaned forward intently what is she screaming ted dont dont ted was trembling shaking his head his expression shocked and disbelieving ted what do you see what happened push door open room is dark the terrace leila hold on hold on help her christ grab her dont let her fall dont let mommy fall ted began to sobdeep racking sounds that filled the room his body twitched convulsively ted who did that to her hands just see hands shes gone its my father his words became broken leilas dead daddy pushed her daddy killed her the psychiatrist looked at scott you wont get any more now either thats all he knows or he still cant bring himself to face the entire truth thats what im afraid of scott whispered how soon will he come out of it pretty fast hed better rest awhile john whitley stood up i want to look in on mrs meehan ill be right back id like to go with you the cameraman was packing his equipment drop the tape in my office scott told him he turned to his deputy stay here dont let mr winters leave the head nurse in the icu was visibly excited we were just about to send for you doctor mrs meehan seems to be coming out of the coma she said voices again willy meehans face was alive with hope just as clear i dont know what she meant but she knew what she was trying to say does that mean shes out of danger scott asked dr whitley john whitley studied the chart and reached for alvirahs pulse his answer was low enough that willy meehan could not hear him not necessarily but it sure is a good sign whatever prayers you know start saying them now alvirahs lids fluttered open she was looking straight ahead and as her eyes focused they rested on scott a look of urgency came over her face voices she whispered wasnt scott bent over her mrs meehan i dont understand alvirah felt the way she did when she used to clean old mrs smythes house mrs smythe was always telling her to push the piano out and get at the dust behind it it was like trying to push the piano but so much more important she wanted to tell them who had hurt her but she couldnt think of his name she could see him plain as plain but she couldnt remember his name desperately she tried to communicate with the sheriff wasnt the doctor did that to me wasnt his voice someone else she closed her eyes and felt herself slipping into sleep shes getting better willy meehan whispered exultantly shes trying to tell you something wasnt the doctor wasnt his voice what the hell did she mean scott asked himself he rushed to the room where ted was waiting ted was sitting up now in the small plastic armchair his hands folded in front of him i opened the door he said tonelessly hands were holding leila over the railing i could just see the white satin billowing her arms were flailing you couldnt see who was holding her it was so fast i think i tried to call out and then she was gone and whoever it was just disappeared he must have run along the terrace have you any idea of his size no it was as if i was watching my father when he did that to my mother i even saw my fathers face he looked up at scott and i havent helped you or myself have i no you havent scott said bluntly i want a free association from you voices say the first thing that comes into your mind identification go on unique personal go on ted shrugged mrs meehan she brought up the subject repeatedly she apparently had some idea of taking elocution lessons and she got everyone into a discussion about accents and voices scott thought of alvirahs broken whisper wasnt the doctor wasnt his voice mentally he reviewed the dinnerconversation tapes alvirah had recorded identification unique personal the barons voice on that last tape he drew in his breath sharply ted do you remember what else mrs meehan said about voices something about craig imitating yours ted frowned she asked me about a story shed read years ago in peoplethat craig used to field my phone calls at the fraternity house and the girls couldnt tell the difference between our voices i told her it was true in school craig used to bring down the house with his imitations and she tried to make him demonstrate it for her but he refused scott saw teds look of surprise and shook his head impatiently never mind how i know thats what elizabeth wanted me to catch when i listened to those tapes i dont know what youre talking about mrs meehan kept pestering craig to imitate your voice dont you see he didnt want anyone to think about his being a good mimic elizabeths testimony against you is based solely on hearing your voice elizabeth suspects him but if shes tipped her hand hell go after her a wild sense of urgency made him grab teds arm come on he shouted weve got to get to the spa on the way out he yelled instructions at the deputy call elizabeth lange at the cypress point spa tell her to stay in her room with her door locked send another car over there he ran through the lobby ted at his heels in his car scott turned on the siren its too late for you he thought as his mind filled with the image of the murderer killing elizabeth wont help you anymore the car raced along the highway between salinas and pebble beach scott fired instructions into the twoway radio as ted listened the full impact of what he was hearing penetrated his consciousness the hands that had held leila over the terrace became arms a shoulder as familiar as his own and the realization of elizabeth s danger made him jam his feet on the floor of the car in a futile effort to make contact with an imaginary accelerator had she been toying with him of course she had but like the others she had underestimated him and like the others she would pay for it with methodical calm he stripped off his clothes and unlocked his suitcase the mask was on top of the wet suit and tank it amused him to remember how at the last moment sammy had seen his eyes through the mask and known when hed called to her in teds voice she had run to him all the evidence hadnt in the end turned her against ted and all the overwhelming evidence he had so carefully laid out even the new eyewitness he had planted hadnt convinced elizabeth the wet suit was cumbersome when this was over hed get rid of all this equipment just in case anyone questioned elizabeth s death it wouldnt be wise to have any visible reminder that he was an expert scuba diver ted of course should remember but in all these months it hadnt crossed teds mind that he had the special ability to mimic him ted so stupid so naive i tried to phone you i remember that distinctly and so ted had become his impeccable alibi until that nosy bitchalvirah meehan kept after him let me hear you imitate teds voice just once please say anything at all hed wanted to throttle her but then had had to wait until yesterday when he went ahead of her to treatment room c waited in the closet for her the hypodermic needle in his hand too bad she didnt know shed sampled his gift for mimicry when she thought she was listening to the baron the wet suit was on he strapped the tank to his back turned off the lights and waited it still chilled him to realize that last night hed been within seconds of opening the door and confronting ted ted had wanted to talk everything through im beginning to think youre my only real friend hed said he opened the door a crack and listened there was no one in sight no sound of footsteps the fog was gathering and it would be easy to slip behind the trees until he reached the pool he had to get there before her be waiting and when she swam past grab the whistle before she could get it to her lips he slipped out his footsteps noiseless as he cut across the path avoiding the areas where the lanterns sent out beams of light if only hed been able to finish this on monday night but ted had been standing near the pool watching elizabeth ted always in the way always the one with money and looks always the one the girls flocked around hed forced himself to accept it to make himself useful to ted first in college then inthe office the gofer the tenacious assistant hed had to fight his way up until the executiveplane accident had instantly made him teds right hand and then when ted lost kathy and teddy hed been able to take over the reins of the company until leila his loins ached remembering leila how it had felt to make love to her until hed brought her here and shed met ted and discarded him like garbage tossed into a bin he had watched those slim arms slide around teds neck that wanton body snuggling against ted had helplessly walked away not able to bear the sight of them together planning revenge waiting for the time and hed found it with the play hed had to prove investing in the play was a mistake it was already clear that ted was beginning to ease him out and it was his chance to destroy leila the exquisite pleasure of sending those letters of watching her fall apart shed even shown them to him as she received them hed warned her to burn them to hide them from ted and elizabeth teds getting awfully sick of your jealousy and if you tell elizabeth how upset you are shell quit her play to be with you that could ruin her career grateful for his advice leila had agreed but tell me shed begged is it true bulldog is there someone else his elaborate protests had had the effect he wanted shed believed the letters he hadnt worried about those last two hed thought all that unopened mail had been thrown out but it hadnt mattered cheryl burned one and he had taken the other one from sammy everything was at last working for him on saturday he would become chairman and president of winters enterprises he was at the pool he slipped into the dark water and swam to the shallow end elizabeth always dived into the deepest area that night in elaines hed known the time had come to kill leila everyone would believe it was a suicide hed let himself in through one of the guest suites on the upper floor of the duplex and listened to them quarrel listened when ted stormed out and then the idea had come to mimic teds voice to make elizabeth think ted was with leila just before she died he heard the sound of footsteps on the path she was coming soon he would be safe in those weeks after leilas death hed thought he had lost ted hadnt fallen apart hed turned to elizabeth the death had been considered an accident until that unbelievable stroke of luck when that crazy woman had come forward and said she had seen ted struggling with leila and elizabeth had become the chief witness it was destined to be this way now the baron and syd had become material witnesses against ted the baron wouldnt be able to deny that he had heard ted struggling with leila syd had seen ted on the street even ted himself must have glimpsed them on the terrace and because he was drunk and it was dark relived that episode with his father the footsteps were getting closer he allowed himself to sink to the bottom of the pool she was so sure of herself so clever waiting for him to come anxious for him to attack her ready to outswim him while she blew the whistle and called for help she wouldnt get the chance it was ten oclock and there was a difference in the atmosphere of the spa many of the bungalows were already dark and elizabeth wondered how many people had actually checked out the talkshow host was gone the countess and her friends must have left before dinner the tennis player and his girlfriend had not been in the dining room evening fog had settled in heavy penetrating enveloping even the japanese lanterns along the path seemed hooded she dropped her robe by the side of the pool and looked carefully into the water it was absolutely still there was no one here yet she felt for the whistle around her neck all she would need was to be able to put her lips to it a blast from this whistle would bring help she dived in the water felt clammy tonight or was it because she was afraid i can outswim anyone she reassured herself i had to take this chance its the only way would the bait be taken voices alvirah meehan had been persistent on that subject that persistence might have cost her her life that was what she had been trying to tell them shed known it wasnt helmuts voice shed reached the north end of the pool she flipped over and began to backstroke voices it was her identification of teds voice that had placed him in that room with leila a few minutes before her death the night leila died craig had claimed to be in his apartment watching a television show when ted tried to call him no one had questioned that craig was home ted had been his alibi voices craig wanted ted to be convicted ted was about to turn over the running of winters enterprises to him when she asked craig about changing the message on his recorder had she frightened him enough to force him into an overt attack elizabeth began a freestyle breaststroke from beneath her arms encircled her pinning her own arms to her sides her startled gasp caused her to swallow a mouthful of water choking furiously she felt herself being dragged to the bottom of the pool she began to beat with her heels but they slipped off the heavy rubber wet suit of her assailant with a desperate burst of strength she dug her elbows deep into the ribs of her captor for an instant the grip relaxed and she began to rise to the surface just as her face emerged as she managed to gulp one breath of air and fumble for the whistle the arms enclosed her again and she slipped downward through the dark waters of the pool eleven after kathy and teddy died i went to pieces it was as if ted were talking to himself not scott the car raced past the gate to pebble beach without stopping the roaring siren shattered the peace of the surroundings the headlights opened only a few feet of visibility in the deepening fog craig took over running the whole business he liked it there were times when hed answer and say he was me imitate my voice i finally told him to cut it out then he met leila first i took her away the reason i was so busy those months before leila died i was starting to reorganize i intended to deemphasize his job split his responsibilities with two other men he knew what was happening and hes the one who hired the detective to follow that first witness the detective who was so conveniently there to make sure the new witness didnt get away they were on the grounds of the spa scott drove the car across the lawn and stopped in front of elizabeth s bungalow the maid rushed from her station ted was banging on the door where is elizabeth i dont know the maid said her voice faltering she gave me a letter she didnt say she was going out let me see the letter i dont think give me the letter scott read the note to vicky ripped open the letter addressed to him and began to read where is she ted demanded oh god that crazy kid the pool scott snapped the pool the car smashed through hedges and flower beds and roared toward the north end of the property inside the bungalows lights began to go on they reached the patio the fender of the car caught the edge of an umbrella table knocking it over the car stopped at the edge of the pool scott left the headlights on and they shone over the water waves of the gathering fog shimmered in the lights they peered down into the pool theres no one here scott said a terrible fear grabbed at him were they too late ted was pointing at bubbles floating to the surface shes down there kicking off his shoes he dived into the pool he touched bottom and came up get help he yelled he went down again and again scott scrabbled in the glove compartment for his flashlight grabbed it and saw a figure in a scubadiving outfit begin to climb the ladder out of the pool drawing his pistol he rushed toward the ladder in a swift violent gesture the scuba diver lunged forward and butted him the gun fell from scotts hand as he slammed backward onto the patio ted resurfaced he was holding a limp figure in his arms he began to swim toward the ladder and as scott dazedly pulled himself to a sitting position the scuba diver fell backward onto ted dragging him and elizabeth under the surface gasping for breath scott reached out a groping hand his numbed fingers closed around his gun pointing it upward he fired two shots and was rewarded by the insistent sound of sirens racing toward him ted desperately tried to hold on to elizabeth with one arm as he pummeled his attacker with the other his lungs were bursting he was still groggy from the effects of the sodium pentothal he felt himself losing consciousness futilely he tried to punch the thick rubber suit his blows fell harmlessly on the solid massive chest the oxygen mask he had to pull it off he let go of elizabeth trying with all his strength to push her toward the surface for a moment the grip on him relaxed a hand stretched past him reaching to drag elizabeth back it gave him the chance to grab at the face mask but before he could pull it off a vicious shove sent him reeling backward she had held her breath forcing herself to resist inhaling she made herself go limp there was no way she could get away from him her only hope was that he would think she was unconscious and leave her even from the feel of the arms that pinned her she knew it was craig she had forced him into the openbut now he would get away again she was slipping into unconsciousness hold on she thought no it was leila telling her to hold on sparrow this is what ive been trying to tell you dont let me down now he thinks hes safe you can do it sparrow she felt the arms begin to release her she was drifting down trying to resist the impulse to fight her way to the surface wait sparrow wait dont let him see youre still conscious and then she had felt someone grabbing her pulling her up other arms arms that held her to him cradled her ted she felt the night air on her face gasped in one shuddering breath as his arm around her neck he dragged her along the top of the pool heard his own breath straining choking drowning out the sounds she was making and then she felt before she saw the heavy figure bear down on them and managed to pull in one great gulp of air before the water again covered her face teds arm tightened she felt him flailing out craig was trying to kill both of them nothing mattered to craig except to destroy them now the water pressed against her eardrums she could not fight teds grip she felt the push as he tried to shove her toward the surface felt craigs grasp on her ankle and managed to kick it away on the surface she could see the cars pulling up hear the shouts elizabeth gulped in air once twice filled her lungs and then dived down down to where ted was fighting for his life she knew where craig was the arc of her descent was directly over his head he was squeezing teds neck she reached both hands down lights were beaming over the water she could see the silhouette of craigs arms the desperate struggle of teds body she would have only one chance now she kickeda sharp cutting movement of her legs she was directly over craig in a savage thrust she managed to get her fingers under his face mask he reached up and she recoiled from the shove that made her head snap backward but held on to the mask held on until she had wrenched it away from his face she held it while he groped for it while his arms grabbed her body while he tried to pull it from her held it until she felt him being pulled away from her held it until lungs bursting she found herself being hauled to the surface still in his grasp she could breathe at last she choked in great gulping sobs as ted finally relinquished his grip on craig to the policemen who surrounded them in the water then like two figures drawn by an irresistible magnetic force she and ted drifted to each other and clinging together made their way to the ladder at the end of the pool friday september quote for the day for love and beauty and delight there is no death nor change shelley dear spa guests some of you will be leaving us today remember our only concern has been you your wellbeing your health your beauty go into the world knowing that you have been loved and cared for here at cypress point spa that we are longing for your return soon our magnificent roman bathhouse will be completed it will be the unparalleled and consummate experience there will be separate hours for the women and men except between four and six when we shall enjoy mixed bathing in the european fashion a very special delight indeed hurry back for another retreat into pampering and healthawareness in the serene atmosphere of cypress point spa baron and baroness helmut von schreiber one the morning dawned clear and bright the earlymorning fog evaporated with the bright warmth of a glowing sun sea gulls and blackbirds swept high over the surf and returned to perch on the rocky dunes at cypress point spa the remaining guests followed their schedules water classes were held in the olympic pool masseurs kneaded muscles and pounded layers of fat pampered bodies were wrapped in herbalscented sheets the business of beauty and luxury continued to function scott had asked min and helmut syd and cheryl elizabeth and ted to meet him at eleven they gathered in the music salon the door closed removed from the eyes and ears of the curious guests and staff elizabeth remembered the rest of the night as a blur ted holding her someone wrapping the robe around her dr whitley ordering her to bed ted knocked at the door of her bungalow at ten of eleven they walked up the path together hands entwined not needing to say what was between them min and the baron sat side by side mins face was weary but somehow more at peace elizabeth thought there was something of the old min in the steely determination in her eyes the baron still so absolutely perfect in every hair on his head his sport shirt resting on him with the ease of an ermine robe his posture aloof his assurance regained for him too the night had exorcised demons cheryls eyes moved restlessly toward ted narrowed when they found his face with her sharptipped tongue she licked her lips like a cat about to pounce on a forbidden dish of cream next to her syd lounged there was something about him that had been missing the casual confidence of success ted sat beside her his arm thrown over the back of her chair his manner protective and watchful as though he feared she would slip away from him i think weve come to the end of the road the fatigue in scotts voice suggested that he had not spent the long hours of the night in bed craig has retained henry bartlett who urged him not to make a statement however when i read elizabeth s letter to him he admitted everything let me read that letter to you now scott pulled it from his pocket dear scott there is only one way i can prove what i suspect and im about to do that now it may not work but if anything happens to me i think it will be because craig has decided im coming too close to the truth tonight i practically accused syd and the baron of causing leilas death i hope that will be sufficient bait to make craig feel secure in attempting to harm me i believe it will happen at the pool i think he was there the other night i can only rely on the fact that i can outswim anyone and if he tries to attack me he will have exposed himself if he succeeds go after himfor me and for leila by now you will have heard the tapes have you caught how upset he sounded when alvirah meehan was asking so many questions he tried to cut ted off when ted said that craig could fool people by imitating him i thought i heard ted shout at leila to put the phone down i thought i heard her say youre not a falcon but leila was sobbing thats why i misunderstood helmut was nearby he heard her say youre not falcon he heard accurately i did not that tape of alvirah meehan in the treatment room listen carefully that first voice it sounds like the baron but theres something wrong i think it was craig imitating the barons voice scott theres no proof of any of this the only proof will be obtained if craig has found me too dangerous well see what happens there is one thing i know and probably have always known in my heart ted is incapable of murder and i dont care how many witnesses come forward to claim they saw him kill leila elizabeth scott put down the letter and looked sternly at elizabeth i wish you had trusted me to help you you almost lost your life it was the only way elizabeth said but what did he do to mrs meehan an insulin injection as you know during college he worked summers at the hospital in hanover he picked up a lot of medical knowledge those years but initially the insulin wasnt meant for alvirah meehan scott looked at elizabeth he had become convinced you were dangerous he had planned to find a way to do away with you in new york this week before the trial but when ted decided to come here craig persuaded min to invite you too he persuaded her that you might back off from testifying against ted once you saw him what he wanted was a chance to arrange an accident alvirah meehan became a threat he already had the means to get rid of her scott stood up and now im going home at the door he paused just one last observation id like to make you baron and you syd were willing to obstruct justice when you thought ted was guilty by taking the law into your own hands you did him no favors and may indirectly have been responsible for sammys death and mrs meehans attack min jumped up if they had come forward last year ted might very well have been persuaded to plead guilty ted should be grateful to them are you grateful min cheryl asked i gather the baron did write the play you not only married nobility a doctor an interior designer but also an author you must be thrilledand broke i married a renaissance man min told her the baron will resume a full schedule of operations at the clinic ted has promised us a loan all will be well helmut kissed her hand again elizabeth was reminded of a little boy smiling up at his mother min sees him now for what he is she thought hed be lost without her it cost her a million dollars to find that out but maybe shell decide it was worth it incidentally scott added mrs meehan is going to make it we can thank dr von schreibers emergency treatment for that ted and elizabeth followed him out try to put it behind you scott told them i have a hunch things are going to be a lot better for you two from now on they already are teds voice was firm two the noon sun was high overhead the breeze was coming gently from the pacific bringing the scent of the sea even the azaleas that had been crushed by the patrol cars seemed to be trying to struggle back the cypress trees grotesque in the night seemed familiar and comforting under the splendid sunshine together elizabeth and ted watched scott drive away then turned to face each other it really is over ted said elizabeth im just starting to realize it i can breathe again im not going to wake up in the middle of the night and wonder about living in a cell about losing everything in life i value i want to get to work again i want his arms went around her i want you go ahead sparrow this time its right no dillydallying do as i tell you youre perfect for each other elizabeth smiled up at ted she put her hands on his face and brought his lips to hers she could almost hear leila singing again as she had so long ago weep no more my lady
