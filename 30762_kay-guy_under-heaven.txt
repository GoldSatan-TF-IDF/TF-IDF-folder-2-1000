jadeandgold and the whirling dust of xinan he had often stayed awake all night among friends drinking spiced wine in the north district with the courtesans they would listen to flute or pipa music and declaim poetry test each other with jibes and quotes sometimes find a private room with a scented silken woman before weaving unsteadily home after the dawn drums sounded curfews end to sleep away the day instead of studying here in the mountains alone in hard clear air by the waters of kuala nor far to the west of the imperial city beyond the borders of the empire even tai was in a narrow bed by darkfall under the first brilliant stars and awake at sunrise in spring and summer the birds woke him this was a place where thousands upon thousands nested noisily fishhawks and cormorants wild geese and cranes the geese made him think of friends far away wild geese were a symbol of absence in poetry in life cranes were fidelity another matter in winter the cold was savage it could take the breath away the north wind when it blew was an assault outdoors and even through the cabin walls he slept under layers of fur and sheepskin and no birds woke him at dawn from the icebound nesting grounds on the far side of the lake the ghosts were outside in all seasons moonlit nights and dark as soon as the sun went down tai knew some of their voices now the angry ones and the lost ones and those in whose thin stretched crying there was only pain they didnt frighten him not any more hed thought he might die of terror in the beginning alone in those first nights here with the dead he would look out through an unshuttered window on a spring or summer or autumn night but he never went outside under moon or stars the world by the lake belonged to the ghosts or so he had come to understand he had set himself a routine from the start to deal with solitude and fear and the enormity of where he was some holy men and hermits in their mountains and forests might deliberately act otherwise going through days like leaves blown defined by the absence of will or desire but his was a different nature and he wasnt holy he did begin each morning with the prayers for his father he was still in the formal mourning period and his selfimposed task by this distant lake had everything to do with respect for his fathers memory after the invocations which he assumed his brothers were also performing in the home where theyd all been born tai would go out into the mountain meadow shades of green dotted with wildflowers or crunching underfoot with ice and snow andunless there was a stormhe would do his kanlin exercises no sword then one sword then both he would look at the cold waters of the lake with the small isle in the middle of it then up at the surrounding snowdraped stupefying mountains piled upon each other beyond the northern peaks the land sloped downwards for hundreds of li towards the long dunes of the killing deserts with the silk roads running around either side of them bringing so much wealth to the court to the empire of kitai to his people in winter he fed and watered his small shaggy horse in the shed built against his cabin when the weather turned and the grass returned hed let the horse graze during the day it was placid wasnt about to run away there was nowhere to run after his exercises he would try to let stillness enter into him a shedding of the chaos of life ambition and aspiration to make himself worthy of this chosen labour and then he would set to work burying the dead hed never from first arrival here made any effort to separate kitan from taguran soldiers they were tangled together strewn or piled skulls and white bones flesh gone to earth or to animals and carrion birds long since orfor those of the most recent campaignnot so very long ago it had been a triumph that last conflict though bitterly hardwon forty thousand dead in one battle almost as many kitan as taguran his father had been in that war a general honoured afterwards with a proud title left side commander of the pacified west rewarded handsomely by the son of heaven for victory a personal audience in the hall of brilliance in the taming palace when he returned back east the purple sash presented words of commendation spoken directly a jade gift extended from the emperors hand only one intermediary his family were undeniably beneficiaries of what had happened by this lake tais mother and second mother had burnt incense together lit candles of thanksgiving to ancestors and gods but for general shen gao the memory of the fighting here had been until hed died two years ago a source of pride and sorrow intermingled marking him forever after too many men had lost their lives for a lake on the border of nowhere one that would not in the event be held by either empire the treaty that had followedaffirmed with elaborate exchanges and rituals and for the first time a kitan princess for the taguran kinghad established as much hearing the number from that battleforty thousand deadtai when young had been unable to even picture what it must have been like that wasnt the case any more the lake and meadow lay between lonely forts watched by both empires from days awayto the south for tagur east for kitai it was always silent here now save for the sound of wind the crying of birds in season and the ghosts general shen had spoken of sorrow and guilt only to his younger sons never to the oldest such feelings in a commander could be seen as shameful even treasonous a denial of the emperors wisdom ruling with the mandate of heaven unfailing unable to fail or his throne and the empire would be at risk but the thoughts had been spoken more than once after shen gaos retirement to the family property on their southflowing stream near the wai river usually after wine on a quiet day with leaves or lotus blossoms falling in the water to drift downstream and the memory of those words was the principal reason his second son was here for the mourning period instead of at home you could argue that the generals quiet sadness had been wrong misplaced that the battle here had been in necessary defence of the empire it was important to remember that it hadnt always been the armies of kitai triumphing over the tagurans the kings of tagur on their distant completely defended plateau were hugely ambitious victory and savagery had gone both ways through a hundred and fifty years of fighting by kuala nor beyond iron gate pass which was in itself as isolated a fortress as the empire knew a thousand miles of moonlight falling east of iron sima zian the banished immortal had written it wasnt literally true but anyone who had ever been at iron gate fortress knew what the poet meant and tai was several days ride west of the fort beyond that last outpost of empire with the dead with the lost crying at night and the bones of over a hundred thousand soldiers lying white in falling moonlight or under the sun sometimes in bed in the mountain dark he would belatedly realize that a voice whose cadences he knew had fallen silent and he would understand that hed laid those bones to rest there were too many it was beyond hope to ever finish this it was a task for gods descending from the nine heavens not for one man but if you couldnt do everything did that mean you did nothing for two years now shen tai had offered what passed for his own answer to that in memory of his fathers voice asking quietly for another cup of wine watching large slow goldfish and drifting flowers in the pond the dead were everywhere here even on the isle there had been a fort there a small one rubble now hed tried to imagine the fighting sweeping that way boats swiftly built on the pebbled shore with wood from the slopes the desperate trapped defenders of one army or the other depending on the year firing last arrows at implacable enemies bringing death across the lake to them he had chosen to begin there two years ago rowing the small craft hed found and repaired a spring day when the lake mirrored blue heaven and the mountains the isle was a defined ground limited less overwhelming in the mainland meadow and far into the pine woods the dead lay strewn as far as he could walk in a long day for a little more than half the year under this high fierce sky he was able to dig bury broken rusted weapons with the bones it was brutally hard work he grew leathery muscled callused ached at night fell wearily into bed after washing in water warmed at his fire from late fall through the winter into early spring the ground was frozen impossible you could break your heart trying to dig a grave in his first year the lake froze he could walk across to the isle for a few weeks the second winter was milder and it did not freeze over muffled in furs then hooded and gloved in a white hollow stillness seeing the puffs of his mortal breath feeling small against the towering hostile vastness all around tai took the boat out on days when waves and weather allowed he offered the dead to the dark waters with a prayer that they might not lie lost any longer unconsecrated on windscoured ground here by kuala nors cold shore among the wild animals and far from any home war had not been continuous it never was anywhere and particularly not in a mountain bowl so remote so difficult for sustained supply lines from either country however belligerent or ambitious kings and emperors might be as a consequence there had been cabins built by fishermen or by the herders who grazed sheep and goats in these high meadows in the intervals when soldiers werent dying here most of the cabins had been destroyed a few had not tai lived in one of them set north against a pinetreed slopeshelter from the worst winds the cabin was almost a hundred years old he had set about repairing it as best he could when hed first come roof door and window frames shutters the stone chimney for the fire then hed had help unexpected unsolicited the world could bring you poison in a jewelled cup or surprising gifts sometimes you didnt know which of them it was someone he knew had written a poem around that thought he was lying awake now middle of a spring night there was a full moon shining which meant that the tagurans would be with him by late morning a half dozen of them bringing supplies in a bullock cart down a slope from the south and around the lakes level shore to his cabin the morning after the new moon was when his own people came from the east through the ravine from iron gate it had taken a little time in the period after hed arrived but a routine had been arranged that let them each come to him without having to see the other it was not part of his purpose to have men die because he was here there was a peace now signed with gifts exchanged and a princess but such truths didnt always prevail when young aggressive soldiers met in faraway placesand young men could start wars the two forts treated tai like a holy hermit or a fool choosing to live among the ghosts they conducted a tacit almost an amusing warfare with each other through him vying to offer more generosity every month to be of greater aid tais own people had laid flooring in his cabin in the first summer bringing cut and sanded planks in a cart the tagurans had taken over the chimney repair ink and pens and paper requested came from iron gate wine had first come from the south both fortresses had men chop wood whenever they were here winter fur and sheepskin had been brought for his bedding for clothes hed been given a goat for milk and then a second one from the other side and an eccentriclooking but very warm taguran hat with flaps for the ears and a tie for knotting under his chin the first autumn the iron gate soldiers had built a small shed for his small horse hed tried to stop this but hadnt come close to persuading anyone and eventually hed understood it wasnt about kindness to the madman or even entirely about besting each other the less time he spent on food firewood maintaining the cabin the more he could devote to his task which no one had ever done before and which seemedonce theyd accepted why he was hereto matter to the tagurans as much as to his own people you could find irony in this tai often thought they might goad and kill each other even now if they chanced to arrive at the same time and only a genuine fool would think the battles in the west were over for good but the two empires would honour his laying the dead to restuntil there were newer ones in bed on a mild night he listened to the wind and the ghosts awakened not by either of them not any more but by the brilliant white of the moon shining he couldnt see the star of the weaver maid now exiled from her mortal lover on the far side of the sky river it had been bright enough to show clearly in the window before even with a full moon he remembered a poem hed liked when he was younger built around an image of the moon carrying messages between the lovers across the river if he considered it now it seemed contrived a showy conceit many celebrated verses from early in this ninth dynasty were like that if you looked closely at their elaborate verbal brocades there was some sadness in how that could happen tai thought falling out of love with something that had shaped you or even people who had but if you didnt change at least a little where were the passages of a life didnt learning changing sometimes mean letting go of what had once been seen as true it was very bright in the room almost enough to pull him from bed to window to look out on the tall grass at what silver did to green but he was tired he was always tired at the end of a day and he never went out from the cabin at night he didnt fear the ghosts any morethey saw him as an emissary by now hed decided not an intruder from the livingbut he left them the world after the sun went down in winter he had to swing the rebuilt shutters closed block chinks in the walls as best he could with cloth and sheepskin against the winds and snow the cabin would become smoky lit by the fire and candles or one of his two lamps if he was struggling to write poetry he warmed wine on a brazier this also from the tagurans when spring came he opened the shutters let in the sun or starlight and the moon and then the sound of birds at dawn on first awakening tonight he had been disoriented confused tangled in a last dream hed thought it was still winter that the brilliant silver he saw was ice or frost gleaming he had smiled after a moment returning to awareness wry and amused he had a friend in xinan who would have cherished this moment it wasnt often that you lived the imagery of wellknown lines before my bed the light is so bright it looks like a layer of frost lifting my head i gaze at the moon lying back down i think of home but maybe he was wrong maybe if a poem was true enough then sooner or later some of those who read it would live the image just as he was living it now or maybe some readers had the image before they even came to the poem and found it waiting for them there an affirmation the poet offering words for thoughts theyd held already and sometimes poetry gave you new dangerous ideas sometimes men were exiled or killed for what they wrote you could mask a dangerous comment by setting a poem in the first or third dynasty hundreds of years ago sometimes that convention worked but not always the senior mandarins of the civil service were not fools lying back down i think of home home was the property near the wai where his father was buried in their orchard with both his parents and the three children who had not survived to adulthood where tais mother and shen gaos concubine the woman they called second mother still lived where his two brothers were also nearing the end of mourningthe older one would be returning to the capital soon he wasnt sure where his sister was women had only ninety days of mourning limei was probably back with the empress wherever she was the empress might not be at court her time in the taming had been rumoured to be ending even two years ago someone else was in the palace now with emperor taizu someone shining like a gem there were many who disapproved there was no one as far as tai knew who had said as much openly before tai had left to go home and then come here he found his thoughts drifting back to xinan from memories of the family compound by the stream where the paulownia leaves fell along the path from the front gate all at once in one autumn night each year where peaches and plums and apricots grew in the orchard flowers red in spring and you could smell the charcoal burning at the forests edge see smoke from village hearths beyond the chestnut and mulberry trees no now he was remembering the capital instead all glitter and colour and noise where violent life in all its worlddust and worldfury was happening unfolding would be erupting even now in the middle of night assaulting the senses moment by moment two million people the centre of the world under heaven it wouldnt be dark there not in xinan the lights of men could almost hide moonlight there would be torches and lanterns fixed or carried in bamboo frames or suspended from the litters borne through the streets carrying the highborn and the powerful thered be red candles in upper windows and lamps hanging from flowerdecked balconies in the north district white lights in the palace and wide shallow oil lamps on pillars twice the height of a man in courtyards there burning all night long there would be music and glory heartbreak and hearts ease and knives or swords drawn sometimes in the lanes and alleys and come morning power and passion and death all over again jostling each other in the two great deafening markets in wine shops and study halls twisted streets shaped for furtive love or murder and stunningly wide ones in bedrooms and courtyards elaborate private gardens and flowerfilled public parks where willows drooped over streams and the deepdredged artificial lakes he remembered long lake park south of the rammedearth city walls remembered with whom hed been there last in peachblossom time before his father died on one of the three days each month she was allowed out of the north district eighth eighteenth twentyeighth she was a long way off wild geese were the emblems of separation he thought of the taming the whole palace complex north of the city walls of the son of heaven no longer young and of those with him and around him there eunuchs and nine ranks of mandarins tais older brother one of them princes and alchemists and army leaders and the one almost surely lying with him tonight under this moon who was young and almost unbearably beautiful and had changed the empire tai had aspired to be one of those civil servants with access to palace and court swimming within the current as the phrase went he had studied a full year in the capital between encounters with courtesans and winecup friends had been on the brink of writing the threeday exams for the imperial service the test that determined your future then his father had died by their quiet stream and two and a half years of official mourning came and went from you like a rainwind down a river a man was lashedtwenty with the heavy rodfor failing to perform the withdrawal and rituals due to parents when they died you could say some would say he had failed in the rites by being here in the mountains and not at home but hed spoken with the subprefect before riding this long way west and had received permission he was alsooverwhelminglystill withdrawn from society from anything that could be called ambition or worldliness there was some risk in what hed done there was always danger when it came to what might be whispered at the ministry of rites which supervised the examinations eliminating a rival one way or another was as basic a tactic as there was but tai thought he had protected himself you could never truly know of course not in xinan ministers were appointed and exiled generals and military governors promoted then demoted or ordered to kill themselves and the court had been changing swiftly in the time before hed left but tai hadnt had a position yet it wasnt as if hed risked anything in the way of office or rank and he thought he could survive the whipping rod if it came to that he tried to decide now in a moonlit cabin wrapped in solitude like a silkworm during its fourth sleep how much he really missed the capital if he was ready to go back resume all as before or if it was time for yet another change he knew what people would say if he did make a change what was already said about general shens second son first son liu was known and understood his ambition and achievement fitting a pattern the third son was still young little more than a child it was tai the second who raised more questions than anything else mourning would be formally over at the seventh months full moon he would have completed the rites in his own fashion he could resume his studies prepare for the next set of examinations that was what men did scholars wrote the civil service tests five times ten more some died without ever passing them forty to sixty men succeeded each year of the thousands who began the process with the preliminary tests in their own prefectures the final examination was begun in the presence of the emperor himself in his white robe and black hat and the yellow belt of highest ceremony an elaborate passage of initiationwith bribery and corruption in the process as always in xinan how could it be otherwise the capital seemed to have entered his silvered cabin now driving sleep farther away with memories of a brawling buffeting tumult that never wholly stopped at any hour vendors and buyers shouting in the markets beggars and tumblers and fortune tellers hired mourners following a funeral with their hair unbound horses and carts rumbling through dark and day the muscled bearers of sedan chairs screaming at pedestrians to make way whipping them aside with bamboo rods the gold bird guards with their own whipping rods at every major intersection clearing the streets when darkfall came small shops in each ward open all night long the night soil gatherers passing with their plaintive warning cry logs bumping and rolling through xinans outer walls into the huge pond by the east market where they were bought and sold at sunrise morning beatings and executions in the two market squares more street performers after the decapitations while good crowds were still gathered bells tolling the watchhours by day and through the night and the long roll of drums that locked the walls and all the ward gates at sundown and opened them at dawn spring flowers in the parks summer fruit autumn leaves the yellow dust that was everywhere blowing down from the steppes the dust of the world jadeandgold xinan he heard and saw and almost caught the smells of it as a remembered chaos and cacophony of the soul then he pushed it back and away in the moonlight listening again to the ghosts outside the crying hed had to learn to live with here or go mad in silver light he looked over at his low writing table the inkblock and paper the woven mat in front of it his swords were against the wall beside it the scent of the pine trees came through the open windows with the night wind cicadas whirring a duet with the dead he had come to kuala nor on impulse to honour his fathers sorrow he had stayed for himself just as much working every day to offer what release he could to however small a number of those unburied here one mans labour not an immortal not holy two years had passed seasons wheeling and the stars he didnt know how he would feel when he returned to the crash and tumble of the capital that was the honest thought he did know which people he had missed he saw one of them in the eye of his mind could almost hear her voice too vividly to allow sleep to return remembering the last time hed lain with her and if someone should take me from here when you are gone if someone should ask me should propose to make me his personal courtesan or even a concubine hed known who someone was of course he had taken her hand with its long goldpainted fingernails and jewelled rings and placed it on his bare chest so she could feel his heart shed laughed a little bitterly no you always do this tai your heart never changes its beating it tells me nothing in the north district where they werean upstairs room in the pavilion of moonlight pleasure houseshe was called spring rain he didnt know her real name you never asked the real names it was considered illbred speaking slowly because this was difficult hed said two years is a long time rain i know it much happens in the life of a man or a woman it is she had moved her hand to cover his mouth not gently she wasnt always gentle with him no again listen to me if you begin to speak of the path or the balanced wisdom of lifes long flowing tai i will take a fruit knife to your manhood i thought you might wish to know this before you went on he remembered the silk of her voice the devastating sweetness with which she could say such things he had kissed the palm held against his mouth then said softly as she moved it a little away you must do what seems best to you for your life i do not want you to be one of those women waiting at a window above jade stairs in the night let someone else live those poems my intention is to go back to my familys estate observe the rites for my father then return i can tell you that he had not lied it had been his intention things had fallen out otherwise what man would dare believe that all he planned might come to pass not even the emperor with the mandate of heaven could make that so he had no idea what had happened to her if someone had indeed taken her from the courtesans quarter claimed her for his own behind the stone walls of an aristocrats city mansion in what was almost certainly a better life no letters came west of iron gate pass because he had not written any it didnt have to be a case of one extreme or the other he finally thought not xinan set against this beyondallborders solitude the paths long tale of wisdom taught balancing did it not the two halves of a mans soul of his inward life you balanced couplets in a formal verse elements in a paintingriver cliff heron fishing boatthick and thin brush strokes in calligraphy stones and trees and water in a garden shifting patterns in your own days he could go back home to their stream for example instead of to the capital when he left here could live there and write marry someone his mother and second mother chose for him cultivate their garden the orchardspring flowers summer fruitreceive visitors and pay visits grow old and whitebearded in calm but not solitude watch the paulownia leaves when they fell the goldfish in the pond remember his father doing so he might even one day be thought a sage the idea made him smile in moonlight he could travel east down the wai or on the great river itself through the gorges to the sea and then back the boatmen poling against the current or towing the boats west with thick ropes along slippery paths cut into the cliffs when they came to the wild gorges again he might go even farther south where the empire became different and strange lands where rice was grown in water and there were elephants and gibbons mandrills rosewood forests camphor trees pearls in the sea for those who could dive for them and where tigers with yellow eyes killed men in the jungles of the dark he had an honoured lineage his fathers name offered a doorway through which tai could walk and find a welcome among prefects and taxation officers and even military governors throughout kitai in truth first brothers name might be even more useful by now though that had its own complexities but all of this was possible he could travel and think visit temples and pavilions pagodas in misty hills mountain shrines write as he travelled he could do it just as the master poet whose lines he had awakened with had done was probably still doing somewhere though honesty and irony compelled the additional thought that sima zian seemed to have done as much drinking as anything else through his years on the boats and roads in the mountains and temples and bamboo groves there was that too wasnt there good wine latenight fellowship music not to be dismissed or despised tai fell asleep on that thought and with the sudden fervent hope that the tagurans had remembered to bring wine he had almost finished what his own people had delivered two weeks ago the long summer twilight gave a man more time to drink before going to bed with the sun he slept and dreamed of the woman with her hand on his heart that last night then over his mouth her shaped and painted motheyebrows green eyes red mouth candlelight jade pins pulled slowly one by one from golden hair and the scent she wore the birds woke him from the far end of the lake he had attempted a formal sixline poem several nights ago their strident morning noise compared to opening hour at the two markets in xinan but hadnt been able to make the parallel construction hold in the final couplet his technical skills as a poet were probably above average good enough for the verse component of the examinations but not likely in his own judgment to produce something enduring one of the results of two years alone had been his coming to think this most of the time he dressed and built a fire washed himself and tied back his hair while boiling water for tea he glanced in the bronze mirror hed been given and thought about taking a blade to his cheeks and chin but decided against such selfabuse this morning the tagurans could deal with him unshaven there was no real reason to even tie his hair but he felt like a steppes barbarian when he left it on his shoulders he had memories of that of them before drinking or eating while the tea leaves were steeping he stood at the eastern window and spoke the prayer to his fathers spirit in the direction of sunrise whenever he did this he summoned and held a memory of shen gao feeding bread to the wild ducks in their stream he didnt know why that was his remembranceimage but it was perhaps the tranquility of it in a life that had not been tranquil he prepared and drank his tea ate some saltdried meat and milled grain in hot water sweetened with clover honey then he claimed his peasantfarmer straw hat from a nail by the door and pulled on his boots the summer boots were almost new a gift from iron gate replacing the wornout pair hed had they had noticed that they observed him closely whenever they came tai had come to understand he had also realized during the first hard winter that hed almost certainly have died here without the help of the two forts you could live entirely alone in some mountains in some seasonsit was a legenddream of the hermitpoetbut not at kuala nor in winter not this high up and remote when the snows come and the north wind blew the supplies at new and full moon without fail had kept him aliveand had arrived only through extreme effort several times when wild storms had bowled down to blast the frozen meadow and lake he milked the two goats took the pail inside and covered it for later he claimed his two swords and went back out and did his kanlin routines he put the swords away and then outside again stood a moment in almostsummer sunshine listening to the shrieking racket of birds watching them wheel and cry above the lake which was blue and beautiful in morning light and gave no least hint at all of winter ice or of how many dead men were here around its shores until you looked away from birds and water to the tall grass of the meadow and then you saw the bones in the clear light everywhere tai could see his mounds where he was burying them west of the cabin north against the pines three long rows of deep graves now he turned to claim his shovel and go to work it was why he was here his eye was caught by a glint to the south sunlight catching armour halfway along the last turning of the last slope down looking more narrowly he saw that the tagurans were early today orhe checked the sun againthat he was moving slowly himself after a moonwhite waking night he watched them descend with the bullock and the heavywheeled cart he wondered if bytsan was leading the supply party himself this morning he found himself hoping so was it wrong to anticipate the arrival of a man whose soldiers would rape his sister and both mothers and joyfully sack and burn the family compound during any incursion into kitai men changed during wars or conflict sometimes beyond recognition tai had seen it in himself on the steppes beyond the long wall among the nomads men changed not always in ways you liked to recall though courage seen was worth remembering he didnt think bytsan would grow savage but he didnt know and he could easily imagine the opposite about some of the tagurans who had come here through two years arriving armoured and armed as if to the stern drums of a battlefield not bringing supplies to a solitary fool they were not simple easily sorted encounters the ones he had with the warriors of the empire of the plateau when they came down to him it was bytsan he saw as the tagurans reached the meadow and began circling the lake the captain trotted his baycoloured sardian horse forward the animal was magnificent breathtaking they all were those farwestern horses the captain had the only one in his company heavenly horses they called them in tais own land legends said that they sweated blood the tagurans traded for them with sardia beyond where the divided silk roads became one again in the west after the deserts there through yet more harsh mountain passes lay the deep lush breeding grounds of these horses and tais people longed for them with a passion that had influenced imperial policy warfare and poetry for centuries horses mattered a great deal they were why the emperor serene lord of the five directions and the five holy mountains was steadily engaged with the bogu nomads supporting chosen leaders among the kumissdrinking yurtdwellers north of the wall in exchange for a supply of their horses however inferior they might be to the ones from sardia neither the loessladen soil in northern kitai nor the jungles and ricelands of the south would permit the grazing and breeding of horses of any real quality it was a kitan tragedy had been for a thousand years many things came to xinan along the guarded silk roads in this ninth dynasty making it wealthy beyond description but horses from sardia were not among them they could not endure that long desert journey women came east musicians and dancers jade and alabaster and gems came amber aromatics powdered rhinoceros horn for the alchemists talking birds spices and food swords and ivory and so much else but not the heavenly horses so kitai had had to find other ways to get the best mounts they couldbecause you could win a war with cavalry all else being equal and when the tagurans had too many of these horses being at peace with the sardians now trading with them all else was not equal tai bowed twice in greeting as bytsan reined upright fist in left palm he had acquaintancesand an older brotherwho would have judged it a humiliation had they seen him bow so formally to a taguran on the other hand they hadnt had their lives guarded and preserved by this man and the steady arrival of supplies every full moon for almost two years bytsans blue tattoos showed in the sunlight on both cheeks and the left side of his neck above the collar of his tunic he dismounted bowed also twice closed fist in palm adopting the kitan gesture he smiled briefly before you ask yes i brought wine he spoke kitan most tagurans did it was the language of trade in all directions now when men were not killing each other it was believed in kitai that the gods spoke kitan in the nine heavens had taught it to the original father of emperors as he stood head bowed on dragon mountain in the pastthatlaybehind you knew i would ask tai felt rueful a little exposed longer twilights what else can a man do the cup is a companion we sing it goes well it goes well the moonlight kept me awake i am slow to begin this morning they knew his routine the query had not been idle just the moon tais own people asked variants of that question every time they came curiosityand fear very brave men including this one had told him directly they could not have done what he was doing here with the dead unburied and angry tai nodded the moon and some memories he glanced past the captain and saw a young fully armoured soldier ride up not one of the ones he knew this man did not dismount stared down at tai he had only one tattoo wore an unnecessary helmet did not smile gnam take an axe from by the cabin help adar chop firewood why tai blinked he looked at the taguran captain bytsans expression did not change nor did he glance back at the soldier on the horse behind him because that is what we do here and because if you do not i will take your horse and weapons remove your boots and let you walk back through all the passes alone among the mountain cats it was said quietly there was a silence tai realized with a kind of dismay how unaccustomed hed become to such exchanges a sudden tension rising this is the way the world is he told himself learn it again start now this is what you will find when you return casually so as not to shame the captain or the young soldier he turned and looked across the lake towards the birds grey herons terns a golden eagle very high the young manhe was big wellmadewas still on his horse he said this one cannot chop wood i believe he can since he has been digging graves for our dead for two years now ours or his own while he despoils our soldiers bones bytsan laughed tai turned quickly back he couldnt help himself he felt something returning after a long time he knew it for what it was anger had been a part of him too readily as far back as he could remember a second brothers portion some might say that was it he said as levelly as he could i should be grateful if youd look around and tell me which of the bones here is one of yours if i should feel inclined to despoil it a different silence there were many kinds of stillness tai thought inconsequentially gnam you are a great fool get the axe and chop wood do it now this time bytsan did look at his soldier and this time the other man swung himself downnot hurrying but not disobeying either the bullock had pulled the cart up there were four other men tai knew three of them exchanged nods with those the one called adar wearing a belted darkred tunic over loose brown trousers no armour walked with gnam towards the cabin leading their horses the others knowing their routine here guided the cart forward and began unloading supplies into the cabin they moved briskly they always did unload stack do whatever else including cleaning out the small stable get back up the slope and away the fear of being here after dark careful with his wine bytsan called i dont want to hear a kitan weeping the sounds too unpleasant tai smiled crookedly the soldiers laughed the chunk of axes came from the side of the cabin carrying in mountain air bytsan gestured tai walked off with him they stepped through tall grass over bones and around them tai avoided a skull instinct by now butterflies were everywhere all colours and grasshoppers startled at their feet springing high and away in all directions they heard the drone of bees among the meadow flowers here and there the metal of a rusted blade could be seen even on the grey sand at the waters edge you needed to be careful where you stepped there were pink stones in the sand the birds were raucous wheeling and swooping breaking the surface of the lake for fish waters still cold bytsan asked after a moment they stood by the lake the air was very clear they could see crags on the mountains cranes on the isle in the ruined fortress there always a storm in the pass five nights ago you get it down here tai shook his head some rain must have blown off east bytsan bent and picked up a handful of stones he began throwing them at birds suns hot he said eventually i can see why you wear that thing on your head though it makes you look like an old man and a peasant both the taguran grinned both he threw another stone he said youll be leaving soon midsummer moon ends our mourning period bytsan nodded thats what i wrote them wrote them court in rygyal tai stared at him they know about me bytsan nodded again they know from me of course they do tai thought about it i dont think iron gates sending messages back that someones burying the dead at kuala nor but i may be wrong the other man shrugged you probably are everythings tracked and weighed these days peacetimes for the calculating ones at any court there were some at rygyal who saw your coming here as kitan arrogance they wanted you killed that tai hadnt known either like that fellow back there the two axes were chopping steadily each one a thin clean sound in the distance gnam hes just young wants to make a name kill an enemy right away get it over with like your first woman the two of them exchanged a brief smile both were relatively young men still neither felt that way bytsan said after a moment i was instructed that you were not to be killed tai snorted i am grateful to hear it bytsan cleared his throat he seemed awkward suddenly there is a gift instead a recognition tai stared again a gift from the taguran court no from the rabbit in the moon bytsan grimaced yes of course from the court well from one person there with permission permission the grimace became a grin the taguran was sunburned squarejawed had one missing lower tooth you are slow this morning tai said this is unexpected thats all what person see for yourself i have a letter bytsan reached into a pocket in his tunic and retrieved a paleyellow scroll tai saw the taguran royal seal a lions head in red he broke the wax unrolled the letter read the contents which were not lengthy and so learned what they were giving to him and doing to him for his time here among the dead it became something of an exercise to breathe thoughts began arriving too swiftly uncontrolled disconnected a swirling like a sandstorm this could define his lifeor have him killed before he ever got home to the family estate let alone to xinan he swallowed hard looked away at the mountains ranged and piled around them rising up and farther up the blue lake ringed in majesty in the teachings of the path mountains meant compassion water was wisdom the peaks didnt alter tai thought what men did beneath their gaze could change more swiftly than one could ever hope to understand he said it i dont understand bytsan made no reply tai looked down at the letter and read the name at the bottom again one person there with permission one person the white jade princess chengwan seventeenth daughter of the revered and exalted emperor taizu sent west to a foreign land twenty years ago from her own bright glittering world sent with her pipa and flute a handful of attendants and escorts and a taguran honour guard to become the first imperial bride ever granted by kitai to tagur to be one of the wives of sangrama the lion in his high holy city of rygyal she had been part of the treaty that followed the last campaign here at kuala nor an emblem in her young person shed been fourteen that year of how savageand inconclusivethe fighting had been and how important it was that it end a slender graceful token of peace enduring between two empires as if it would endure as if it ever had as if one girls body and life could ensure such a thing there had been a fall of poems like flower petals in kitai that autumn pitying her in parallel lines and rhyme married to a distant horizon fallen from heaven lost to the civilized world of parallel lines and rhyme beyond snowbound mountain barriers among barbarians on their harsh plateau it had been the literary fashion for that time an easy theme until one poet was arrested and beaten with the heavy rod in the square before the palaceand nearly died of itfor a verse suggesting this was not only lamentable but a wrong done to her you didnt say that sorrow was one thingpolite cultured regret for a young life changing as she left the glory of the worldbut you never offered the view that anything the taming palace did ever might be mistaken that was a denial of the rightly fulfilled fully compassed mandate of heaven princesses were coinage in the world what else could they be how else serve the empire justify their birth tai was still staring at the words on the paleyellow paper struggling to bring spiralling thoughts to what one might call order bytsan was quiet allowing him to deal with this or try you gave a man one of the sardian horses to reward him greatly you gave him four or five of those glories to exalt him above his fellows propel him towards rankand earn him the jealousy possibly mortal of those who rode the smaller horses of the steppes the princess chengwan a royal consort of tagur now through twenty years of peace had just bestowed upon him with permission two hundred and fifty of the dragon horses that was the number tai read it one more time it was in the scroll he held recorded in kitan in a taguran scribes thin but careful calligraphy two hundred and fifty heavenly horses given him in his own right and to no one else not a gift for the taming palace the emperor not that presented to shen tai second son of the general shen gao once left side commander of the pacified west his own to use or dispose of as he judged best the letter read in royal recognition from rygyal of courage and piety and honour done the dead of kuala nor you know what this says his own voice sounded odd to tai the captain nodded they will kill me for these tai said they will tear me apart to claim those horses before i get near the court i know said bytsan calmly tai looked at him the other mans darkbrown eyes were impossible to read you know well it seems likely enough it is a large gift a large gift tai laughed a little breathlessly he shook his head in disbelief in the name of all nine heavens i cant just ride through iron gate pass with two hundred and fifty i know the taguran interrupted i know you cant i made some suggestions when they told me what they wished to do you did bytsan nodded hardly a gift if youre accidentally killed on the way east and the horses are dispersed or claimed by someone else no it isnt is it hardly a gift tai heard his voice rising such a simple life hed been living until moments ago and the taming was a brawl of factions when i left i am sure it is worse now i am sure you are right oh really what do you know about it the other man he decided seemed irritatingly at ease bytsan gave him a glance little enough in the small fort i am honoured to command for my king i was only agreeing with you he paused do you want to hear what i suggested or not tai looked down he felt embarrassed he nodded his head for no reason he knew he took off his straw hat standing in the high bright sun the axes continued in the distance bytsan told him what hed written to his own court and what had been decreed in response to that it seemed to have cost the other man his position at the fortress in the pass above in order to implement his own proposal tai didnt know if that meant a promotion or not it might tai understood keep him alive for a time at least he cleared his throat trying to think what to say you realize bytsan spoke with a pride he could not conceal that this is sangramas gift the kings generosity our kitan princess might have asked him for it it is her name on that letter but it is the lion who sends you this tai looked at him he said quietly i understand it is an honour that the lion of rygyal even knows my name bytsan flushed after the briefest hesitation he bowed two hundred and fifty sardian horses tai was thinking from within the sandstorm of his foreveraltered life being brought by him to a court an empire that gloried in every single dragon steed that had ever reached them from the west that dreamed of those horses with so fierce a longing shaping porcelain and jade and ivory in their image linking poets words to the thunder of mythic hooves the world could bring you poison in a jewelled cup or surprising gifts sometimes you didnt know which of them it was chapter ii bytsan sri nespo was furious with himself to the point of humiliation he knew what his father would have said and in what tone had he witnessed this shame he had just bowedfar too deferentiallywhen the kitan having removed his stupid hat for some reason said he was honoured that the lion knew his name in rygyal so far away in glory but it was a gracious thing to say and bytsan had found himself bowing hand wrapped around fist in their fashion not that of his own people before he was able to stop himself perhaps it had been the hat after all the deliberate selfexposure of that gesture the kitan could do such things to you or this one could just when youd decided one more time that they were all about their centreoftheworld arrogance they could say and do something like this from within the breeding and courtesy they donned like a cloakwhile clutching a completely ridiculous straw hat what did you do when that happened ignore it treat it as decadence softness a false courtesy unworthy of note on ground where taguran soldiers had fought and died bytsan wasnt able to do that a softness of his own perhaps it might even affect his career although what defined military promotion these dayswith warfare limited to occasional skirmisheswas more about whom you knew in higher ranks had gotten drunk with once or twice or had allowed to seduce you when you were too young to know better or could pretend as much in order to be judged on courage on how you fought there had to be fighting didnt there peacetime was good for tagur for borders and trade and roads and raising new temples for harvests and full granaries and seeing sons grow up instead of learning they were lying in mounds of corpses as here by kuala nor but that same peace played havoc with an ambitious soldiers hopes of using courage and initiative as his methods of advancement not that he was going to talk about that with a kitan there were limits inward borders in addition to the ones with fortresses defending them but if he was going to be honest about it the court in rygyal knew his name now as well because of this shen tai this unprepossessing figure with the courteous voice and the deepset eyes bytsan stole an appraising glance the kitan couldnt be called a soft cityscholar any more two years of punishing labour in a mountain meadow had dealt with that he was lean and hard his skin weathered hands scratched and callused and bytsan knew the man had been a soldier for a time it had occurred to himmore than a year agothat this one might even know how to fight there were two swords in his cabin it didnt matter the kitan would be leaving soon his life entirely changed by the letter he was holding bytsans life as well he was to be given leave from his post when this kitan left for home he was reassigned to dosmad fortress south and east on the border with the sole and specific responsibilityin the name of the princess chengwanof implementing his own suggestion regarding her gift initiative he had decided could involve more than leading a flanking attack in a cavalry fight there were other sorts of flanking manoeuvres the kind that might even get you out of a backwater fort in a mountain pass above a hundred thousand ghosts that last was another thing he didnt like and this hed even admitted to the kitan once the ghosts terrified him as much as they did every soldier who came with him bringing the wagon and supplies shen tai had been quick to say that his own people from iron gate pass were exactly the same stopping for the night safely east of here when they came up the valley timing their arrival for late morning just as bytsan did working hastily to unload his supplies and do whatever tasks theyd assigned themselvesand then gone gone from the lake and the white bones before darkfall even in winter when night came swiftly even in a snowstorm once shen tai had said refusing shelter in his cabin bytsan had done that too better ice and snow in a mountain pass than the howling presence of the bitter unburied dead who could poison your soul blight the life of any child you fathered drive you mad the kitan beside him didnt appear to be a madman but that was the prevailing explanation among bytsans soldiers at the fort probably at iron gate too something two outpost armies could agree upon or was that just an easy way of dealing with someone being more courageous than you were you could fight him to test that of course gnam wanted to had been spoiling for it even before theyd come down from the pass bytsan had briefly harboured the unworthy thought that hed like to see that challenge only briefly if the kitan died there went his own flanking move away from here shen tai put his absurd hat back on as bytsan told him what they were going to do in an effort to keep him alive long enough to get to xinan and decide how to deal with his horses because the man was rightof course he was righthed be killed ten times over for that many sardian horses if he simply tried to herd them back east openly it was an absurd wildly extravagant gift but being absurd and extravagant was the privilege of royalty wasnt it he thought about saying that to the other man but refrained he wasnt sure why but it might have been that shen tai really did look shaken rereading the scroll again visibly unsettled for the first time since bytsan had been coming here they walked back to the cabin bytsan supervised the unpacking and storing of suppliesmetal chests and tight wooden boxes for the food to defeat the rats he made another joke about wine and the long evenings gnam and adar had begun stacking firewood against the cabin wall gnam worked fiercely sweating in his unnecessary armour channelling furywhich was perfectly all right with his captain anger in a soldier could be used it was soon enough done the sun still high just starting west summers approach made the run down to the lake easier in obvious ways bytsan lingered long enough for a cup of wine warmed in the kitan fashion with shen tai then bade him a brisk farewell the soldiers were already restless the other man was still distracted uneasy it showed behind the eternal mask of courtesy bytsan could hardly blame him two hundred and fifty horses the white jade princess had decreed the sort of overwrought conceit only someone living in a palace all her life could devise the king had approved it however it was never wise bytsan had decided on his way here from the fort to underestimate the influence of women at a court hed considered saying that too over the cup of wine but had elected not to there would be one last supply trip in a months time then life would change for both of them they might never see each other again probably would not better not to do anything so foolish as confide in the other man or acknowledge more than curiosity and a rationed measure of respect the cart was lighter on the way back of course the bullock quicker heading home so were the soldiers putting the lake and the dead behind them three of his men started a song as they left the meadow and began to wind their way up bytsan paused in the afternoon light at the switchback where he always did and looked down you might call kuala nor beautiful in late springif you knew nothing about it his gaze swept across the blue water to the nesting birdsan absurd number of them you could fire an arrow in the air over that way and kill three with one shot if the arrow had room to fall he allowed himself a smile he was glad to be leaving too no denying it he looked across the meadow bowl north towards the far framing mountains range beyond range the tale of his people was that bluefaced demons gigantic and malevolent had dwelled in those distant peaks from the beginning of the world and had only been barred from the tagur plateau by the gods who had thrown up other mountains against them wrapped in magic the range they were reentering now where their small fortress sat was one of these the gods themselves dazzling and violent lived much farther south beyond rygyal above the transcendent peaks that touched the foothills of heaven and no man had ever climbed them bytsans gaze fell upon the burial mounds across the lake on the far side of the meadow they lay against the pine woods west of the kitans cabin three long rows of them now two years worth of bonegraves in hard ground shen tai was digging already he saw working beyond the last of them in the third row he hadnt waited for the tagurans to leave the meadow bytsan watched him small in the distance bend and shovel bend and shovel he looked at the cabin set against that same northern slope saw the pen theyd built for the two goats the freshly stacked firewood against one wall he finished his sweep by turning east to the valley through which this strange solitary kitan had come to kuala nor and along which he would return somethings moving there gnam said beside him looking the same way he pointed bytsan stared narrowing his eyes and then he saw it too hed gone back to digging the pit hed started two days ago end of the third row in from the trees because that was what he did here and because he felt that if he didnt keep himself moving working to exhaustion today the chaos of his thoughtsalmost feverish after so long a quiet timewould overwhelm him there was always the wine bytsan had brought another access like a crooked lamplit laneway in the north district of xinan to the blurred borders of oblivion the wine would be there at days end waiting no one else was coming to drink it or so hed thought carrying his shovel to work but the world today was simply not fitting itself to a steady twoyear routine standing up stretching his back and removing the maligned hat to mop at his forehead tai saw figures coming from the east over the tall green grass they were already out of the canyon in the open on the meadow that meant they had to have been visible for some time he just hadnt noticed why should he notice why even look no one came here but the two sets of troops from the forts full moon new moon there were two of them he saw on small horses a third horse carrying their gear behind they moved slowly not hurrying perhaps tired the sun was starting west its light fell upon them making them vivid in the latedays glowing it wasnt time for supplies from iron gate hed just said farewell to bytsan and the taguran soldiers and when men did arrive it wasnt just a pair of them with no cart andmost certainlythey did not reach the lake in the later part of the day when theyd have to stay with him overnight or be outside among the dead after dark this clearly was a day marked for change in his stars they were still some distance away the travellers tai stared for another moment then shouldered his shovel picked up his quiver and bowcarried against wolves and for shots at a bird for dinnerand started towards his cabin to be waiting for them there a matter of simple courtesy respect shown visitors to ones home wherever it might be in the world even here beyond borders he felt his pulse quickening as he walked beating to meet the worlds pulse coming back to him chou yan had expected his friend to be changed in both appearance and manner if he was even alive after two years out here hed been preparing for terrible tidings had talked about it with his travelling companion not that she ever replied then at iron gate passthat wretched fortress here at the worlds endtheyd told him tai was still among the living or had been a little while ago when theyd taken supplies to him by the lake yan had immediately drunk several cups of salmon river wine he had been carrying it for tai more or less to celebrate he hadnt known until then no one had known hed assumed when he left xinan that he would be journeying ten days or so along the imperial road and then down through civilized country to his friends family home with what he had to tell him it wasnt so at the estate near the wai river where hed managed to remain uncharacteristically discreet about his tidings the third brother young shen chaothe only child still at homehad told him where tai had gone two full years ago yan couldnt believe it at first and then thinking about his friend he did believe it tai had always had something different about him too many strands in one nature an uneasy mingling of soldier and scholar ascetic and drinking companion among the singing girls along with a temper it was no wonder their friend xin lun had once said that tai was always going on about the need for balance after too many cups of wine lun had joked about how hard keeping ones balance could be on muddy laneways weaving home after that many cups it was a very long way where tai had journeyed his family had not heard from him since hed gone he could be dead no one could reasonably expect chou yan to follow him beyond the borders of the empire yan had spent two nights among the shen women and youngest boy sharing their ancestor rites and meals very good food no wine in the house during mourning alas hed slept in a comfortable mosquitonetted bed hed poured his own libation over general shen gaos grave admired his monument and inscription strolled with young chao in the orchard and along the stream he was unhappily trying to decide what to do how far did friendship carry one literally how far in the event he did what hed been afraid hed do from the time theyd told him of tais departure he bade farewell to the family and continued west towards the border with only the single guard hed been advised to take with him back in xinan she had told him it was an easy enough journey when he mentioned where his friend had gone yan didnt believe her but the indifferent manner was oddly reassuring as long as he paid her yan thought she wouldnt care you hired a kanlin warrior and they stayed with you until you paid them off or didnt pay them though that was invariably an extremely bad idea wansi was hopeless as a companion truth be told especially for a sociable man who liked to talk laugh argue who enjoyed the sound of his voice declaiming poetryhis own verses or anyone elses yan kept reminding himself that she was simply protection for the road and skilled hands to assemble their camp at night when they slept outdoorsrather more necessary now than hed expected at the outset she was not a friend or an intimate of any kind most certainly not someone to think about bedding at night he had little doubt what shed say if he raised that matter and less doubt shed break a bone or two if he tried to give effect to the desire that had begun to assail him aware of her lithe body lying near him under stars or curving and stretching in her exercise ritualsthose elegant slow movements at sunrise the kanlin were fabled for discipline and for how efficiently they killed when need arose need hadnt arisen as theyd journeyed down the river road to shen tais family home one twilight encounter in light rain with three roughlooking men who might have had theft in mind had they not seen a blackclad kanlin with two swords and a bow theyd absented themselves quickly down a path into dripping undergrowth once they started west however everything began to feel different for yan he was at pains to light candles or burn incense and leave donations at any and all temples to any and all gods from the morning they left the shen estate and began following a dusty track northwest and then farther west towards emptiness north of them parallel to their route lay the imperial road through the prefecture city of chenyao and beyond that was the easternmost section of the silk roads leading from xinan to jade gate and the garrisons in the kanshu corridor the imperial highway had lively villages and comfortable inns at postal stations all the way along there would have been good wine and pretty women maybe even some of the yellowhaired dancing girls from sardia working in pleasure houses perhaps on their way to the capital the ones who could arch their bodies backwards and touch the ground with feet and hands at onceand so elicit arresting images in the mind of an imaginative man but shen tai wasnt up there was he nothing so sensible and it didnt make sense to go five or six days north to meet the highway when their own path was to iron gate by kuala nor not jade gate pass that left his friend yan his loyal friend feeling every hardboned movement of his small shaggy horse towards the end of a days silent ride through latespring countryside he wasnt going to drink that wine or hear music in those inns or teach fragrant women how he very much liked to be touched it was wansi who decided how far theyd ride each day whether theyd reach a village and negotiate a roof under which to sleep or camp outside yan ached like a grandfather each morning when he woke on dewdamp ground and the village beds were hardly better for anything less than the tidings he was bearing he wouldnt have done this he told himself he simply wouldnt have however dear his friend might be to him whatever parting verses and last embraces theyd exchanged at the willow inn by the western gate of xinan when tai had left for home to mourn his father yan and lun and the others had given him broken willow twigs in farewell and to ensure a safe return the others there had been half a dozen of them at the willow inn fabled for the partings it had witnessed none of the others were with yan on the road were they theyd been happy enough to get drunk when tai left and then praise yan and improvise poems and give out more willow twigs at that same inn yard when he set out two years later but no one had volunteered to go with him had they not even when the expected journey was only ten days or so to tais family home hah thought chou yan many hard days west of that estate at this point he decided he himself could fairly be called heroic a testament to the depth and virtue of friendship in the glorious ninth dynasty they would have to admit it when he returned all of them no more winecup jests about softness and indolence it was too pleasing a thought to keep to himself he offered it to wansi as they rode as idle an expenditure of mortal breath and words as there had ever been black clothing black eyes a stillness like no one hed ever known this warriorwoman it was irritating a tongue was wasted on her so was beauty come to think of it he couldnt remember if hed ever seen her smile that night she killed a tiger he didnt even know it until morning when he saw the animals body two arrows in it at the green edge of a bamboo grove twenty paces from where theyd slept he gaped stammered why didnt i didnt even he was in a sweat hands shaking he kept looking at the slain beast and quickly away the dreadful size of it fear made him dizzy he sat down on the ground he saw her walk over and reclaim her arrows a booted foot on the tigers flank twisting the shafts free shed already packed their bedding and gear on the third horse now she mounted up and waited impatiently for him holding his horses reins out for him he managed to stand to get up on the horse you never even told me last night he said unable to take his eyes off the tiger now you complain less when youve slept a night she said which counted as a long sentence she started off the sun rising behind them they reached the fort at iron gate pass two evenings later the commander fed them for two nights mutton stew and mutton stew let chou yan entertain with gossip from the capital and sent them west with advice as to where to spend three nights on the way to kuala nor so as to arrive at the lake in the morning yan was entirely content with this counsel having no interest at all in encountering ghosts of any kind let alone angry ones and in the numbers improbably reported by the soldiers at the fort but wansi disdained belief in such matters and did not want to spend an unnecessary night in the canyon among mountain cats she said bluntly if his friend was alive by the lake and had been there for two years they pushed on through two long lightheaded days yan was finding it difficult to deal with the air this high past the commanders suggested stopping places on the third afternoon with the sun ahead of them they ascended a last defile between cliffs and came suddenly out of shadows to the edge of a meadow bowl of a beauty that could break the heart and moving forward through tall grass chou yan had finally seen his dear friend standing at the doorway of a small cabin waiting to greet him and his soul had been glad beyond any poets words and the long journey came to seem as nothing in the way of such trials when they are over weary but content he brought his small horse to a halt in front of the cabin shen tai was in a white tunic for mourning but his loose trousers and the tunic were sweat and dirtstained he was unshaven darkened roughskinned like a peasant but he was staring at yan in flattering disbelief yan felt like a hero he was a hero hed had a nosebleed earlier from the altitude but you didnt have to talk about that he only wished his tidings werent so grave but then he wouldnt be here would he if they werent tai bowed twice formally hand in fist his courtesy was as remembered impeccable almost exaggeratedly so when he wasnt in a fury about something yan still on horseback smiled happily down at him he said what hed planned to say for a long time words hed fallen asleep each night thinking about west of iron gate west of jade gate pass therell be no old friends tai smiled back i see you have come this long distance to tell me poets can be wrong this is meant to dazzle and confound me hearing the wry remembered voice yans heart was suddenly full ah well i suppose not greetings old friend he swung down stiffly his eyes filled with tears as he embraced the other man tais expression when they stepped back and looked at each other was strange as if yan were a ghost of some kind himself i would not ever ever have thought he began that i would be one to come to you i am sure you didnt everyone underestimates me that is supposed to confound you tai did not smile it does my friend how did you even know where yan made a face i didnt think i was coming this far i thought you were at home we all did they told me there where you had gone and you carried on all the way here it looks as though i did doesnt it yan said happily i even carried two small casks of salmon river wine for you given me by chong himself there but i drank one with your brother and the other at iron gate im afraid we did drink to your name and honour the ironical smile i thank you for that then i do have wine tai said you will be very tired and your companion will you both honour me and come inside yan looked at him wanting to be happy but his heart sank he was here for a reason after all i have something to tell you he said i thought that must be so his friend said gravely but let me offer water to wash yourselves and a cup of wine first you have come a long way beyond the last margins of the empire yan quoted he loved the sound of that no one was going to be allowed to forget this journey of his he decided soft a plump wouldbe mandarin not chou yan not any more the others studying for the examinations or in the north district laughing with dancing girls as a spring day waned listening to pipa music drinking from lacquered cups they were the soft ones now beyond the last margins tai agreed all around them mountains were piled upon each other snowclad yan saw a ruined fort on an isle in the middle of the lake he followed his friend into the cabin the shutters were open to the air and the clear light the one room was small trimly kept he remembered that about tai he saw a fireplace and a narrow bed the low writing table wooden inkblock ink paper brushes the mat in front of them he smiled he heard wansi enter behind him this is my guard he said my kanlin warrior she killed a tiger he turned to gesture by way of proper introduction and saw that she had her swords drawn and levelled at the two of them his instincts had been dulled by solitude two years away from anything remotely like blades pointed towards him keeping an eye out for wolves or mountain cats making sure the goats were penned at night did nothing to make you ready for an assassin but hed felt something wrong about the guard even as yan had ridden up with her he couldnt have said what that feeling was it was normal prudent for a traveller to arrange protection and yan was sufficiently unused to journeying and had enough family wealth to have gone all the way to hiring a kanlin even if hed only intended to go west a little and then down towards the wai that wasnt it it had been something in her eyes and posture tai decided staring at the swords both were towards him in fact not at yan she would know which of them was a danger riding up reining her horse before the cabin door she ought not to have seemed quite so alert staring at him she had been hired to get a man somewhere and theyd come to that place a task done or the outbound stage of it payment partly earned but her glance at tai had been appraising as much as anything else the sort of look you gave a man you expected to fight or simply kill since tais own swords were where they always were against the wall and there was no hope of notching arrow to bowstring before she cut him in two everyone knew what kanlin blades in kanlin hands could do yans face had gone pale with horror his mouth gaped fishlike poor man the drawn sword of betrayal was not a part of the world he knew hed done something immensely courageous coming here had reached beyond himself in the name of friendship and found only this for reward tai wondered what his tidings were what had caused him to do this he might never know he realized that angered and disturbed him equally he said setting the world in motion again i must assume i am your named target that my friend knows nothing of why you really came here there is no need for him to die but there is she said softly her eyes stayed on him weighing every movement he made or might make what because hell name you you think it will not be known who killed me when they come here from iron gate you will have been recorded when you arrived at the fortress what can he add to that the swords did not waver she smiled thinly a beautiful cold face like the lake tai thought death within it not that she said he insulted me with his eyes on the journey he saw you as a woman that would have taken some effort tai said deliberately have a care she said why or youll kill me anger within him more than anything now he was a man helped by rage though steered towards thought decisiveness he was trying to see what it did to her the kanlin are taught proportion and restraint in movement in deeds you would kill a man because he admired your face and body a disgrace to your mentors on the mountain if so you will tell me what kanlin teachings are if i must tai said coolly are you going to do this with honour and allow me my swords she shook her head his heart sank i would prefer that but my instructions were precise i was not to allow you to fight me when we came here this is not to be a combat a hint of regret some explanation for the appraising look who is this one what sort of man that she was told to fear him tai registered something else however when you came here you knew i was at kuala nor not at home how she said nothing had made an error he realized not that it was likely to matter he needed to keep talking silence would be death he was certain of it they thought i would kill you if we fought who decided this who is protecting you from me you are very sure of yourself the assassin murmured he had a thought a poor one almost hopeless but nothing better seemed to be arriving in the swirling of these moments i am sure only of the uncertainty of life he said if i am to end here by kuala nor and you will not fight me will you kill me outside i would offer my last prayer to the water and sky and lie among those i have been burying it is not a great request no she said and he didnt know what she meant until she added it is not she paused it would be wrong to call it a hesitation i would have fought you had my orders not been precise orders precise orders who would do that he needed to shape time create it find some way to his swords the earlier thought really was a useless one he decided he had to make her move shift her footing look away from him yan who suggested you hire a kanlin silence the woman snapped before chou yan could speak does it matter tai said you are about to kill us without a fight like a frightened child who fears her lack of skill it was possiblejustthat goaded enough she might make another mistake his sheathed blades were behind the assassin by his writing table the room was small the distance trivialunless you wanted to be alive when you reached them no like a warrior accepting orders given the woman amended calmly she seemed serene again as if his taunting had instead of provoking imposed a remembrance of discipline tai knew how that could happen it didnt help him it was xin lun who suggested it to me yan said bravely tai heard the words saw the womans hard eyes knew what was coming he cried a warning yan took her righthand sword a backhanded stroke in his side angled upwards to cut between ribs the slashandwithdraw was precise elegant her wrist flexed the blade swiftly returnedto be levelled towards where tai had been no time seeming to have passed time held and controlled the kanlin were taught that way as it happened he knew this and time had passed time that could be used timelessness was an illusion and he wasnt where hed been before his heart crying knowing there was nothing he could have done to stop that stroke he had leaped towards the doorway even as shed turned to yanto kill him for speaking a name tai shouted again fury more than fear though he expected to die now himself a hundred thousand dead here and two more he ignored his sheathed swords they were too far he whipped out the open door and to his right towards the firewood by the goat pen he had leaned his shovel on that wall a gravediggers shovel against two kanlin swords he got there claimed it wheeled to face her the woman was running behind him and then she wasnt because the faint foolish desperate idea hed had before entered into the sunlit world became real the wind that rose in that moment conjured itself out of nothing at all without warning from within a spring afternoons placidity a terrifying force erupted there came a screaming sound high fierce unnatural not his voice not the womans not anyone actually alive the wind didnt ruffle the meadow grass at all or stir the pine trees it didnt move the waters of the lake it didnt touch tai though he heard what howled within it the wind poured around him curving to either side like a pair of bows as he faced the woman it took the assassin bodily lifted her up and hurled her through the air as if she were a twig a childs kite an uprooted flower stalk in a gale she was slammed against the wall of his cabin pinned unable to move it was as if she were nailed to the wood her eyes were wide with horror she was trying to scream her mouth was open but whatever was blasting her claiming her didnt allow that either one sword was still in her hand flattened against the cabin the other had been ripped from her grasp she had been lifted clean off the ground he saw her feet were dangling in air she was suspended hair and clothing splayed against the dark wood of the wall the illusion again of a moment outside of time then tai saw two arrows hit her one and then the other they struck from the side fired from the far end of the cabin beyond the door and the wild ghostwind did nothing to mar their flight only held her pinned to be killed like a victim for sacrifice the first arrow took her in the throat a flowering of crimson the second went in as deep below her left breast in the instant of her dying the wind too died the screaming left the meadow in the bruised stillness that followed the woman slid slowly down the wall crumpled to one side and lay upon the trampled grass beside his cabin door tai drew a ragged harrowed breath his hands were shaking he looked towards the far side of the cabin bytsan and the young soldier called gnam were standing there fear in their eyes both arrows had been fired by the younger man and though the wild windsound was gone tai was still hearing it in his mind that screaming still seeing the woman pinned flat like some blackrobed butterfly by what it had been the dead of kuala nor had come to him for him to his aid but so had two men mortal and desperately frightened riding back down from their safe path away even though the sun was over west now with twilight soon to fall and in the darkness here the world did not belong to living men tai understood something else then looking down at the woman where she lay that even by daylightmorning and afternoon summer and winter doing his workhe had been living at sufferance all this time he looked the other way towards the blue of the lake and the low sun and he knelt on the dark green grass he touched his forehead to the earth in full obeisance three times it had been written by one teacher in the time of the first dynasty more than nine hundred years ago that when a man was brought back alive from the tall doors of death from the brink of crossing over to the dark he had a burden laid upon him ever after to conduct his granted life in such a manner as to be worthy of that return others had taught otherwise over the centuries that survival in such a fashion meant that you had not yet learned what you had been sent to discover in a single given life though that really could be seen as another kind of burden tai thought on his knees in meadow grass he had a sudden image of his father feeding ducks in their stream he looked out over the lake a darker blue in the mountain air he stood up he turned to the tagurans gnam had gone to the dead woman he saw he dragged her away from the wall ripped his arrows out of her body tossing them carelessly behind himself her hair had come free of its binding in that wind spilling loose pins scattered gnam bent down spread her legs arranging them he began removing his armour tai blinked in disbelief what are you doing the sound of his own voice frightened him shes still warm the soldier said do me as a prize tai stared at bytsan the other man turned away do not claim your own soldiers never do this the taguran captain said but he was staring at the mountains not meeting tais gaze none of mine ever did said tai and no one else will while i stand by he took three strides and picked up the nearest kanlin sword it had been a long time since hed held one of these the balance was flawless a weight without weight he pointed it at the young soldier gnams hands stopped working his armour straps he actually looked surprised she came here to kill you i just saved your life it wasnt wholly true but close enough you have my gratitude and a hope i can repay you one day but that will be prevented if i kill you now and i will do that if you touch her unless you want to fight me gnam shrugged i can do that he began tightening his straps again youll die said tai quietly you need to know it the young taguran was brave had to be to have come back down tai struggled to find words to lead them out a way to save face for the younger man think about it he said the wind that came that was the dead they are with me here he looked at bytsan again who seemed strangely passive suddenly tai went on urgently i have spent two years here trying to honour the dead dishonouring this one makes a mockery of that she came to kill you gnam repeated as if tai were slowwitted every dead man in this meadow came to kill someone tai shouted his words drifted away in the thin air it was cooler now the sun low gnam said bytsan finally there is no time for a fight if we want to be away before dark and trust me after what just happened i do mount up were going he walked around the side of the cabin he came back a moment later on his magnificent sardian leading the soldiers horse gnam was still staring at tai he hadnt moved the desire to fight written in his face youve just won your second tattoo tai said quietly he looked briefly at bytsan then back to the soldier in front of him enjoy the moment dont hurry to the afterworld accept my admiration and my thanks gnam stared at him another moment then turned deliberately and spat thickly into the grass very near the body of the dead woman he stalked over and seized his horses reins and mounted he wheeled to ride away soldier tai spoke before he was aware hed intended to the other man turned again tai took a breath some things were hard to do take her swords he said kanlinforged i doubt any soldier in tagur carries their equal gnam did not move bytsan laughed shortly ill take them if he does not tai smiled wearily at the captain ive no doubt it is a generous gift it carries my gratitude he waited didnt move there were limits to how far one would go to assuage a young mans pride and behind him through that open cabin door a friend was lying dead after a long moment gnam moved his horse and extended a hand tai turned bent unslung the shoulder scabbards from the dead womans body and sheathed the two blades her blood was on one sheath he handed them up to the taguran bent again and retrieved the two arrows gave them to the young man as well dont hurry to the afterworld he repeated gnams face was expressionless then my thanks he said he did say it there was that much even here beyond borders and boundaries you could live a certain way tai thought remembering his father you could try at least he looked west past the wheeling birds at the red sun in low clouds then back to bytsan youll need to ride fast i know it the man inside is dead you killed him she did but he was with her he was my friend it is a grief bytsan shook his head is it possible to understand the kitan perhaps not he was tired suddenly and it occurred to him that hed have two bodies to bury quickly nowbecause hed be leaving in the morning he led an assassin to you he was a friend tai repeated he was deceived he came to bring me tidings she or whoever paid her didnt want me to hear them or live to do anything about it a friend bytsan sri nespo repeated his tone betrayed nothing he turned to go captain bytsan looked back didnt turn his horse so are you i believe my thanks tai closed fist in hand the other man stared at him for a long time then nodded he was about to spur his horse away tai saw but he did something else instead you could see a thought striking him could read it in the squarechinned features did he tell you whatever it was he came to say tai shook his head gnam had danced his horse farther south he was ready to leave now had the two swords across his back bytsans face clouded over you will leave now to find out what it was he was clever this taguran tai nodded again in the morning someone died to bring me tidings someone died to stop me from learning them bytsan nodded he looked west himself this time the sinking sun darkness coming birds in the air restless on the far side of the lake hardly any wind now the taguran drew a deep breath gnam go on ahead ill stay the night with the kitan if hes leaving in the morning there are matters he and i must talk about ill test my fate inside with him it seems that whatever spirits are here mean him no harm tell the others ill catch you up tomorrow you can wait for me in the middle pass gnams turn to stare you are staying here i just said that captain that is i know it is go the younger man hesitated still his mouth opened and closed bytsans tattooed face was hard nothing vaguely close to a yielding there gnam shrugged he spurred his horse and rode away they stood there the two of them and watched him go in the waning of the light saw him gallop very fast around the near side of the lake as if spirits were pursuing him tracking his breath and blood chapter iii the armies of the empire had changed over the past fifty years and changes were continuing the old fupei system of a peasant militia summoned for part of the year then returning to their farms for the harvest had grown more and more inadequate to the needs of an expanding empire the borders had been pushed west and north and northeast and even south past the great river through the diseaseridden tropics to the pearldiver seas collisions with tagurans to the west and the various bogu tribal factions north had increased as did the need to protect the flow of luxuries that came on the silk roads the emergence of border forts and garrisons farther and farther out had ended the militia system with its backandforth of farmersoldiers soldiers were professionals now or they were supposed to be more and more often they and their officers were drawn from nomads beyond the long wall subdued and coopted by the kitan even the military governors were often foreigners now certainly the most powerful one was it marked a change a large one the soldiers served yearround and for years now were paid from the imperial treasury and supported by a virtual army of peasants and labourers building forts and walls supplying food and weapons and clothing and entertainment of any and all kinds it made for bettertrained fighters familiar with their terrain but a standing army of this size did not come without costsand increased taxes were only the most obvious consequence in years and regions of relative peace without drought or flood with wealth now flowing at an almost unimaginable rate into xinan and yenling and the other great cities the cost of the new armies was bearable in hard years it became a problem and other issues less readily seen were growing at the lowest ebb of a person or a nation the first seeds of later glory may sometimes be seen looking back with a careful eye at the absolute summit of accomplishment the insects chewing from within at the most extravagant sandalwood may be heard if the nights are quiet enough a quietenough night wolves had been howling in the canyon earlier but had stopped the darkness was giving way for those on watch on the ramparts of iron gate fort to a nearlysummer sunrise pale light pulling a curtain of shadows backas in a puppet show at a town marketfrom the narrow space between ravine walls though that thought wujen ning from his post on the ramparts was not quite right street theatre curtains were pulled to the sidehed seen them in chenyao ning was one of the nativeborn kitan here having followed his father and older brothers into the army there was no family farm for him to rely upon for an income or return to visit he wasnt married he spent his halfyear leave time in the town between iron gate and chenyao there were wine shops and food sellers and women to take his strings of cash once given two weeks leave hed gone to chenyao itself five days away home was too far chenyao had been by a great deal the biggest city hed ever seen it had frightened him and hed never gone back he didnt believe the others when they said it wasnt that large as cities went here in the pass in the quiet of it the dawn light was filtering downwards it struck the tops of the cliffs first pulling them from shadow and worked its way towards the stilldark valley floor as the sun rose over the mighty empire behind them wujen ning had never seen the sea but it pleased him to imagine the vast lands of kitai stretching east to the ocean and the islands in it where immortals dwelled he glanced down at the dark dusty courtyard he adjusted his helmet they had a commander now who was obsessed with helmets and properly worn uniforms as if a screaming horde of tagurans might come storming down the valley at any moment and sweep over the fortress walls if someones tunic or sword belt was awry as if ning thought he spat over the wall through his missing front tooth as if the might of the kitan empire in this resplendent ninth dynasty and the three hundred soldiers in this fort that commanded the pass were a nuisance like mosquitoes he slapped at one of those on his neck they were worse to the south but this predawn hour brought out enough of the bloodsuckers to make for annoyance he looked up scattered clouds a west wind in his face the last stars nearly gone hed be off duty at the next drum could go down to breakfast and sleep he scanned the empty ravine and realized it wasnt empty what he saw in the mist slowly dispersing made him shout for a runner to go to the commander a lone man approaching before sunrise wasnt a threat but it was unusual enough to get an officer up on the wall then as he came nearer the rider lifted a hand gesturing for the gates to be opened for him at first ning was astonished at the arrogance of that and then he saw the horse the man was riding he watched them come on horse and rider taking clearer form like spirits entering the real world through fog that was a strange thought ning spat again between his fingers this time for protection he wanted the horse the moment he saw it every man in iron gate would want that horse by the bones of his honoured ancestors wujen ning thought every man in the empire would why you so sure that one didnt bring her to you bytsan had asked he did bring her or she brought him stop being clever kitan you know what i mean some irritation understandable theyd been on their eighth or ninth cup of wine at leastit had been considered illbred among the students in xinan to keep count night outside by then but moonlit so silver in the cabin tai had also lit candles thinking light would help the other man the ghosts were out there as always you could hear their voices as always tai was used to it but felt unsettled to realize this was his last night he wondered if they might know it somehow bytsan wouldnt becouldnt beaccustomed to any of this the voices of the dead offered anger and sorrow sometimes dark hard pain as if trapped forever in the moment of their dying the sounds swirled from outside the cabin windows gliding along the rooftop some came from farther off towards the lake or the trees tai tried to remember the drymouthed terror hed lived with on his first nights two years ago it was hard to reclaim those feelings after so long but he remembered sweating and shivering clutching a sword hilt in bed if cups of warmed rice wine were going to help the taguran deal with a hundred thousand ghosts less the ones buried by shen tai in two years that was the way it was that was all right theyd buried yan and the assassin in the pit tai had begun that afternoon it wasnt nearly deep enough yet for the bones hed planned which made it good for two kitan just slain one by sword one by arrows sent over to the night theyd wrapped them in winter sheepskin he wasnt using and would never use again and carried them down the row of mounds in the last of the days light tai had jumped into the pit and the taguran had handed down yans body and hed laid his friend in the ground and climbed out of the grave then theyd dropped the assassin in beside yan and shovelled the earth from next to the open pit back in and pounded it hard on top and all around with the flat sides of the shovels against the animals that might come and tai had spoken a prayer from the teachings of the path and poured a libation over the grave while the taguran stood by facing south towards his gods it had been nearly dark by then and theyd made their way hastily back to the cabin as the evening star the one the kitan people called great white appeared in the west following the sun down poets star at evening soldiers in the morning there hadnt been anything in the way of fresh food on a normal day tai would have caught a fish gathered eggs shot a bird and plucked it for cooking at days end but there had been no time for that today theyd boiled dried salted pork and eaten it with kale and hazelnuts in bowls of rice the tagurans had brought early peaches which were good and theyd had the new rice wine they drank as they ate and continued when the meal was done the ghosts had begun with the starlight you know what i mean bytsan repeated a little too loudly whyre you so sure of him chou yan you trust everyone who names himself a friend tai shook his head isnt in my nature to be trusting but yan was too proud of himself when he saw me and too astonished when she drew her swords a kitan cant deceive tai shook his head again i knew him he sipped his wine but someone knew me if they told her not to fight she said shed have preferred to kill me in a combat and she knew i was here yan didnt know she let him go first to my fathers house didnt give away where i washed have suspected something maybe he wasnt a suspicious man bytsan looked at tai narrowly considering all this why would a kanlin warrior fear you he wasnt so drunk after all tai couldnt see how it would hurt to answer i trained with them at stone drum mountain nearly two years he watched the other man react it would take me time to get my skills back but someone may not have wanted to chance it the taguran was staring tai poured more wine for him from the flask on the brazier he drank from his own cup then filled it a friend had died here today there was blood on the bedding there was a new hole in the world where sorrow could enter everyone knew this about you the time with the kanlins tai shook his head no you trained to be an assassin the usual irritating mistake i trained to learn how they think their disciplines and how they handle weapons they are usually guards or guarantors of a truce not assassins i left fairly abruptly some of my teachers may still feel kindly towards me others might not it was years ago we leave things behind us well thats true enough tai drank his wine they think you used them tricked them tai was beginning to regret mentioning it i just understand them a little now and they dont like that no im not a kanlin what are you right now im between worlds serving the dead oh good be kitanclever again are you a soldier or a court mandarin fuck it all tai managed a grin neither fuck it all bytsan looked away quickly but tai saw him suppress a smile it was hard not to like this man he added more quietly it is only truth captain i left the army years ago have not taken the civil service exams im not being clever bytsan held out his againempty cup before answering tai filled it topped up his own this was beginning to remind him of nights in the north district soldiers or poetswho could drink more a question for the ages or sages after a moment the taguran said also softly you didnt need us to save you outside something screamed it wasnt a sound you could pretend was an animal or wind tai knew that particular voice heard it every night he found himself wishing hed been able to find and bury that one before leaving but there was no way to know where any given bones might lie that much hed learned in two years two years that were ending tonight he had to leave someone had been sent to kill him this far away he needed to learn why he drained his cup again he said i didnt know they would attack her neither did you coming back well of course or we wouldnt have come tai shook his head no that means your courage deserves honour something occurred to him sometimes wine sent your thoughts along channels youd not otherwise have found as when river reeds hide and then reveal a tributary stream in marshland is that why you let the young one shoot both arrows bytsans gaze in mingled light was unsettlingly direct tai was beginning to feel his wine the taguran said she was flat against the cabin they were going to crush the life from her why waste an arrow half an answer at best tai said wryly why waste a chance to give a soldier a tattoo and a boast the other man shrugged that too he did come back with me tai nodded bytsan said you ran outside knowing theyd help you an edge to his voice and why not they were listening to the cries outside right now and screams tai cast his mind back to the desperate moments after yan died i was running for the shovel bytsan sri nespo laughed a quick startling sound against kanlin swords tai found himself laughing too the wine was part of it and the aftermath of fear remembered hed expected to die hed have become one of the ghosts of kuala nor they drank again the screaming voice had stopped another bad one was beginning one of those that seemed to still be dying unbearably somewhere in the night it hurt your heart listening frayed the edges of your mind tai said do you think about death the other man looked at him every soldier does it was an unfair question this was a stranger of an enemy people not so long ago and likely again in years to come a bluetattooed barbarian living beyond the civilized world tai drank taguran wine was not going to replace the spiced or scented grape wine of the best houses in the north district but it was good enough for tonight bytsan murmured suddenly i said we had to talk told gnam that remember we arent talking enough a shame a shame yans buried out there hed have talked you to sleep if only to find a respite from his voice buried out there such a wrong place for a gentle garrulous man to lie and yan had come so far carrying what tidings tai didnt know he didnt even know he realized if his friend had passed the exams bytsan looked away gazing out a window at moonlight he said if someone sent an assassin they can send anotherwhen you get back or while you are on the way you know that he knew that bytsan said iron gate saw them come through they will ask where the two of them are ill tell them and they will send word to xinan tai nodded of course they would a kanlin warrior coming this far west as an assassin that had significance not empireshaking tai wasnt important enough but certainly worth a dispatch from a sleepy border fort it would go with the military post which was very fast bytsan said your mournings over then it will almost be time i get to xinan that where youll go have to because you do know who sent her he hadnt expected that it was xin lun who suggested it to me yans last words on earth in life under nine heavens i might know how to start finding out he might know more than that but he wasnt ready to think about it tonight i have another suggestion then said the taguran two of them trying to keep you alive he laughed briefly drained another cup my future seems to be bound up with yours shen tai and the gift youve been given you need to stay alive long enough to send for your horses tai considered that it made sense from bytsans point of viewyou didnt have to think hard to see the truth of it both of the tagurans suggestions had been good ones tai would not have thought of either he would need to get his subtlety back before he reached xinan where you could be exiled for bowing one time too many or too few or to the wrong person first he accepted both of the other mans ideas with one addition that seemed proper theyd finished the last of the flask put out the lights and had gone to bed towards what would soon enough be morning the moon over west the taguran had said softly from where he lay on the floor if id spent two years here i would think about death yes said tai starlight the voices outside rising and falling the star of the weaver maid had been visible earlier shining in a window far side of the sky river from her love they are mostly about sorrow out there arent they yes they would have killed her though yes tai recognized the guard above the gate hed come to the lake at least twice with the supplies they sent he didnt remember his name the commander was named lin fong he knew that a small crisp man with a round face and a manner that suggested that the fort at iron gate pass was only a way station an interlude in his career on the other hand the commander had come to kuala nor a few weeks after arriving at the fort last autumn in order to see for himself the strange man burying the dead there he had bowed twice to tai when hed left with the soldiers and cart and the supplies being sent had remained completely reliable an ambitious man lin fong and obviously aware during that visit to the lake of who tais father had been traces of arrogance but there was honour in him tai judged and a sense that the commander was aware of the history of this battleground among mountains not someone youd likely choose as a friend but that wasnt what he was here to be at iron gate he was standing impeccable in his uniform just inside the gate as it swung open it was just after dawn tai had slept through the first night travelling but had been awakened by wolves on the second not dangerously near or hungry as best he could judge but he had chosen to offer his prayers for his father in the darkness and ride on under stars instead of lying on high hard ground awake none of the kitan were easy with wolves in legend in life and tai was no exception he felt safer on horseback and he was already in love with bytsan sri nespos baycoloured sardian they didnt sweat blood the heavenly horsesthat was legend a poets imagebut if anyone had wanted to recite some of the elaborate verses about them tai would have been entirely happy to listen and approve hed ridden recklessly fast in the night the moon behind him borne by an illusion that the big horse could not put a hoof wrong that there was only joy in speed no danger in the canyons dark you could get yourself killed thinking that way of course he hadnt cared the pace was too purely intoxicating he was riding a sardian horse towards home in the night and his heart had been soaring if only for that time he had kept the taguran namedynlal meant spirit in their tonguewhich suited in many ways exchanging horses had been bytsans first proposal tai was going to need some mark of favour hed pointed out something that identified him alerted people to the truth of what hed been given one horse as a symbol of two hundred and fifty to come dynlal would also get him where he was going faster the promise of sardian horses to be claimed only by him was what might keep him alive induce others to join in tracking down those who obviously did not wish him to remain aliveand help tai determine why this was so it had made sense so also for tai did his modification of the suggestion hed written it out before they parted in the morning a document conveying to bytsan sri nespo captain in the taguran army his free choice of any three horses among the two hundred and fifty in exchange for his own mount surrendered at need and at request and in grateful recognition of courage shown against treachery at kuala nor arriving from kitai that last phrase would help the captain with his own commanders they both knew it nor had the taguran argued he was clearly relinquishing something that mattered a great deal to him with the big bay horse moments after starting into the sunrise running with the wind tai had begun to understand why this was so bytsans second suggestion had involved making explicit what might otherwise be dangerously unclear the taguran had taken his own turn with ink and paper at tais desk writing in kitan his calligraphy slow and emphatic the belownamed captain in the army of tagur has been entrusted with ensuring that the gift of sardian horses from the honoured and beloved princess chengwan offered by her own grace and with the lordly blessing of the lion sangrama in rygyal be transferred to the kitan shen tai son of general shen gao to him and to no one else the horses which presently number two hundred fifty will be pastured and maintained there had been more stipulating locationin taguran lands near the border close to the town of hsien in kitai some distance south of where they wereand detailing the precise circumstances under which the horses would be handed over these conditions were designed to ensure that no one could compel tai to sign instructions against his will there were in xinan men trained and often gifted in methods of inducing such signatures there were others equally skilled in fabricating them this letter would go with tai be handed to the commander at iron gate to be copied and the copy would proceed ahead of him by military post to the court it might make a difference might not of course but losing the empire those horses would very possibly cause any new assassin and those who paid him or her to be hunted down tortured for information and creatively disembowelled before being permitted to die tai had been aware even as he rode east and certainly now as he cantered dynlal through the open gate of the fort and reined up before lin fong in the main courtyard that a second assassin might be sent when word came back that the first one had failed what he had not expected was to see one waiting here at iron gate pass walking up behind the commander clad in black and bearing crossed kanlin swords in scabbards on her back she was smaller than the first woman had been but with the same lithe movements that walk almost marked someone as kanlin you learned those movements even a way of standing at stone drum mountain they made you dance there balanced on a ball tai stared at the woman her black hair was unbound falling to her waist she had just risen from sleep he realized didnt make her less dangerous he pulled his bow from the saddle sheath and nocked an arrow you kept arrows and bow ready in the mountains for wolves or the cats he didnt dismount he knew how to shoot from the saddle had been in the northern cavalry beyond the long wall and had trained at stone drum after you could find irony in that last if you were in a certain state of mind kanlins were being sent after him by someone the commander said what are you doing the woman stopped fifteen paces away she had wideset eyes and a full mouth given what she was fifteen paces might be too close if she had a dagger tai danced his horse backwards shes here to kill me he said calmly enough another kanlin tried by the lake we know about that commander lin said tai blinked but never took his eyes from the woman moving slowly she shrugged her leather straps off one shoulder and then the other keeping her hands visible all the time the swords dropped behind her into the dust she smiled he didnt trust that smile a crowd of soldiers had gathered in the courtyard a morning adventure there werent many of those here at the edge of the world how do you know about it tai asked the commander glanced briefly at the woman behind him he shrugged this one told us last night she came pursuing the other arrived at sunset would have ridden on by night towards you i told her to wait until this morning that if something unpleasant had happened at kuala nor it would have done so already since the others were days ahead of her he paused did something happen yes the commander was expressionless they are dead the fat scholar and the woman yes both of them the woman spoke for the first time her voice was low but clear in the dawn courtyard i regret to hear it you grieve for your companion tai was holding in anger she shook her head the smile had gone she had a clever alert face high cheekbones the unbound hair remained a distraction i was sent to kill her i grieve for the other one the fat scholar lin fong repeated the scholar was my friend said tai chou yan came a long way from the world he knew to tell me something that mattered did he the woman again did he tell you she stepped closer tai lifted a quick hand as he held the bow with the other she stopped smiled again with that wide mouth a smile from a kanlin warrior could be unsettling in and of itself tai thought she shook her head if i were here to kill you youd be dead by now i wouldnt have walked up like this you must know that you might want questions answered first he said coldly and you know that her turn to hesitate it pleased him shed been too sure of herself at stone drum you were taught how to disarm a person with words confuse or placate them it wasnt all blades and bows and spinning leaps that ended with a kick to the chest or head and often as not a death his friend was dead killed by one of these warriors he held that within himself a hard fury her gaze was appraising now but not in the way the other womans had been she wasnt sizing him up for a fight either she was biding her time at a momentary disadvantage or she was telling the truth about why she was here he needed to decide he could just shoot her he thought why would you be sent to kill another kanlin because she isnt kanlin the fortress commander turned and looked at her the woman said she went rogue half a year ago left her assigned sanctuary near xinan disappeared into the city started killing for a fee then was hired by someone we learned to travel here to do the same who hired her the girl shook her head i wasnt told he said she was a kanlin she wanted to fight me said the only reason she didnt was strict orders and you think those orders could have been given to someone still serving the mountain master shen tai really you were at stone drum you know better he looked from her to lin fong the commanders expression was alert this was all news to him of course and news was bright coinage this far west tai really didnt want his life discussed in an open courtyard she probably knew that he thought she had ignored his question about why shed been sent here that could be discretion or a way to get him into a smaller space his life had been very simple just a few days ago the commander can have someone search me she said in that low crisp voice it was as if shed read his thoughts she added i have a dagger in my right boot nothing else they can also tie my wrists so we can talk in a private place with the commander present or not as you wish no said lin fong glaring he wouldnt like a woman being so decisive no military officer would i will be present you do not set conditions here you are both under my jurisdiction and it seems people have been killed i have questions of my own there are reports to be filed there were always reports to be filed the empire could drown in the reports that were filed tai thought the woman shrugged tai had the feeling shed anticipated or even intended this he needed to make a decision he sheathed his arrow and bow looked up to his right the gaptoothed balding guard was still on the wall looking down tai gestured that one to look to my horse walk water feed him i remember that he knows horses the mans expression of joy would have been gratifying at any easier time he had a few moments alone to wash and change his clothes he switched from riding boots to brocaded slippers they provided a servantone of the border people serving the soldierstook his clothing and boots to clean them it had occurred to tai many years ago that one usually expected important decisions in life to emerge after long and complex thought sometimes this was so but on other occasions one might wake in the morning or finish drying ones hands and face in a dusty border fort with the abrupt intense realization that a choice had already been made all that was left was putting it into effect tai could see no clear pattern in his own life as to this nor was he able to say that morning why he was suddenly so sure of something a waiting soldier escorted him through two courtyards to the commanders reception pavilion at the eastern end of the compound he announced tais presence and drew back a canvas flap that covered the doorway blocking the wind tai walked in lin fong and the kanlin woman were already there tai bowed then sat with them on a raised platform in the centre of the room he settled himself on a mat crossing his legs there was tea unexpectedly at his elbow on a blue lacquered tray decorated with a painting of willow branches and two lines from a poem by chan du about willow trees the pavilion was sparely decorated it was also more beautiful than any space tai had entered in two years there was a palegreen vase on a low side table behind the commander tai stared at it for a long time too long probably his expression he thought wryly was probably something like the soldiers on the wall had been looking down at the horse that is a very fine piece of work he said lin fong smiled pleased and unable to hide it tai cleared his throat and bowed at the waist without rising untie her please or dont bind her on my account folly on the face of it he was alarmingly certain it wasnt he looked at the woman who had been carefully trussed at both ankles and wrists she was sitting placidly on the other side of the platform why commander lin however happy with a compliment to his taste evidently didnt like making adjustments she isnt about to attack me with you here hed realized this while washing his face the kanlins exist because they can be trusted by both court and army they have lasted six hundred years because of that but that trust is badly damaged if one of them kills the commander of a military fort or someone under his protection their sanctuaries their immunity could be destroyed and besides i think shes telling the truth the woman smiled again large eyes downcast as if the amusement was private the commander could be part of my plot she said looking down in the intimacy of the room out of the courtyard wind her low voice was unsettling it had been two years since hed heard this sort of voice tai thought but he isnt he said before commander lin could express outrage im not important enough or i wasnt before before what the other man said distracted from whatever hed been about to say tai waited lin fong looked at him a moment then nodded brusquely at a soldier the man stepped forward and began untying the woman he was careful not to step on the platform discipline was good here tai watched until the man was done and then continued to wait politely after a moment the commander took the hint and dismissed the two soldiers the woman crossed her legs neatly and rested her hands upon her knees she wore a hooded black tunic and black leggings for riding both of common hemp she had used the interval to pin up her hair she didnt rub her wrists though the ropes had been tight would have chafed her hands were small he noted you wouldnt have thought she could be a warrior he knew better your name is he asked wei song she said bowing slightly you are at stone drum mountain she shook her head impatiently hardly or i could not have been here so soon i am from the sanctuary near mawai the same as the rogue was before she left a short ride from xinan near a posting station inn and a celebrated hot springs retreat with its pavilions and pools and gardens for the emperor and his favourites tai had said something stupid stone drum one of the five holy mountains was far to the northeast before what please master shen the commander repeated you have not answered me he made some effort to keep irritation out of his voice but it was there a brisk fussy man an important person for tai just now tai turned to him it was time evidently he had a vivid sense of roads forking rivers branching one of those moments where the life that follows cannot be as it might otherwise have been i have been given a gift by the tagurans he said from their court our own princess princess chengwan has given you a personal gift astonishment barely controlled yes commander lin fong was clearly thinking hard because you were burying their dead the man might be in a dismal posting but he wasnt a fool tai nodded they have done me too much honour in rygyal too much honour they are barbarians commander lin said bluntly he lifted his porcelain bowl and sipped the hot spiced tea they have no understanding of honour perhaps said tai his voice carefully neutral then he told them about the horses and watched them both react chapter iv where are they these horses it was the right question of course the commander had gone pale was clearly thinking hard fighting agitation experience could only take you so far in dealing with some kinds of information two deep horizontal lines etched his forehead now lin fong looked afraid tai didnt entirely understand that but it was there to be seen the kanlin woman by contrast seemed to have withdrawn into repose attentive but unperturbed tai had been on stone drum mountain however he recognized this as a posture a way of trying to make herself tranquil in the act of seeming so which meant she wasnt she was very young wei song he realized suddenly younger than the assassin had been probably the same age as his sister i dont have them he said simply lin fongs eyes flashed i did see you come in i know that much irritation for some men was their response to strain youll never get to court alive with sardian horses unless you have an army escort the woman said and then youll be indebted to the army young but a quick brain working the commander glared you are all indebted to the army you would do well to remember it kanlin it begins tai thought the old old tale of the kitan people and their rivalries petty kingdoms warring with each other once ambitious men and women at the imperial court now military governors prefects mandarins rising through their nine ranks religious orders palace eunuchs legal advisers empresses and concubines and on and on all of them striving for eminence around the emperor who was the sun he had been back in the empire for part of a morning no more tai said the horses will be held at a fort across the border near hsien i have letters to be sent to court with the military post explaining this held by whom the commander working it through by the taguran captain from the pass above kuala nor hes the one who brought me word of the gift but then they can take them back keep them tai shook his head only if i die he reached into his tunic pocket and drew out the original letter from rygyal he had a sudden memory of reading it by the lake hearing the squabble of birds he could almost feel the wind princess chengwan signed this herself commander we must be careful not to insult her by suggesting theyd take them back lin fong cleared his throat nervously he almost reached for the letter but did not it would have been demeaning to tai if hed checked he was an irritable rigid man but not unaware of due courtesy even out here in the wilderness tai glanced across at the woman she was smiling a little at lin fongs discomfiture not bothering to hide it he added they will keep them unless i come myself it was what hed worked out with bytsan sri nespo at the end of a long night in the cabin ah said wei song looking up that is how you stay alive how i try her gaze was thoughtful a difficult gift that puts your life at risk the commanders turn to shake his head his mood seemed to have changed difficult it is more than that this is this is a tailstar burning across the sky a good omen or a bad one depending on what it traverses and depending on who reads the signs tai said quietly he didnt like alchemists or astrologers as it happened commander lin nodded these horses should be gloriousfor you for all of us but these are challenging times to which you are returning xinan is a dangerous place it always has been tai said more so now said the commander everyone will want your horses they might tear you apart for them he sipped his tea i do have a thought he was clearly thinking very hard tai almost felt sorry for the man you were posted to a quiet border fort sought to do well there maintain order efficiency move onwards in due course then two hundred and fifty heavenly horses arrived more or less a tailstar indeed a comet streaking from the west i will be grateful to learn any thoughts you have he said he felt formality reasserting within himself a way of dealing with unease it had been so long since hed been part of this intricate world of any world beyond lake and meadow and graves he did think he knew what was coming some moves in a game could be anticipated your father was a great leader mourned by all of us in the west especially you have the army in your blood son of general shen accept these dragon steeds in the name of the second military district the one nearest kuala nor itself our military governor is at chenyao i will give you an escort an honour guard present yourself to governor xu offer the heavenly horses can you imagine the rank you will be given the honour and glory as expected and it did explain the mans fear lin fong was obviously aware that if he didnt at least try to keep the horses for the army here it would be a mark against his own record fairly or not tai looked at him in some ways the idea was tempting an immediate resolution in others he shook his head and i do this commander lin before appearing at court before relating to our serene and glorious emperor or his advisers how the princess his daughter has so honoured me before also telling the first minister i do imagine prime minister chin hai will have views on this and before letting any other military governors know of these horses the kanlin woman spoke softly but very clearly the army is not undivided commander do you not think for example that roshan in the northeast will have thoughts as to where they belong he commands the imperial stables now does he not do you think his views could matter is it possible that master shen coming from two years of isolation needs to learn a little more before surrendering such a gift to the first man who asks for it the look the commander shot her was venomous you he snapped have no status in this room you are here only to be questioned about the assassin and that will come it will i hope tai agreed he took a breath but i would like to give her status if she will accept i wish to hire her as my guard going forward from here i accept the woman said quickly her gaze met his she didnt smile but you thought she was here to kill you the commander protested i did now i believe otherwise why tai looked across at the woman again she sat gracefully eyes lowered again seemingly composed he didnt think she was he considered his answer then he allowed himself a smile chou yan would have enjoyed this moment he thought would have absolutely savoured it then told the tale endlessly embellishing it differently each time thinking of his friend tais smile faded he said because she bound up her hair before coming here the commanders expression was diverting she because tai kept his voice grave this remained an important man for him for the next little while lin fongs dignity had to be protected her hands and feet are free and she has at least two weapons in her hair the kanlin are trained to kill with those if she wanted me dead i would be already so would you if she were another rogue she wouldnt care about the consequences to stone mountain of killing you she might even manage to escape three weapons wei song said she pulled one of her hairpins out and laid it down it rested gleaming on the platform and escape is considered preferable but is not expected with certain assignments i know that said tai he was watching the commander and he saw a change it was as if the man settled into himself accepted that he had done what he could would be able to absorb and deflect whatever criticism came from superiors this was beyond him larger by far than a border fortress the court had been invoked lin fong sipped his tea calmly poured more from the darkgreen ceramic pot on the lacquered tray at his side tai did the same thing from his own he looked at the woman the hairpin rested in front of her long as a knife the head of it was silver in the shape of a phoenix you will at least attend upon xu bihai the governor in chenyao lin fongs expression was earnest this was a request no more on the other hand the commander did not suggest he visit the prefect in chenyao army against civil service endlessly some things never changed year over year season after season there was no need to comment and if he also went to see the prefect that was his own affair tai said simply of course i will if governor xu is gracious enough to receive me i know that he knew my father i will hope to receive counsel from him the commander nodded i will send my own letter as to counsel you have been much removed have you not very much said tai moons above a mountain bowl waxing and waning silver light upon a cold lake snow and ice wildflowers thunderstorms the voices of the dead on the wind lin fong looked unhappy again tai found himself beginning to like the man unexpectedly we live in difficult days shen tai the borders are peaceful the empire is expanding xinan is the glory of the world but sometimes such glory the woman remained very still listening my father used to say that times are always difficult tai murmured for those living through them the commander considered this there are degrees polarities the stars find alignments or they do not this was rote from a third dynasty text tai had studied it for the examinations lin fong hesitated for one thing the first thing the honoured empress is no longer in the taming palace she has withdrawn to a temple west of xinan tai drew a breath it was important news though not unexpected and the lady wen jian he asked softly she has been proclaimed as precious consort and installed in the empresss wing of the palace i see said tai and then because it was important to him and the ladies attending upon the empress what of them the commander shrugged i wouldnt know id assume they went with her at least some of them tais sister had gone to xinan three years before to serve the empress as a ladyinattendance a privilege granted to shen gaos daughter he needed to find out what had happened to limei his older brother would know his older brother was an issue that is indeed a change as you said what else must i know lin fong reached for his tea cup put it down he said gravely you named the prime minister that was an error alas first minister chin hai died last autumn tai blinked shaken he hadnt been ready for this at all it felt for a moment as if the world rocked as if some tree of colossal size had fallen and the fort was shaking with the reverberation wei song spoke up it is generally believed though we have heard it suggested otherwise that he died of an illness contracted with an autumn chill the commander looked narrowly at her we have heard it suggested otherwise these could be called words of treason commander lin said nothing however it could never have been said that the army held any love for emperor taizus brilliant allcontrolling first minister chin hai tall thinbearded thinshouldered famously suspicious had governed under the emperor through a quartercentury of growing kitan wealth and fabulous expansion autocratic ferociously loyal to taizu and the celestial throne hed had spies everywhere could exileor executea man for saying something too loudly in a wine shop overheard by the wrong person a man hated and terribly feared and possibly indispensable tai waited looking at the commander another name was coming now had to be coming commander lin sipped from his tea he said the new first minister appointed by the emperor in his wisdom is wen zhou of of distinguished lineage the pause was deliberate of course is his a name you might know it was of course it was wen zhou was the precious consorts cousin but that wasnt the thing tai closed his eyes he was remembering a scent green eyes yellow hair a voice and if someone should ask me should propose to make me his personal courtesan or even a concubine he opened his eyes they were both looking at him curiously i know the man he said commander lin fong of iron gate fortress would not have named himself a philosopher he was a career soldier and had made that choice early in life following older brothers into the army still over the years he had come to realize with proper humility that he was more inclined to certain ways of thinking and perhaps to an appreciation of beauty that went deeper in him than in most of his fellow soldiersand then fellow officersas he rose somewhat through the ranks from humble beginnings he enjoyed among other things civilized conversation so much sipping wine alone in his chamber late at night lin fong acknowledged that a disturbing measure of what had to be called excitement was keeping him awake shen tai the son of the late general shen was the sort of person lin fong would have wished to keep at iron gate for days or even weeks such was the spark of the mans thinking and the unusual pattern of his life their conversation over dinner had forced him to acknowledge ruefully how impoverished his daily routines and company were here hed asked the man an obvious to him question you have now gone twice beyond the borders for extended periods the ancient masters teach that danger to the soul lies in doing that he had offered a smile to take any sting or offence from the words some teach that not all that is so lin fong had murmured gesturing to a servant to pour more wine he was a little out of his depth when it came to variant teachings of the ancient masters a soldier did not have time to learn these things shen tai had looked thoughtful however the oddly deepset eyes revealing a mind working on the question courteously hed said the first time commander i was a very young officer i went north among the bogu because i was ordered there thats all i doubt respectfully you would have chosen to come to iron gate had your wishes been considered so he had noticed fong had laughed a little selfconsciously it is an honourable posting hed protested of course it is after a short silence fong had said i take your point of course still having been beyond the empire once without any choice of your own the second time unhurried unruffled a man of obvious breeding the second time i was honouring my father that is why i went to kuala nor there were no other ways to honour him im sure there were was all shen tai said fong had cleared his throat embarrassed he was too hungry for such exchanges hed realized too starved for intelligent talk it could make you cross social boundaries hed bowed this shen tai was a complex man but he was leaving in the morning to pursue a life that was unlikely ever to bring the two of them into contact again with reluctance but an awareness of what was proper the commander had turned the conversation to the matter of the tagurans and their fortress north of the lake what shen tai could tell him of that the tagurans after all were within his present sphere of responsibility and would be until he was posted elsewhere some men seemed able to slide in and out of society this man appeared to be one of them lin fong knew that he himself was not and never would be he had too great a need for security routines for such uncertainty but shen tai did make him aware that there were or might be alternative ways to live it probably did help he thought to have had a left side commander for a father alone in his chamber later that night he sipped his wine he wondered if the other man had even noticed that theyd been drinking tea earlier how unusual that was out here it was a new luxury just beginning to be taken up in xinan imported from the far southwest yet another consequence of peace and trade under emperor taizu he had heard about the drink from correspondents and asked for some to be sent he very much doubted the new custom had been adopted by many other commanders in their fortresses hed even ordered special cups and trays paid for them himself he wasnt sure he liked the taste of the drink even sweetened with mountain honey but he did enjoy the idea of himself as a man in tune with court and city culture even here on a desolate border where it was almost impossible to find a man worth talking to what did you do when faced with this as your life you reminded yourself over and again that you were a civilized man in the most civilized empire the world had ever known times were changing the prime ministers death the new first minister even the nature and composition of the armyall these foreign troops now so different from when lin fong had first enlisted there were great and growing tensions among military governors and the emperor himself aging withdrawing with who knew what to follow commander lin did not like change it was a flaw in his nature perhaps but a man could cling to basic certainties to survive such a flaw couldnt he didnt you have to do that there was only one private chamber for guests at iron gate the fort wasnt a place where distinguished visitors came the trade routes were to the north jade gate pass aptly named guarded those and the wealth that passed through that was the glamour posting in this part of the world the guest room was small an interior chamber on the second level of the main building no windows no courtyard below tai regretted not having chosen to share a communal room where there might at least be air on reflection however it hadnt been an option you needed to make choices that reflected your status or you confused those dealing with you hed had to take the private chamber he was an important man he had blown out his candle some time ago the chamber was hot airless black he was having trouble falling asleep his thoughts were of chou yan who was dead there were no ghostvoices in the darkness here only the night watch on the walls faintly calling there hadnt been ghosts in the canyon either the two nights hed spent coming this way he hadnt been used to that stillness after sunset he wasnt used to not seeing the moon or stars or if it came to that to having a young woman just the other side of his door on guardat her absolute insistencein the corridor he didnt need a guard here tai had told her she hadnt even bothered to reply her expression suggested that she was of the view shed been retained by a fool they hadnt talked about her fee tai knew the usual kanlin rates but had a feeling he also knew what she would say when that came up something to do with her failure to be at kuala nor in time to save him being required by honour to serve him now he needed to learn more about that first woman at the lake most importantly who had sent her and why he had a nameyan had named their scholar friend xin lunand tai also had a growing apprehension about another the fee for wei song hardly mattered in any case he could afford a guard now or twenty he could hire a private dui of fifty cavalry and dress them in chosen colours he could borrow any sum he needed against the sardian horses he wasno other way to shape the thought no avoiding ita wealthy man now if he survived to deal with the horses in xinan if he sorted out how to deal with the horses his family had always been comfortable but shen gao had been a fighting officer commanding in the field not an ambitious one at court straining towards recognition and the prizes that came with it tais older brother was different but he wasnt ready to start thinking about liu tonight his mind drifted back to the woman outside his door that didnt lead him towards sleep either theyd put a pallet in the corridor for her theyd be used to doing that guests of any stature would have servants outside or even inside this chamber it just wasnt how he thought of himself a guest of stature the other kanlinthe rogue according to wei songhad likely slept out there when yan was in this same bed a few nights earlier you could look at that as symmetry two wellbalanced lines in a verse or as something darker this was life not a poem and yan loyal gentle almost always laughing lay in a grave three days ride back through the ravine west of iron gate west of jade gate pass therell be no old friends for tai there would be one there forever now he listened but heard nothing from the corridor he couldnt remember if hed barred the door it hadnt been a habit for some time it had also been more than two years since hed been close to a woman let alone in the stillness after dark against his will he found himself picturing her oval face wide mouth alert eyes amusement in them under arching eyebrows the eyebrows her own not painted in the xinan fashion or what had been the fashion two years ago it had likely changed it always changed wei song was slender with quick movements long black hair it had been unbound when first seen this morning too much that last recollection for a man whod been alone as long as he had his mind seemed to be sailing down moonlit river channels pulled towards memory as to the sea unsurprisingly he found himself thinking of spring rains golden hair also unbound and thenunexpectedlythere was an image of a different woman entirely it was because of what hed been told this afternoon he suspected that he found himself with a clear memory of the precious consort the emperors own dearly beloved concubine wen jian the one time hed seen her close a jadeandgold enchantment on a springtime afternoon in long lake park laughing on horseback a ripple in air like birdsong a shimmer about her an aura appallingly desirable unattainable not even safe for dreaming about or reveries and her handsome silkensmooth cousin he had learned today was now first minister of the empire had been since autumn not a good man to have as a rival for a woman if tai was even halfway intelligent in possession of the most basic selfpreservation instincts he told himself he would stop thinking about spring rain and her scent and skin and voice right now long before he came anywhere near to xinan not easily done she was from sardia as the horses were objects of desire coming as so many precious things seemed to do from the west it was another existence entirely this world of men and women and desire tai thought lying in darkness at the empires edge that truth was beginning to come back along with so much else one more aspect of what he was returning to it was unsettling pushed away sleep twisting with all the other disturbances in his mind like silkworm threads inattentively spooled and he was still on the border in a backofbeyond fortress what was going to happen as he rode east on his baycoloured sardian to the brilliant deadly world of the court he turned restlessly hearing the mattress and bedposts creak he wished there were a window he could stand there draw breaths of clear air look up at summer stars seek order and answers in the sky as above so below we are a mirror in our lives of the nine heavens he felt confined in here fought an apprehension of permanent enclosure restraint death someone had tried to kill him before theyd known about the horses why why would he have been important enough to kill abruptly he sat up swung his legs over the side of the bed sleep was vanishingly far away i can bring you water or wine her hearing had to be extremely good and she couldnt have been asleep you are a guard not a servant he said through the closed door he heard her laughter i have been retained by people who saw little distinction i am not one of those ah i shall light an ancestor candle in gratitude gods above he wasnt ready for this go to sleep tai said we start early laughter again ill be awake she said but if you cant sleep because of fears tonight youll slow us down tomorrow he really wasnt ready for this there was a silence tai was acutely aware of her presence out there after a moment he heard her say forgive me that was presumptuous accept that i am bowing to you respectfully however might you have declined the princesss gift he had been thinking the same thing for three days that didnt make it easier to hear someone else ask it i couldnt he said it was odd talking through door and wall someone could be listening easily enough he doubted it however not here they were offered to me by royalty you cant refuse i wouldnt know her gift will probably kill you i am aware of that tai said it is a terrible thing to do to someone youth in the voice now in that aggrieved sense of injustice but her words were true after a fashion the princess would not have meant for that to happen it would not even have occurred to her that it might they know nothing of balance wei song said from the corridor she was kanlin balance was the essence of their teaching the tagurans you mean no royalty everywhere he thought about it i think being royal means you need not think that way another silence he had a sense of her working it through she said we are taught that the emperor in xinan echoes heaven rules with its mandate balance above echoed below or the empire falls no his own thought from moments before there were women in the north districtnot many but a fewwho could talk this way over wine or after lovemaking he hadnt expected it here in a kanlin guard he said i mean it differently about how they think why should our princess in rygyal or any prince have an idea what might happen to a common man if he is given a gift this extravagant what in their lives allows them to imagine that oh yes he found himself waiting she said well for one thing that means the gift is about them not you he nodded then remembered she couldnt see him go to sleep he said again a bit abruptly he heard her laugh a richness in the dark he pictured her as hed first seen her hair down her back in the morning courtyard just risen from her bed pushed that image away there would be women and music in chenyao he thought five days from now perhaps four if they went quickly he lay down again on the hard pillow the door opened tai sat up much more abruptly than the first time he gathered the bed linens to cover his nakedness though it was dark in the room no light came in with her from the corridor he sensed rather than saw her bowing that was proper nothing else about this was you should bar your door she said quietly her voice seemed to have altered or was that his imagination im out of the habit he cleared his throat what is this a guards sweep of the chamber am i to expect it every night she didnt laugh no i have something to tell you we were talking this is private you think someone is listening here in the middle of the night i dont know the army does use spies you need not fear for your virtue master shen a hint of asperity tartness returning you dont fear for yours im the one with a blade he knew what bawdy jokes would have been made in the north district as an immediate response to that he could almost hear yans voice he kept silent waiting he was aroused distracted by that she said softly you havent asked who paid me to follow the assassin suddenly he wasnt distracted any more kanlins dont tell who pays them we will if instructed when hired you know that he didnt actually he hadnt reached that level in twenty months with them he cleared his throat again he heard her move nearer the bed a shape against darkness the sound of her breathing and a scent in the room now that she was closer he wondered if her hair was down he wished there were a candle then decided it was better that there wasnt she said i was to catch up to the two of them and kill her then bring your friend to you i followed their path to your home we didnt know where you were or id have come directly on the imperial road and waited for them here you went to my fathers house yes but i was too many days behind tai heard the words falling in the black like drops of water from broad leaves after rain he felt a very odd tingling at his fingertips imagined he heard a different sound a faroff temple bell among pines he said slowly no one in xinan knew where i was who told you your mother and your younger brother not liu he wasnt there she said the bell seemed to have become a clear sound in his head he wondered if she could hear it a childish thought im sorry the woman said he thought of his older brother it was time to begin doing that it cant be liu he said a little desperately if he was behind this he knew where id gone he could have had the assassin and yan go straight to kuala nor not if he didnt want it known he was behind this shed had more time to sort this through he realized and in any case she hesitated yes his voice really did sound strange now i am to tell you that it isnt certain your brother hired the assassin he may have only given information others acting upon it i am to tell you very well who hired you then i am asking who told you all of this and so speaking formally now almost invisible in the room a voice in blackness she said i was instructed to convey to you the respect and the humble greetings of the newest concubine in the household of the illustrious wen zhou first minister of kitai he closed his eyes spring rain it had happened she had thought it might she had talked to him about it if zhou offered the demanded price to her owner whatever it was rain would have had essentially no choice a courtesan could refuse to be bought by someone privately but her life in the north district would be ruined if she cost an owner that much money and this was the first minister the sum offered tai was quite certain would have been more than rain could have earned from years of nights spent playing music for or slipping upstairs with candidates for the examinations or slipping towards loving them he was breathing carefully it still didnt make sense neither his brother nor the first minister had had any reason to wantlet alone needtai dead he didnt matter enough you could dislike a man a brother see him as a rivalin various waysbut murder was extreme and a risk there had to be something more there is more she said he waited he saw only an outline the shape of her as she bowed again your brother is in xinan has been since autumn tai shook his head as if to clear it he cant be our mourning isnt over yet liu was a civil servant at court highranking but he would still be whipped with the heavy rod and exiled from the capital if anyone reported him for breaching ancestor worship and his rivals would do that for army officers mourning is only ninety days you know it my brother isnt tai stopped he drew a breath was all of this his own fault going away for two years sending no word back receiving no tidings concentrating on mourning and solitude and private action shaped to his fathers long grief or perhaps hed really been concentrating on avoiding a toocomplex world in xinan of court and of men and women dust and noise where he hadnt been ready to decide what he was or would be autumn shed said autumn what had happened in the fall he had just been told today that there it was it fit slid into place like the rhyme in a couplet hes advising wen zhou he said flatly hes with the first minister he could see her only as a form in the dark yes your brother is his principal adviser first minister wen appointed shen liu as a commander of one thousand in the flying dragon army in xinan symbolic rank symbolic soldiers an honorary palace guard sons of aristocrats or senior mandarins or their cousins on display gorgeously dressed at parades and polo matches ceremonies and festivals famously inept in real combat but as a way to shorten mourning with military rank to bring a man you wanted to the capital im sorry she said again tai realized hed been silent a long time he shook his head he said it is a great honour for our family i am still not worth killing wen zhou has power and spring rain is his now my brother has his position with him and his rank whatever it is theres nothing i could door would doabout any of this there is another piece here there has to be do you did rain know anything more carefully she said lady lin chang said you would ask me that i was to tell you that she agrees but did not know what this might be when she learned of the plot to have you killed and sent for a kanlin lin chang she wouldnt have a north district name any more not as a concubine in the city mansion of the first minister of the empire you werent called spring rain there he wondered how many women there were what her life was like shed taken a tremendous risk for him hiring her own kanlin he had no idea how shed done it it wouldnt be difficult for them to figure out who might have sent this woman after the other if perhaps it is best you didnt reach me in time he said theres no easy way to trace you back to her now i found and hired you on the road the assassin was killed by taguran soldiers i thought that as well she said although it is a mark against my name that i failed you didnt fail he said impatiently i could have somehow found out come straight here and given her away you just said that kanlin honour is one thing foolishness is another he heard her shift her feet i see and you will decide which is which your friend might be alive if id been quicker it was true it was unhappily true but then rains life would be at risk i dont think you are meant to talk to me that way my most humble apologies she said in a tone that belied them accepted tai murmured ignoring the voice it was suddenly enough i have much to think about you may go she didnt move for a moment he could almost feel her looking towards him we will be in chenyao in four or five days you will be able to have a woman there that will help im sure the tone was too knowing for words a kanlin trait he remembered wei song bowedhe saw that muchand went out a creaking of the floorboards he heard the door shut behind her he was still holding the bed linens to cover his nakedness he realized that his mouth was open he closed it the ghosts he thought a little desperately had been simpler chapter v some decisions for an officer accustomed to making them were not difficult especially with a night to consider the situation the commander of iron gate fort made clear to his guest from kuala nor that the five guards being assigned to him were not to be seen as discretionary his premature death should it occur would be blamedwithout any doubton the incompetent fortress commander who permitted him to ride east with only a single small female kanlin guard in the courtyard immediately after the morning meal the commander indicated courteous but unsmiling that he was not yet ready to commit an ordered suicide and destroy the prospects of his children should a tragic event overtake shen tai on the road master shen would be properly escorted military staging posts would be made available to him so that he might spend his nights there on the way to the prefecture city of chenyao and word of the horsesas discussedwould precede him to xinan it was possible that the military governor would wish to assign further soldiers as escorts when shen tai reached chenyao he was naturally free to make his own decision about sending the five horsemen back to iron gate at that time but commander lin presumed to express the hope he would retain them having come to see their loyalty and competence the unspoken thought was that their presence entering into the capital might be some reminder of the priority of iron gate in the matter of the horses and their eventual safe arrival one day in the future it was obvious that their guest was unhappy with all of this he showed signs of a temper it might have to do commander lin thought with his having been solitary for so long but if that was it the man was going to have to get out of that state of mind and the quicker the better this morning was a good time to start and when the kanlin guard also made clear that she could not be held accountable for guarding shen tai alone especially since the sardian horse he himself was riding was so obvious an incitement to theft and murder the late generals son acceded he did so withit had to be admittedgrace and courtesy he remained an odd difficult fellow to pin down lin fong could see why the man had left the army years ago the military preferredinvariablythose who could be readily defined assigned roles understood and controlled this one intense and observant more arresting than conventionally attractive in appearance had had a brief military service with a cavalry posting beyond the long wall and then there had been a period among the kanlin on stone drum mountain there had to be a story to that he had been studying for the civil service examinations in xinan when his father died more than a sufficiency of careers already for a stillyoung man lin fong would have thought it spoke to something erratic in him perhaps shen tai alsoand this signifiedhad evidently had dealings with the new first minister not necessarily cordial that was problematic or it might be i know the man did not offer much but the tone in which it had been spoken did for someone inclined to listen for nuance considering all of this commander lin had sometime in the night made his decisions these included offering a considerable sum from his own funds to the other man he named it a loana facesaving gesturemaking clear that he expected reimbursement at some point but stressing that a man travelling with the tidings shen tai carried could hardly undertake such a journey or arrive at court without access to money it would be undignified and perplexing to others a discord would emerge between his present circumstance and the futures promise that would unsettle those he met in challenging times it was important to avoid such imbalances the solution was obvious shen tai needed funds for the moment and lin fong was honoured to be in a position to assist what was left to discuss between civilized men whatever the future would bring it would bring the commander said men made wagers with their judgment their allegiances their resources commander lin was making one this morning if shen tai died on the road or in xinan distinctly possible there was still a distinguished family to approach for the return of his money that didnt need to be said of course one of the pleasures of dealing with intelligent men lin fong decided watching seven people ride out the eastern gate in earlymorning sunlight was how much did not have to be spoken the five soldiers represented protection for shen tai and for the second districts interests the strings of cash were fongs own investment it was frustrating had been from the beginning to be tied down in this impossibly isolated place but when that was the case and there was nothing to be done about it a man cast his lines like a fisherman in a stream and waited to see if anything chanced to bite he had done one other thing was quietly pleased with himself for thinking of it shen tai now carried documents and so did the couriers who had already ridden out establishing that the commander of iron gate fort had made him an officer of cavalry in the second military district currently on leave to attend to personal affairs if he was an officer shen tais mourning period was now over he was free to return to xinan this was commander lin had pointed out not trivial if there had been people willing to kill him even before the horses they would hardly hesitate to invoke failure to honour ancestral rites to discredit him or even smooth the way towards confiscating his possessions which might include you could say a great deal lin fong had always believed with properly chosen silences shen tai had hesitated he had prominent cheekbones those unusually deepset eyes a suggestion of foreign blood a way of pressing his lips together when in thought eventually he had bowed and expressed his thanks an intelligent man no doubting it the commander stood in the easternmost courtyard to see them leave the gates swung closed were barred with the heavy wooden beam they didnt need to do that no one came this way no dangers loomed but it was the proper thing to do and lin fong believed in acting properly rituals and regulations were what kept life from spinning towards chaos as he walked back to deal with paperwork there was always paperwork he heard a soldier on the wall begin to sing and then others joined him for years on guard in iron gate pass we have watched the green grass change to snow the wind that has come a thousand li beats at the fortress battlements the air felt unnervingly still all the rest of that day towards evening a thunderstorm finally came surging from the south sheets of lightning shattering the sky a heavy percussive rain fell filling the cisterns and wells making muddy lakes in the courtyards while thunder rolled and boomed it passed as storms always passed this one continued north boiling away as quickly as it had come a low lateday sun returned shining red down the wet ravine that led to kuala nor the storm explained his daylong feeling of brittle tension commander lin decided he felt better for the realization he preferred when there were explanations for what occurredin the sky on earth within the loneliness of the self their path trended downwards out of the mountain foothills to grain fields and hamlets and eventually through a lowlying marshland south of the river this was tiger country they posted guards the one night they chose to camp between posting stations heard the creatures roaring but never saw one there was some tension between the soldiers and the woman but no more than might be expected wei song kept mostly to herself riding at the front that was part of the problemher taking the leadbut once tai realized that he turned it into an order he gave her and the men from the fort accepted it that way she kept her hair tightly coiled her posture alert her head was always moving as she scanned the road ahead and the land to either side she said almost nothing at night at campfire or the inns there were enough of themseven well armedthat they hadnt feared to light a fire when they camped though there would be bandits in this countryside too as they descended riding east the air felt heavier to tai he had been in the mountains for so long one morning he caught up to the woman rode beside her she gave him a glance then looked ahead again be patient she murmured chenyao tonight or early tomorrow at the latest the soldiers can surely tell you the best house for girls he sawcouldnt missthe amusement in her face this did need to be dealt with at least it felt that way to him but how would it satisfy you he asked earnestly if i slake my passion with a courtesan leaving you to weep unassuaged on some marble stair she did flush it made him feel pleased then slightly contrite but only slightly she had started this in his room back at the fort he knew who had to be behind what this one had said then about women was it normal for rain to have confided in a hired bodyguard the intimate nature of the person shed be protecting he didnt think so i will manage to control my longing the woman said looking straight ahead im sure you will you seem wellenough trained we could have the others wait take a short ride together past those trees she didnt flush again youll do better in chenyao she said they had entered more densely populated country tai saw mulberry trees and a path leading south towards a silk farmthe buildings were hidden behind the trees but a banner was visible he had spent three weeks on one of those years ago obscurely curious or without direction more accurately there had been a period in his life when he was like that after his time in the north beyond the long wall some things had happened to him there he remembered the sound in the room where the silkworms were kept on stacked trays and fed day and night hour by hour on white mulberry leaves a noise like rain on a roof endlessly while that happened in that time of needful important perfection the temperature was controlled all smells were prevented from entering the room all drafts of wind even lovemaking in chambers nearby was done without sound lest the silkworms be frightened or disturbed he wondered if this kanlin woman knew this he wondered why he cared shortly after that a fox appeared at the edge of the trees alongside the road to their right wei song stopped throwing up a quick hand she turned in the saddle eyed the animal one of the men laughed but another made a gesture averting danger tai looked at the woman surely not he exclaimed you think it a daiji hush it is beyond foolish to name them she said and which of us do you think a foxwoman would be here for i dont think shed be here at all tai said i dont think every animal seen by the woods is a spiritworld creature not every animal she said what next the fifth dragon appears in a red sky and the ninth heaven falls no she said looking away it was unexpected that this crisp composed kanlin warrior would so obviously believe in foxwoman legends she was still watching the fox a stab of colour by the woods it was looking back at them tai saw but that was normal riders were a possible threat needed to be observed you should not be so careless speaking of spirits naming their names wei song said softly so that only tai heard we cannot understand everything about the world and that last phrase took him hard sent him spinning back a long way the fox withdrew into the woods they rode on the only other time hed been in command of cavalry had been north of the wall on campaign among the nomads hed led fifty soldiers not just five riders as now command of a dui had been more than he deserved but tai had been young enough to feel that his fathers fame and rank had simply opened a doorway for him to show what he could do what he honestly merited hed welcomed the chance to prove himself he didnt want to dwell on it now all these years after but being among soldiers again riding in open country towards a changed life seemed to make it inevitable that his thoughts would drift that time among the bogu had begun the changes in his life before that hed thought he knew what his course would be after he was shaken unsure adrift for a long time hed told what had happened how it had ended as best he could first to his superior officers and then to his father when they were both home not his brothers one was too young the other not a confidant hed been permitted to honourably resign rank and post leave the army it was unusual going to stone drum mountain some time later had been a useful perhaps even an appropriate next stage though he doubted the kanlin masters on the mountain saw it that way since hed left them too but after what had happened on the northern steppes that autumn it had not been considered unexpected that a young man would want to spend time searching for spiritual guidance discipline austerity tai remembered being surprised that his military superiors had believed his northern tale and even more at the hint of understanding among them understanding was not seen as a strength let alone a virtue in the higher ranks of the kitan army only later did he realize that he and his men might not have been the first or the only ones to encounter some terrifying strangeness among the bogu hed wondered over the years about other stories no one ever told him names or what had happened he was not blamed for what had happened that had also surprised him it still did military rank carried responsibilities consequences but it seemed the official view was that some encounters between civilized men and savagery in barbarian lands were not to be anticipated or controlled by any officer ordinary soldiers conduct could break down in such places the kitan felt a defining superiority and contempt for those beyond their borders but also fear whenever they left home even if that was denied it made for a dangerous intermingling for a long time their armies had been going among the nomads to ensure the succession of the chieftainthe kaghanthey favoured once you went north of the wall and its watchtowers you were living in the open or in isolated garrison forts among the bogu or the shuoki fighting beside or against the barely human it was unreasonable to expect men to conduct themselves as if they were doing domestic duty on the great canal or among summer rice fields guarding peasants against bandits or tigers manipulating the bogu succession was important the taming palace had a considerable interest in who ruled the nomads and how willing they were to offer docility along the border and their thickmaned horses in exchange for empty honorary titles lengths of lesser silk and the promise of support against the next usurper unless of course the next usurper made more attractive overtures the nomads grazing lands fractured among rival tribes stretched from the wall all the way to the bonecold north among birch and pine forests beyond which the sun was said to disappear all winter and never go down in summer those farthest icelands didnt matter except as a source of fur and amber what mattered was that on their nearer margins the nomads lands bordered kitai itselfand ran alongside the silk roadsall the way from the deserts to the eastern sea the long wall kept the nomads out most of the time but the northern fork of the great trade routes curved up through the steppes and so the lucrative flow of luxuries into the glorious kitan empire depended to a great degree on cameltrains being safe from harassment the taguran empire in the west was another threat of course and required different solutions but for some time the tagurans had been quiet trading for themselves with those taking the southern branch of the route exacting tolls and duties in faroff fortresses they controlled acquiring sardian horses xinan wasnt happy about this but could live with it or so it had been decided tagur and its king had been bought off from worse with among other things a slender kitan princess in the aftermath of wars that had drained both empires peace on his various borders might reduce an emperors chances of glory but emperor taizu had reigned for a long time and had won battles enough wealth and comfort the building of his own magnificent tombtobe north of xinan colossal beyond words overshadowing his fathers languid days and nights with his precious consort and the music she made for an aging emperor these appeared to be adequate compensation let wen jians sleek clever cousin zhou be first minister if he wished and if she wished it let him be the one to sort through after a fortyyear reign the complexities of court and army and barbarians one could grow weary of these the emperor had a woman for the ages making music for him dancing for him he had rituals to follow and carefully measured powders to consumewith herin pursuit of longedfor immortality he might never even need his tomb if the three stars of the hunters belt the asterism of this ninth dynasty could be aligned by alchemists with the emperors merit and his desire as for ambitious younger men in the empire well there had been steady fighting among the bogu against their eastern rivals the shuoki and in their own internal tribal wars and these continued military officers and youthful aristocrats and brave men of no particular birth had always been able to assuage a hunger for blood and swordglory somewhere for this time it was in the north where the emptiness of the grasslands could dwarf a man or change his soul for shen tai second son of general shen gao that last had been what had happened years ago during an autumn among the nomads it was explained to them that evil spirits sent by tribal enemies had afflicted the soul of meshag the son of hurok hurok had been the tamings chosen kaghan the man they were in the steppe lands to support his eldest son a man in the prime of health had fallen suddenly gravely illunresponsive barely breathingin the midst of a campaign it was determined that shamans of the enemy had invoked dark spirits against him so the nomads told the kitan soldiers among them the imperial officers did not know how that understanding had been arrived at or why the alleged magic was directed at the son and not the father though some of them had views by then as to which was the better man this business of bogu magicshamans animal totems spirit journeys from the bodywas simply too alien too barbaric for words it was only reported to them as a courtesy along with what apparently was going to be done in a desperate effort to make the sick man well this last information had compelled some hard thinking among the army leaders sent north from kitai hurok was important and therefore so was his son the father had sent private earnests of allegiance and offerings to the long wall in the springgood horses and wolf pelts and two young womenhis own daughters apparentlyto join the emperors ten thousand concubines in their palace wing hurok it emerged was willing to contemplate a revolt against the ruling kaghan his brotherinlaw dulan dulan had not sent as many horses or furs instead his envoys had brought weak smallboned horses some with colic to the wide northern loop of the golden river where the exchange was done each spring the kaghans emissaries had shrugged and grimaced spat and gestured when the kitan pointed out these deficiencies they claimed the grasses had been poor that year too many gazelles and rabbits sickness among the herds their own mounts had looked sturdy and healthy it seemed to the senior mandarins charged with evaluating such information for the celestial emperor that dulan kaghan might have grown a little too secure perhaps even resentful of his annual commitment to faroff xinan it had been decided that a reminder of the power of kitai was past due patience had been abused the emperor had once again been too generous too indulgent of lesser peoples and their insolence hurok had been quietly invited to contemplate a more lofty future he had done so happily fifteen thousand kitan soldiers had gone north late that summer beyond the loop of the river beyond the wall dulan kaghan with his own forces and followers had been in strategic retreat ever since maddeningly hard to pin down in the vast grasslands waiting for allies from north and west and for winter there were no cities to pillage and burn on the steppe no enemy fortresses to besiege and starve into submission no crops to ravage or seize and they were acting for the man who needed to claim the trust of the nomads afterwards it was a different sort of warfare the key was clearly to find and engage dulans forces or just kill the man one way or another hurok however in the growing opinion of the kitan expeditionary armys officers was emerging as a feeble figure a weak piece of pottery containing nothing but ambition he drank kumiss from first light was drunk most of the day sloppily hunting wolves or lolling in his yurt there was nothing wrong with a man drinking but not on campaign his eldest son meshag was a betterfired vessel so they reported back in the event meshag in turn privately approached did not appear to have any great aversion to the suggestion that he might aspire to more than merely being the strongest son of a proppedup kaghan they were not an especially subtle people these nomads of the steppe and the empire of the kitan amongst everything else had had close to a thousand years and nine dynasties to perfect the arts of political manipulation there were books about this any competent civil servant had them memorized they were a part of the examinations consider and evaluate the competing doctrines emerging from third dynasty writings as to the proper conduct of succession issues among tributebearing states it is expected that you will cite passages from the texts apply your preferred doctrine to resolving current issues pertaining to the southwest and the peoples along the margins of the pearl sea conclude with a sixline regulatedverse poem summarizing your proposals include a reference to the five sacred birds in this poem of course the appraisal of this work also included judging the quality of the candidates calligraphy formal hand not running hand with whom did these ignorant fatsmeared barbarians barechested as often as not hair greasy and to their waists smelling of sour fermented milk sheep dung and their horses think they were dealing but before this newer plan for the bogu succession could be implemented young meshag had fallen ill precisely at sundown in his camp one windy autumn day he had been standing by an open fire a cup of kumiss in one hand laughing at a jest a graceful manthen his cup had fallen into trampled grass his knees had buckled and hed toppled to one side barely missing the fire his eyes had closed and had not opened again his women and followers extravagantly distressed made it clear that this had to have been done by sinister powersthere were unmistakable signs their own shaman small and quavering said as much but admitted in the morning after a night spent chanting and drumming at meshags side that he was unequal to shaping a response capable of driving malign spirits from the unconscious man only someone he named as the white shaman of the lake could overmaster the darkness sent to claim meshags soul and bear it away this lake was it appeared many weeks journey north they would set out the next morning the bogu said bearing meshag in a covered litter they did not know if they could keep his soul near his body for so long but there was no alternative course the little shaman would travel with them do all he could whatever the kitan expeditionary force thought about this there wasnt much they could do two army physicians summoned to take the mans pulses and measure auras were at a loss he breathed his heart beat he never opened his eyes when the eyelids were lifted the eyes were black disturbingly so meshag was for good or ill a component of imperial strategy now if he died adjustments would have to be made again it was decided that a number of their own cavalry would go north with his party to maintain a kitan presence and report back immediately if the man died his death was what they expected advance word would go to xinan immediately the assigned cavalry officer riding north with the bogu was to exercise his best judgment in all matters that arose he and his men would be desperately far away cut off from all others shen tai son of shen gao was selected to lead this contingent if that decision carried an element of unspoken punishment for the young man having a rank he hadnt earned no one could possibly be faulted later for giving him the assignment it was an honour wasnt it to be sent into danger what else could a young officer want this was a chance to claim glory why else were they here you didnt join the army to pursue a meditative life go be a hermit of the path eat acorns and berries in a cave on some mountainside if that was what you wanted they worshipped the horse god and the lord of the sky the son of the sky was the god of death his mother dwelled in the bottomless lake far to the north it froze in winter no this was not the lake of their journey now it was much farther north guarded by demons in the afterworld everything was reversed rivers ran from the sea the sun rose west winter was green the dead were laid to rest on open grass unburied to be consumed by wolves and so returned to the sky dishes and pottery were laid upside down or shattered by the body food was spilled weapons brokenso the dead could recognize and lay claim to these things in the backwards world the skulls of sacrificed horses horned reindeer in the north were split with an axe or sword the animals would be reconstituted whole and running in the other place though the white ones would be black and the dark ones light a woman and a man were cut to pieces at midsummer in rites only the shamans were allowed to share though thousands and thousands of the nomads gathered for them from all across the steppe under the high sky shamans engaged in their tasks wore metal mirrors about their bodies and bells so demons would be frightened by the sounds or by their own hideous reflection each shaman had a drum he or she had made after fasting alone upon the grass the drums were also used to frighten demons away they were made from bearskin horsehide reindeer tiger skin though that was rare and spoke to a mighty power never wolf pelts the relationship with wolves was complex some wouldbe shamans died during that fast some were slain in their outofbody journeys among the spirits the demons could triumph take any mans soul carry it off as a prize to their own red kingdom that was what the shamans were all about to defend ordinary men and women intervene when spirits from the other side came malevolently near whether of their own dark desire or summoned yes they could be summoned yes the riders believed that was what had happened here moving slowly north with thirty of his own dui and fifteen of the nomads accompanying the carried curtained litter of meshag tai couldnt have explained why he asked so many questions or hungered so deeply for the answers he told himself it was the length of the journey through an expanse of emptiness day after day they rode and the grasslands hardly changed but it was more than tedium and tai knew it the thrill he derived from the crystals of information the riders vouchsafed went beyond easing boredom they saw gazelles great herds of them almost unimaginably vast they watched cranes and geese flying south wave after wave as autumn came bringing red and amber colours to the leaves there were more trees now and more rolling hills as they moved out of the grasslands one evening they saw swans alight on a small lake one of tais archers pointed grinned drew his bow the bogu stopped him with shouts of menace and alarm they never killed swans swans carried the souls of the dead to the other world and the carried soul denied his destination could haunt the killerand his companionsto the end of their own days how could tai explain how hearing this quickened his heartbeat set his mind spinning with the strangeness of it all it was almost undignified the kitan were famously dismissive never allowing themselves to be more than languidly amused by the primitive beliefs of the barbarians on their borders beliefs that confirmed their barely human nature the appropriateness in a world rightly ordered of kitan preeminence really a people that left their dead to be devoured by wolves he told himself he was gathering information for his report that it would be useful to have a fuller understanding of the bogu make it easier to guide and control them it might even be true but it didnt explain how he felt when they told him riding past crimsonand goldenleaved birch woods of threeeyed demons in the north among sheets of ice of how the men there grew autumn pelts like bears and slept the snowbound winter away oragainof midsummers red sun festival when all wars stopped on the grassland for the rites of the death god performed by shamans of all tribes with bells and pounding drums the shamans the bogi lay behind or at the heart of so many of the tales they were taking meshag to one of them if he lived so long this one was a mighty shaman tai was told she dwelled on the shore of a lake remote and mysterious if sufficiently rewarded and ardently beseeched she might intervene she that was interesting as well the journey was taking them into territory controlled by the current kaghan dulan their enemy that was another reason why tai and thirty of his cavalry were with this party riding through an increasingly upanddown russetcoloured autumn land past jewelbright stands of larch and birch into a growing cold they had an interest in what happened to meshag in his survival however less likely that seemed every day he was still breathing tai looked in on his litter to confirm it each morning at midday and at sunset enduring tired hostile glares from the little shaman who never left meshags side the patient lay on his back under a horsehair blanket breathing shallowly never moving if he died the bogu would leave him under this sky and turn back tai could see his own breath puffs when they mounted up at first light now the day warmed as the sun climbed but mornings and the nights were cold they were so far from the empire from any civilized place in unnervingly strange lands he had grown used to the howling of wolves by now though all kitana farming peoplehated them with an ancient intensity some of the big cats that roared at night were tigers which they knew about but some were not these had a different sound louder tai watched his men grow more uneasy with every li they rode away from all they knew they were not travellers the kitan the occasional exception a farfarer who returned was celebrated as a hero his written record of the journey widely copied and read pondered with fascination and disbelief he was often regarded privately as more than slightly mad why would a sane man choose to leave the civilized world the silk roads were for merchants and wealth to come to them not so that they could goor ever wished to goto the far west themselves or the far north for that matter heavier forests now brilliant and alarming with autumn colour under the sun a scatter of lakes strung like necklace ornaments the sky itself too far away as if tai thought heaven was not as close to mankind here one of the bogu told him around a night fire under stars that as winter approached so did darker spirits that the nomad added was why the magic that had assaulted meshag this season had been harder for him to resist and required a powerful shaman to redress the shamans were divided into white and black the division turned on whether they cajoled demons in the spirit world they left their bodies to enter or tried to battle and coerce them yes some were women yes the one they were approaching was no none of the riders here had ever seen her or been so far north themselves this did not reassure she was known by reputation had never allied herself with any kaghan or tribe she was one hundred and thirty years old yes they were afraid no living creature or man frightened a bogu rider the thought was laughable but spirits did only a fool said otherwise a man did not let fear stop him or he was not a man was this not also so among the kitan the creature roaring the night before that was a lion they were the size of tigers but they hunted with others of their kind not alone there were different bears in these woods too twice the height of a man when they reared up and the northern wolves were the largestbut men of other tribes were still the greatest threat this far from home they saw riders the next morning for the first time ahead of them on a rise against the horizon about fifteen or so not enough to fear the horsemen fled their own approach galloping west and out of sight tai considered pursuit but there was no real point the riders had come from the north tai didnt know what that meant he didnt really know what anything meant the leaves of the trees were crimson and amber and gold and beginning to fall they saw arrows of geese overhead all the time now countless multitudes as if they were fleeing something that lay where the riders were headed the way animals fled a forest fire they saw two more swans on another lake at dusk floating strange and white on darkening water as the moon rose none of tais men threatened these a fear of ongoing transgression had grown in the kitan riders as if they had crossed some inward border tai heard his men snapping and quarrelling with each other as they broke camp in the morning as they rode through the day he did what he could to control it was unsure how successful he was it was difficult to feel superior here he thought that in itself was disturbing for the kitan altering the way they dealt with the world intersected it he wanted to call the forest colours and the autumn landscape beautiful but the word the idea didnt rise easily through the apprehension within him hed finally admitted that fear acknowledged it the night before they came to the shamans lake there was a cottage he saw as they halted on the slope above and looked down in afternoon light unexpectedly large timbers well fitted with an outbuilding and a fenced yard and firewood stacked against winter this was not a yurt houses changed with the climate and they had left behind the grazing lands for something else meshag was still alive he had not moved all the way north it was unnatural they had shifted his body at intervals to prevent sores but hed done nothing but breathe shallowly someone came out from the cabin stood by the door staring up at them her servant the little shaman said come he started quickly down with the litterbearers carrying meshag four of the bogu riders flanking them a gesture was made rather too emphatically the kitan escort were being told to remain on the ridge tai hesitated he remembered that moment then shook his head he spoke to his nextincommand a quiet order to stay for now and watch then flicked his reins and moved down the slope alone following the unconscious man and his escort the nomads glared at him but said nothing he was here to observe his people had an interest in this man in the bogu succession it was not the place of barbaric herdsmen to deny them the right to go anywhere they wanted not when fifteen thousand kitan were assisting hurok in his rising that many soldiers gave you rights one way of looking at this considered another way they had no proper place here among nomads spellbattles no business being this far away from home at all alien sky bright greenblue lake leafdazzle forest behind and beyond in sunlight and the first hint in a far blue distance of mountains to the north he wondered if any of his people had ever seen those mountains or the cold jewel of this lake that possibility should have excited him at the moment easing his horse down the slope it didnt it made him feel terribly far away the riders reined up before the doorway those carrying the litter also stopped there was no fence in front of the cottage only around the back where the outbuilding was tai assumed it was a barn or animal shed or maybe this servant slept there were there others there was no sign of the shaman herself or any life within the door had been carefully closed when the one man came out the nomads leader dismounted he and the shaman approached the servant spoke quietly with unwonted deference tai couldnt make out the words too quick and soft for his limited grasp of their tongue the servant said something brisk in reply the bogu leader turned and gestured to the slope two more riders detached from the company they started down leading two horses these carrying the gifts theyd brought all this way magic and healing did not come without cost it was the same back home tai thought wryly and that realization somehow calmed him you paid for healing whether or not it worked it was a transaction an exchange this one would be appallingly strange but elements of what was to come would be exactly the same as going to an alchemist in xinan or yenling to cure a morningafter head or summoning the plump whitehaired physician from the village to their home by the stream when second mother couldnt sleep at night or third son had a dry cough a memory of home with that very sharp scent of autumn fires smoke drifting the ripple of the stream like the sound of time passing the paulownia leaves would have fallen by now tai thought he could see them on the path from their gate almost hear the noise they made underfoot the shamans servant spoke again as the horses approached with their gifts it wasnt a suitable tone even tai could tell that but he did know that shamans carried enormous honour among the bogu and that the one here was of particular significanceand power theyd come a long way to her after all the riders unloaded the gifts the servant went inside with some of them came out carried another armful back in it took him four trips each time he closed the door behind him he didnt hurry after he went in for the last time they waited in the sunlight the horses shuffled and snorted the men were silent tense and apprehensive their anxiety reached into tai a disturbance was it possible they could come all this way and be rejected sent back he wondered what his own role should be if that looked to be happening would it be his task to try to coerce the shaman into seeing meshag would he be sparing the bogu riders from doing that if the kitan took it on themselves or would he be performing a gross impiety that endangered all future relationships it occurred to himbelatedlythat he might have a serious decision to make in a few moments and he hadnt given it any thought at all he had considered that meshag might die before they came here or that whatever the shaman tried to do would fail he had never contemplated being refused treatment he looked around there was smoke rising from the cabin chimney little wind today the smoke went straight up before drifting and thinning towards the lake from where he was a little to one side he saw two shegoats in the yard behind huddled against the back fence bleating softly they hadnt been milked yet it didnt make him any more impressed with this servant perhaps there were others it was not his task the man came out again finally left the door open behind him for the first time he nodded gestured at the litter tai drew a breath one decision he wouldnt have to make he was angry with himself he ought to have anticipated possibilities worked them out ahead of time their own shaman looked desperately relieved on the edge of tears his face working he quickly drew the litter curtain back two of the men reached in and eased meshag out one cradled him like a sleeping child and carried him into the cabin their shaman made to follow the servant shook his head decisively making a peremptory stiffarmed gesture the little shaman opened his mouth to protest then closed it he stayed where he was head down looking at no one humiliated tai thought the servant went into the cabin reappeared an instant later escorting the man whod carried meshag the servant went back in closed the door they still hadnt seen the old woman the shaman of the lake they were left outside in front of the cabin in the bright clear stillness of an autumn afternoon someone coughed nervously someone glared at him as if the sound might undermine whatever was happening inside their shaman was still staring at the ground before the door as if unwilling to meet anyones gaze tai wanted to be inside then realized that no he actually didnt he did not want to see whatever was taking place in there the nomads clustered before the cabin looking more uncertain than tai had ever seen them the rest of the riders including tais own men remained above on the slope the lake glittered birds were overhead as always now streaming south some were on the water no swans that he could see restless edgy he dismounted left his horse to graze the sparse grass and walked around to the back where the outbuilding was and the yard with the two goats he had a thought of milking them if he could find a pail something to do a task he slipped the gate latch and went in closing it behind him the fenced yard was goodsized two fruit trees a tall birch for shade an herb garden at the far eastern end he could see the lake beyond it across the fence the goats huddled against the shed at the back clearly unhappy no pail to be seen probably inside but he wasnt about to knock on the rear door of the cabin and ask for one he crossed the yard towards the garden and the birch he stood under the tree gazing across the fence at the small lake the brightness of it in sunshine it was very quiet except for the soft distressed bleating of the two animals he could milk them without a pail he thought let the servant suffer for his laziness if the shaman had no milk today he was actually turning to do that irritated when he noticed the freshly dug mound of earth at the back of the garden a single thump of the heart he could still remember years after he stared unmoving for a long moment then he stepped carefully to the edge of the neatly ordered garden space the order underminedhe saw it nowby boot marks and that narrow sinister mound at the back right against the fence the goats had fallen silent for the moment tai felt a stir of wind and fear it was not a shape that mound you could confuse for something else he stepped into the garden fatuously careful not to tread on anything growing there he approached the mound he saw just the other side of the fence an object that had been thrown over discarded saw it was a drum he swallowed hard his mouth suddenly dry too much silence now trembling he knelt and drawing a steadying breath began digging at the earth of the mound with his hands but he already knew by then one of the goats bleated suddenly making tais heart jump in fear he looked quickly over his shoulder at the rear door of the cabin it remained closed he kept digging scooping his fingers shifting the black freshly turned soil he felt something hard a low cry escaped him he couldnt help it he looked at his fingers saw blood looked at the earth hed moved a head in the soil emerging as from some desperate nightmare into hard sunlight or from the other world where the dead went there was a single deep downward gash in it almost splitting the face in halfand the blood from that blow lay thick in the soil of the garden and on his own hands now tai swallowed again made himself move more earth wishing so much he had a tool didnt have to do this with shaking fingers he did however he did do it and in a few moments hed exposed the bladeruined face of a woman a very old woman her eyes still open staring upon nothingness or into the sun he closed his own eyes then opened them again and pushing and digging more quickly now uncovered her body farther down she was clothed wearing tangled bone necklaces and a strange glinting collection of metal polished to be to be mirrors on her body he realized mirrors to frighten demons away his fingers clawing at the soil shifted her a little inadvertently he heard muted bells in the bloodwet earth tai stood up a very old woman drum mirrors bells he looked at the heavy cabin door that opened on the yard he ran sunlight overhead darkness behind him and before chapter vi in xinan some years later after he had found spring rain among the singing girls in the north district or more accurately once she had noticed and chosen him among the studentscholars and they had begun to talk frankly when alone before or after music before or after love she asked him one night why he never spoke about his time north of the wall it didnt last very long he said i know that everyone knows that thats what makes it talked about it is talked about she shook her golden hair and gave him a look he knew well by then i am enamoured of an idiot who will never amount to anything was more or less the import of the glance tai found it amusing sometimes said so she found his saying so a cause of more extreme irritation this too amused him and she knew it she was a glory and a wonder and he worked hard at not thinking about how many men he shared her with in the north districtone in particular you were permitted to withdraw from the cavalry with honour and distinctionduring a campaign that doesnt happen no matter who your father is then you go to stone drum mountain but leave there not a kanlin and then you show up in xinan having decided to study for the examinations it is all mysterious tai i need to clear up the mystery no she put down her pipa and leaning forward tugged hard at his hair which hed left unbound he pretended to be in pain she ignored that dont you see being mysterious is good it is a way of being noticed that is what you want i do it is she made to seize his hair again and he lifted his hands to forestall her she settled back on the couch and poured more rice wine from the flask upon the brazier at her elbowpouring for him first her training and manners were flawless except when she was attacking him or when they were making love if you pass the examinations this spring and you hope for a position that means somethingthat doesnt leave you sending little begging poems to senior mandarins for their helpyes it is what you want you are trying for rank in the palace tai to swim within the current at this court you need to know how the game plays or you will be lost he had taught her to use his given name he insisted on it when they were alone if i am lost will you come find me she glared at him he grinned at ease ive been lucky if youre correct ive managed to become noticed without even trying rain i just prefer not to discuss that time above the wall it isnt a good memory i never thought about any of the things you are saying you need to think about these things i could let you keep doing it for me she stiffened shifted he regretted his words as soon as hed spoken them i am spring rain said a humble singing girl of the north district hired by the hour or the night owned by the proprietor of this house it is inappropriate that one such as i be offered such a role it is cruel to say so even in jest you will need to master these subtleties for yourself it is your life we are talking about is it just my life he asked which was a little cruel but her selfdescription had wounded himand he knew at least one man who could afford to buy her from the pavilion of moonlight for the impossible sum shed command if he chose to do so she flushed a curse of the fairskinned from the northwest which was what she was she said levelly after a moment if you pass the examinations you will enter among the most ambitious men on earth you can decide to leave xinanleave yet another lifebut if you stay here at court those are the people you will be among they will eat you for breakfast throw your bones to the dogs and not know they dined her green eyesher celebrated jadegreen eyeswere hard and cold he laughed a little nervously he remembered thats not poetic language no she said but im not a poet would you prefer a girl who is master shen there are some downstairs and in other houses i can make suggestions sir a revenge of sorts for his own remark a moment before but this was about her life too of course it was a woman smooth as jade waiting all night above marble stairs at a rice paper window wet with autumn rain tai shook his head he remembered looking at her beside him on the low couch wanting simply to enjoy beauty and intelligence and nearness but wrestling with what shed said he murmured women have usually been better at this than men havent they pursuing these subtleties women have no choice but to be this way if we want any kind of influence or simply a little control of our own lives thats what i meant tai said he tried a smile do i get credit for subtlety she didnt respond to the smile a child can know that much you will be if you ever decide to study enough to pass the examinations among grown men who use words like blades and are in mortal combat with each other for position every day and night and to that he remembered saying quietly men like my brother you mean shed just looked at him sprinting across the autumn grass from the shamans grave tai thought about screaming a warning then about running around the front to summon the others he didnt do either he couldnt have said after that hed been thinking with clarity this was an utterly remote terrifying place hed unearthed a murder and he was very young those truths didnt entirely address why he broke into the cabin alone when pressedand he was by his officers laterhed say that if they were going to save meshag which was their reason for being where they were it was unlikely to happen if he alerted those inside by shouting and he didnt think he had enough time to go around the front it sounded true it was true if you considered it he didnt remember considering anything at the time however you could say his instincts had been at work tai didnt have any idea if that was so his sword was on his saddle so was his bow there was a shovel leaning against the back cabin wall he had a fair guess by then how that had been used without pausing to think plan to do anything coherent at all he seized it grabbed the door latch and pushed with no idea what hed find what he would actually do in there or what they were doing whoever these people were who had killed the shaman buried her in earth to deny her soul access to the sky and deceived them out in front it wasnt locked the back door he stepped inside it was dark in the cabin it had been very bright outdoors he was nearly blind he stopped and just made out the shape of someone turning towards him from within the room tai stepped forward and swung the shovel as hard as he could he felt it bitethe sharp spade edgeinto flesh and sink the figure still only half seen threw up an empty hand as if in entreaty or placation and slumped to the earthen floor soundlessly which was good tai had never killed anyone at that point in his life he didnt have time to consider what had just happened what it meant if it meant anything he blinked rapidly willing his eyes to adjust to shadow and dark heart pounding he made out an interior archway a curtain over it no actual door a tworoom cabin he stepped over the fallen man thentardilyturned back and exchanged the shovel for the mans sword he did kneel and check cautiously he was aware enough to do that the man was dead another brief disturbance how swiftly smoothly silently life could be present pulsing and then be gone that thought pushed him forward treading lightly towards the fabric curtain he shifted a corner of it there were candles burning in the other room for which tai gave thanks three men two near the front door whispering fiercely to each other tai saw that the door was barred they wouldnt have been able to crash in that way not without giving a great deal of warning meshag lay on a pallet near the hearth tai saw that his tunic had been cut open exposing his chest his eyes were still closed he looked terribly vulnerable the third figure tall and bulky with animal horns attached to his head was standing over him this one wore mirrors and bells and was softly beating a drum and chanting rocking from side to side occasionally spinning completely around a kind of dance there was a sicklysweet smell in the room something burning on a brazier tai had no idea what it was but he did not believe for a moment that this third manit was a man the woman was dead in the gardenwas doing anything benevolent for the unconscious figure they had killed the shaman who dwelled here they werent trying to help meshag they hadnt killed him yet tai didnt know why why should he understand any of this but watching through the slightly lifted curtain breathing carefully tai had a disturbing sense that what was happening here was intended to be worse than killing he was a long way from home that was his last clear thought before he screamed at the top of his voice and exploded through the curtain into the front room he went straight for the shaman not necessarily what an experienced soldier would have done take out the guards but he wasnt experienced and surely his task was to try to stop whatever was being done with drum and chant and gathered powers to the man on the pallet he had not yet been on stone drum mountainhis time among the kanlin was a result of what happened that autumn day in the northbut he was the son of a soldier he had been trained from earliest memory in ways and means of fighting the more so since his older brother soft and slightly plump even as a child had made clear that his own inclinations and path in life did not involve swords or spinning twisting manoeuvres against other armed men the dead nomads sword was slightly curved shorter than tais own heavier as well meant for downward blows from horseback no matter you used what you had he had time to see the shaman turn see fevered eyes open wide blazing surprise and rage before he struck a slashing blow above the metal mirrors draping the shamans body protecting it a part of tai his bearings lost so far away from everything hed ever thought he knew enmeshed in sorcery was surprised when the sword bit the way it should he felt it grind on bone saw blood heard the shaman cry out and fall a sound of bells dropping drum and mallet on the hardpacked floor he shouldnt have been startled theyd killed a shaman woman hadnt they these mirroranddrum people they were holy and feared but they werent immortal of course it was also possible that killing one put a curse on you for life not a matter tai was in a position to address just then he wheeled and dropped fear giving him urgency he saw the nearer of the guardsthe one whod pretended to be a servant outsiderushing to where a bow lay against a wall tai sprang after him twisting to dodge a knife thrown by the other man he heard shouts outside he screamed again words this time treachery get in here the false servant scrabbled for his bow for an arrow turned dodging to avoid tais thrust swordor trying to avoid it tai caught him in the shoulder instead of the chest heard the man shriek in pain tai jerked free his blade andinstinctivelydropped and rolled again careful of the sword he held he banged against objects scattered on the floor their offered gifts but the second enemys sword sweep whistled over his head first time in his life for that sound the sound of death averted passing close he heard thudding outside and wild cries as his companions tried to get in pounding against the barred front door around the back he screamed its open but in the same moment he took another chance hurtling to the door he flung the heavy wooden bar back just in time he dodged again avoiding a downward slash that bit past him into wood he was sent staggering as the door flew open hitting him in the back but somethingpride and anger and fear interwoven like threads in silkmade him step towards the man left standing tai slashed at him parried a hard return as the others spilled into the room behind him they killed the shaman he cried over his shoulder shes dead out back meshags over there watch the one on the ground i only wounded him the one on the ground was seized by three men and dragged upright off the ground held like a childs doll he received a bonesplintering blow to the side of his head they didnt kill him however tai noticed that and in the same moment he heard one of the bogu say leave the last one too we will use him at those words the man facing tai abruptly changed his expression tai would remember that look as well he could sometimes see it when he closed his eyes in years of nights to come the man moved back towards the curtain he reversed his sword fumbling for the grip with both hands he was trying to stab himself tai realized but before that could happen two carefully placed arrows took him one in each shoulder the sword fell to the ground the man screamed then a terrible sound beyond any possible pain of his wounds tai thought a little later he would begin to understand hed have screamed like that he found himself thinking on the ride back south they had left that same evening unwilling to remain by the lake needing as much distance from it as possible hed have tried to kill himself too if hed had any idea what was to come before he was allowed to die and the man had clearly known in some ways that was the most horrific thing the kitan cavalrytais own menhad come rushing down the slope when the shouts and screaming had begun but it was all over within the cabin before they were near enough to do anything tai had walked across the grass to join them when he came out it had been disorienting to be back in mild sunshine with so little time having passed the world could change too swiftly the thirty kitan riders had remained apart together to see what the nomads would do watching in impassive silence at first then with increasingly intense shattering revulsion the bogu began by claiming the body of the old shaman from out back and burning it on a pyre they built between cabin and lake they did this respectfully with chants and prayer she had been defiled by murder and burial under ground it seemed she had to be returned to the skyleft in the open to be devoured by wolves and other animalsor she could be consumed by flame and rise with the smoke they chose fire because they were beginning a greater burning they set the outbuildings alight and then the cabin itself but not before they brought out meshag upon his pallet and laid him down in the yard they dragged out the two men tai had killed the guard and the shaman and finally they brought forth the two who were still alive they were drinking by then the bogu there had been kumiss in the cabin the shamans bells chimed as they pulled his body across the trampled grass his mirrors glinted splintering sunlight tai had wondered if hed transgressed in killing this man it was not so he understood now he had done something in the nomads eyes that marked him as a hero he was to be honoured it seemed they invited him to join in what was now to follow with the two dead men and the two left deliberately alive he declined stayed with his men his own people from a civilized place he was physically sick wrackingly so when he saw what came next what he had been invited to share many of the kitan cavalry became violently ill stumbling or riding away retching into the grass the empire of kitai had not been shaped through nine dynasties by a placid pacifist people theirs was a violent conquering grandeur built upon slaughter through nearly a thousand years in their own civil wars or carrying warfare beyond shifting borders or defending those borders such was their history fires such as these or greater burnings by far blood and blades there were texts and teachings as far back as the first dynasty about the tactical utility of massacre killing children mutilation rape the useful fear all these could spread in foes the overcrowding of besieged cities as terrified refugees fled before advancing armies these things were a part of what men did in warfare and warfare was a part of what men did in life but the kitan did not roast dead enemies over fires and eat their flesh with invocations to the sky or cut off slices from men still living staked out naked upon the ground and let them watch screaming as their own body parts were consumed cooked or raw there was a great deal of smoke spilling thickly upwards hiding the sun a stench of burning in a onceserene space beside a northern lake the crackling of several fires howls humans not wolves ritual chants and someones desperate slowly fading plea for death replaced the sound of birds and wind in leaves the ugliness of men erasing solitude and autumnal beauty it went on for some time one of the nomads eventually approached the kitan where they waited gentling their nervous horses a distance apart he was barechested grinning widely and he was waving the severed forearm of a man blood dripped from it and from his chin unsteady on his feet he extended the human flesh towards tai as to a hero worthy to partake of this great bounty giving the kitan the stranger one more chance he took an arrow in the chest as he stood before them he died instantly tai could not for a moment believe what had happened it was entirely wrong shockingly so he stood in numbed disbelief which was however brief too long an interval for a commander of men in a place such as this one had become his soldiers as if released by that single arrow to their own demons their frenzied response to the horror they were being made to witness mounted up suddenly all of them with smooth trained efficiency as if an order had been given seizing bows and swords from saddles they swept forwardavenging spirits in and of themselvesinto the fires and smoke infused with a clawing fury with the sense that this hideous savagery could only be expunged erased with savagery of their own this understanding of events came to tai only afterwards he wasnt thinking clearly at the time his cavalry knifed into and among the outnumbered onfoot drunkonkumiss nomads the stumbling bloodsoaked men theyd come north to aidand they slaughtered them between the fires and when it was done when none of the bogu were left alive amid the black smoke and the red burning the blurred sun setting west now the lake a dark cold blue the next thing happened meshag son of hurok stood up he looked around the unholy scene created by men in that place he had been a graceful man he wasnt any more he had changed had been changed he moved awkwardly now as if oddly jointed had to shift his whole body to turn his gaze moving stiffly through a full circle black smoke drifted between him and where tai stood rooted to the ground with a gaping horror he was seeing this and refusing to believe what he saw meshag stared towards the kitan riders for a long moment the last men alive here then shifting his shoulders as if trying to throw back his head he laughed a low distorted sound he had not moved or opened his eyes since falling unconscious by another fire to the south weeks before it was not his remembered laughter the way he stood and moved was appallingly different this shambling slacklimbed unnatural posture the kitan soldiers in an alien place among burning and the dead stopped wheeling their horses about stopped shouting they clustered together close to tai again as if for protection keeping their distance from meshag looking at this manif he was still a mantai understood that the evils of this day had not ended he heard sounds beside him arrows clicking from sheaths nocked to strings he stirred he rasped an orderand was not sure if what he did was right he might die not knowing he would decide on the ride back south hold he cried no man shoots an arrow what was left of meshag or what had become of him turned cumbersome and slow to look at tai tracking the sound of his voice their gazes locked through smoke tai shivered he saw a blankness in those eyes something unfathomable cold as the end of all life it occurred to him in that same moment that his task his duty to what had once been a man might be to grant him the arrows release he did not he knewhe could not deny knowingthat something evil had been happening in that cabin still burning a red roaring chaos before he burst in and killed the shaman it might have been interrupted incomplete but what that meant what it implied for the figure standing stiffly before him holding his gaze as if committing tai to memory he couldnt hope to grasp like the swans he said loudly to his cavalry killing it might curse us all this is not our affair let it let him go he will find his fate without us he said that last as clearly as he could staring at the soulwracking figure of meshag if the creature moved towards them the soldiers would panic tai knew hed have to allow the arrows to fly and live with that he didnt believe his own swan comparison he hadnt even believed killing a swan would curse them that was bogu fear the kitan had their own animal legends and fears but the words might offer something to his men a reason to listen to him they didnt normally need reasons soldiers followed orders as simple as that but this northward journey and todays ending to it were so remote in all ways from their normal lives and world that it seemed necessary to offer one as for why in his own mind it felt proper to give this deadeyed impossibly reawakened figure the chance to leave this place and liveif living was what it wastai could only call it pity then and after he wondered if that came through in his voice in the look they exchanged he wouldnt have said it was an entirely human gaze meshags but neither would he have said it wasnt that there was some demon in there meshag was altered and it seemed to tai he might well be lost but he didnt know killing him might have been the truest answer to what had been done to him offering the kindness of release but tai didnt do it and didnt allow his soldiers to do it he wasnt even sure this figure could be killed and he really didnt want to test that after a long stillness barely breathing he saw meshagor what had been meshagmove one hand in a gesture he could not interpret the figure turned away from him from all of them living and dead and burning meshag didnt laugh again and he never did speak he loped away around the burning cabin and then along the shore of the lake towards the firecoloured autumn trees and the distant almosthidden mountains tai and his men stayed together watching him through the smoke until he passed from sight and then they started the other way towards home they had left the silk farm and the orange flare of the fox far behind the sun was going down also orange now tai realized hed been wrapped in reverie for a long time tracing memory the paths that had led him here or one particular path that journey north past wall past rivers loop beyond the steppes to the edge of winters land in the eye of his mind riding now with six companions on a glorious sardian horse he still saw meshag son of hurokor whatever he had becomeshambling away alone it occurred to him that having seen this having been a part of that day he ought not to be so quickly dismissive of someone elses belief in foxwomen or perhaps because of his own history that was why he needed to be dismissive there were only two people in the world with whom he could even have imagined talking about this feeling one of them was in xian and it was very likely he would never be able to speak with her again the other was chou yan who was dead no man can number his friends and say he has enough of them i broke willow twigs when you left my tears fell with the leaves wei song was still up front the stream they were following was on their left a wide valley stretching from it fertile lands both banks the forest that had flanked them to the south had receded this was farming land they could see peasant huts clustering into hamlets and villages men and women in the fields charcoal burners fires against the darkening trees tai had come this way heading west approaching kuala nor two years ago but hed been in a strange state of mind thengrieving withdrawnand he hadnt paid attention to the land through which he rode looking back he couldnt say hed begun to think clearly about what he was doing what he intended to do until hed ridden beyond iron gate fort up the long ravine and come out and seen the lake he needed to become a different man now spring rain had warned him so many times about the dangers of the taming palace the world of court and mandarinand now he had the army the military governors to consider as well someone wanted him dead had wanted that before hed received the horses he couldnt keep them he knew he couldnt keep them not in the world as it was the issue was what he did with them andbefore thathow he could live long enough to claim them back at the taguran border he twitched dynlals reins and the big horse moved effortlessly forward to catch up to the kanlin woman the sun was behind them shining along the plain it was almost time to stop for the night they could camp out again or approach one of these villages he wasnt sure where the next posting station was she didnt turn her head as he pulled up beside her she said id be happier inside walls unless you object it was the fox he guessed this time he didnt make a jest he still carried the long days dark remembering a smell of burning in his mind from a northern lake whatever you say this time she did look over he saw anger in her eyes you are indulging me tai shook his head i am listening to you i retained you to protect me why hire a guard dog and bark yourself not calculated to appease her but he didnt exactly feel like doing that it did occur to him to mildly regret hiring her the soldiers from the fort would surely have been enough protection but he hadnt known that hed be given a military escort there was more person in her than hed expected shed been chosen by spring rain he needed to think about that he had many things to think about it seemed he said you never did tell me that night if rain knows anything or told you about why someone sent a kanlin to kill me a weak question hed have been informed by now if she knew he expected a remark to that effect didnt get one a false kanlin she reminded him reflexively then added if the lady lin chang knew i do not i dont believe she did know your friend was bringing you tidings and it seemed you werent to know them no tai shook his head it is more than that or theyd have killed yan before he reached me it would have been easy to have him die along the way they were alone she looked at him i never thought of that they didnt want me alive to act on whatever he was coming to tell me if i found it out some other way she was still staring tai grinned suddenly what you are astonished i can think of something you didnt she shook her head looked away watching her tai felt his mood darken the joking felt shallow he said not sure why he was confiding he was a dear friend never harmed a soul in life that i know of i am going to want to know why he died and do something about it she turned again to look at him you may not be able to do anything depending on what you discover tai cleared his throat we had better choose a village soon if you want to negotiate for shelter her turn to smile as if to herself look ahead tai did so oh he said the land rose slightly before them he saw that the road widened three lanes now the middle one reserved for imperial riders in the distance caught by the setting sun he could just make out the walls of a fairsized city with banners flying chenyao they had arrived and closer to them beside the road obviously waiting tai noticed a small group of men they had horses but had dismounted respectfully one of them formally dressed lifted a hand in salute you are being met outside the walls wei song murmured it is an honour iron gate sent word of your coming with the courier the horses tai said well of course song replied you will probably have to meet with the military governor and the prefect both before you can go find a woman so very sorry he couldnt think of a rejoinder he lifted a hand in a return salute to those waiting they immediately bowed all of them as if pulled downwards by his gesture like puppets in a street theatre tai drew a breath and let it out it was beginning chapter vii it might have been thought that the most beautiful and talented of the singing girls the courtesans who could break a mans heart or bring him to a climax in ways he had never imagined would all be in xinan with its worlddazzling wealth and the palace by the northern walls that would have been a fair assumption but not an accurate one market and canalside towns could emerge as celebrated or notorious for a variety of reasons and the grace and skill of their women was one the south had its own traditions in the matter of lovemaking as far back as the fourth dynasty some of these sufficiently subversive to be discussed only in whispers or after too much wine the northeast was a wasteland in this regard of course soldiers and camp followers in the windscoured fortresses by the long wall repressive cities also windscoured dominated by an ascetic aristocracy that saw the last three imperial dynasties as new arrivals barely worth acknowledging chenyao however was at the other end of the empire and the silk road passed through it becoming the imperial highway bringing traders and trade goods into the market square and pleasure district of a prosperous lively city lying so far west chenyao also had a reputation for sardian girlsthe fairhaired blue or greeneyed goddesses from beyond the deserts so very appealing in ninth dynasty kitai one such woman was called spring rain who was in xinan and whose name now appeared to be lin chang and who belonged as a personal concubine to the new first minister of the empire there were a number of reasons tai decided that it was past time for him to become extremely drunk one was a friends death he kept reclaiming images of yan laughing until he spluttered and choked in a winecup game in the north district or studying on a bench next to tai in ferocious concentration chanting under his breath to memorize a passage or the two of them climbing a tower outside the walls during the festival of chrysanthemums which was about friendship and now this friend was lying in a lakeside grave beside the assassin who had killed him the second reason for needing wine good wine one might hope was that someone had tried to kill him and he didnt know who or why the third was rain she had foreseen her departure from the north district more than two years ago had warned tai about it he hadnt believed it could happenor had denied it to himself not the same thing against his will he found himself remembering a night in the pavilion of moonlight rain and three other girls entertaining the students laughter and music in the largest room a silence had fallen tais back had been to the doors hed seen rain glance over and thenwithout the slightest hesitationstand up and carrying her pipa walk away from them towards the man tai saw in the doorway as he turned to watch her go wen zhou had not been first minister then but he was wealthy wellborn and a favourite cousin of the emperors favoured concubine which mattered most of all he was a big man handsome and knowing it elegantly dressed he could have had any woman in xinan sent to him hed wanted rain it amused him to come to her in the city and there was no question of scholars claiming any kind of priority once such a man arrivedthe idea was laughable tai remembered that night though it wasnt the only time zhous gaze had flicked over the party of students before turning to rain accepting her graceful homage shed led him out towards a private room tai tried to sort out why that memory was the one that had returned and decided it was because zhous gaze had actually held his a moment a toolong moment before looking away there was a poem by chan du about powerful men and women of the court enjoying a feast in long lake park suggesting that with certain men it was better if they never noticed you hed been noticed that night he didnt want a yellowhaired girl in chenyao he did need a woman after so much time alone and he decided assorted ghosts and malign spirits could choose amongst themselves which would torment the smug kanlin warrior hed mistakenly hired at iron gate hed arranged with the escort waiting outside the walls that he would call upon the prefect and the military governorin that orderin the morning they both wanted him tonight he declined politely tonight was his own they were inside a city patrolled by soldiers safe from roaming banditsor spiritworld foxwomen hed had wei song book the best available inn for the seven of them hed also decided to keep the cavalrymen from iron gate it was a small enough gesture of acknowledgement to commander lin who had given him cash for the road including the inn here and what turned out to be a handsome room with a goodsized bed and sliding doors leading out to a garden five guards from a border fortress were not going to link him too closely to the second military district when he got to the capital but their presence with tai might be of use to the commander who had assigned them there had been competing invitations from the welcoming party on the way into the city to be the honoured house guest of both the men in power here a competition that made it easier for tai to take his own lodging the governor was more powerful they always were these days but the prefect had the title that signified in protocol and tai had studied in xinan long enough to know how this matter needed to be dealt with come morning there were girls at his inn of course in a pavilion behind the first building red lanterns hanging from the eaves there one of the women he noticed when he strolled across the courtyard and looked in was charmingor could that be due to his not having been close to a silkclad woman in two years there was a pipa being played and another girl with wide red sleeves was dancing he stayed a few moments to watch in the doorway but this was a comfortable inn not the entertainment district and tai had been cheerfully advised by the escort sent out to meet him which of the courtesan houses was most likely to please a man of taste with some reserves of cash he left the inn to make his way there the night streets of chenyao were crowded lit by hanging lanterns on walls and carried by torches that was something else he hadnt experienced for a long time men pushing the darkness back so the nights might hold more than fear he wouldnt have denied feeling a measure of aroused anticipation in xinan nightfall marked the curfew the city gates and those of each ward locked until the dawn drums but this was a market town on the merchants road and rules were slack here of necessity men many of them foreigners emerging from the hardship of the long passage around the deserts would not readily submit to limits on their movements when they finally arrived at a civilized place knowing their journey was over theyd pay their duties and taxes submit to inspection of goods bribe clerksand the prefectas required but they wouldnt stay in one place after dark there were enough soldiers in chenyao this close to the taguran border to ensure relative good order even if travellers were abroad at night tai saw clusters of soldiers here and there but they looked relaxed not oppressive moonlit carousing was encouraged here men feasting and drinking spent money left it in the city tai was prepared to be one of those music graceful women dancing good food and wine and then a chosen girl eyes dark with promise the nearly forgotten scent of a woman legs that could wrap themselves around him a mouth and fingers skilled in provoking in exploring and a candlelit private room where he could begin to feel his way back into the world hed left behind at kuala nor he was distracted he would later decide his thoughts running too far ahead through the noisy streets or else hed not have been so easily trapped he ought to have been alerted when the short laneway he turned down following directions given was suddenly not noisy or thronged he was alone he realized figures appeared at the head of the lane blocking it there was no lantern at that end it was hard to be sure of their number tai stopped swearing under his breath he looked quickly behind him was unsurprised to see more men at the lower end now where hed entered eight of them in all he guessed he was in the middle of an empty street the doors of shops and houses on either side were naturally barred he had only one of his own swords it was considered bad manners to carry double blades into a courtesan house but it was also regarded as foolish to go unarmed through night streets in any city he might have been foolish just now he drew his sword there were tactics prescribed on stone drum mountain early levels of teaching for dealing with a challenge such as this it was set as a formal lesson one was unlikely to defeat or break free of eight men four was possible tai drew two quick breaths and then sprinted forward shouting at the top of his voice for the city guards he heard a yell behind him but hed have a few moments with half of these men whomever they were and he did as it happened know how to fight he hadnt had much use for those skills in years but the second son of general shen gao trained by the kanlin on their holy mountain ran towards this new set of assassins with a rising useful angerhe recognized it let it surge channelled it sword extended he whipped through a full running circle as he neared them to confuse cause hesitation he leaped at the last house wall on his right driving himself with three or four short steps running up the wall and then he sprang back from it flying above the heads of the menthree only not four which was goodand he stabbed one and slashed another with his first two airborne passes the good blade cutting deep both times he landed behind the one who remained that man whipped around lifting his sword to parry it was at that point tai saw that the man wore a uniformthe colours of the army of the second district the same as his own five cavalrymen these were the military guards hed been shouting for tai froze blade levelled what is this he cried i am one of your officers the commander at iron gate sent word of me the second man hed wounded moaned lying in the muddy street the one still on his feet spoke rapidly through shock and fear this is known your presence is required it was judged you might decline to come we were sent to ensure it happened he bowed jerkily tai heard a rustling sound he looked up quickly saw someone hurtling down from a rooftop behind the four other soldiers who had rushed up from the far end of the lane he made as urgent a decision as he had in a long time song no wait leave them wei song landed rolled and stood up she hadnt been going to a courtesan house issues of courtesy had not applied she drew both her swords from the scabbards behind her and extended them why was all she said tai drew a steadying breath because there are twenty more soldiers here not all of them incompetent some with bows and you are in a city i control the voice was assured and amused it came from the square behind tai he turned slowly there were half a dozen torches by a curtained sedan chair the small square was otherwise empty kept that way by soldiers at the edges blocking each street at least twenty men the curtains of the litter were drawn back on this side so that the man within might see what was happeningand be seen in the cast torchlight tai still felt anger within himself a hot stone he was dealing with the sick sensation that could follow violence the two men on the ground were silent now he didnt know if hed killed them the first one probably he thought he walked slowly over to the sedan chair and the torches why have you done this he asked his voice demanding too arrogant he was aware of the tone he didnt care he was fairly sure who this was you look like your father said the thin very tall man in the litter stepping out to stand gazing at tai he used a stick a heavy one to support himself and that made it certain a city i control tai bowed it was necessary whatever anger he felt he cleared his throat sir i told your officers outside the walls that i would be honoured to call upon you in the morning and i have no doubt you would have done so but i am an impatient man and disinclined to follow the prefect in a matter such as this you would have had to attend upon him first a matter such as this it would always be the horses now tai thought governor xu bihai commanding both the second and the third military districts smiled at him it was a cold smile tai sheathed his sword the kanlin the governor said in a paperthin voice she is retained by you no time wasted tai nodded she is my lord and was assigned to guard you tonight assigned to do so always he knew what this was about he was afraid again suddenly she was not walking with you kanlin are conspicuous sir i chose to remain otherwise she was not far away as you see the cold smile again the military governor had to be sixty years old his long chinbeard and hair were white but his posture and manner were commanding notwithstanding the stick he held in that case she will be permitted to live you do not object if she is beaten twenty strokes i do object i would take it as an insult and an injury to me a raised eyebrow the torches flickered in a flare of wind she drew weapons on soldiers in my city master shen she drew blades on men in darkness who appeared to be attacking me governor xu i say this with respect i would have had cause to dismiss her or worse had she not done so a silence i will indulge you in this xu bihai said finally in memory of your father whom i knew i served under him in the west i know that he spoke of you often tai said not quite a lie he did know how the governors leg had been injured thank you he added he bowed again it was entirely the governors right even a duty to have song executed or beaten to crippled incapacity this was a market town thronged with drunken foreigners and transients hard men from the long roads the soldiers were charged with keeping order certain rules followed upon that wei song sheathe weapons please tai called he didnt look back he heard with relief the doubled snick as she obeyed thank you he said again to her this time she was kanlin they werent servants to be ordered about as such neither was he he said i am honoured of course beyond my worth that the governor has taken himself abroad in the night to hold converse with me i had been greatly looking forward to your counsel and tidings in the morning i still am what hour would be convenient this one said xu bihai you werent listening i said i was disinclined to see you after the prefect i was listening sir i do not decree the protocols of our glorious ninth dynasty governor and i am disinclined to have my appointments for a dayor a nightdecided by others however greatly i honour them the whitebearded governor appeared to be considering this distant sounds drifted music and laughter one voice briefly lifted in anger but they were alone in this square with the soldiers and wei song i dont see that you have a choice xu bihai said at length though i note your disinclination i will not apologize for protecting the interests of this military district but i can offer you mares teat grape wine at my residence and an escort to the entertainment district afterwards tai drew a breath he needed to decide swiftly how far he would take thisand how far the governor would he was still angry his father had liked this man elements to be balanced inwardly he shrugged a princess in rygyal had changed his life a moment such as this was part of that change it was unlikely to be the last i have not tasted mares teat wine in more than two years he said i should be honoured to be your guest shall we invite the prefect to join us for a moment the governors lean face betrayed astonishment then he threw back his head and laughed tai allowed himself to smile i think not said xu bihai in the event tai came to understand the governor wished to say only one thing to him but he wanted quite urgently to say it and to do so before anyone else spoke to the young man who now controlled enough sardian horses to play a role in the balance of power towards the end of a long reign the wine was luxuriously good it was spiced with saffron tai honestly couldnt remember the last time hed tasted that the two young women who served them were xus daughters unmarried each wore flawless silk one in pale green the other in blue lowcut in a fashion that had evidently emerged so to speak since tai had left xinan their perfume was intoxicating each different from the others they both had painted motheyebrows tinted bluegreen and a sidefalling hairstyle with extravagant hairpins they wore jewelled closedtoe slippers gold rings and jade earrings and had amused confident eyes it was he thought unfair the governor crosslegged on a platform couch opposite clad in doubled black robes with a black hat and a red belt seemed oblivious to the effect his daughters were having on his guest but tai was entirely certain that the wine and lamplit room and the two exquisite scented women had been carefully orchestrated wei song was in the courtyard with the soldiers the two men tai had wounded were expected to live hed asked on arrival here this was good of course but reminded him that his skills were not what theyd once been he had been trying to kill they ate fivespice dried riverfish in three sauces and early fruits served in ivory bowls by the daughters not servants they drank the saffron wine cups steadily refilled talked of spring crops outside the city walls and along the river of thunderstorms and a tailstar apparently seen in the east earlier that month what it might presage the two women brought water and hand cloths for them to wash and dry their fingers as they ate curving towards tai offering a lacquered bowl of scented water the one in green allowed her hair in strategic disarray to one side to brush his hands this was the waterfall hairstyle made popular by the precious consort wen jian herself in xinan it was unfair xus daughter smiled very slightly as she straightened as if sensing and enjoying his response her father said briskly commander lin writes that he proposed to you a position of high rank in the cavalry of the second army a number of the sardian horses to remain as yours and your selection of officers to serve under you so much for polite discussion of stars or millet and its ripening time and bestsuited soil tai set down his cup fortress commander lin was generous beyond my merits and behaved with impeccable courtesy to his guest on behalf of his military district hes ambitious and clever enough he would said xu bihai i imagine he will serve the district well if promoted tai thought he owed the commander that much perhaps said xu indifferently he isnt well liked and he isnt feared makes it harder for him to rise your father would have agreed indeed said tai noncommittally he received a glance from the other couch the two daughters had withdrawn to the door either side of it decorative beyond words he very much liked the one in green her eyes that knowing halfsmile perhaps further persuasion from me will be of use in causing you to reconsider his offer i am honoured you would even consider me worthy of persuading murmured tai but i told commander lina man i liked incidentallythat it would be folly for me to contemplate a course of action before i consult with those at court first minister wen zhou indeed tai repeated your elder brother advising him tai nodded uneasy suddenly two men i understand you have reason to dislike i should regret if you continued in such an understanding tai said carefully his pulse had quickened my duty to the son of heaven may he rule a thousand years surely requires that i take counsel in xinan with his advisers there was a silence it was not a statement that could be challenged and both men knew it governor xu lifted his cup sipped thoughtfully he put it down looking at tai his expression changed i can almost pity you he said i should regret that as well tai said you do know what i mean tai met his gaze i might have chosen a simpler life had it been my own decision but if we accept the teachings of the sacred path then we also accept do you do you follow those teachings the discussion had become uncomfortably intimate tai said i try the balancing male and female hot and cold awareness of all five directions stillness and motion polarities the flow between such things suits my nature more than the cho masters certainties however wise he was you learned this on stone drum mountain it was curious how many people seemed to know of his time there he remembered rain telling him thatand what else shed said how it might be useful shaping a mystery about him he shook his head from before my own readings it was a reason i went there he saw no reason not to be honest to a point it had been one reason xu bihai nodded as if a thought had been confirmed he stared at tai another long moment then as if speaking only of cultivated fields again or earlysummer rainfall said quietly i understand you must consult at the palace before acting but i would sooner kill you tonight and lose all the horses for the empire and be exiled to the pestilent south or ordered to commit suicide than have you give them to roshan this master shen tai you need to know the promised escort took him in the governors sedan chair to the entertainment district he hadnt been in one of those for a long time the cushions were soft there was a scent of aloeswood he was slightly drunk he realized the bearers stopped tai opened the curtains to reveal the quite handsome entrance of the white phoenix pleasure pavilion which had a new roof a covered portico lanterns hanging by the entrance wide steps going up and doors open to the mild night the leader of tais escort went up and spoke to an older woman at the entrance tai knewand there was nothing he could in courtesy do about itthat he was not going to be permitted to pay for anything here tonight the soldiers indicated that they would wait for him he wanted to dismiss them but that wasnt possible if they had orders from the governor and he knew they did they would take him back to the inn eventually if he spent the night here theyd remain outside until morning with the sedan chair this was the way things were going to be now men were investing in him he could try to find it amusing but it was difficult i would sooner kill you tonight this you need to know murder as an alternative to investment he thought wryly and given consequences so sure and so severe even for a governorsince word had gone ahead to xinan and they would know about the horses very soongovernor xus statement carried its own uncompromising message roshan was not to be allowed to claim these roshan was a nickname given by soldiers long ago adopted by the court the mans real name was an li he was a onetime barbarian cavalryman then an officer a general now a military governor himself commanding the seventh the eighth and most recently also the ninth district armies a man everyone watched and feared tai had been away too long there were elementsbalanceshe needed to learn and he didnt have a great deal of time i can almost pity you was the other thing xu bihai had said and at kuala nor among the ghosts a bluetattooed taguran had said nearly the same thing he had seen roshan only once in long lake park watching princes and aristocrats at a polo game the general visiting from his base in the northeast in xinan to receive yet another honour and the gift of a city palace had sat with the imperial party he had been unmistakable in his colossal bulk clad in brilliant overwhelming red his laughter ringing across the meadow he hadnt always been so fat but one needed to be older than tai to remember an lis fighting days he would destroy a horse under him today it was said that he laughed all the time even when killing people that he had never learned to read that he was advised by a steppe demon and had given the emperor certain potions for the delights of darkness in that time when taizu first turned his aging eyesand heartto the youthful glory of wen jian it was also said that the only man roshan had ever fearedand he had very greatly feared him as everyone didwas the infinitely subtle calculating nowdeceased first minister chin hai with chin gone there was a new prime minister and though wen zhou might be a favoured cousin of the precious consort and owe his appointment to that as much as anything else roshan was also beloved of the emperor and had long been said to be equally close to the exquisite jianand perhaps more than merely close depending on which rumour you heard and believed in the night street before a courtesan house in chenyaos pleasure district remembering a summer day in the park tai recalled looking across at the corpulent figure of the military governor from a distance and flinching inwardly at the image of such a figure embracing crushing the most beautiful woman of the age jian was already named by then in poems and had been painted as one of the four great beauties of kitai going back to the first dynasty and the empress jade pearl among the immortals now to xu bihai tonight tai had simply said that he would seek counsel from as many people as he could before deciding what he would do and expressed a willingness to come back west and meet the governor here drink and dine againperhaps in the presence of his charming daughters one of them had giggled at that from by the door not the one in green that one had simply looked across at tai her expression suddenly difficult to read thoughts of the two of them drew his mind back to the house in front of him he wasnt in the best condition after so much saffron wine to deal with matters of court and rival governors such issues could surely be deferred for a night his first in a city after two years the doors of the house were wide open he saw lights within the attendant woman smiled from under two red lanterns of course shed smile a welcome it was her assignment here and she would have just been informed that anythinganythingthe young man wanted was to be offered to him and charged to the governor the young man wanted more wine to start with he decided the sage in the cup the poets said the rest could follow as the spring night deepened and the late moon rose he heard a voice inside speaking poetry he went up the wide handsome steps between lanterns and entered the white phoenix giving a coin to the woman at the door chapter viii the ridiculous kitan adorationand that feels like the right wordof poetry and of declaiming drunken poets is an endless mystery to amber and deeply annoying amber is from sardia has honeygold hair therefore her name not particularly inventive but courtesan names never are she is beautiful green eyes shes longlegged has perfect skin is very young beauty has been enough to ensure her a stream of clients since arriving here even infatuated ones though she cant sing or play one of their instruments and poetry puts her to sleep not every silk merchant or offduty officer in need of a woman for a wintry afternoon or summer night wants the girl to discourse upon philosophy or pluck the bandits of the gorge on a pipa before he takes her upstairs and throws her across a bed amber makes a point of giggling when they do this to her men tend to be excited by that she may not be educated but she understands certain things in bed or on the floor beside it she knows exactly what shes doing has a talent especially if the man is young and not offensive in manner or appearance a few of the women who have been here longer are constantly urging her to listen more carefully to the poetry even memorize some of it to practise harder at her music they are always pointing out that the men with real money the ones who leave additional sums for the girl they are allowed to keep half of this will usually be those with some worldliness thats just the way of things here in kitai even in a western market town bright amber she likes the name they gave her as it happens doesnt entirely disagree but she also knows that a merchant just off the long road will be generous to a pretty girl with smooth legs and an easy laugh and green eyes and that many of those men will be indifferent to or bored by as she is obsessive distinctions between eightline regulated verse and any other of the hopelessly contrived forms poetry takes here poetry in the name of the bullgod you even need to be a poet to rise in the civil service here can there be a clearer sign of a culture that has lost its way amber doesnt think there is when she thinks about it at all though she does concede the point jade flower makes if kitai has lost its way why does it control so much of the world maybe it would be different in a pleasure house in xinan or yenling where the aristocrats are maybe shed accept that it was worth her while to work on other skills but amber is happy in chenyao has thoughts already about one or two merchants and one extremely handsome officer of the second district cavalry shes perfectly content to spend a year or two in the white phoenix and then cajole or induce the right man to buy her as his concubine it is as good a life plan as any for a girl she is from a hard world after all orphaned in a plague summer sold at twelve by her oldest sister to a brothelkeeper noticed there by a merchant heading east bought by him to sell her good fortune that no doubting it she is distinctive in kitai and the white phoenix is the best house in chenyao she has food and a bed of her own firesides in winter two days a month to herself and half the festival holidays life has not dealt badly with her chenyao is as far into kitai as amber feels any desire to go they recite more poetry in pleasure houses east among other things shes been told that often enough you need to pretend to listen and admire and understand it strum accompaniment on your pipa or else the men in fine silks of their own will laugh the wrong way or ignore you entirely a waste of a pretty girl as far as amber is concerned let the older women who need to spend time each day painting away lines struggle to find ways to keep the attention of clients clapping and smiling at drunken mumbled verses placing a pipa strategically in front of fallen breasts amber tends to find that standing a certain way then just looking across the room at a man is enough at this particular moment of an almostsummer night however in the large subtly lit reception room of the white phoenix crowded with a variety of men and a number of perfumed women circumstances are otherwise no one is looking at amber though shes positioned herself by her favourite lamp near an archway and knows her hair is beautiful tonight even one of her regular clients the cavalry officer she has thoughts about is among those crowding the central platform on that platform a softbellied badly groomed considerably intoxicated man well past his middle years is reciting a verse aboutas best amber can tella wife and her absent husband it is she feels strongly insulting the poet is proceeding slowlyin part because he stops to take a drink every few lines this poem is not alas one of their brief formal things this one he declared his voice is not deep but it carries is a ballad whatever that is well amber knows one cursed thing it is long she makes herself smile with that no one notices one of the other girls looking as if she was on the cresting edge of extreme desire had breathed the word immortal when the poet came in some little time ago the banished immortal it is laughable amber wants to laugh but knows shed be in trouble if she did where she comes from an immortal exiled from heaven for whatever reason would have to look a great deal more as if he knew how to use the sword that lies beside the poet now and would surely have the dignity to not be so obviously unable to stop himself from drinking cup after cup of their best grape wine it hasnt happened yet but she expects his voice to start slurring soonif he even manages to remain upright this one isnt going to be much use to himself or the girl he takes upstairs amber thinks sometimes if the man is too drunk to use you properly he leaves a larger sum to have a girl keep quiet about his embarrassment she doesnt think this one this immortal in his dusty winestained clothing is likely to care he is still reciting to an unnaturally silent room and still drinking another cup every few lines hes impressive in that at least amber concedes two of the girls hovering by the platform visibly excited hasten to refill his cup taking turns amber wonders if their nipples are hard she is tempted to have a coughing fit or cause a lamp to topple so annoyed is she by this spectacle no one is looking at her no one is talking or even whispering to anyone else no one is taking any of the women to another room and the owner doesnt look as if she cares in the least incredulously amber realizes that some of the girlsand many of the menhave tears in their eyes tears bright amber is from a land famed for horses and women and for men who fight barechested with knives priding themselves on their scars she is seventeen and a half years old has been in the white phoenix for a little more than two years now but honestly she thinks she could live among these kitan till she was dried up like an endofautumn grape bent like an oxcart wheel and shed never understand them or how the celestial empire dominates the world they know she is thinking this outraged and aggrieved when another man steps quietly into the room following lotus through the open doorway lotus just watches at the entrance now greets arrivals too old to ever be asked to go to a room with a man any more her hands are twisted painful in rain and wind she cant even play the pipa properly apparently she was the best of all of them once amber sees lotus bow to this man as low as she can twice as she backs out to the portico thatof courseis the usual sign to all of them this one is important has money no one but amber is even looking she runs a quick hand to her bright hair checking the pins that hold it in place prepares her smile for when his gaze finds her beside the lamp it doesnt he stops where he stands his mouth opens he staresit is too upsettingat the poet on his raised platform the new arrivals expression is awed disbelieving he has money to spend lotus has signalled it hes young presentable you might even call this one handsome unusual deepset eyes amber wants him to look at her with that dazzled expression as she unbinds her golden hair and slowly teasingly discards silken clothing in a private room and kneels gracefully to attend to him she swears not quietly enough two of the older women turn back to glare at her amber offers the response that makes the most sense at this particular moment she sticks out her tongue in the teachings of the path beliefs to which hed tried erratically to adhere tai knew that coincidence the fortuitous encounter was to be accepted with composure if grim and unpleasant such moments were properly understood as tasks lessons one was meant to master if benevolent they were gifts to be humbly received sometimes there was no obvious tilt towards one side or other of that balancing there was simply a moment an event that startled in its unexpectedness regarding these there was a dispute among teachers some said the wayfarers task was to interpret the meaning of the moment as best he could and respond appropriately others taught that there were moments in a life that did not admit of understanding until long after at such times they counselled one was merely to experience and strive towards comprehension in the fullness of time that sima zian the banished immortal most beloved poet of the empire should be in the reception hall of the white phoenix pleasure house of chenyao declaiming one of the poems tai loved most in the world feltimmediatelyto be one of those moments that could not possibly be grasped there was no point even trying be in the room tai told himself be aware of all of this gather it before anything else however it made sense to close his mouth which was hanging open like that of a child watching fireworks at the chrysanthemum festival he took a few cautious steps forward the women their silks in many colours like butterflies or flowers were exquisitely trained in an expensive house perfumed deliciously they made way for him lingering close in subtle and lesssubtle ways to read how he responded what he liked girls like these and the wine they offered and their flute and pipa music had been what hed dreamed about for two years they almost didnt matter now he moved forward a little more among other men around the platform merchants and soldiers provincial bureaucrats in their belted gowns no students not in a border town or a house this expensive up close there was resistance as tai tried to get nearer to the poet he saw a willowy girl bend her hair swept up stylishly the curves of her perfect breasts showing to pour for sima zian as he paused between verses he waited for her smiled drank off the entire cup he hesitated resumed i remember my careless maiden time i did not understand the world and its ways until i wed you a man of the great river now on river sands i wait for the wind to change and when as summer begins the winds are fair i think husband you will soon be here autumn comes the west wind whistles i know you cannot come to me sima zian paused again lifted his cup it was refilled from his other side another girl lissome as the first her dark hair pleasingly disordered brushing the great mans shoulder he smiled at her and tai sawfor the first time so nearthe poets notorious tigereyes wideset dangerous you might even say eyes that would know you and the world on the other hand the poet hiccupped and then giggled oh dear he said i have friends in xinan i do still have friends in xinan who would be disappointed in me that this small sampling of a good wine should cause me to lose the thread of my own verse will someone he looked around optimistically tai heard himself before he was aware that he was speaking but whether you go or come it is always sorrow for when we meet you will be off again too soon youll make the river ford in how many days i dreamt last night i crossed the waves in wind and joined you and we rode on grey horses east to where the orchids are on the immortals isle we saw a drake and duck together in green reeds as if they were painted on a silkthread screen the crowd by the raised platform parted turning to look at him tai moved forward aware that he wasnt entirely sober himself lightheaded with what he was doing overwhelmed to be among this many people after so long alone all these women his gaze was metand heldby tigereyes he stopped had reached the last verse sima zian smiled no danger in it at all only goodnatured inebriated delight that was it he exclaimed thank you friend and have you left the ending for me tai bowed hand in fist he didnt trust himself to speak he had loved the words of this man and the legend of him since hed left childhood behind when he straightened a tall girl in crimson silk attached herself to his side hip against his a long arm lightly around his waist head tilted to rest on his shoulder he breathed the scent of her felt a surge of desire over and above and through all else sima zian the banished immortal who had never held a single post in the imperial civil service never even sat an examination who had been banished from xinan as well as heaven three times that tai knew about who was reliably reported to have not been entirely sober in decades who could nonetheless extemporize a poem write it on the spot with immaculate brushwork and break your heart said softly into the hush take pity upon me now when i was fifteen years old my face and body were ripe as a summer peach why did i wed a merchant who travels the great river water is my grief my grief is the wind there was a further silence surely there would always be tai thought a silence after this everywhere the hand around his waist lingered there was musk in her perfume and ambergris both were expensive this really was he thought the best house in chenyao if the girls wore such scents thank you master he said someone had to say it he thought sima zian didnt turn his head at first he lifted a hand holding the empty cup the first girl moved beside him and refilled it the poet drank it off held it up again the second woman refusing to yield her rights came forward this time the poets eyes pale and brilliant in the lamplight finally turned to look at tai join me sima zian said if your mourning time is over it must be since you are among us we can drink together tai opened his mouth realized he had no idea what to say the girl beside him pressed her head briefly against his shoulder a reminder of her presence a promise and withdrew tai stepped up to the platform bowed and slipped off his own sheathed sword laying it near the poets he sat opposite the other man crosslegged a cup was handed to him wine was poured he lifted the cup in salute he decided to be careful how much he drank he had no idea how sima zian knew who he was the poet seen close was a bigger man than tai had imagined his long hair was mostly grey tied at the back with a nondescript blue strip of cloth no hairpins his robe was stained his face was remarkably unlined round flushed and benign the bright eyes were unsettling however his hands were steady large the fingers long he said i knew of your father of course his death was a loss it has always seemed to me that the best military leaders are gentle in their souls aware of what war means i thought this might be true of shen gao he lifted his cup and drank tai did the same cautiously tai cleared his throat it was necessary to speak or be thought simpleminded the two girls had withdrawn down the two steps leaving them a space of privacy on this platform the evening activities of the chamber had resumed he heard pipa music begin then a flute and laughter saw men and women retiring through curtained doorways tai wished he were sober he said our family is honoured of course that you even know who he was or who i am the pale eyes were briefly sharp then amusement returned you have been long away said the poet i know your brother as well shen liu is too close to the first minister not to be known and judged tai said judged but not admired sima zian grinned again a smile seemed to be his natural expression not by all the same is true of course of the first minister himself we live in challenging times assessments are going to be made tai looked quickly around only the two girls with their wine were in possible range of hearing this the poet laughed you are concerned for me what would wen zhou do exile me from xinan again he would like to i suspect so would others it was decided by friends who care for me that this might be a good summer to absent myself from the capital thats why im drinking in a pleasure house in the west in part a deliberate pause an obvious invitation taking it tai murmured in part that laughter again uninhibited infectiousthough tai was not in a state to share amusement the prefect was kind enough to tell me of your arrival over dinner this evening he mentioned that youd inquired about where the best courtesan house in town might be a sensible query i wanted to meet you i am i am humbled tai heard himself stammering no said sima zian not after that lake beyond borders what you did there his wide gaze was suddenly direct tai nodded a single awkward bob of the head he felt flushed wine and the rooms warmth the intensity of the eyes holding his the poet murmured alone among the pines he is a servant of no man how could i dream of ascending such a mountain from below that starlight i bow my head the lines were well known zian had written them himself for a friend years ago another poet older now gone tai lowered his eyes you do me too much honour sima zian shook his head no he said again i do not then quietly do you see ghosts here tonight it was a real question tai was startled looked at the other man and then away zian held up his cup and one of the women came forward she gestured at tais and he shook his head the poet made a face tai tried to ignore that he said i never saw them at kuala nor heard tai nodded more slowly every night once once only by day last afternoon sun going down a wind that was not wind are they angry the girl had stepped back down again with the wine this was difficult some of them others are lost or in pain the poet looked away this time at length he shook his head did you ever write about it how did you know that i the smile again more gently you were studying for the examinations i understand when your father died all of you write poetry son of shen gao or we try tai amended i had paper and ink wrote little i judged worth keeping i am not equal to their story perhaps none of us are tai drew a breath what else did the prefect tell you he wanted he badly wanted a man he could trust he wanted it to be this man sima zian hesitated for the first time then he did inform me about your sardians the heavenly horses the princesss gift i see said tai it was too large a tale to keep he thought every man who heard it would tell they will probably know in xinan soon the poet added i hope so i sent word ahead the eyes were thoughtful because the horses are being held for me at the border the gift is revoked if i do not claim them myself clever the other man said after a moment it might save your life he didnt smile now a taguran captain thought of it tai wasnt sure why hed said that a friend clearly i think so while were at peace ah you believe we might not be tai shook his head suddenly uneasy ive been away two years i have no information what should i know abruptly he lifted his cup it seemed he did want another drink the poet waited until a girl had come with wine and withdrawn slender and young in winecoloured silk that rustled as she moved sima zians gaze drifted across the crowded lamplit room came back to tai as to saving your life he murmured under the music dont look away from me but is there a chance uncivilized men would be here with ill intent towards you his voice was relaxed almost lazy as if they were discussing poetry or world affairs it is possible tai said carefully he felt his heart beginning to hammer kept his gaze on the poets even with that message you sent ahead the loss of the horses should you die of course they might be here for me truly the poet shrugged he was deceptively broadshouldered the softness hid it unlikely i offended the prime minister and the chief eunuch in the same room which is difficult but i dont believe it was a deadly insult for either remind me to tell you the story later i will said tai later that meant something didnt it he cleared his throat it took some effort not to look around he made a decision he would acknowledge after that some of it had to do with the sense of the person that came through in the poetry and that this might not be a sound basis for judging a man nonetheless there was an assassin sent west for me before the gift of the horses was known sima zians expression changed again watching him tai saw curiosity and thenunexpectedlya hint of pleasure you killed him it was widely reported that the poet had been an itinerant warrior in his youth two horses two swords and a bow sleeping in caves or under stars defending peasants against landlords and tax collectors like one of the herobandits of folk tales there were storieslegends reallyabout his deeds along the great river in the wild country by the gorges it was a woman tai said but no i didnt she was killed by the tagurans and and the ghosts you had to trust some people in life the poet considered this then look now near the door do you know them tai turned there were two men to the left of the entranceway they were in profile engaged by three girls neither man was dressed for an evening in the pleasure district let alone the best house there their boots and clothing were dusty and stained they carried two swords each one of them glanced over his shoulder just thendirectly at tai their gazes met the man flicked his eyes away it was enough however they were here for him he looked back at the poet i dont know them sima zian said they know you the poet gestured to the girl whose turn it was with their wine sweet joy are those two often here he asked indicating with his chin are they ever here she was a composed young woman would have stature among the girls to have been chosen to serve the poet her glance towards the door was brief appraising she poured the wine and murmured i have never seen them she made a disapproving face they are not dressed suitably not at all zian agreed cheerfully he looked at tai a brightness in those eyes now he stretched like a big cat i wouldnt mind a fight shall we kill them together i could ask the mistress to have them escorted out said the girl quickly if they distress you my lord the proper thing to say fights were bad for a pleasure house killing was obviously worse the poet made a face but nodded reluctantly was in the process of agreeing when tai spoke he heard the anger in his own voice sharp like the spikes of an assault ram breaking through a gate he was tired of being acted upon threatened attacked treated as an object of maliceor even apparent benevolencewith no resources of his own no chance to shape his own course he did have resources in chenyao tonight and not just his sword no he said be so good as to go out to the governors sedan chair in front advise the soldiers there that two men are inside with ill intent towards me and that this threatens the second military district the governors authority and the security of the empire i would like them detained and questioned i wish to know who sent them i will await the governors answer later tonight at my inn can you do that the girl smiled it was a slightly cruel smile she set down the wine flask on a low table of course i can my lord she murmured she bowed to him withdrawing please excuse a brief absence she walked down the two steps and crossed to the entrance they watched her go her movements were graceful unhurried i believe said sima zian thoughtfully that one would make a memorable companion tai found himself nodding do you know the military governor yet xu bihai will not be gentle with them said the poet i met him tonight tai said not by my own choice and so i believe you i need to know these things however he hesitated the assassin who came to the lake she killed the friend of mine she guided west under the pretext of serving him i buried him at kuala nor a soldier asked sima zian anger still sorrow returning nothing like a scholar taking the examinations with me a man without harm in him the poet shook his head i am sorry to learn of it we live in troubled times tai said he was coming to tell me something came all that way to do it she killed him before he could a clattering from near the doorway they turned six soldiers entered the white phoenix there was a stir but not an unduly disruptive one the room was crowded and large men came in and went out all the time the girl who had come back with the soldiers pointed to the two men zian had noted they were approached a brief intense conversation ensued one of the two wentfoolishlyfor his sword he was carried out a moment later unconscious the other man was hustled through the doorway between soldiers it had only taken a moment the music and laughter from the other side of the room hadnt even paused two girls were dancing a flute was being played this tai thought grimly was the way of life in cities an assault could occur in a public place and not even be noticed he needed to remember this relearn it xinan would be more of the same and infinitely worse the dust of the world sima zian had turned back to look at him id have enjoyed a fight the poet said i believe you tai forced a smile it is unlikely those two can tell them anything you do know that because if this is from xinan from power there will be many people between the order and those sent to execute it tai shook his head he was still angry too much wine too much helplessness and the memory the image of chou yan perhaps he said perhaps not so many people if this is being kept quiet for whatever reason zian grinned happily for someone without any rank and two years away from the world you know more about such things than you should tai shrugged my father and my older brother advises the prime minister as you noted he does do that doesnt he said the poet thoughtfully an honour for your family a great honour he knew his voice didnt match the words and that the other man would hear it sima zian said softly if these two are in chenyao looking for you theyll have been given their orders some time ago to watch for you coming back east probably in the event the assassin by the lake should have failed the voice of his own thought he stared at the other man i still dont know why anyone would have wanted me dead before the horses the poet did not smile i do he said in the dense canopied forests along the great river gibbons swung and shrieked at the boats bobbing and spinning east with the current or being pulled upstream along the gorges birds wheeled crying above the water and the crags tigers lived among the trees and killed men in the dark should they be foolish enough to be abroad at night it was easy to see a tiger in the wide eyes holding his tai thought for all the wit and worldliness of the poet there was also something feral a link to the wilderness that lay outside the walled and guarded cities sima zian had been a bandit on rivers and roads never entirely a part of court or courtesan district you could see it the poet smiled again compassion in his face now but tigers werent like that tai thought they never looked kind you are going to have to do better with your images he told himself there was too much complexity here for a jungle cat the other man said gently you came here for a woman i must imagine it has to have been a long time and that is not good for any man let alone one with hard decisions to make go upstairs shen tai i will do the same make use of tonight because you can let us meet here a little later we will both be the better for it then we can decide what we will do with what i have to tell you what we will do tai cleared his throat i whatever this is it is surely not your trouble or task the smile deepened call it wisdom in the cup if you like which is not always wisdom as we know but i have lived my days making decisions this way and i am too old to change poetry friendship wine the essence of a mans life and then there is the poet rose smoothly enough but he swayed a little when upright he looked down at tai spread his feet a little rumpled foodstained greying hair inadequately tied the wide eyes afire though he said you will know the passage there is another world that is not the world of men he looked around unsteadily for the girl theyd sent to carry the message she was beside him already she bent took his sword handed it to him she said with a slow smile of her own though it is your other sword i want now my lord in all truth sima zian laughed aloud and went with her down the two steps and then from the room through the nearest of the curtained doorways tai sat a moment longer then stood uncertainly claiming his own sheathed sword as he rose a scent was beside him in that same moment musk ambergris a slender hand at his waist again he looked at her crimson silk her hair was gathered with pins of ivory and jade some of it artfully allowed to fall i have been patient she murmured not without distress he gazed at her she was as beautiful to him just then as moonlight on a high meadow as the weaver maid herself as everything he remembered about the grace and mystery of women and she did not have golden hair i may not be as patient he said hearing the change in his voice her expression altered a darker note in the dark eyes that will please me too she said his pulse responded please honour my need and come upstairs my lord pipa music quiet singing flutes laughter and talk in a carefully lit room fading behind him behind them as she led him up the stairs to a room with a very wide bed and lamps already burning lit by servants flickering light waiting for them for whoever it was who came incense on a brazier a window open to catch the latespring breeze there was a pipa on a table shall i play for you my lord after tai said and took her in his arms with hunger and need with fear beneath those and an urgency that came from all of these and found its centre in the rich red of her mouth tasting his and the slipping down of silk as she let it fall and stood before him jewelled at ears and throat wrists and fingers and ankles the lamplight playing with and over the beauty of her body he had a sense even as she began to disrobe him and then drew him to her upon the bed that after this after he went back downstairs his life would change yet again as much as it had when the horses were given to him and therein lay his fear she was skilled and clever unhurried intricately versed in what it was that women were to do here and to know about men and their needs hidden or otherwise in a house this well appointed she made him laugh more than once and catch his breath in quick surprise and draw breath sharply he saw her smile then and cry aloud both times she took him to and through the longdeferred crescendo of desire she washed him after using water from a basin on the table she murmured the words of a very old folk verse as she did and her movements were languid replete slow as aftermath should be and then she did play for him quietly upon the pipa left in the room bringing him back with all of these movement by movement mouth fingers fingernails with whispers in his ear of shocking things and subtle things and finally with musicback from kuala nor to the world at length tai made himself get up he clothed himself again as she watched still naked on the bed posed artfully to let him see her to best effect in the muted light breasts belly the dark inviting place between her thighs she would attend to herself come downstairs after him that was the way it was done properly he finished dressing found his sword bowed to her which was something chou yan had initiated among their circle a tribute to the woman even when one didnt know her name and might never see her again if she had given of herself beyond expectation and reached to needs held deep within he saw that she was surprised he went out of the room and down the stairs towards the next change of his life the poet was on the platform same place likely the same cup in his hand the two girls were there again he wondered idly if theyd both been with him upstairs probably he thought the room was quiet now it was late and though the pleasure districts never really stopped in any city the mood would change as night deepened the best houses let some of the lanterns go out in their reception rooms the ambience grow gentler the music softer and sometimes even melancholy for men could take a kind of pleasure in sadness remembrance of loves long ago or the days of their youth someone was singing the windmill above my village which was only played late and made some listeners cry he placed his sword where it had been before and sat opposite the poet again the taller of the two girls came forward with a cup for him poured wine withdrew tai drank he looked at the other man waiting it is about your sister said sima zian part two chapter ix limei has her own yurt assembled every evening for her when their travels finish for the day taken down in the morning when they rise to go on the sun is west now near the end of their fourth day outside of kitai she has never been this far she has never wanted to be this far there are two ladies attendant on her from the court she doesnt know them doesnt like either of them they cry all the time she is aware that they resent serving her instead of the real princess shes a princess now or they call her one they made her royal before this journey north started from xinan there was a ceremony in the taming palace limei in redandgold silk with a tooheavy headdress decorated with white jade and tortoiseshells and pearls from the south had paid little attention shed been too angry her brother had been standing behind the prime minister shed stared at him the whole time never looking away making certain that he knew exactly how she felt as if that would mean anything to liu at all she is still more angry than anything else though she is aware that this could be a way to hide fear from herself and from others it is anger that stops her from being gentler with the two women who are hers now they are afraid of course they are she could be gentler none of this is their fault theres no shame to their grief she thinks or their terror which has grown worse predictably since they left shuquian behindthe last major city north of xinanand then reached the golden rivers great bend and the wall shuquian had been many days back theyd passed through the wall and entered wilderness four days ago soldiers saluted from above as their party went through limei is counting keeping track of time as best she can a habit of mind her father used to say he liked it in her her father is dead or this would not be happening the leader of their imperial escort had bowed three times to the princesses and then he and the flying dragon army from xinan had turned back at the heavy gates in the long wallback towards the civilized world limei had left her sedan chair to stand in a yellowdragon wind to watch them go she saw the gates of the world swing shut the nomads the barbarians had taken custody of two kitan brides negotiatedtradedfor furs and camels and amber but mainly for horses and military support this is the first time the bogu have aimed so high or been given so much the actual princess thirtyfirst daughter of the glorious emperor taizu may he live and reign forever under heaven will become the newest wife in whatever ceremony they use on the grasslands of hurok the ruling kaghan lord of the steppes or this part of them loyal for the most part ally of kitai it has been duly judged by the clacking blackgarbed crows who serve the imperial throne as advisers that with a momentarily overextended military and issues as to both army costs and the supply of horses it is a sage and prudent time to allow the kumissdrinking steppebarbarians this otherwise unthinkable honour limei should not be here does not wantthe gods know itto be a princess had her father not died putting a twoyear halt to all family ceremonies and celebrations shed surely have been married by now and safe her mother and second mother had been working on that marriage through the proper channels she is not remotely a true member of royalty only an attendant to the aging exiledtothecountryside empress but limei is also the sister of an ambitious brilliantly positioned brother and because of that she is about to become soon now the whateverthenumber wife of hurok kaghans second son tarduk currently his heir not that there is anything certain about remaining an heir on these steppes if youve listened to the stories limei is someone who does listen to what is said around her always has been from childhoodand her second brother tai had come home from the north with a tale years ago there areas with everything done in the taming palaceprecedents for elevating lesser women to royalty for this purpose it is a kind of sly trick played on the barbarians all the subject peoples want ever is the ability to claim a link to kitan royalty if a woman is called a princess that is more than enough for the second or third member of a wedding party for the foreign ruler this has happened a handful of times though never with the bogu a true princess is made available there are more than enough daughters with this particular emperor after forty years on the throne and ten thousand concubines from all over the known world limei has thought about the lives of these women at times locked behind walls and gates and silkpaper windows in their wing of the palace at the top of eunuchguarded stairways most of them have grown old or will never having even been in a room with the emperor or any other man the true princess the emperors daughter has not stopped having one of her attendant women she has six of them sing and play married to a far horizon for her since they left shuquian they are weeping day and night princess xue and her women endless lamentation it is driving limei to distraction she wants a deeper calm around her in this wilderness this wind to nurture the fury within ward off terror think about her brother both her brothers the youngest chao still at home by the stream doesnt really count yet thinking of homecascading images of itis a bad thing to do right now limei realizes she concentrates her mind as best she can on the brother she wants to kill and on the one who ought somehow to have saved her from this although in fairness there would have been nothing tai could have done once liu hadbrilliantly for his own purposesproposed his sister as the second princess for the bogu alliance and had that accepted but why be fair why be accepting in this place of wolves and grass when she is leaving everything shes ever known for empty spaces and primitive yurts yellowdust wind off the western desert and a life among barbarians who will not even speak her language this would never have happened if her father were alive eldest son liu has always been eloquent and persuasive and daughters are tools many fathers would have acquiesced seen the same family glory liu did but limei only girlchild of her family is almost certain that the general even in retirement would have stopped his first son from using a sister this way liu would have never dared propose it ambition for self and family was proper in a balanced man but there were limits which were part of balance she wants to think this but has been with the court long enougharriving the year before the empresss exileto picture it otherwise she can almost hear lius polished reasonable voice what is so different from offering her as an attendant to the empress in my proposing her elevation to a princess are they not both exaltations for our family has she any other duty or role in life it is difficult even in the imagination to shape a sufficiently crushing reply tai might have done so equally clever in a different fashion but her second brother is impossibly far away right now west among the ghosts it is an absolute certainty that liu took that absence into account as well when he shaped his plans nor could limeis sad sweet empress exiled from the palace lost to endless prayers and a dwindling memory do anything to shield her when the summons to the hall of brilliance came limei being carried north is beyond all borders herself now the difference is taiif he is alivewill be going home soon she never will it is a hard thing to live with she needs her anger married to a far horizon starts up again the worst pipa player of the six this time they appear to be taking turns limei allows herself to curse in a very unroyal fashion she hates the song by now lets that feeling help drive and shape the fury she requires she peeks out of her litter they will not let her ride of course one of the bogu is just then passing riding towards the front he is barechested his hair loose almost all the way down his back he sits his horse in a way that no kitan ever has they all do shes come to realize the nomads live on their horses he looks at her as he goes by their eyes meet for an instant before limei lets the curtain fall it takes her a few moments but she decides that the expression in the riders face was not conquest or triumph or even a mans lust but pride she isnt sure what she wants to make of that after a time she peers out again no rider now hes moved ahead the landscape is hazy the evening wind blows dust as usual it has done that for several days now it stings her eyes the sun is low blurred above the endless grass they have seen vast herds of gazelles the last two days heard wolves at night since leaving the wall behind the kitan have a terror of wolves part of the fear and strangeness these northern grasslands evoke those stationed in the garrisons past the wall must hate it like death she thinks squinting towards the orange sunset limei finds herself devising ways in which she might have killed her brother liu before any of this happened sent him over to the night the visions are briefly satisfying shes angry at tai as well shes decided she doesnt have to be fair to anyone in this wind he had no business leaving them for two years not with a father and husband buried he was needed if only as a counterweight to liu he ought to have known that foreseen it she lets the curtain drop leans back against pillows thinking about the two of them sliding towards memory not necessarily a good thing it means remembering about home again but is she really going to be able to keep from doing that it is if nothing else a way of not dwelling upon what is waiting for her when this journey from the bright world ends wherever it does in this emptiness second mother their fathers only concubine was childless a tragedy for her cause of nighttime sorrows and sleeplessness butin the difficult way of truth sometimesan advantage for the four shen children because she diverted all of her considerable affection to them and the generals two women did not have competing children as a source of conflict limei was six years old which means liu was nineteen preparing for the first round of examinations in their prefecture tai was two years younger than him training in military arts already bigger than his older brother chao the baby was toddling about the yard falling happily into piled leaves that autumn she remembers that their father was home end of a campaign season another reason she knew it was autumn that and the paulownia leaves limei who had been diligently studying dance all summer with a teacher arranged by her mothers was to offer a performance for the family one bright windy festivalday morning with everyone home she remembers the wind to this day she believes it was the wind that caused her problem were her life not shattered and lost right now she could manage to be amused that she still clings to this explanation for falling she had fallen the only time shed done that after at least a dozen rehearsals in the days before for her teacher and her mother but with both mothers and father and her older brothers watching and the drummer hired to accompany her she had spun too far halfway through her first dance lost her balance tried to regain it wobbled the other way and tumbledignominiouslyinto leaves at the edge of the courtyard as if she were no older than the baby playing in them no one laughed she remembers that liu might have done so in a certain mood but he didnt limei sat up covered in leaves shocked whitefaced and saw her fathers immediate gentle concern and then his almostmasked amusement at his shortlegged little girlchild and that made her scramble to her feet and run from the courtyard weeping uncontrollably she had wanted to show himshow them allhow she was growing up that she wasnt an infant any more and what shed done was entirely the opposite the humiliation welling within her was beyond enduring liu found her first in the orchard under her favourite peach tree at the farthest end of a row by the stone wall she was sprawled on the ground ruining her dance costume her face buried in her arms she had cried herself out by then but refused to look up when she heard him coming shed expected second mother or perhaps less likely her own mother hearing eldest brothers crisp voice speaking her name had startled her looking back she has long since realized that liu would have told the two women to leave her to him by then theyd have listened to his instructions sit up he said she heard him grunt crouching beside her he was already plump it wasnt an effortless position for him it was simply not done to ignore a direct instruction from a first brother you could be whipped or starved in some other families for that limei sat up faced him remembered to bow her head respectfully hands together though she did not stand up to do it he let that pass perhaps her mudstained face the tracks of her tears caused him to be indulgent you could never tell with liu even back then he said here is what you will learn from this his voice was controlled precisenot the tone with which one addressed a child she remembered that after he was quiet but he made her pay attention he said we train to avoid mistakes and we do not go before others unless we believe we have trained enough that is the first thing do you understand limei nodded eyes wide on her oldest brothers round face he had the beginnings of a moustache and beard that year he said nonetheless because we are not gods or of the imperial family we cannot ever be certain of being flawless it is not given to ordinary men and especially not women therefore this is the second thing you will remember if we are in public and we err if we fall in the leaves or stumble in a speech or bow too many times or too few we continue as if we had not done so do you understand she nodded again her head bobbing liu said if we stop if we apologize show dismay run from a courtyard or a chamber we force our audience to register our error and see that it has shamed us if we carry on we treat it as something that falls to the lot of men and women and show that it has not mastered us that it does not signify and sister you will always remember that you represent this family not only yourself in everything you do do you understand and a third time limei nodded her head say it her brother commanded i understand she said as clearly as she could manage six years old mud and overripe fallen fruit on her face and hands and clothing representing her family in all she did he stared at her a moment then rose with another grunt and walked from the orchard down the long row he wore black she remembers now unusual for a nineteenyearold bordering on presumption no red belt mind you but shen liu was always going to pass the exams all three levels and become a mandarin in the palace in xinan always tai came into the orchard a little later it was a certainty that hed waited for liu to come and go as a second brother should the images of that day are piercingly sharp a wound she is equally certain thinking back that tai knew pretty much exactly what liu had said to her she was sitting up still so this time she saw her brothers approach he smiled when he drew near shed known he would smile at her what she hadnt expected was that hed be carrying a basin of water and a towel hed guessed shed have been lying on muddy ground he sat down next to her crosslegged careless of his own clothing and slippers and placed the bowl between them draping the towel elaborately over a forearm like a servant she thought hed make a funny face to try to make her laugh and she was determined not to laugh she almost always did but he didnt do that he just waited after a moment limei dipped her cupped hands and washed her face and hands and arms there was nothing she could do about her specially made dance costume tai handed her the towel and she dried herself he took the towel back and set it aside tossing the water from the basin and putting that beside him as well better he said looking at her thank you she said she remembers a small silence but an easy one tai was easy to be with shed worshipped both her older brothers she recalls but tai shed loved i fell she said he didnt smile i know it must have felt awful you would have looked forward so much to dancing she nodded not trusting her voice he said it was very good limei until the wind picked up i started worrying when i felt it she looked at him perhaps perhaps next time maybe even tonight you might do it inside i believe that is a reason dancers dislike performing outofdoors any breeze affects how their clothing flows and they can fall i didnt know do they prefer inside i know it for certain her brother said you were very brave to do it in the courtyard on an autumn morning shed permitted herself to briefly claim the notion shed been brave then shook her head resolutely no i just did it where mother and the drum man decided i wasnt brave he smiled limei just saying that makes you honest and brave and that would be true it will be true when you are twentysix not six i am proud of you and father was i saw it as he watched will you dance again for us inside tonight her lip quivered he was father was almost laughing tai grew thoughtful do you know a truth about people when someone falls if they dont hurt themselves it is funny little sister im not sure why do you have an idea shed shaken her head she didnt know why it was funny but she remembered giggling when chao toddled and toppled into leaves tai added and father didnt laugh he was afraid for you at first then afraid he would hurt your pride if he smiled so he didnt i saw he was holding it back he covered his mouth with his hand good for you seeing that yes because hed been very proud he said he hopes youll try again her lip wasnt quivering any more did he truly tai and tai had nodded truly she still doesnt know to this day if that last was the truth but theyd walked out of the orchard together tai carrying the basin and the towel and shed danced for them again that night the dancing costume hurriedly cleaned among carefully spaced lanterns in the largest reception room and she hadnt fallen her father had smiled throughout watching her and patted her cheek when she came over to him after and then he had stood up and bowed formally without laughing at all and given her a string of copper coins the way one paid a real dancer and then a sweet from one of his pockets because she was six years old if she were to address within herselfor explain to someone who might ask and have any claim to an answera few of the very great differences between her older brothers limei thinks those longago conversations in the autumn orchard would do well enough liu had told herthat day and endlessly after in person and in letters from xinanthat she represented the family in all she did she accepted it as true for her for any woman or man that was the way of things in kitai you were nothing in the empire without a family behind you but she is beyond the empire now the nomads with their strings of longmaned horses and huge wolfhounds and their primitive yurts and harshsounding language dont know her family her father dont care at all about that they dont even knowthe thought comes hard to herthat shes part of the shen lineage shes been named as one of the imperial dynasty that is how the bogu see her thats why they look so proud glancing at her as they ride by the honour of it eludes her just now she is the embodiment of a smug deception and of her brothers cold ambition and no one at home by their small stream will ever see her again she wonders controlling emotion if a letter will even reach her mother and second mother if she sends one or a dozen with bogu riders to the trading place by the rivers loop in spring tai had called her brave had repeated over and again how clever she was growing up how both these things would help her in life she isnt so sure any more he wouldnt have been lying but he might have been wrong bravery might mean only that she doesnt weep at night or insist on hearing the same interminable lament as they travel and limei has no idea at all how cleverness might play out for the second or fifth wife of the kaghans heir she doesnt even know what number shell be she knows nothing of the man shes travelling to wedwhose bed shell share if he even chooses in her carried litter limei draws a deep breath she can kill herself that has been done by women married in this fashion it is considered a disgrace of course she isnt sure she cares she can decide to cry and mourn all the way north and after they arrive or she can represent her fathers bright tall memory and the version of herself tai has held up like a bronze mirror all her life the version of shen limei that an aged empress had loved and trusted in her own exile after the precious consort came and bewitched with music and wit and beauty changing the world a woman could change the world and limei is not the first woman to be exiled from her life and home through marriage through the ending of marriage through someones death through birth through the inability to bear a child in one hard way or another she hears shouted orders she recognizes some words by now having paid attention they are finally stopping for the night the approach of summer on the steppe means very long days the routine has been established the two princesses remain in their litters while their yurts are prepared they step out when summoned and proceed directly into the yurts where a meal is brought to them after they are readied for bed by their women and they sleep they rise so early that even nearing summer there is sometimes frost on the grass or a mist rising in the litter as it is set down limei makes a face it is somewhat childlike in fact although she wouldnt like to be told that she pushes bare feet into slippers she draws back her curtain herselfall the way this timeand she steps outside into evening light and the dusty wind of the wide steppe the grass around her the world is green as emeralds her heart is beating fast she hopes no one can tell that one of her litterbearers cries out startled a rider turns at the sound sees her standing there and comes galloping back through the tall grass the same one who glanced at her before he swings off his horse before it has even stopped hits the ground smoothly running then slowing an action done half a thousand times limei thinks he comes up anger and urgency in his face he speaks fiercely gesturing at the litter for her to reenter no ambiguity in the message though she doesnt understand the words she does not move he says it again same words more loudly same harsh pointing gesture others have turned now are looking at them two more riders are coming quickly from the front of the column their expressions grim it would be wisest limei thinks to go back into her litter she slaps the man in front of her hard across the face the impact stings her hand she cannot remember the last time she struck someone she cannot remember ever doing so in fact she says enunciating clearlyhe will not understand but it doesnt matter i am the daughter of a kitan general and a member of the imperial family of the celestial emperor taizu lord of the five directions and i am bridetobe of the kaghans heir whatever rank you hold any of you you will listen to me now i am done with staying in a litter or a yurt all day and night bring me someone who understands a civilized tongue and i will say it again it is possible he might kill her she may be standing at the edge of night here of crossing over his shame will be very great struck by a woman but she sees indecision in his eyes and relief floods through her she is not going to die in this evening wind they have too much vested in her coming north to this marriage he had looked so proud moments before riding past gazing at her with nothing but instinct as her guide limei steps back places her feet together and bows hands formally clasping each other inside the wide sleeves of her robe straightening she then smiles briefly royalty condescending to ease a hard moment let them be confused she thinks let them be uncertain of her showing anger and independence then courtesy and even grace she sees that the curtain of the other princesss litter the real princess has been pulled slightly back good let her watch at least the idiotic song has stopped limei hears birds they are passing overhead in great numbers there is a lake nearby that will be why theyve chosen this place to stop for the night she points to the water what lake is that what is it called in your tongue she looks at the man in front of her the other two have reined up by now have remained on their horses visibly uncertain as to how to proceed she says if i am to live among the bogu i must learn these things bring me someone who can answer the man in front of her clears his throat and says amazingly we name it marmot lake there are many of them here marmots their burrows on the hills other side he speaks kitan she raises her eyebrows and favours himagain keeping it briefwith a smile why did you not tell me you spoke our language he looks away manages a shrug that is meant to be disdainful but fails you learned it trading by the rivers loop he looks quickly back at her startled but it wasnt a difficult surmise yes he says in that case she says coldly now if you have anything to say to me including requests i may or may not agree to you will say it from now on in the language i know and you will tell the others what i said to you just now do you understand me and gloriously after a short pause he nods tell them she says and she turns her back on them to look east towards the lake and the birds the wind is tugging at her hair trying to pulls strands of it free of the long pins there is a poem about that the wind as an impatient lover she hears him clear his throat again then begin to speak in his own tongue to the riders who have gathered she waits for him to finish before she turns back and now she gives him something gives it to all of them i will be trying to learn your language now i will have questions you must show me the riders who know kitan do you understand he nods again but more importantly one of those on horseback lifts a hand as if asking permission to speak which is proper and says i speak also your tongue princess better than this one he grins crookedtoothed an edge of competition here he is a bigger man and limei sees with pleasure that the one standing before her looks angrily at the new claimant she smiles at the one on the horse this time i hear you she says though i will form my own conclusions as to whose speech is best among those here i will let you all know after ive had time to judge they must be played she thinks kept in balance the men here any woman from the taming knows something of how to do that meanwhile this is useful the first good thing in who knows how long all her life she has been known for asking questions and now she might find some answers here she needs to learn as much as she can about the man shes marrying and the life of women on this steppe if existence is to become a dark horror she will end it herself but if days and nights can be shaped in any way here beyond the wall and the known world she has decided to try she is trying now she looks at the one standing before her your name she keeps her tone and bearing imperious sibir he says then adds princess and inclines his head come with me she says bestowing this upon him as a gift for the others to see and envy while they put together the yurts tell me where we are how far we have yet to travel teach me the names of things she walks away without waiting for him going towards the water out of this jumbled column of riders and litters and disassembled yurts the long sun throws her shadow ahead of her be imperial she reminds herself head high the sky she thinks is enormous and the horizon the horizon she is married to is astonishingly far sibir bestirs himself follows quickly it pleases her that he does not fall into stride beside her remaining half a step behind this is good it is also good that her heartbeat has slowed her right hand stings from when she slapped him she cannot believe she did that the ground is uneven there are rabbit holes and those of other animals marmots the grass is astonishingly high almost to her waist as she nears the lake grasshoppers jump as she walks through she will need better shoes she realizes she is unsure what clothing they packed for her at the palace she deliberately ignored all that at the time lost in anger she will have one of her women open the trunks and boxes they are bringing north and look i intend to do this each morning before we start and every evening when we make camp she says looking around also at midday when we stop to eat unless you tell me there is danger i want you to attend upon me do you understand do you understand she is sounding like her brother liu and yes there is irony in that the one named sibir does not answer unexpectedly she looks over her shoulder uneasily she is not as confident as she sounds how could she be he has stopped walking and so does she his gaze is not on her he says something in his own tongue an oath a prayer an invocation behind them in the column of riders the others have also fallen silent no one is moving the stillness is unnatural they are all looking in the same directiontowards the lake but beyond it above to the hills where the marmot burrows are supposed to be limei turns to see there is another stirring of wind she brings up both hands and crosses them on her breast protectively aware again powerfully of how alone she is how far away oh father she whispers surprising herself why did you leave me to this of all creatures living the kitan most fear wolves a farming peoplerice and cereal grains irrigation and patiently cultivated fieldsthey always have the wolves of the northern steppe are said to be the largest in the world on a hill slope beyond the lake there are a dozen of them in the open motionless against the sky lit by the lateday sun looking down upon them upon her sibir speaks finally his voice thick with tension princess we go back quickly this is not natural they let themselves be seen wolves never do and his voice stops as if the capacity for words in any language has been ripped away from him she is still looking east she sees what all of them see a man has appeared on the hilltop among the wolves the beasts make room for him they actually do that and shen limei knows with sudden appalling certainty that her lifes journey is about to change again because paths can and do fork in ways no man or woman can ever truly grasp for that is the way the world has been made chapter x that same evening in the taming palace bordering the northern wall of xinan with the vast enclosed deer park visible through open balcony doors a woman is playing a stringed instrument in an upperlevel audience chamber making music for the emperor and a select company of his courtiers his heir shinzu is also present the prince is cradling a steadily replenished cup of wine the emperor taizu serene lord of the five directions ruling with the mandate of heaven never takes his eyes from the woman making music that observation applies to most of the people in the chamber one mandarin is also watching out of the corner of his eye a prodigiously large man near the emperor tryingand failingto see into his heart wen jian the precious consort is accustomed to being the object of all gazes it is the way things are the way she is this is so whether she is making music as now or simply entering a room or riding through one of the city or palace parks alongside water or wood it is acknowledged as her due she is already named among the legendary beauties of kitai she is twentyone years old she takes the breath away alters the rhythm of the heart first time seen every time after as if memory is erased then renewed one thinks of impossible ripeness then of porcelain or ivory and tries to reconcile these images and fails seeing wen jian this evening her instrument is western in origin a variant of the pipa played with the fingers not a plectrum she was singing earlier but is not doing so now only rippling notes fill the room which has columns of alternating jade and alabaster some of the latter so finely wrought that lanterns placed within them cast a light a blind man sits with a flute on a woven mat beside the woman at a moment of her choosing she strokes a final note and he knows this for his cue and begins to play she rises and it can be seen she is barefoot crossing the pink marble floor to stand before the throne that has been carried to this room the son of heaven smiles behind the narrow greywhite length of his beard he is robed in white his belt is yellow the imperial colour he wears a soft black hat pinned upon his head black silk slippers stitched with gold and three rings upon each hand one of the rings is a green jade dragon only the emperor can wear this forty years ago a little more he killed his aunt and two of his brothers and sixty thousand men died in the weeks and months following as he claimed and secured the phoenix throne after his fathers passing bold and capable on the battlefield learned imaginative much more than the brothers who died a hardened leader taizu had secured the ninth dynasty and shaped the known world using war to bring expansion and peace and then that peaceenduring for the most partto begin the flow of almost unimaginable wealth to kitai to this city this palace which hed built beside the smaller one that had been his fathers he is no longer young he is easily wearied now by affairs of state and governance after so many decades of diligent care he is building his tomb northwest of xinan beside his fathers and grandfathers dwarfing thembut he wants to live forever with her with jian and her music and youth the beauty of her this improbable discovery treasure beyond jade of his whitehaired latter days she moves before them now in a high room beginning to dance as the blind man lightly plays there is a sound among those watching a collective intake of breath as from mortals glimpsing the ninth heaven from a distance a hint given of what existence might be like among the gods the emperor is silent watching her jians eyes are on his they are almost always on his when he is in a room flute music that soft breath of anticipation as her dance begins and then one voice cries out shockingly an assault oh very good you will dance for us now good he laughs happily a voice oddly highpitched in a stupefyingly massive body a man so large his buttocks and thighs overspill the mat set out for him next to the throne he has been permitted to sit leaning upon cushions an acknowledgement of necessity and a sign of honour no one else is seated other than the emperor and the blind musician not even taizus heir shinzu stands near his father drinking wine carefully silent it is usually wise for a prince in kitai to be cautious the very large man not careful at all had been born a barbarian in the northwest he was arrested young for stealing sheep but permitted to join the kitan army instead of being executed he is now so powerful it terrifies most of those in this room he is the military governor of three districts in the northeast an enormous territory a very large army this has never happened before one governor for three districts it has never been permitted to happen the mans thick legs are thrust straight out before him there is no possible way he could cross them his eyes are almosthidden slits in the creases of a smoothshaven face his hair under a black hat is thinning there isnt enough left to tie into a knot when he comes to xinan or when he leaves the imperial city returning to his northern districts twelve men bear his sedan chair gone are the days when a horse could carry him into battle or anywhere else his name is an li but he has been known for a long time as roshan he is hated by a great many but there are those who adore him as passionately as intensely the emperor is one who loves him and jian the precious consort has even adopted him as her sonthough he is past twice her agein a childs game a mockery of ceremony seen by some as an abomination earlier this spring the women of her entourage thirty or forty of them giggling amid clouds of incense and the scent of mingled perfume had stripped him of his garments as he lay upon the floor in the womens quarters and then they had powdered and swaddled and pinned him like a newborn in vast cloths jian entering laughing and clapping with delight had fed him milk pretendingwith exposed breasts some saidit was her own the emperor it was whispered had come into the room that day in the womens quarters where the gross man who had beenand in many ways still wasthe most formidable general in the empire was wailing and crying like a newborn babe lying on his back fisting small eyes with his hands while sleek scented women of the taming palace laughed themselves into raptures of amusement to see jian and roshan so merrily at play at the centre of the world everyone in xinan knew that story other tales were whispered about the two of them which were unspeakably dangerous to say aloud in the wrong company in any company really to speak out as roshan does this evening just as wen jians dance begins is a violent breach of protocol for those who understand such things it is also a ferociously aggressive display of confidence he is uncouth and illiterateproudly declares it himselfborn into a tribe bordering desert dunes among a people who had learned to survive raising sheep and horses and then robbing merchants on the silk roads his father had served in the kitan army on the frontier one of many barbarian horsemen filling that role as the imperial army evolved they had stopped the raiding made the long roads safe for commerce and the growth of xinan and the empire the father had risen to middling rankpreparing the way for a son who had not always been so vast an li in turn had been a soldier and an officer then a senior one whose soldiers left mounds of enemy skulls on his battlefields for the wolves and carrion birds subduing swaths of territory for kitai following upon these conquests hed been made a general and then not long after a military governor in the northeast with honours beyond any of the other governors he assumes a licence accordingly to behave in ways no other man would dare not even the heir perhaps especially the heir he amuses taizu in the view of some in this room he acts this way deliberately interrupts crudely to show others that he can that only he can among those with this opinion is the first minister the new one wen zhou the precious consorts favoured cousin holding office because of her intercession the last prime minister the gaunt unsleeping one who died in the autumnto the relief of many and the fear and grief of otherswas the only man alive roshan had visibly feared chin hai who had steadily promoted the gross barbarian and kept him in check has gone to his ancestors and the taming palace is a different place which means the empire is eunuchs and mandarins princes and military leaders aristocrats disciples of both the sacred path and the cho masterall of them watch the first minister and the strongest of the military governors and no one moves too quickly or calls attention to himself it is not always a good thing to be noticed among those observing jians first slow sensuous motionsher creamandgold silk skirt sweeping the floor then beginning to rise and float as her movements grow swifter widerthe most suspicious view of roshan is shared by the prime ministers principal adviser this figure stands behind zhou in the black robes red belt gold key hanging from the belt of a mandarin of the highest ninth degree his name is shen liu and his sister his only sister is a great distance north by now beyond the long wall serving his needs extremely well he has a cultured appreciation for dancing such as this for poetry good wine and food painting and calligraphy gems and brocaded liao silk even architecture and the subtle orientation of city gardens more in all these cases than the first minister does there is also a sensual side to his nature carefully masked but watching this particular woman liu struggles to resist private imaginings he frightens himself the very fact that he cannot help but picture her in a room alone with him those slender hands upraised wide sleeves falling back to show long smooth arms as she unpins nightblack hair makes him tremble as if an enemy might somehow peer into the recesses of his thought and expose him on a precipice of danger impassive outwardly composed liu stands behind first minister wen beside the chief of the palace eunuchs watching a woman dance a casual observer might think him bored he is not he is hiding desire and frightened by roshan perplexed as to what the mans precise ambitions might be liu hates being unsure of anything always has the first minister is also afraid and they believe they have reason to fear they have discussed a number of actions including provoking roshan into doing something reckless then arresting him for treasonbut the man controls three armies has the emperors love and jian who matters in this is ambivalently positioned one of roshans sons is here in the palace a courtier but also a hostage of sorts if it comes to that liu is privately of the opinion that roshan will not let that deter him from anything he decides to do two of the governors advisers were arrested in the city three weeks ago at the first ministers instigation charged with consulting astrologers after dark a serious crime they have denied the accusations they remain incarcerated roshan has appeared serenely indifferent to the matter the discussions will continue there is a rustling sound a lean cleric of the path an alchemist appears beside the throne bearing a jade and jewelled cup upon a round golden tray the emperor his eyes never leaving the dancer whose eyes never leave his drinks the elixir prescribed him for this hour she will take hers later he might never need his tomb he might live with her forever eating golden peaches in pavilions of sandalwood surrounded by tended lacquer trees and bamboo groves gardens of chrysanthemums beside ponds with lilies and lotus flowers floating in them drifting amid lanterns and fireflies like memories of mortality tai looked across the raised platform at the poet and then away towards a lamp and its shadow on the wall his eyes were open but seeing nothing more than shapes sima zian had finished the tale what he knew what was hed said beginning to be known among people with links to court or civil service it was a story that could easily have reached the scholarsinwaiting come to the ears of tais friends two princesses to be sent as wives to the bogu in exchange for urgently needed horses for stock breeding and the cavalry and increased numbers of the nomads to serve for pay in the kitan army one of the princesses a true daughter of the imperial family the other in the old sly trick it is about your sister the poet had said a great deal had become clear in this softly lit reception chamber of a courtesan house late at night in a provincial town far from the centre of power from where tais older brother trusted confidant and principal adviser to first minister wen zhou had achieved what people would regard as something brilliant spectacular a gift to their entire family not just himself tai looking towards shadow had a sudden image of a little girl sitting on his shoulders reaching up to pick apricots in the no he pushed that away he could not let himself be so cheaply sentimental such maudlin thoughts were for slack poets improvising at a rural prefects banquet for students struggling with an assigned verse on an examination he would conjure instead mornings when general shen gao had been home from campaigning images of the wilful girl who had listened at a doorwayletting herself be seen or heard so they could dismiss her if they chosewhen tai spoke of the world with their father or later after the general had retired to his estate to fishing in the stream and sorrow when tai had been the one coming home from the far north from stone drum mountain or visiting at festivals from studying in xinan limei was not some earnest roundfaced little girl she had been away from home serving the empress at court for three years had been readying herself to be married before their father died another image northern lake cabin aflame fires burning smell of charred flesh men doing unspeakable things to the dead and to those not yet dead memories he would have liked to have left behind by now he became aware that he was clenching his fists he forced himself to stop he hated being obvious transparent it rendered a man vulnerable it was in fact eldest brother liu who had taught him that he saw sima zian looking at him at his hands compassion in the other mans face i want to kill someone tai said a pause to consider this i am familiar with the desire it is sometimes effective not invariably my brother her brother did this tai said the women had withdrawn they were alone on the platform the poet nodded this seems obvious will he expect you to praise him for it tai stared no he said really he might have done so considering what this does for your family no tai said again he looked away he will have done this through the first minister hell have had to sima zian nodded of course he poured himself more wine gestured towards tais cup tai shook his head he said the words rushing out i have also learned that first minister wen has claimed for himself the woman i my own favoured courtesan in the north district the other man smiled as tightly spun as a regulated verse hed be another man youll want to kill tai flushed aware of how banal this must seem to someone as worldly as the poet fighting over a courtesan now a student and a high government official to the death they performed this sort of shallow tale with puppets for gaping farmers in market squares he was too angry and he knew it he reached over and poured another cup after all he looked around the room again only a dozen or so people still awake it was very late hed been riding since daybreak this morning his sister was gone yan was dead by the lake his father was dead his brother his brother there are said sima zian gravely a number of people in xinan and elsewhere who might wish the prime minister to be no longer among the living he will be taking precautions the imperial city is murderously dangerous right now shen tai ill fit in well then wont i the poet didnt smile i dont think so i think youll disturb people shift balances someone doesnt want you arriving obviously obviously it was difficult despite everything to picture his brother selecting an assassin it was painful as a blow it was a crack a crevasse in the world tai shook his head slowly it might not have been your brother said the poet as if reading his thoughts the kanlin woman wei song had done the same thing a few nights ago tai didnt like it of course it was him he said harshly there was a dark place beneath the words he would know how id feel about what he did to limei would he expect you to kill him for it tai slowed the black drumming of his thoughts the poet held his gaze with those wideset eyes at length tai shrugged his shoulders no he wouldnt sima zian smiled so i thought incidentally theres someone on the portico keeps crossing back and forth looking in at us small person wearing black it may be another kanlin sent after you tai didnt bother to look no that one is mine kanlin yes i hired a guard at iron gate a warrior whod been sent by someone in xinan to stop the assassin you trust him he thought of wei song in the laneway tonight when the governors men had come for him he did trust her he realized once it would have irritated him to have someone post herself so visibly on guard the loss of privacy the assumption that he couldnt take care of himself now with what hed learned it was different he was going to need to think that through as well not tonight he was too tired and he couldnt stop his thoughts from going to limei and then to liu first son elder brother they had shared a room for years he pushed that away too more sentimentality they were not children any more it is a woman he said the kanlin shell have seen the governors soldiers leave with their prisoners decided someone needed to be on watch she can be difficult they all can women kanlin warriors put them in one the poet laughed then asked as tai had half expected who is the someone in xinan who sent her he had decided to trust this man too hadnt he the courtesan i mentioned wen zhous concubine this time the poet blinked after a moment he said she risked that for someone whos been away two years shen tai you are he left the thought unfinished but if it is the first minister who wants you dead even costing the empire your horses might not change his mind tai shook his head killing me now after word of the horses has arrived zhou or my brother runs the risk of someoneyou xu bihai even the commander at iron gatelinking it to him the loss of so many sardian horses would make my death important his enemies could bring him down with that the poet considered it then what is this about there was nothing you could do for your sister from kuala nor was there you were much too far it was already too late but an assassin was sent was this about eliminating a new enemy before he returned he hesitated perhaps a rival there was that her hair by lamplight and if someone should take me from here when you are gone he said it might be you are going on to xinan tai smiled first time since coming back down the stairs mirthlessly he said i must surely i have sent word i will be anxiously awaited no answering smile not this time awaited on the road it might also be shen tai you will accept an unworthy friend and companion tai swallowed he hadnt expected this why it would be foolishly dangerous for you to put yourself you helped me remember a poem said the one called the banished immortal thats no reason to and you buried the dead at kuala nor for two years another silence this man was tai thought all about pauses the spaces between words as much as the words themselves across the room someone had begun plucking quietly at a pipa the notes drifting through lamplight and shadow leaves on a moonlit stream xinan is changed you will need someone who knows the city as it has become since you left knows it better than some kanlin pacing back and forth sima zian grinned and then he laughed amusing himself with a thought he elected not to share the poets hand tai saw reached out to touch his sword friend was the word he had used a journey does not end when it ends the wellworn thought comes to her in the chill of night as she waits in her yurt alone limei is not asleep nor under the sheepskin blankets they lay out for her at night it can grow cold on the steppe under stars it is black as a tomb inside with the flap closed she cannot even see her hands she is sitting on the pallet fully clothed holding a small knife she is trembling and unhappy about that even though no one is here to see her weakness the doctrines of the sacred path use the phrase about journeys and destinations to teach in part that death does not end ones travelling through time and the worlds she does not know there is no way she could know but bogu belief lies near to the same thought the soul returns to the sky father the body goes to earth and continues in another form and then another and another until the wheel is broken limei understands something else tonight she knows something else and this was so in the moment she saw the wolves on the slope and the man with them and watched the nomads behind her hurled into chaos and panicthese hard fierce men of the steppe whose very being demands they show no fear to anyone or to themselves something is about to happen a journey one sort of journey will end possibly right here she is awake and clothed waiting with a knife so when the first wolf howls she is unsurprised even with that she is unable to keep from jerking spasmodically at the lost wild sound of it or stop her hands from beginning to shake even more you can be brave and be afraid she fears shell cut herself with the blade and she puts it aside on the pallet a lead wolf by itself at first then others with it filling the wide night with their sound but the nomads dogsthe great wolfhoundsare silent as they have been since the first wolf sighting towards sundown that as much as anything else is why she is so certain something strange is happening the dogs should have gone wild at the sight of the wolves before and hearing them now nothing nothing at all from them she does hear movements outside the riders mounting up they will be happier on horseback she has come to realize that but there are no shouts commands no warlike cries and no dogs it is unnatural the wolves again nearer the worst sound in the world someone called their howling in a longago poem the kitan fear wolves more than tigers in legend in life they are coming down now she closes her eyes in the dark limei wants to lie on her small pallet and draw the sheepskins over her head and wish this all away into notbeingso there was a storyteller in the town nearest their estate who used to offer a marketplace tale a fable of a girl who could do this she remembers extending to him a copper coin the first time then realizing he was blind she wants so much to be there to be home in her own bedchamber going back and forth on the garden swing on a ladder in the orchard picking earlysummer fruit looking up to find the weaver maid in the known evening sky she realizes there are tears on her face impatiently with a gesture at least one of her brothers would have recognized she presses her lips together and wipes at her cheeks with the backs of both hands in her own way though she might wish to deny it showing distress disturbs her as much as it would the nomads outside on their horses she forces herself to stand makes certain shes steady on her feet shes wearing riding boots shed made her two women find them in the baggage when she came back from that walk at sundown she hesitates then takes the knife again drops it into an inside pocket of her tunic she might need it to end her life she draws a breath lifts back the heavy flap of her yurt and ducks outside you have to be afraid for it to count as bravery her father had taught her that a long time ago a wind is blowing it is cold she is aware of the hard brilliance of the stars the band of the sky river arcing across heaven eternal symbol of one thing divided from another the weaver maid from her mortal love the living from the dead the exile from home the man is standing before her yurt shed had a thought about him before what he might be but it turns out she is wrong it is difficult to tell his age especially in the night but she can see that hes dressed as any other bogu rider might be no bells no mirrors no drum he isnt a shaman she had thought this might be why the horsemen were so afraid she knew about these men because her brother had told her years ago though if truth was being demanded tai had told their fatherand limei had listened nearby as father and second son talked did it matter now she knew some things and they could have sent her away from the stream or closed the door if theyd wanted to she hadnt worked very hard at remaining hidden the man in front of her yurt is the one from the lakeside slope she has expected him to come in fact she knows more than that she knows she is the reason hes here and that he is the cause of the dogs silencethough wolves are with him in the camp now half a dozen of them she decides she will not look at them the bogu riders are rigid an almost formal stillness they sit their horses at intervals around her yurt but no one is moving no one reacts to the intruder among them or his wolves they are his wolves what else can they be she sees no nocked arrows no swords unsheathed these men are here to escort the kitan princesses to their kaghan to defend them with their lives this is not happening stars a waning moon campfires burning between yurts sparks snapping there but no other movement it is as if they have all been turned to moonlit statues the man and his wolves the horsemen and their horses and the dogs as in some legend of dragon kings and sorcerers of long ago or foxwomen working magic in bamboo woods by the great river gorges the bogu look limei thinks as if they could not move perhaps that is true an actual truth not a fable told perhaps they are frozen in place by something more than fear or awe it isnt so she decides looking around her in the firelit dark one man twitches his reins another draws a nervous hand down his horses mane a dog stands up then sits quickly again folk tales and legends are what we move away from when the adult world claims our life she thinks for a brief unstable moment it crosses her mind to walk up to the man with the wolves and slap him across the face she does not this isnt the same as before she doesnt understand enough she doesnt understand any of it until she does she cant act cant put her stamp however feeble on events she can only follow where the night leads try to hold down terror be prepared to die the knife is in a pocket of her robe the man has not spoken nor does he now instead looking straight at her he lifts a hand and gestures stiffly to the easttowards the lake and the hills beyond it invisible now in the dark she decides she will treat it as an invitation not a command not that it makes a difference the wolvessix of themimmediately get up and begin loping that way one passes close to her she doesnt look at it the man does not turn to watch them he continues to face limei waiting the riders do not move they are not going to save her she takes a hesitant step testing her steadiness as she does she hears a sigh from those on horseback a sound like wind in a summer grove she realizes belatedly that everyone has been waiting for her that is what this stillness has been about it makes sense as much as anything does in this wide night in an alien land he has come for her after all chapter xi he was tired it had been a very long day and his body was telling him as much tai was hardened and fit after two years digging graves by kuala nor but other factors could enter into making someone weary at days end it would also be dishonest to deny that a measure of his languor could be traced to an encounter upstairs in the white phoenix just now he was aware that the womans scent was still with him and that he didnt know her name that last wasnt unusual and whatever name hed learned wouldnt have been her real one he didnt even know rains real name that suddenly became a sadness joining others stepping outside with the most celebrated poet in the empire his new companionthe reality of that was going to take time to settle intai saw someone waiting and decided hed be happier if his recently hired kanlin guard hadnt looked so smugly amused registering her expression he wished he were sober wei song approached she bowed your servant trusts you are feeling better my lord she spoke with impeccable courtesyand unmistakable irony tai ignored her for the moment a useful tactic when your thoughts offered no good reply he looked around the night square saw the governors sedan chair behind her other soldiers had replaced those whod taken the wouldbe assassins cautionanother new thingmade him hesitate you saw these men arrive he asked gesturing song nodded i spoke with the leader you may safely ride with them her tone was proper her expression barely so he really wished she hadnt said what shed said back at iron gate about women waiting for him in chenyao tai became aware of an extreme delight showing in the face of the rumpled poet beside him sima zian was eyeing tais bodyguard with appreciation by the light of the lanterns on the porch this is wei song my kanlin he said briefly i mentioned her inside you did agreed the poet smiling song smiled back at him and bowed i am honoured illustrious sir she hadnt needed an introduction tai looked from one of them to the other lets walk he said abruptly have the soldiers follow song is there word from the governor about the men they took a report will be sent to us as soon as they have something to tell us he considered commenting and decided he was too tired for a confrontation and not sober enough he didnt want to argue he was thinking about his sister and his brother were leaving at sunrise he said and well be riding faster now please advise our soldiers from iron gate sunrise protested sima zian tai looked at him the poet grinned wryly ill manage he said send this one to wake me wei song laughed she actually laughed flashing white teeth ill do that happily my lord she said unable to think of anything to say to that either tai began walking sima zian caught up with him he showed no evidence of fatigue or the wine hed drunk it was unfair song walked behind them tai heard one of the governors men snap a command as they lifted the empty sedan chair and hurried to follow something occurred to him without breaking stride or looking back he said song how did those two men get inside she said i had the same thought my lord i was guarding the back there is an entrance there i believed that soldiers of governor xu could stop anyone at the front i have spoken with them about this failure they know i will mention it to their commander it was difficult to catch her out tai thought as it should be she was a kanlin after all they will not feel kindly towards you the poet said zian glanced back at song as they walked im certain that is so she said then after a pause she murmured i saw the foxwoman again master shen near the laneway when you fought the soldiers a foxspirit inside the city the poet looked at her again his tone had changed yes she said no tai snapped in the same moment she saw a fox there was silence from the other two only their footsteps and distant noises from other streets the city tai thought he was in a city again at night by the waters of kuala nor the ghosts would be crying with none to hear their voices ah well yes a fox i wonder the banished immortal said thoughtfully if it will be possible to find an acceptable wine at this inn i hope it isnt far there was no message from the governor when they reached the inn nor was there a room available for the poet song spoke to the attendant in the reception pavilion and zian was assigned her chamber she would sleep outside tais room again the staff of the inn were embarrassed by the awkwardness eager to provide a pallet on the covered portico it wasnt unusual for guards to sleep outside doorways there was little tai could do about it the poet invited song to share his room she declined more sweetly than tai would have expected he stared at her as the attendant hurried off to give orders this is because of those two men he asked she hesitated yes of course and your friend needs a chamber it is only proper to its the fox isnt it he couldnt say why that upset him so much anger was too easily his portion hed gone to stone drum mountain in part because of that hed left for the same reason in part she met his gaze eyes defiant they were still in the reception pavilion no one else nearby yes she said it is also that kanlins he recalled were enjoined not to lie what was he going to say it was unexpected on her part given how controlled she was otherwise an embracing of folk legends ancient tales but she certainly wasnt alone in doing that the poet had wandered off through the first courtyard into the nearest pavilion where music was still playing as tai glanced that way zian reappeared grinning carrying a flask of wine and two cups he came back up the steps salmon river wine if you can believe it i am very happy tai lifted a warding hand you will undo me no more tonight the poets smile grew wider he quoted at the very bottom of the last cup at the end of night joy is found tai shook his head perhaps but sunrise will also be found soon sima zian laughed i thought the same so why go to bed at all he turned to wei song keep the room little kanlin ill be with the musicians im sure someone there will offer a pillow if i need one song smiled at him again the chamber is yours sir maybe the pillowor the someonewill prove unsatisfactory i have my place tonight the poet glanced at tai he nodded his head he didnt look nearly intoxicated enough i will instruct that any message from the governor tonight be brought to me song had the grace to bow to tai if that is acceptable it probably shouldnt have been but he was weary too much of too many things it is about your sister he nodded thank you yes you will wake me if you judge it proper of course two servants carrying a rolledup pallet appeared moving briskly managing to bow sideways as they passed they hurried out to the courtyard past lanterns towards a building on the left zian went out after them but turned right again towards pipa music and flutes and a ripple of latenight laughter there was tai saw an eagerness to his stride tai and song followed the pallet the other way it was set down on the covered portico of the first building outside the closed door of his own chamber the servants bowed again and hurried away leaving them alone there were torches burning at intervals along the portico faintly from the far side of the courtyard they could hear the music tai looked at the stars he thought about the last time song had spent a night outside his room he wondered if there was a bolt on the door he remembered that hed meant to check on dynlal before retiring he could ask song to do it and she would but it didnt feel right shed been awake as long as he had it was unlikely to be necessary one of the iron gate soldiers that first one whod seen tai approaching from up on the wall hardly ever left the horse odds were good he was sleeping in the stables he didnt know where the other soldiers were sharing one of the larger rooms most likely theyd be long asleep by now night clouds thin moon stars but a promise of the sun remaking the world bringing mountains back in a way sima zian had the right idea tai had spent entire nights drinking before many times with spring rain with yan and the other students and their women he wasnt up to that tonight youll wake the men he asked wei song ill wake all of you before dawn just knock for me he said he managed a smile she made no reply just looked at him a moment hesitating when she stood so near he realized how small she was ill go tell the stable hands to have the horses fed and watered before sunrise well need a horse for master sima and ill look in on dynlal she bowed briefly walked quickly down the three steps to the courtyard he watched her crossing it she didnt look tired either he thought he went into the room closed the door then he stood just inside keeping extremely still after a moment he opened the door again wait here he said to the empty portico come if i call you he left the door ajar turned back into the chamber it was her perfume that had registered that and the amber glow in the room three lamps were lit which was extravagant so late the servants of the inn would not have done that there was another entrance from the covered porch on the opposite side a private space from which to look at flowers or the moon the sliding slatted doors had been pushed back the room was open to the night the gardens of the inn went all the way down to the river tai saw a star in the opening quite bright flickering she had changed her gown she was wearing red now gold threads in it not the green of before he wished it hadnt been red good evening he said quietly to the daughter of xu bihai it was the older one the one hed liked sidewaysfalling fashion of her hair clever look in her eyes an awareness of the effect shed had bending to pour wine her jewellery was unchanged rings on many fingers the governors daughter was sitting on the edge of his canopied bed alone in the room she wore gold opentoed sandals her toenails were painted red tai saw she smiled stood up moved towards him exquisite it was still unfair in almost every possible way my kanlin guard shes just outside the door he lied then shouldnt we close it she asked her voice was low amused would you like me to do that is she dangerous no no your father would be very unhappy if his daughter was in a closed bedchamber with a man my father she murmured sent me here tai swallowed it was just possible how urgently how desperately did the military leader of two western districts want to keep taiand his horsesfrom rivals from roshan as an example as the best example what would he do to achieve that hed given an answer hadnt he earlier tonight i would sooner kill you xu bihai had said over saffron wine was thisa lissome daughter sent to bind himan alternative short of murder it would preserve the horses for the empire and for the second and third military districts if tai was killed the horses were lost and governor xu if known to have caused that to happen was likely to be exiled or ordered to end his life for all his power and accomplishment but a man could be seduced by an elegant daughter with the worldly skills of wellbred women in ninth dynasty kitai or he could be compromised perhaps forced to behave with honour after a night lacking honour defined by skills there was that possibility and daughterslike sisterscould be used as instruments he was not he realized tired any more the governors daughter tall slender came slowly up to him her perfume was delicious expensive disturbing and the red gown was cut as low as the green one had been earlier tonight a green dragon amulet still hung between her breasts on a golden chain silk brushing against him she glided past to close the halfopen door leave it please tai said she smiled again she turned towards him very close large eyes looking up claimed his her painted eyebrows were shaped like moth wings her skin was flawless cheeks tinted with vermilion she said softly she might become envious or aroused your kanlin woman if we leave the door ajar would you like that would that add to your pleasure sir to imagine her looking in upon us from the dark if tai thought a little desperately she was doing this on the instructions of her father she was a very dutiful daughter i i have already been to the white phoenix pleasure house tonight he stammered not the most poised or courteous thing to say her fingernails were also red and they had golden extensions a fashion he remembered from two years ago in xinan the fashion had reached this far west that was that was interesting tai thought it wasnt really he wasnt thinking very clearly her breath was sweet scented with cloves she said i know where you were they are said to be well trained the girls there worth the cost to any man she cast her eyes down as if shyly but it is not the same you know it my lord as when you are with a wellborn woman you have not bought a woman who has risked a great deal to come to you and waits to be taught what you know her right hand moved and one of those golden fingernails stroked the back of his hand and then as if carelessly moved slowly up the inside of his forearm tai shivered he didnt believe there was a great deal this one needed to be taught not by him not by anyone he closed his eyes took a steadying breath and said i know this is foolish but are you could a daiji be within you that took longer than it should have a third voicefrom the small porch leading to the garden and the river tai and the governors daughter turned very quickly wei song stood framed in the space between the sliding doors one sword was drawn levelled at the girl i can be a little dangerous he heard his kanlin warrior say calmly she wasnt smiling the other woman lifted shaped eyebrows then turned very deliberately away from song as if from someone inconsequential my name she said to tai is xu liang you know it my father introduced us tonight i am flattered you think me fair enough to be a daiji spirit but it is an error it would be another error if your womanservant harmed me it was said with the utmost composure there really was something tai thought about being wellborn you could call kanlin warriors womanservants for one thing it is an error he glanced towards the porch song was biting her lower lip he doubted she was aware of it he was trying to remember if he had ever seen her look this uncertain before it might have been diverting at any other time she kept her sword levelled but without force or conviction now he saw he was still trying to define a proper target for his own rising outrage was there no privacy in a mans life when he travelled with a guard or for that matter when some military leader encountered on the road decided to bind him with a daughter everyone could just wander into his room as they pleased when they pleased day or night eliciting embarrassing fears of shapechanging spirits the daughter in question murmured still not bothering to look at song did you not see my guards kanlin in the garden they rowed me here to the water gate of the inn i am surprised and a little unhappy that neither of them has killed you yet it would be difficult for them my lady they are unconscious by the trees you attacked them she turned to glare at song her anger was pretty clearly unfeigned tai decided her hands were rigid at her sides i found them that way wei song said after a hesitation lady xu liangs mouth opened they are not dead song added no blows that i could see no cups or flasks for poison and they are breathing if you have not been claimed by a foxspirit governors daughter and used for her purposes it may be because something kept the daiji away tai had no idea what to make of this shapeshifting foxwomen were the subject of erotic legends going back to the earliest dynasties their beauty impossibly alluring their physical needs extreme men could be destroyed by them but in such a manner spun of worldchanging desire that the tales aroused fear and inchoate longings further not every man made the nighttime recipient of a daijis fierce hunger was destroyed some of the tales suggested otherwise memorably wei song hadnt yet lowered her blade tai said first of half a dozen questions jostling in his head how did you know to come back she shrugged you couldnt smell that much perfume through the door a cool glance at the governors daughter and i was quite certain you hadnt asked for another courtesan you did say you were tired remember my lord he knew that tone xu liang folded her arms across her lowcut gown she looked younger suddenly tai made his decision this was not a girl possessed by a foxspirit that had chosen to make use of her bodyand hisfor what was left of tonight he didnt even believe in foxwomen that did mean if you were functioning well enough to consider the matter that the governors older daughter was remarkably seductive and alarmingly poised hed address that issue later or perhaps better he wouldnt he concentrated on his blackclad guard not much older than xus daughter so you went song rattled it off impatiently i came back around on the garden side i saw the two guards in the grass she looked at liang i never touched them the governors daughter looked uneasy for the first time then what how were they a footfall on the porch behind wei song id have to agree it was probably a daiji said sima zian the poet came up the steps into the room i just had a look at the two of them tai blinked then shook his head in indignation shall we he asked caustically wake our soldiers and invite them in oh and perhaps the governors men out front might want to join us why not grinned zian no said xu liang not my fathers guards why you said his soldiers brought you here it wont be a secret song said dryly these two tai realized had decided not to like each other you are wrong again kanlin it is secret my being here of course it is the two in the garden are men i can trust liang said my own guards all my life if they have been slain they are not dead the poet said he looked around probably hoping for wine tai thought if i were to shape a conjecture and i confess i enjoy doing that i would say that master shen was the target of a daiji that our clever kanlin is correct he smiled at song and then at the governors daughter your arrival gracious lady was exquisitely timed for the foxspiritor was guided by her he paused to let that thought linger but something here perhaps within our friend kept the spirit awayfrom him and from you if i am correct you have cause to be grateful and what would something be asked xu liang her painted eyebrows were arched again they really were exquisite this is this is nothing but conjecture tai snapped i did say that sima zian agreed calmly but i also asked if you saw ghosts at the white phoenix tonight when first we spoke you are saying that you did no i have only a limited access to the spirit world my friend but enough to sense something about you you mean from kuala nor the ghosts it was wei song this time her brow furrowed she was biting her lower lip again perhaps said the banished immortal i would not know he was looking at tai waiting another lake far to the north a cabin there a dead shaman in the garden mirrors and drum fires and then a man or what had once been a man tai shook his head he was not about to speak of this when pressed ask a question what could my being at kuala nor possibly mean to a daiji the poet shrugged accepted the deflection you might draw one as you passed by she could become aware of your presence conscious of those protecting you hovering there are spirits attending upon master shen xu liang didnt sound fearful you could say if you wanted that she appeared to find the notion intriguing engaging shed uncrossed her arms again was looking at tai another appraising glance not dissimilar to ones shed given him from by the door in her fathers reception room he really had been away from women too long there are spirits near all of us song said from the porch a little too emphatically whether we see them or not the way of the sacred path teaches as much and the dialogues of master cho assert that this is not so murmured the woman in the red gown only our ancestors are near us and only if they were improperly consecrated to the next world when they died which is the reason for our rituals sima zian glanced happily from one woman to the other he clapped his hands you are both splendid beyond description this is a wonderful night we must find wine he cried let us continue this across the way there is music i am not entering a courtesan pavilion said xu bihais daughter with immediate impressive propriety the fact that she was standing scented and bejewelled in a mans bedchamber and had been on the verge of closing the door lest someone be made envious by what was apparently to transpire seemed entirely beside the point tai thought admiringly of course of course you arent the poet murmured forgive me gracious lady well bring a pipa player here and perhaps just one girl with cups and wine i think not said tai i believe that wei song will now escort the lady xu liang back to her fathers mansion is the boat waiting for you of course it is liang said but my guards tai cleared his throat it appears if sima zian is correct and my kanlin that they may have encountered a spiritworld creature i have no better explanation we are told they are alive i will return and watch over them myself song said and tell them when they wake that their lady is home and well they wont believe you if im not here xu liang said im a kanlin said song simply we do not lie they will know that if others less experienced do not the poet tai thought looked ridiculously pleased by all of this liang he realized was looking at him again ignoring the other woman tai didnt entirely mind that he was briefly tempted by the notion of agreeing with zian summoning music and wine but not really his sister was a long way north beyond the wall by now and tonight here in chenyao men had i did say earlier xu liang murmured eyes demurely downcast that my father had sent me you have not asked why indeed well hed had what seemed a good notion why my apologies he bowed is it permitted for your servant to ask now she nodded it is my father wished to advise you privately that those two men when encouraged to discuss their adventurism tonight suggested only one name of possible significance before they each succumbed sadly to the exacting nature of the conversation she looked meaningfully at the poet and then at song on the porch tai understood one is my guard he said the other my companion liang inclined her head she said the assassins were bandits from the woods south of here the man they named lives in chenyao he in turn when invited for a conversation was kind enough to offer another namefrom xinanbefore lamentably expiring tai was listening very closely i see and that other name is she was crisp efficient she said xin luna civil servant at court we understandwas the name given my honoured father offers his deepest regret that he was unable to be of greater assistance but dares to hope this will be of some use to master shen xin lun again yan had spoken that name before he died hed been killed as he said it lun drinking companion fellow student convivial and clever not a student any more it seemed if he was in the palace hed passed the examinations while tai was away a card and dice player once ballad singer at night a lover ofas it happenedsalmon river wine wearing the robes of a mandarin now because of yan it wasnt a revelation not devastating news of betrayal more a confirmation an echo hed been waiting for a different name perhaps two behind these assassins and had been deeply afraid to hear one of them spoken aloud he showed none of this in his face he hoped he bowed to the governors daughter my thanks to your father and to you gracious lady bearing these tidings so late at night i do understand why governor xu would not trust them to anyone else of course he wouldnt she murmured she looked directly at him as she said it then let that slow smile shape her lips as if the guard and the poet werent in the room as if she and tai were continuing a conversation interrupted earlier and so unpleasantly by another girl with a blade the other girl escorted her out the sliding doors and through the garden sima zian walked them down to the river standing on the porch tai watched the three of them go towards the trees and the water beyond he lost them in the dark then saw the one man come back a short time later and head across towards the music again head lifted steps quickening hearing it tai waited in silence for a time listening to the night he caught the scent of flowers citrus there were peonies a slight breeze from the north towards the river the stars that ended the night this time of year were rising daiji he called greatly recklessly daring he couldnt say why but it felt as if there might be an answer to something to part of this story out in the garden nothing stirred in the dark but fireflies flashing go the nighttravellers the old song about them he thought of the tale of the poor scholar who could not afford oil for lanterns gathering fireflies in a bag each evening studying by their light they used to joke about that story in xinan the students chou yan xin lun shen tai the others there were other nighttravellers tonight he wondered where his sister was where in a toowide world a hard pull upon the heart his father was dead this would not have happened otherwise deaths even quiet ones had consequences three men had died in chenyao tonight under questioning for attempting to have him killed no movement in the garden no approach to his call his foolishness he didnt believe there had been a foxcreature following him though it was interesting that wei song seemed to fear them he hadnt noticed her biting her lower lip that way before he had thoughts about how those two guards had ended up unconscious wind in leaves distant music the bright low star hed seen before was still there it felt as if a great deal of time had passed since hed come into this room but it wasnt so tai didnt call again he turned and went back inside he washed and dried himself using the filled water basin and towel he undressed put out the three lights burning in the room drew the sliding doors and hooked them shut some air came in through the slats which was good he closed the main door which was still ajar he went to bed a little later drifting towards sleep as to the shore of another country he suddenly sat up in the nearly black room and swore aloud he half expected to hear song from the portico asking what was wrong but she wouldnt be back from the governors mansion yet they couldnt leave at sunrise hed just realized it it was not possible not in the empire of the ninth dynasty he had to visit the prefect tomorrow morning had to they were to take a morning meal together it had been arranged if he didnt attend if he simply rode off it would bring lasting shame upon himself and upon his fathers memory neither the poet nor the kanlin would say a word to refute this they wouldnt even think to try it was a truth of their world for good or ill as much a part of itthis ritualized unyielding defining formalityas poetry was or silk or sculpted jade palace intrigues students and courtesans heavenly horses pipa music or unburied tens of thousands upon a battlefield chapter xii they are walking east in the night around the shore of the small lake then ascending the slopes of the hills that frame it on the far side no one has followed them the wind is from the north limei looks back the campfires glow they seem fragile precarious in the vastness stretching in all directions the firelit presence of mensome women are down there but not her not her any moresurrounded by all of night and the world it is cold in the wind swiftly moving clouds then stars deerskin riding boots are better than jewelled slippers but are not adequate to this steady walking the wolves keep pace on either side she is still trying not to look at them the man has not said a word since they walked out of the camp she hasnt seen him clearly yet she needs more light his strides are long groundcovering though somehow awkward stiff she wonders if it is because hes accustomed to riding most of the bogu are he walks in front not bothering to see if she is keeping pace or has tried to run away he doesnt need to do that he has the wolves she has no idea where they are going or why he is doing this why he has come for her and not the real princess it is possible that this is a mistake on his part one that their guards permitted encouraged to protect the bride of the kaghan loyalty limei thinks requires that she continue the deception let the princess get as far away as possible she doesnt think he intends to kill her he could have done so by now if that was why he was here nor does this feel like someone seeing a chance of wealth kidnapping kitan royalty that had been her thought waiting in the yurt holding a knife in the blackness kidnapping isnt uncommon back home in the wild country along the great river gorges certainly but she doesnt think this is a man looking for money he may he may want her body difficult to shield that thought the allure of a kitan woman the exciting mystery of strangeness this might be that sort of abduction but again she doesnt think it is he has hardly even looked at her no this is different because of the wolves and the silence of the wolfhounds when he came for her there is something else happening here limei has prided herself all her life had been praised by her father for it if ruefully on being more curious and thoughtful than most women more than most men hed added once she has remembered that moment where they were how he looked at her saying it she is skilled at grasping new situations and changing ones the nuances of men and women in veiled elusive exchanges shed even developed a sense of the court of manoeuvrings for power in her time with the empress before they were exiled and it stopped mattering her father hadnt been this way she has the trait very likely from whatever source her oldest brother does though she doesnt want to think about liu acknowledge any kinship any sharing with him she wants him dead what she also wants what she needs is a rest just now and to be warmer the wind since they have climbed higherskirting the steepest of the hills but still ascendingis numbing her she is not dressed for a night walk on the steppe and she has carried nothing with her at all except a small knife in her sleeve she makes a decision inwardly she shrugs there are many ways to die as many the teachings tell as there are ways to live shed never thought about being torn apart by wolves or ripped open in some bogu sacrifice on the plain but stop she says not loudly but very clearly it does sound too much like a command in the huge silence of the night it is mostly fear infusing her voice he ignores her keeps moving so after a few steps to consider that limei stops walking being ignored is not something shes ever been inclined to accept from girlhood they are on a ridge the lake lies to their left and below the moon shows it to her there is beauty here for a landscape painter not for her not now the nearest wolf also stops he pads towards her he looks directly at limei the eyes glowing the way they do in tales one of the things that is true she thinks his jaws open teeth showing he takes two more silent steps nearer too near this is a wolf she is alone she does not weep the wind is making her eyes tear but that is an entirely different thing she will not cry unless driven to a deeper abyss than this she resumes walking moving past the animal she does close her eyes in that moment the wolf could shred her flesh with a twist of his head the man has slowed she sees to let her and the animal catch up again he still has not looked back he seems to know what has happened however she doesnt know anything and it can be called intolerable limei takes a deep breath she stops again so beside her does the wolf she will not look at it she calls out if you intend to kill me do it now no reply but he stops this time he does do that does this mean he understands her she says i am very cold and i have no idea where you intend to walk like this how far i will not willingly go farther unless you tell me what this is am i being abducted for money he turns around she has achieved that much she thinks for a long moment they stand like that in the night ten paces apart she still cannot make out his features the moon is not enough does it matter she thinks he is a big man for a bogu long arms he is barechested even in this wind his loose hair whipped around his face by it he will not be sympathetic limei thinks to a claim of being cold he is gazing at her she cannot see his eyes shandai he says she is shocked the fact of speech you follow shelter horse he says this in kitan awkwardly but in her tongue he has already turned away again as if this terse handful of words is all he feels capable of saying or inclined to say a man unused to speech explaining himself well he would be she thinks glancing at the wolves shandai she repeats that is where we are going she had not looked at any maps before they set out regrets it now he stops again turns slowly she can see the stiffness in his posture he shakes his head impatiently shandai he says again more forcefully why this why you come bogu will follow shaman she knows what a shaman is shed thought he might be one he starts walking again and she does the same she is working on it puzzling it out she doesnt feel as cold now or even tired with a thought to pursue he doesnt want to be caught by a shaman that seems reasonably clear her guards had had none and feared him a shaman will not some time later directly ahead she sees the first grey begin to soften the sky then there is a pale band and pink morning she looks around mist rising a rolling away of grass in all directions between them and every horizon married to a distant horizon perhaps not perhaps a different tale just before the sun rose in front of them making bright the tall grass and the world under heaven she understood the word hed spoken to her the imperial way running utterly straight for eighteen li through the exact centre of xinan from the main gate of the taming palace to the southern walls was four hundred and ninety paces wide there was no thoroughfare so broad and magnificent in the empire or the world it had been designed to overawe and intimidate proclaim majesty and power on a scale worthy of the emperors ruling here in glory with the mandate of the gods and as a reasonably effective firebreak it was also difficult for anyone to cross after curfew without being seen by one of the gold bird guards stationed at every intersection you had to run a long way without any hint of concealment thirty of the guards were at all important crossroads there were fourteen major eastwest roads five guards at the smaller ones you faced thirty lashes with the medium rod if found on a major roadway after the drumbeats sounded to lock the ninetyone wards the night guards were authorized to kill if one ignored a command to halt order in the capital was a priority of the court with two million inhabitants and vivid memories of famine and violent unrest this was only sensible within the wardseach one enclosed by its own rammedearth wallsone could be abroad after dark of course else taverns and pleasure houses and the local dining places peddlers and snack wagons men selling firewood and lamp oil and cooking oil would have had no trade they did their best business after the two huge city markets closed you couldnt slam a city shut at night but you could control it and defend it the massive outer walls were four times the height of a man a hundred of the gold bird guards manned the towers above every major gate day and night with twenty at the lesser ones there were three very large gateways through the walls to east and south and west and half a dozen to the north four of them opening into the palace courtyards the administrative offices attached and the emperors vast deer park four canals flowed into the city diverted from the river to provide drinking and washing water irrigate the citygardens of the aristocracy and create lakes for the larger gardens one canal was assigned to floating in logs for the endless construction and repair and to carrying flat barges with coal and firewood at the point where each canal came through the walls there were another hundred guards being found in a canal was punished with sixty lashes if it happened after dark if found in the water by daylight without an acknowledged labour such as shifting the logs if they piled up the punishment was thirty it was also recognized that men drunk at sunrise after a long night could fall into the water without ill intent the emperor taizu lord of the five directions was a merciful ruler ever mindful of his subjects less than thirty lashes with the rod seldom killed or caused permanent incapacity of course few of these rules and restrictions applied to aristocrats to imperial couriers or to the blackclad civil service mandarins from the purple myrtle courtthe crowswith their keys and seals of office ward gates would be opened or closed for them on command if they were abroad on horseback or in carried litters during the dark hours the north district home to the best pleasure houses was accustomed to late arrivals from the taming and its administrative palaces hardworking civil servants from the censorate or the ministry of revenue finally free of their memoranda and calligraphy or elegantly attired noblemen exiting city mansions or the palace itself more than slightly drunk seeing no compelling reason not to prolong an evening with music and silken girls sometimes it might be a woman travelling one of the wide streets in a discreet sedan chair curtains drawn an anonymously clad officer of her household alongside to deal with the gold bird guards and shield her assignation in xinan after darkfall it was fair to say that someone on a main thoroughfare wasif not an officer of the guardeither at risk or part of the court prime minister wen zhou normally took pleasure in riding his favourite grey horse down the very centre of the imperial way at night it made him feel as if he owned xinan to be so conspicuously at ease a powerful handsome richly dressed aristocrat proceeding south from the palace to his city mansion under moon or stars he had guards with him of course but if they kept behind and to either side he could imagine himself alone in the imperial city the distant outer edges of the road had been planted with juniper and pagoda trees by the present emperors father to hide the drainage ditches there were beds of peoniesking of flowersrunning between the lamplit guard stations offering their scent to the night in springtime there was beauty and a vast grandeur to the imperial way under the stars but this particular night first minister wen found no pleasure in his night ride hed been afflicted with such anxiety he would not call it fear this eveningafter his cousins dance in that upper chamber of the tamingthat hed felt an urgent need to remove himself from the palace lest one of the appallingly astute figures of court or civil service note apprehension in his features that would not be acceptable not in a first minister and president of seven ministries in his first year of office he could have asked shen liu to come home with him and liu would have done that but tonight he didnt want even his principal adviser beside him he didnt want to look at that smooth unforthcoming face not when he felt his own features to be revealing depths of indecision he trusted liu the man owed everything to wen zhou his own fate by now completely tied to the first ministers but that wasnt always the point sometimes you didnt want your counsellors to see too clearly into you and liu had a habit of appearing able to do that while revealing next to nothing of himself the first minister had other advisers of course a vast bureaucratic army at his disposal he had done his own investigations had learned a good deal about liuand his familysome of it complex some of it unexpected lius subtlety made him enormously useful because he could read others in the palace with acuity but it also meant there were times when you were just as happy to arrange for morning attendance from the man and spend the night with others zhou had to decide if he wanted spring rain alone tonight or to pair her with one of his other women he was angry and uneasy that might affect what he needed he reminded himself again not to useeven in his mindher name from the north district he was the one who had changed it after all he looked around not far now from his ward gates his home in xinan provided by the emperor was in the fiftyseventh ward east of the imperial way halfway down there lay many of the most luxurious properties in the city including as of this same nights proclamation by the emperor the newest mansion of the military governor of the seventh eighth and ninth districts an li widely known as roshan whom wen zhou hated and feared and wished deadin all his bloated grossnessand consumed by eyeless crawling creatures without names his hands tightened on the reins and the highstrung horse reacted pacing sideways restively zhou handled it easily he was a superb rider a polo player enjoyed speed and the most challenging horses enjoyed them more than say calligraphy displays or landscape painting or poetry improvised in a palace room dancing hed concede was pleasant enough if the dancer was even nearly as skilledor as stunningly desirableas his cousin his cousin who had changed the empire jian to whom he owed everything he was now and everything he had but who refused capriciously to be unequivocal in supporting him against a monstrous generals obvious ambition shed even adopted roshan as her child some months ago what gamewhat possible womans gamewas she playing at the obese barbarian had to be thirty years older than her his odious sons were older than her the adoption had been a frivolity zhou had to assume meant to divert the courtand the emperor the first minister was among those who had not found it diverting from the moment chin hai had died and zhou had manoeuvred swiftly from his position as president of the ministries of revenue and punishment to succeed him he had been aware that an li was his greatest dangeramong many roshan with chin hai gone was like a beast of the jungle uncaged and why why did the emperor and his exquisite concubine not see that beneath the clownish act roshan offered them zhou forced himself to be calmer if only for the horse he looked up at stars the waning moon racing clouds he was saluted by the next set of guards as he approached their station he nodded vaguely to them a straightbacked broadshouldered impressive man it occurred to him undermining any movement towards tranquility that if he wasand he wascontemplating having his enemy ruined or killed it was possible that roshan was shaping similar thoughts about him these night rides from the palace might become less prudent going forward it was a consideration to be weighed in fact he gestured his guards in closer motioned one to ride ahead they were nearly at their gate someone would need to signal for admittance even in the presence of the emperor roshan seemed to know no fear inhibition no idea of restrainthis very bulk suggested as much he had been mortally afraid of chin hai however would break out in a sweat if prime minister chin spoke to him if they were even in the same room zhou had seen it more than once no great surprise that terror everyone had feared chin hai whatever any man might accuse zhou of doing since accepting officein the way of choosing persons for exile or elimination with formal design randomly or for a personal reasonno one could honestly suggest that he was introducing this as a feature of government not after what chin hai had done for most of the emperors reign it was shen liu his soclever adviser who had pointed this out not long after zhou had been appointed to succeed the one called privately the spider some men simply had to be dealt with liu had said if one were to properly discharge the duties of office and establish the proper tone as first minister if one were new and relatively youngand wen zhou was bothweakness might be anticipated and probed by some within the court the wider empire or abroad any such misconception on their part needed to be swiftly addressed a measure of effectively employed terror liu had suggested was almost always useful one might argue hed added that it was imperative in challenging times kitai might be wealthy beyond description but that could make it more vulnerable to destructive ambition more in need of loyal men to have narrow eyes and suspicious hearts to be cold and vigilant while others played at polo games wrote poems danced to foreign music ate golden peaches brought from far corners of the world built lakes in private gardens or used extravagantly expensive sandalwood for the panels of pavilions polo was wen zhous favoured sport sandalwood he happened to believe was entirely proper for a display of wealth he had it in the walls of his bedchamber and the manmade lake behind his mansion had jade and ivory rocks on the island built within it when he had guests for a party courtesans hired from the best houses would play music from that isle dressed like creatures from legend once theyd worn kingfisher feathers rarer more expensive than jade but the new first minister had taken lius central point a firm hand was needed for the taming palace and the civil service and the army perhaps especially the army chin hai fearing the aristocrats in his own early days had gradually placed barbarian generals in many of the military governorships it had made him safer what could an illiterate foreigner who owed him everything aspire to be or do but there were consequences all the more so since the celestial emperor may he live a thousand years was older now distracted less firmly attentive to imperial matters month by month day over day night after night it was widely known that roshan had sent the emperor an alchemists potion shortly after taizu had summoned his very young precious consort to the palace and installed her there shortly before the illustrious empress was gently persuaded to take up her new residence at a temple of the path outside xinan wen zhou wishedhe so dearly wishedhed thought of sending that potion himself firmness you could make a joke about firmness he didnt feel amused or amusing not tonight the city palace just given as a gift this evening another gift to the pustulent barbarian toad was chin hais own mansion conspicuously uninhabited in the nine months since hed died what did it mean that it had now gone in its unrivalled splendour and notoriety tales of interrogation chambers underground walls made proof against screaming to the military governor of three districts and their hard trained armies in the northeast a man who was scarcely ever in xinan to even make use of the mansion did the emperor did zhous emptyheaded cousin did no one realize what sort of message this sent or rather more frightening did they realize it the ward guards recognized them of course there was a shout and a signal from atop the wall men began hastily unbarring the gates as the first minister and his men approached angling across the imperial way not the best ward security perhaps but mildly gratifying the alacrityand fearwith which they responded to his presence he should be used to it by now perhaps but why did becoming accustomed to something have to render its pleasures stale could one of the philosophers answer him that he still enjoyed saffron wine and being serviced by women did he not passing through he asked casually addressing the night not deigning to look anywhere near an actual person who else had come through after curfew he always asked them that someone answered two names neither one for different reasons brought zhou any of the pleasure hed just been thinking about he rode on heard orders behind him the gates creaking closed the heavy bar sliding even here within the ward the main eastwest street running between the gates at each end was sixtyfive paces wide long expanses of wall on either side lanterns at intervals shade trees planted by mansion owners the walls were interrupted on the north side of the street by the massive doors of homes that were better described as palaces to his right there were only occasional servantdoorways backgarden exits from someones property all front doors faced south of course he saw the second of the men who had come through earlier waiting in a sedan chair with the curtains back so he could be seen and known under the lanterns hanging by the doors of zhous own home he hadnt intended or desired to see this man tonight and his principal adviser would have known that which meant that if liu was here something had happened something even more than the disturbing news theyd heard this evening of the gift given to roshan roshan himself was the other man whod passed through after nightfall come undoubtedly to boastfully luxuriate in his newest extravagant possession a city palace larger and more potently symbolladen than any other in xinan perhaps zhou thought he could ride over there himself suggest a drink by way of celebration poison the wine roshan drank very little he had the sugar sickness zhou wished it would kill him already he suddenly wondered who the governors personal physician was it was a thought chin hais former mansion was only a short distance on horseback two streets over and one north from here the property was gigantic even by the standards of an aristocratic neighbourhood it stretched all the way to the northern wall of the wardthe southern border of the fiftythird there were rumours that a tunnel went beneath the wall into the fiftythird the mansions servants had been kept on he knew paid by the court even with no one living there the pavilions and rooms and furnishings the courtyards gardens banquet halls womens quarters all would have been impeccably maintained awaiting whoever might be honouredexaltedat the whim of the emperor with the dead prime ministers home well now they knew zhou swung down from his horse tossed the reins to one of the servants who hurried up bowing the doors were open wide enough for a carriage and horses the first courtyard was brightly lit welcoming his own was an entirely magnificent home it just wasnt seeing the first minister dismount liu stepped out of his sedan chair there was mud in the roadway from rain the night before his adviser placed his feet carefully a fastidious man zhou found it amusing the prime minister booted accustomed to polo and hunting utterly unfazed by dirt and mud strode over to him he came through the gates just before you he said there was no need to say the name shen liu nodded i know i asked i thought of riding over to welcome him to his new home bring poisoned wine lius face took on a pained expression as if his stomach were ailing him one of the few ways he revealed himself his adviser carefully restrained himself from glancing around to see who among the guards or servants might have heard zhou didnt care let the gross barbarian know what the first minister of kitai thought of him and his tooobvious designs as if roshan didnt know already what are you doing here he asked i said you were to come in the morning i received tidings liu murmured or i was advised of tidings that have come to the palace and i needed to know this tonight liu shrugged obviously was the import of the gesture he was an irritating man and disturbingly close to indispensable wen zhou turned and strode through his open doors into the courtyard splashing through a puddle he crossed and entered the first reception hall and then the private room beside it servants sprang to action an interval passed in which boots became slippers court garb turned into a silk robe for a night at home and cypressleaf wine was warmed on a brazier liu waited in the adjacent chamber there was music from a pavilion across another small courtyard a more intimate reception room with a bedchamber attached spring rain was playing her pipa for him having awaited his arrival as she always did she would be adorned with jewellery he knew her hair exquisitely pinned her face painted waiting for him his her name was lin chang now a change made on his own order once hed brought her here it was far more suited to her status as a concubine of the first minister of kitai he hadnt been able to stop thinking of her by the north district name yet not that it mattered she belonged to him and would wait it was her role although looked at another way he was going to have to wait until whatever liu had on his mind tonight was shared the prime minister decided that he was likely to remain in a troubled mood he walked back into the reception chamber was handed the wine he sipped threw the cup down it bounced and rolled against a wall the servant cringing and bowing almost to the floor mumbling desperate apologies scurried to the brazier and added coal to the flame below he crawled over and picked up the discarded cup his hands were shaking there were stains on the carpeting the first minister had made extremely clear by now his preference as to the temperature of his wine at night which was not the same as in the morning or at midday servants were required to know these things or accept consequences consequences in at least one case had left a man crippled and dismissed he begged in the street now behind the mansion someone had told zhou that the pipa music continued from across the small courtyard the sliding doors were open window shutters were folded back on a mild night the silkpaper windows did little to keep out sound he thought about silencing the instrument but the music was beautifuland promised a mood very different from this one once hed dealt with liu he gestured shen liu took one side of the platform zhou sat opposite crosslegged a breeze music late night the two men waited the servant bowing three full times eyes never leaving the floor brought the wine again and extended it with both hands wen zhou tasted he didnt nod he didnt need to keeping the cup was sufficient the servant poured for liu backed up bowing all the way to the edge of the room he was expecting to be beaten later the wine had been too cool zhou looked at his adviser and nodded permission to speak what do you think happens liu asked his round face placid as usual when we make jests about killing him he hadnt expected that as a start we dont wen zhou said coldly i do unless you have become a humorist when i am not present liu shook his head i thought not what happens the prime minister went on his mood congealing further is that i amuse myself of course my lord said liu he said nothing more hed made his accursed point sometimes you werent allowed to amuse yourself zhou was inclined to disagree if he wanted a woman or a horse they were his until he grew tired of them if he wanted a man dead he could have him killed why else be what he was this came with his power defined it why are you here he growled he gestured the servant scurried forward with more wine liu declined a second drink the first minister had long intended to see his adviser drunk it hadnt happened yet from across the courtyard the pipa music had stopped shed have been told that her lord was engaged with his principal adviser rainlin changwas impeccably trained and intelligent shed not wish to distract them he knew his adviser waited until the servant had withdrawn to the far wall again he said word came tonight a military courier from the west from iron gate fortress well that is west said the prime minister amusing himself slightly liu did not smile he said you know that my my brother has been at kuala nor you asked about my family last year and i told you he did remember asking it was before hed taken office he remembered this piece of information very well and the man he hadnt liked master shen tai hadnt known him at all but that didnt matter the first minister nodded more carefully his mood had changed he didnt want it noticed burying bones he said indifferently a flick of one hand a foolish thing with all respect to your father what of it hes left the lake he is coming back to xinan they made him a member of the second military district army to shorten his mourning time permit him to return the two men in this room had done the same thing not long after shen gao had died to allow liu to come back to the palaceto assist the ambitious cousin of the woman the emperor favoured above all others the first minister considered this a moment still carefully he said i wonder why we know this from iron gate liu nodded he passed through for one night he sent a message ahead to the taming along with the fortress commanders formal report one night meant he wasnt lingering as he travelled wen zhou affected a yawn and why would the movements of your brotherdiverting as the topic might be for you personallybe of interest to me or of importance to the empire he thought hed said that well enough liu looked discomfited an extreme rarity he shifted position a rider could look like that after too long in the saddle it was interesting the prime minister kept his gaze on him well he added liu drew a breath he my brother reports first that an assassin was slain at kuala nor having been sent there to kill him i see said zhou keeping his voice level that is first of little importance to us as far as i can see what else his adviser cleared his throat it seems it seems that the white jade princess in rygyal chengwan our our own princess i know who she is liu another throat clearing liu was unsettled that in itself was disturbing shes given him a gift liu said to honour what he was doing by the lake with the dead how pleasant for your brother wen zhou murmured but i fail to see two hundred and fifty sardian horses like that a hammer zhou felt his mouth go dry he swallowed with difficulty he is your brother is riding from the border with two hundred and fifty heavenly horses it was impossible he thought in a way it was no said liu he has arranged to have them held by the tagurans he must go back and claim them himself only he can do it after it is decided what is to be done with them he writes that he is coming to xinan to inform the celestial emperor and others and others now he understood why this was information he needed to know he also understood something else abruptly he struggled to keep this from showing in his face lius unpleasant younger brother had told the soldiers at iron gate fort and written a letter about an assassin sent after him he was a figure of significance now with those horses there would almost certainly be an inquiry where there might never have been one before which meant it meant that someone in xinan had to be dealt with tonight in fact before word of shen tais journey and his giftlikely racing through the palace and the purple myrtle court even nowspread too widely and reached the man in question it was unfortunate the person he was now thinking about had his uses but he also knew too much given these sudden tidings for the first ministers comfort it was still possible for certain reasons that the extremely irritating shen tai might not reach xinan but everything was changed with this information what does that mean he has to claim the horses himself did you read the letters i did the prime minister didnt ask how liu had achieved that if he does not go back for them himself the gift is revoked it is a gift from the princess to him there was there is a third letter from a taguran officer making this clear inwardly with great intensity the prime minister of kitai began shaping the foulest oaths he could imagine he felt a droplet of sweat slide down his side it was worse than hed imagined because now if shen tai died on the roadif hed already diedhis death cost the empire those horses two hundred and fifty was an absurd a stupefying number the man was coming back as a hero with immediate access to the court it was about as bad as it could get and someone needed to be killed quickly the silence continued no pipa music across the way liu was very still waiting for him clearly shaken himself you might have thought it a good thing for him for his family but not if you knew these brothersand something else that had been done zhou said it aloud with the thought your sister is beyond the long wall liu he cant do anything about her lius eyes wouldnt meet his gaze this was rare told him hed hit upon the concernor one of themin his advisers mind you are he added tartly the eldest son arent you head of the family this was within your rights and i approved it and proposed it at court it brings you honour all of you it had also put liu even more in his debt his adviser nodded though with something less than his customary crispness what else do i need to know the prime minister asked relations within the shen family were not his most compelling problem he needed to dismiss his adviser he had someone else to summon tonight who will know of this liu lifted his eyes who will know everyone he said tonight or by midmorning it was a military dispatch two copies one to the grand secretariat one to the ministry of war and nothing in the taming stays secret he knew that last nothing in the taming stays secret a man was coming a troubling man with control of an impossible number of sardian horses and a profoundly exalted stature for soveryvirtuous actions in the past two years he would be received by the son of heaven there was no way to prevent it and depending on what shen tai wanted he could become an immediate unpredictable factor in a game already too complex for words although possibly hed be killed or had already been killed on the road from iron gate but that had different implications now given the horses the court would investigate undoubtedly and first minister wen knew altogether too much about those chances of death on the road it had been such a small private matter when set in motion an impulse as much as anything a casual flexing of power but now if it emerged that the empire had lost two hundred and fifty sardian horses because of someones recklessness pursuing entirely personal interests it could happen if someone talked there was a man who absolutely needed to die before he arrived at the same conclusion regarding his own risksand tried to protect himself by speaking to someone in the palace for example tonight possibly even right now orthe prime minister felt himself growing pale at the thoughtperhaps by attending upon a certain military governor with what he had to say asking for guidance and protection a scenario too terrifying to even contemplate he sent his adviser home too abruptly perhaps given a shrewd man but there wasnt time to be subtle here and he was not about to share this story with liu hed have to rely on the fact that liu was distracted and uneasy because of what hed done with the sister of course and the brothers return this was all because of the same man zhou thought bitterly the one coming back along the imperial road from beyond the border he might have the powerand the desireto ruin them both when he was alone except for the stillcowering servant who did not matter zhou began to swear aloud the person he cursedwithout speaking the name he was hardly so great a foolwas the seventeenth daughter of the celestial emperor the serene and beautiful the white jade princess chengwan who from faroff rygyal on its mountainringed plateau had capriciously irresponsibly altered so much the way a woman could he heard the pipa music begin again shed have been told of lius departure would assume zhou was free now the toils of the day falling away he wasnt they werent he could not go to her he couldnt slake or assuage or channel fear or anger yet he needed to deal with something immediately and that meant trusting another man and hoping it was not already too late he knew the man he needed gave orders for him to be brought as to trust he could always have this one killed as well after these matters rippled outwards the prime minister thought like the waters of a still pond after a single stone fell there think of that image he was an accursed poet after all he lifted his cup the servant hastened to bring him wine he tried not to picture someone riding or being carried from the purple myrtle court in a litter even now across the night city arriving before the doors of the new mansion of roshan being admitted telling him the guard hed summoned was announced zhou bade him enter a big man a scar on his right cheek his name was feng he bowed in the doorway wen zhou dismissed his servant then said what had to be said he did so with precision his voice calm feng accepted the orders with another bow no flicker of response in his face which was all as it should be you simply could not guide and govern an empire this vast with so many challenges from within and without while being the sort of gentlesouled person who might be deemed worthy of admission to holy orders and any fairminded man evaluating the times would agree that this was even more the case if ones emperor was no longer young no longer the driven brilliant leader he had been when he seized the throne himself killing brothers it needed to be remembered and began shaping a reign of glory if the late prime minister chin hai at the emperors side for decades had taught the court anything it was that sometimes the darker disturbing deeds of government needed to be shouldered by the first minister why else were there said to have been those soundless rooms underground or the secret tunnels in and out of the city palace that now belonged as of tonight to the most dangerous man in kitai and if a beleaguered overburdened first minister directly responsible for no fewer than nine ministries forswearing his own bestloved pleasures and diversions in the tireless service of his emperor should have invoked the power of his office in the trivial matter of a chosen woman and an irritating man shed known too well well were there to be no benefits attached to dealing with so many tasks to the sleepless hours for example that lay ahead of him tonight while he waited for the return of the man hed just sent out in their nine heavens wen zhou decided the gods would understand she has never accepted the name he chose for her when he bought her from the pavilion of moonlight pleasure house and had her brought here lin chang means nothing to her it has no weight at all neither had spring rain at first but she has at least grown accustomed to her courtesan name and was even offered choices when they proposed it asked if it felt right zhou hadnt done that he hadnt needed to of course but neither had the women at the pavilion of moonlight when shed arrived there he hadnt even told her the source of her new name what it meant to him if anything it certainly wasnt sardian no acknowledgement of her origins hed wanted something more dignified than a north district pleasure girls name and there it was and it isnt worth hating it really isnt that is the change in her you did need to decide what mattered and concentrate on that otherwise your life force would be scattered to the five directions and wasted a woman needs to accept some truths in the world wen zhou is immensely powerful he is not cruel to his servants or his women certainly not by the standards of xinan or those of sardia as it happens he is young not unpleasant to be with in most humours and his needs with women though he likes to think they are decadent men are often that way are hardly so for a girl from the pleasure district no if she hates him nowand she doesit is for a different reason the intensity she brings to bear upon this anger is extreme he had not needed to order a rival killed tai wasnt even a rival in any way that signified he had gone away for his mourning years leaving her where she was and what manwhat student having not yet even taken the examinationscould set himself against the first minister of the empire the precious consorts kinsman you could if you wished draw upon your knowledge of how fragile men were even the most powerful how much they could be shaped or guided by women and the needs they aroused was not the august emperor himself the clearest illustration you could understand how even a man of the stature of wen zhou might dislike remembering nights in the pavilion of moonlight when hed arrived unexpectedly and discovered her already with another and perhaps too obviously enjoying that but you could also draw a line in your own mind straight as string as to what youd accept in the way of actions following upon thatand killing was on the far side of such a line it had not been difficult to shape a space for herself when shed arrived here in the compound she had been able to render two of the servants infatuated with her had she been unable to do that shed hardly be worth desiring would she shed begun working on the task of gathering information as soon as shed come without any purpose in mind it was just what you did shed made it clear let them appear to deduce it which worked with most men high or low that her reasons for wanting to learn the current mood conversations comings and goings of their lord had to do with her sustaining desire to please him to know his needs at any hour she behavedbehaves stillimpeccably in the compound or when she leaves it in a litter guarded to shop at one of the markets or accompanies zhou to banquets or polo games no one here has cause to hate her unless it is the other concubines and she has been careful with them she still calls herself spring rain among the others to avoid seeming to put on airs her real name from home is hers to keep and hasnt been spoken by anyone in a long time she put it aside when she crossed the border at jade gate years ago it is possible that there is no one in all of kitai who knows it an unsettling thought zhous wife is of little consequence a woman of extreme breedingselected for thatand even more extreme piety which means she and her husband lead widely divergent lives one of the concubines has offered the view that she might have been less virtuous if more attractive an ungenerous thought though not necessarily an untrue one the first ministers wife is often away at one sanctuary or another her generosity to holy men and women is well known her husband encourages it she also frequents astrologers but is careful about it the school of unrestricted night has an ambiguous place in the court of the emperor taizu tonight rain knew that adviser shen had come to their doors before zhou was even home and that hed been nervous about something normally shen liu would be admitted to wait inside but he had declined that invitation staying in the street under the lanterns watching for zhou the nervousnessreported by hwan her primary source of informationwas unusual shen liu does not know of her connection to his brother rain is almost sure of that she is less confident of some other things about him she will need a certain kanlin warrior to return and report before she knowsif any sure conclusion is possible shen liu is a cautious man it is unlikely to be obvious if hes been part of a plan to kill his brother rain has been waiting in number two pavilion elegantly attired she wears no perfume as usual that makes it easier for her to cross dark courtyards linger on porticos perfume is an announcement after all only when she knows zhou is coming to her will she use her scent it has become a gesture shes known for here a signature like a calligraphers brush stroke another way his newest concubine honours her master these devices are not difficult for a woman who can think and with men who dont realize she can shed heard the two men come in to the chamber across the small courtyard had begun playing her pipa then to let zhou know she was here she stops when she hearstoo faintly to make out wordsthat they have begun to talk they will she knows think it a courtesy of hers she crosses the wet courtyard barefoot to save her slippers carrying her pipa that is her excuse if anyone sees her she is on the portico out of sight to offer music to her lord and his adviser if a request for it arises music is her domain here the sliding doors are open on a spring night and silkpaper windows block little sound she hears quite clearly what they are saying her heart begins pounding excitement and there is fear but she has made her peace with that and her own decisions some time ago betrayal it can fairly be called it will be called that if what shes done emerges from night into bright day but hed sent a trained assassin a false kanlin and arranged for two more in an excess of casual murderous inclination and rain would have called it a betrayal of herself to do nothing about that tai wasnt at his fathers home it seemed even in their mourning period wen zhou evidently knew where he was rain did not it was maddening she was too isolated herethe city the empire the world beyond these stone walls were all wrapped in a cloud of notknowing she had done what she could hwan usefully in love with her by then had arranged for a kanlin a real one this time to come to her from their sanctuary at mawai the womanshed asked for a womanhad come over the wall at the back of the compound for a night meeting in the garden rain had told hwan it had to do with a threat she needed to quietly guard againstand that much had been true she had paid the kanlin and sent her to tais family which was the only place to begin surely there they would know where he was and why he was away tonight listening from the portico rain finally knows where tai had gone it is a wonder walking back to the number two pavilion having a maidservant wash her feet beginning to play her instrument again for the man now waiting for someone else to return tonight rain tries to decide if she wants the guardhis name is fengto succeed in killing xin lun she remembers lun quick irreverent company in the pavilion of moonlight a good singing voice a loud high laugh generous with money none of that matters what concerns her is if it will be better if tai is able to find the man alive when he returns if he survives himself she tries to make her heart be calm there is no place here for desire or dreams though dreams are difficult to control whatever else might be true she cannot be his now he should not have gone away without her she had told him what might follow men didnt listen enough a truth of the world but what he had done at kuala nor what he had done and now two hundred and fifty horses from her own land it is beyond words it reaches past music and it can change so muchthough not for her it is extremely late when zhou comes to her she has been certain he will though not what his mood will be hwan and her maidservants had been asleep when feng returned to the compound zhou seems almost cheerful when he crosses the courtyard to her she believes she has an idea what that means he takes her with some urgency from behind first against the wall and then more slowly face to face on the wide bed while she touches him in the ways he likes he does not awaken any of the other women to play with them or to watch after he is done she washes his body while he sips wine her maidservant has readied she is careful about his wine she is thinking hard hiding it as ever xin lun is dead zhou will have protected himself ended that risk of exposure she will need to consider this she thinks her hands moving over the body of the man lightly then strongly then lightly again she will be wrong in some of her guesses and conclusions there are limits to what a woman in her position can know however intelligent and committed she might be there are too many constraints on someone confined to the womens quarters of a compound or a curtained sedan chair relying for information on infatuated servants there have always been such limits it is the way of things and not all men are foolish though it might seem otherwise at times tonight she wonderscaressing him smiling a little as she does so as if in private pleasure he likes thisif he will order the guard slain now hell probably send feng away first she decides south to where his family and power base are raised in rank to disguise the purpose make it appear a reward then accidentally dead in a faraway prefecture alternatively he might decide he needs a man like feng in xinan with events unfolding as they seem to be either is possible rain thinks singing for him now a song of the moon reflected in the great river autumn leaves falling in the water floating past the silver moored fishing boats drifting towards the sea an early verse of sima zian the banished immortal set to music a song that everyone knows only ever sung late at night bringing peace with it carrying memories chapter xiii it was possible tai knew to be asleep and dreaming and somehow be aware you were dreaming entangled unable to wake up after the night hed had intense in the white phoenix violent earlier and with unsettling tidings given him he found himself alone in a bedchamber in chenyao dreaming himself lying on his back bed linens scattered around him while he was mounted and ridden by a woman whose face he could not see in the dream he could hear her breathing become more rapid and could feel his own excitement he was aware of his hands on her driving hips as she rose and fell upon him but try as he might in the darkness of dream heavier than any in the waking world he couldnt see her didnt know who this was arousing in him such a fever of desire he thought of the foxspirit of course he thought of that even in dream perhaps especially because this was a dream he tried to say the word again daiji but words even the one word would not come to him just as clear sight was not given only movement touch the scent of her not perfume her quickened breathingsmall gasps nowand his own he wanted to reach up and touch her face like a blind man find her hair but his dreamhands would not leave her hips the smooth skin there the muscles driving he felt wrapped and gathered cocooned like a silkworm in this enclosed indeterminate space of notwakingyet he feared it was aroused and wildly excited by it wanted never to leave wanted her never to leave him some time later he heard a different sound and woke he was alone in the room in the bed of course he was a hint of light through the slatted doors to the garden the bed linens were in disarray he might have tossed them off in restless sleep he was confused tired not sure why he was awake then he heard again the sound that had reached him metal on metal from the portico past the door something heavy fell hitting the wall outside tai leaped from bed scrambled into his trousers didnt bother knotting them or with a shirt or boots or tying his hair he did take his swords he jerked open the door noting that he hadnt barred it the night before though he remembered intending to there was a man on the threshold he was dead sword wound right side tai heard fighting to his left the garden he stepped over the dead body ran towards the sound of swords barefoot down the portico his hair swinging free sleep gone the dream gone in this first light of morning he reached the end leaped over the railing without breaking stride wei song was in the courtyard spinning kanlinstylefighting five men it had been six at least with the one behind tai she was battling in a deadly whirling silence tai swore savagely under his breath she could have shouted for help he had an idea why she hadnt he didnt like it sprinting towards them he screamed a release of pentup rage as much as anything else directed at anyone and everyone and everything just then at all of these people acting upon him and for him and even through himfrom the moment bytsan sri nespo had given him a rolledup parchment at kuala nor with a gift of too many horses it had gone far enough this passiveness this acceptance absorbing the designs of othersbenign or otherwise it was not what he was or would allow himself to be under the nine heavens perhaps he could declare that with two swords in his hands one of the men facing song half turned towards tais sudden cry that turning closed the scroll of his life songs lefthand sword took him on the side hed exposed the blade was withdrawn as cleanly as it had entered drawing life away with it she dropped and rolled through a flower bed peonies crushed under her they sprang back up as she did a sword stroke from the nearest man meant to decapitate whistled through air tai was among them by then the essence of kanlin training as he saw it others might differ was the continuous patient formal repetition of the movements of combat without swords with one blade with both over again every day of ones life ideally the movements becoming so instinctive that the need for thought awareness planning in a fight disappeared the body knew what it needed to do and how to do it so it was without anything resembling deliberation without a thought given to how long it had been since hed done this that tai planted his righthand sword in the earth left it quivering there and hurled himself into a twisting dive a movement whichwhen properly executedlet the lefthand sword slide under ones own flying body and sweep like a scythe parallel to the ground at someone facing him or turning to do that his blade caught the nearest man biting deep just above the knee sending blood spurting like some primitive sacrifice to the rising sun tai landed a dangerous moment with a blade in one hand and from his knees killed the wounded falling man with a straight thrust to the chest three left all three turned to him get away wei song screamed not likely thought tai angerridden you each chose a man on either side when there were three lined up straight against twoif they made that mistake he switched his single blade to his right hand took the man farthest from song that was routine he parried a slash from the bandit and rolled again through the air to his left a different move one he hadnt realized he remembered you needed to be careful not to cut yourself with your own sword doing this one toothat awareness came back in midairbut as he completed the movement before he landed he slashed at the bandit and felt the sword bite the man screamed went down tai landed in flowers was up almost smoothly and dispatched this one too on the ground he looked quickly over dropping down in anticipation of an attack then stepping back no immediate danger the middle figure was also down song had adapted to what they had given her shed used both her swords slicing as the man turned towards tai you could call it elegant though there was a great deal of blood the last of the bandits turned not surprisingly to flee unfortunately for him his way was blocked by a rumpled irritatedlooking poet with grey hair untied and askew sima zian looked for all the world like one of the grotesque guardian statues placed by the doorway of a house or the entrance to a tomb to frighten away demons you took me from my first cup of wine he said grimly let fall your weapon doing so offers you a small chance of living otherwise there is none the bandit hesitated thenevidentlydecided that the small chance wasnt real he shouted what sounded like a name and hurtled full tilt towards the poet blade swinging tai caught his breath he neednt have bothered he knew the tales after all sima zian had been an outlaw himself for years in the wild country of the gorges and his swordthe single one he carriedwas famed he sidestepped the wild charge dropped leaning away and thrust out a leg the running man tripped and fell before the bandit could recover from where he sprawled by the portico master sima was upon him dagger to throat the sun appeared over a pavilion to the east a servant walked into the courtyard from that side carrying a water basin he stopped his mouth gaped summon the governors men song shouted they are in front she looked at tai and are about as useful as they were at the white phoenix she walked over and handed him his second sword she had already sheathed her own pair these came in through the water gate she nodded the poet had the bandits left arm twisted high behind his back it would crack tai saw with only a little pressure the dagger remained at the mans throat why are you here sima zian said quietly you know the governors questioners will be merciless answer me ill do what i can who are you the man rasped face to the earth to offer anything in chenyao youll have to believe i can they will be here soon you heard her send for them speak you will kill me if i do before they tai winced closed his eyes for a moment i swear it said the poet calmly why are you here it was my brother they tortured last night after the two men named him your brother hired men to kill shen tai he was told a man of that name might come from the west to watch for him good money if he came to chenyao and did not leave your brother was the one directed in this way yes a letter i never saw it he only told me who wrote the letter i do not know then why are you here if it was his task there came a sound from the man on the ground why they carried him back to his wife last night dropped his body in the street his servant summoned me he was naked in the mud he had been castrated his organ stuffed in his mouth his eyes had been carved out and they had cut off his hands this was my brother do you hear it i was here to kill the one who caused this tai felt himself swaying where he stood in the spreading light of day the ones who caused this are not here said sima zian gravely it was as if hed expected these words tai thought you must know that they work for governor xu who sought only to stop violence and murder in his city as he must do for the son of heaven we all serve in kitai it is it is not easy to amend a broken world that last was from a poem not his own they heard a jingling sound soldiers half a dozen of them entered the courtyard at a run one of them shouted an order sima zian murmured something tai didnt hear the poets knife moved the bandit face down among earth and flowers died instantly before the guards arrived to claim his living body for more of what had been done to his brother in the night how dare you kill him the lead guard rasped in fury tai saw the poet about to reply he stepped forward lifting a quick hand zian courteously was silent but he remained coiled now like a snake who might still strike how dare you let assassins into this inn yard tai snapped into a garden you were here to guard i want your names given to my kanlin right now i will wait for governor xu to advise me how he intends to make redress for this the soldier looked tai decided very like a fish extracted from his element suddenly lacking easy access to breathing xu bihai was it was already clear not a man given to half measures hed regard this second failure by his guards as a stain upon his honour these soldiers might well be executed tai thought he wasnt sure at this particular moment if that distressed him he took a breath im sorry your morning was disturbed he said to zian the poet flexed his shoulders and neck as if to loosen them hardly your fault and it isnt as if i was asleep no well perhaps id dozed a little but i was having my first cup will you join me now tai shook his head you must excuse me i have to change for breakfast with the prefect i forgot about it last night ah said the poet wed have been late for a dawn departure even without this diversion we would have been tai turned to song she looked pale she had cause you are all right they barely touched me it wasnt true he saw there was a line of blood on her left side showing through her slashed tunic her expression changed that was a foolish leap for someone who has not fought in two years it was folly to even come out what were you thinking tai stared at her small and resolute wounded glaring up in fury it was a maddening question what was i thinking who fights six men without calling for help she looked away then shrugged you know the kanlin answer to that my lord your servant offers apologies if you believe i erred she bowed he started another sharp retort then stopped he looked more closely your hand is also hurt she glanced at it indifferently i rolled over some rocks i will get these soldiers names and have them taken to the governor is there a message she paused meaningfully for anyone else tai ignored that what happened to the two men in the garden last night they revived i spoke with them they took the river path home you were awake she nodded hesitated it is why i saw when these others came up the garden he thought about that song how would they know my chamber i think we will discover that someone here told themunder duress or not we can leave that unless you wish otherwise to governor xus inquiries yes said tai we are leaving as soon as i return from the prefect as soon as we return she said she met his gaze her mouth was firm her eyes resolute indomitable he looked back at her she had just fought six assassins in silence to keep him from coming out and possibly being killed in a fight he would need to ask her though not just now if she truly thought he was best served by being left to lie in bed to be attackedunarmed and defencelessin the event they killed her as she fought them alone your servant will escort you and wait song murmured if that is acceptable my lord she lowered her eyes presenting a small neat lethal image all deference and duty in a black kanlin robe yes he sighed it is acceptable what was the point of saying anything else shandai is my brother limeis voice is louder than shes intended it to be they are alone after all only the wolves around them in a vast expanse the sun just risen but her heart is racing that is what you are trying to say his name shen tai he turns to look at her there is light pale and benevolent warming the land mist is rising dispersing she can see him clearly for the first time and she knows who this man has to be tai had told them what happened well hed told their father with limei among the willow trees near the stream this man with the stiff groundcovering gait and the lightless eyes will surely be the one assailed by shamanmagic all those years ago who had almost died or halfdied or had been made into some thing suspended between living and dead tai hadnt been able to tell their father which so limei didnt know couldnt know even looking now but what fit was the identity the remembered namemeshag son of huroklike the puzzle pieces of wooden toys her mother or second mother would sometimes bring home for her on market days long ago she should be terrified limei thinks he could be a monstrous spirit a predator like his wolves malignant devouring he isnt though and so she isnt he hasnt touched her the wolves havent he is he is rescuing me the thought comes and he is rescuing her not the true princess the emperors daughter because you are taking me away because of what tai did he has been staring at her accepting her gaze in the growing light after another long moment his untied hair moving in the breeze straying across his face he nods his head once down and back up yes he says shan shendai limei feels herself beginning to tremble is suddenly much too close to tears she hates that but it is one thing to be fairly sure of a guess it is another to be standing here with a spiritfigure and wolves and be told it is true how did you know i was with them how did you know to come she has always been able to think of questions to ask her voice is smaller she is afraid of this answer for the same reasons most likely that the bogu riders were afraid of him last night magic whether the foretellings of the school of unrestricted night in xinan the potions and incantations of the alchemists or darker bloodier doings up here with mirrors and drums this is not easy ground and the story her brother told all those years ago is still the worst shes ever heard in her life perhaps the man senses that or perhaps for an entirely different reason he only shakes his heavy head and does not answer instead he takes the leather flask from his hip and extends it to her his arm straight out she doesnt repeat her question she takes the water drinks she pours some into one hand and washes her face with it a little pointlessly she wonders if hell be angry at the waste but he says nothing his eyes are deeply disturbing if she thinks about how they became so black and flat she will be afraid he isnt dead she tells herself repeats it within as if for emphasis she may need to keep telling herself this she realizes he says awkwardly but in her tongue cave not far you rest i find horses she looks around at the grassland stretching all directions the lake is gone now behind them there is only grass very tall lit by the risen sun the mist has burned away a cave she says in this for a moment she thinks he is amused his mouth twitches one side only nothing in the eyes light is swallowed there it dies she hands him back the flask he seals it shoulders it turns to walk on she follows shandai the world limei decides is a stranger place than any sages teachings can encompass you have to wonder why the gods in their nine heavens have made it this way they reach the cave quite soon shed missed the depression in the landscape ahead of them from the edge she sees this is a shallow valley with another small lake within it there are wildflowers on the banks on the far side the slope back up is steeper they descend and start across it is full morning now the air is warmer at the lake meshag fills his flask limei washes her face properly shakes out and reties her hair he watches her expressionless he is not dead she tells herself the lead wolf takes them to the cave at the eastern end its entrance is entirely hidden by tall grass shed never have seen it no one who didnt know this was here would see it this is not the first time limei realizes that the man and these animals have been here he gestures she finds herself crawling elbows and knees holding down fear into a wolf lair the tunnel is narrow a birth chamber the smell of wolf all around and small bones she feels these with her hands under her knees panic begins to rise in the blackness but then the cave opens up she is in a space with rough stone walls and a ceiling she cant even make out she stands it is still dark but not completely so light filters in farther up openings high on the cliff face she can see the strangeness of the world meshag comes through the tunnel the wolves have not followed them on guard outside she doesnt know how could she know she is in a wolf cave in the bogu grasslands beyond the borders of the world her life her life has carried her here the strangeness he hands her a satchel and the flask here is food not leave wait my brother will come after us very soon my brother his brother is the kaghans heir the man she is supposed to marry she is a kitan princess a treatybride she looks at the man beside her his speech she decides is already clearer can the dead learn things he isnt dead she reminds herself where are you going she asks trying to keep apprehension from her voice alone a cave in wilderness wolves he looks impatient it is almost a relief to see such a normal expressionif you dont look at the eyes horses i told before he had she nods tries again to assemble facts she can work with she cant say why it matters but it does your brother you are opposing him for me for for shen tai for my brother there is enough light for her to see that his eyes remain flat there is nothing to find in them it makes her consider how much of what shes knownor thought she knewof any person has come from their eyes yes he says finally but hes taken so long she decides it isnt entirely true this reply that might be an error shes making he might have simply been trying to decide whether to tell her but she still feels what would he do to you your brother again he stares again a hesitation he says he wants me destroyed he has never found me now he will think he can destroyed not killed but it might be just language again words she is working hard he thinks he can find you by following me he nods that single down and up all of us the wolves i have allowed myself to be seen oh and you havent done that before not so near him or his shamans not difficult grasslands are large you might imagine you saw a smile there almost she lowers her head thinking she looks up again she says i am grateful you took you are taking a great risk for me she bows twice right fist in left hand she has not done so yet to him and it is proper they may call her a princess but she isnt and it doesnt matter anyhow meshag she needs to start using the name she thinks only looks at her she sees that he is not discomfited by her gesture he was the kaghans heir she thinks she is nowhere near her home he says quietly i wish him destroyed also limei blinks he looks at her deadeyed barechested hair to his waist utterly strange in this cave where they stand faint light filtering from above he says he did this to me my brother and it begins piece by puzzle piece to come clearer he has not yet returned it is now she judges well into the afternoon though it is difficult to measure time inside a cave there is more light filtering down now the sun is higher she has eaten has even dozed fitfully lying on earth and pebbles her head pillowed awkwardly on the satchel she is obviously not a princess if she can do that awakened by what was probably an imagined sound shes untied and then retied her hair used a little of the water to wash her hands again she is not to go outside she can ignore thisshes ignored so many instructions through her lifebut she isnt inclined to do so nor does it occur to her to run away for one thing she has no idea where to go for another the man shes been sent to marry is looking for her she has no doubt of that and she doesnt want to be found she doesnt want to live her life on these steppes she may end up with no choice short of death but for the moment at least there appears to be a glimmering of one like glowworms in a night dell or a cave she has no idea what meshag intends to do but he is helping her away and that is a start isnt it it might get her killed or he might decide to claim her body as a prize in a war with his brother take her right here on earth and stone but what control does she have in any of this what shed prefer it feels an absurd word is to be with the empress still serving her even exiled from the taming or even better to be home right now at this beginning of summer she can picture it too well not a helpful channel of thought or memory she is sitting hands around drawnup knees she permits herself to cry no one can see and then she stops she looks around for what must be the fiftieth time the low narrow tunnel leading out the curved cave walls rising towards light spilling softly down from the openings on the one side stones and pebbles bones scattered the wolves will have needed to eat feed their cubs she shivers there is one other tunnel larger than the entranceway leading farther in shed seen it on first entry here she cant say why she decides to explore it now anxiety a desire to do something make a decision however trivial patience is not a skill she has her mother used to talk to her about it she finds she can stand in the second tunnel if she bends over the air seems all right as she goes she isnt sure how shell know when it isnt she keeps her hands on the rough walls to either side and strains her eyes for the light begins to fade it is a short distance actually another birthing passage she thinks though she cant say why that thought has come to her twice now she straightens in a second chamber not as large or as high it is colder she can hear faintly the sound of water dripping something else is different there is no wolf smell here she doesnt know why wouldnt they extend their lair as far from outside as they could protect the cubs what is it that has kept them away and does that mean she shouldnt be here either she doesnt know the answers are too remote from any life shes lived then as her eyes adjust to fainter light limei sees what lies in this chamber both hands go to her mouth as if to lock in sound as if a gasp or cry would be sacrilege her next thought is that she might know after all why the animals have not come here for this must besurely it must bea place of power on the wall in front of her dim in the darkness but clearly conjured forth limei sees horses innumerable jumbled chaotically piled on each other all the way up into shadow fullbodied halfforms some with only heads and necks and manes in a racing tumbling spilling tumult a herd all facing the same way moving the same way deeper in as if thundering across the curved cave walls and she knows she knows in the moment of seeing the moment they emerge from darkness on the wall that these painted surging figures are unimaginably old she turns in the centre of a cascade on the opposite wall is another herd galloping the same direction the horses superimposed upon each other in wild profligate intensity so vital so vivid even in barely sufficient light that she can imagine sounds the drumming of hooves on hard ground the horses of the bogu steppes but before the bogu tribes were here she thinks there are no men on these walls and the horses are untamed free flowing like a river in spate towards the eastern end of the cave deeper inwhere there is a third tunnel she now sees something rises within her primitive and absolute imperative to tell her she will not go in there it is not for her she does not belong and she knows it high above that slit of an entranceway the largest by far of all the painted horses looms a stallion deepchested redbrown almost crimson its sex clearly shown and on its body all over itand on this one onlylimei sees the imprint of human hands laid on in a palecoloured paint as if branding or tattooing the horse she doesnt understand she does not ever in her life expect to understand but she feels an appallingly ancient force here and senses within herself a yearning to claim or possess it she is certain that those who placed their handprints on this wall on the painted body of this kinghorse whether they did so ages ago or have come recently through these tunnels were paying tribute homage to this herd and perhaps to those who put these horses here leading the way deeper in she will not follow them there she is not such a person and is too far from home there is a barrier in her mind where that third tunnel begins it is not an opening she can take she has not led a life guided by magic infused or entwined with it she doesnt like that world did not even at courtalchemists hovering stroking narrow beards astrologers mumbling over charts still she looks at these horses unable to stop turning and turning aware that shes becoming dizzied overwhelmed consumed by the profusion the richness here there is so much power on these walls humbling evoking awe enough to make someone weep she has a sense of time stretching back and back so far it cannot be grasped not by her at any rate not by shen limei only daughter of the kitan general shen gao she wonders suddenly what her father would have said had he been with her in this hidden place a hard thought because if he were alive she wouldnt be here and in that moment she hears a sound that makes her halt her spinning she stands motionless suddenly silent she listens the drip of water not that she is almost certain she heard a horse fear comes with that then another sound someone coming into this inner cave from the first one instead of frightening her this reassures meshag went to get horses he knows where she is the sound shes heardfaintlyis from outside a real horse not the supernatural neighing of a spirit stallion on these walls she sees him come through he straightens she is about to speak when he holds up a hand three fingers to his lips fear returns why silence who is out there he gestures for her to follow turns to lead her through the short tunnel to the wider brighter cave the first one she takes a last look at the horses all around at the kinghorse with the human hands upon him and then she makes her way out in the larger cave with the high openings lending light meshag turns again once more with fingers to his lips urging silence he is wearing a long dark tunic now a leather vest over it she wonders what clothing he has found for her she opens her mouth to whisper a question surely they can whisper but his gesture seeing that is imperative his eyes gleam flashing angrily in the thin light from above she registers this says nothing she draws a slow breath he gestures again for her to follow turns to take them back towards daylight she approaches closely behind him and at the edge of the tunnel that will lead them out in the moment when he bends low to enter it limei stabs him in the throat from one side with the knife shes carried in her sleeve all this way she drives the blade in then rips it towards her with all her strength knowing shell have only this one chance not knowing how to kill a man where the knife must go she tears it out and stabs him again and a third time sobbing he grunts only once a queer chest sound he falls with a clattering noise right at the entrance to the tunnel still weeping and she is not a woman who weeps limei strikes again with the knife into his back it hits metal twists in her hand she is frantic terrified but he lies where hes fallen and now she sees how much blood there is she scrabbles away clutching the marred blade she backs up against the cave wall eyes never leaving him if he gets up if he even moves she knows she will begin to scream and not be able to stop nothing no movement her rapid ragged breathing is loud in her ears the light in this chamber falls as before it is the light that saved her that told her if she is right in this her hands are still shaking spasms she cannot stop she puts the knife down beside her she has killed a man she is quite certain she has killed a man it is not meshag it is not him she says that last aloud shocking herself with the sound the harshness of her voice it cannot be him must not be she needs to know can only do that if she looks that means going back to where he lies face down before the tunnel it requires courage she has more in fact than she knows holding hard to inner control she does crawl back bent knife in hand there are stones on the cave floor they hurt her knees her wrist hurts from when the knife twisted why did it twist she thinks she might know needs to touch him to be sure she does that too drags him by his legs from the tunnels entrance more light where he lies now with an effort grunting she pushes him onto his back into her mind there flashes a horrifying image of this man rising up as she does so rising to he is dead he will not rise and he is not meshag an older man lean face thin grey hair he looks nothing at all like meshag son of hurok now but he had before had looked exactly like him in all but one respect which tells her what this man is what he was she corrects herself he is dead she killed him she rips through his tunic chest to belly with her reddened twisted blade tears it open with both hands metallic mirrors appear strapped around his body glinting in the pale light from above it is a truth about the nature of human beings that we seekeven demandorder and pattern in our lives in the flow and flux of history and our own times philosophers have noted this and mused upon it those advising princes emperors kings have sometimes proposed that this desire this need be used exploited shaped that a narrative a story the story of a time a war a dynasty be devised to steer the understanding of a people to where the prince desires it to go without pattern absent that sense of order a feeling of randomness of being lost in a world without purpose or direction can undermine even the strongest man or woman given this it would certainly have been noted as significant by any such philosopher or adviser that the second son and the only daughter of general shen gao honoured in his day as left side commander of the pacified west each killed a man on the same morning a long way from each other the son had done this before the daughter had not had never expected to as to the meaning to be attached to such a conjunction a pattern discovered embedded in the tale who can number under nine heavens the jewelbright observations to be extracted from moments such as these who will dare say he knows with certainty which single gem is to be held up to whatever light there is for us in our journeying and proclaimed as true eventually limei begins to think about the horse sound shed heard she fears an animal will give her away reveal the cave if it is still out there it might not be the wolves might have driven it away or killed it it leaves her feeling oddly passive after the hideous spasm of action before someone is lying not far away blood thickening on stone it is as if shes exhausted her reserves of force her ability to play any further role help herself can only wait to see what will follow it is an unexpectedly peaceful state you sat leaning against a wall legs extended in the midst of stones and animal bones and the smell of wolf and the sometimes flutter of a bat or bird overhead and you waited to see whoor whatwould come for you you didnt have to do anything there didnt seem to be anything left to do there is no point going outside to be seen where will she walk from here or even ride alone she has no adequate clothing no food and the wolves are out there so there is a curious measure of tranquility in her when she hears the sound of someone else coming into the cave through the tunnel she looks over but she doesnt stand up or try to hide she holds her bent knife in her hand meshag enters and straightens and looks around she can see him absorb what has happened she looks at him closely of course though she is very sure the deception isnt happening again he kneels beside the fallen man she sees that he avoids the blood on the cave floor he stands and comes towards her she looks at his eyes he was a shaman she asks though she knows the answer he gives his short nod he made himself look exactly almost exactly like you he never spoke he was taking me outside when i she doesnt finish what was not me she stands before answering brushes at her leggings and tunic to remove some of the rock dust there is blood too she sees that isnt going to disappear so easily his eyes she says his yours couldnt have been so bright she wonders if this will be wounding for what it implies but it looks as if he smiles she is almost sure she sees it before the expression goes away he says i know i have seen my eyes in water in pools that word yes pools this is since what happened to you a stupid question but he only nods again yes since my eyes are dead no they arent she says with sudden force he looks surprised she feels surprised your eyes are black but they arent you arent dead no smile this time no but too nearly something else he says before shan before shendai came that day that day and it was your brother who yes you know this i know this and this one she gestures at the body he was sent by him unexpectedly he shakes his head she had thought she was beginning to understand no too soon i think he sees me when i leave to find horse or before as we came here he just saw a chance to take me for himself or for reward might be he sees me to know me who i am watching the wolves might have told him then it takes time to make a spell to shapechange limei is thinking hard he could have just come in and seized me when you left no he considers that yes so must have meant to take you to them maybe afraid you kill yourself so he changed she clears her throat her hand is hurting must go now he says what about him he looks surprised he gestures at the bones around them leave to wolves it is what we do he pauses looks a little awkward then he says was good killing this one was very bravery is the word she sighs brave i suppose it is the word again he hesitates he motions with a stiff hand you see what is next cave the horses i saw i didnt go farther i felt not brave no he shakes his head was right not to go for priests spiritwalkers very old but you see last horse above i saw it he looks at her seems to make a decision come one thing we do then go she has exhausted her reserves for resisting she lets him lead her back into the dimness of the horsecave with those animals on the wall laid upon each other long ago and she watches as he does go into the last cave the one she would not enter very old he comes out with a shallow earthen bowl and mixes into it water from a second flask hes carrying and he stirs with a wooden stick his motions stiff as they always are there is no grace to him how he moves she is surprisingly certain there was once he signals her nearer she goes he takes her right handthe first time hes ever touched herand lays it flat in the bowl there is a paint of sorts white or very nearly at that point she realizes what is happening he leads her over by the wrist and he lays her hand on the flank of the kinghorse above the tunnel leading to the third cave so that a fresh imprint is made there among all the others which means that her existence her presence her life having been here has now been recorded registered and perhaps she will never know that does play a role in what follows it is so hard to see the patterns to be sure that they are there they leave that cave and then the other one go back out into sunlight she blinks in the days brightness he has found one horse only but the dead shamans is still tethered here unmenaced by the wolves though lathered with fearand so they have two mounts after all along with the food and the clothing meshag has taken from who knows where he helps her on the smaller horse and then he mounts and gentles the shamans and they ride a path out of that valley and go east with the sun overhead and the wolves beside them limei has no notion no least idea where he is taking her but she is alive and not going placidly into the fate devised for her against her will and desire and for now for this moment under heaven that is enough chapter xiv wujen ning of the second district cavalry had been the first to see master shen tai and his horse appear like ghosts out of a grey dawn west of iron gate fortress now not many days after he was dimly aware that his life might be changedor might have already been changedby them it was not normal for peasant labourers or soldiers without rank to undergo such alterations in the flowing of their lives you worked your fields dealt with flood or famine married had children born had them die and wives events far away rolled on vaguely apprehended perhaps heard about over rice wine in a tavern if you went to taverns or you joined the army were posted where they posted youusually far from home these days you dug ditches and latrines built and rebuilt garrison walls and buildings patrolled for bandits or wild animals caught fevers lived or died marched did go to taverns and brothels on leave in market towns sometimes you fought some of you died in battle some lost an eye or an arm and wished theyd died the sweep of distant events among the great might come more often to your ears in the way of army talk but it tended to have just as little impact short of a major campaign or perhaps a rebellion change wasnt a part of life as wujen ning had understood or experienced it this truth was currently undergoing change for one thing he was shockingly close to xinan to seeing the capital for the first time in his life only a night or two away now they told him the countryside had been altering as theyd ridden east from chenyao wheat and barley fields the occasional mulberry grove silk farms set back behind them away from the noise of the road had given way to village after village and larger towns so frequent now you could say they were continuous people and more people temple bells ringing not in haunting isolation but barely audible amid loud populations small farmspotatoes broad beanswere tucked in between the villages squeezed there was an endless line of market carts or woodcutters wagons going both ways along the imperial road clogging it slowing them this was the outermost sprawl of xinan he was told they were getting close now it was not something ning had ever thought about or wanted the capital had been as remote to his grasp of the world as the sea it terrified him to be honest so many people already he tried not to let that show and since no one in their company was really looking at him and he talked little he thought hed kept his secret he did catch himself whistling nervously sometimes he wondered as they travelled how the other soldiers felt about coming to the capital there were thirty riders now not just the five that had set out from iron gate to escort master shen governor xu had insisted that shen tai as an honorary officer of the second district army carrying tidings and riding a horse of greatest importance be accompaniedand protected there was some anger and some amusement among the iron gate soldiers ning didnt see the humour but he wasnt good at that he knew arising from the belief that it was carelessness among the governors guards that had come near to having master shen killed in chenyao one of nings fellows from iron gate a man with no shortage of opinions or winesoaked breath to voice them with said he didnt think any of those soldiers who had been on guard outside their inn that night were still alive governor xu might no longer be in the prime of youth he said but he wasnt showing any inclination to retire to fruit orchards and trout ponds he was wealthy aristocratic known to have rivalries with other military governors one big one in particular hed said with a knowing look as if everyone at their table would realize the one he meant ning didnt it didnt bother him had shen tai been killed or the horse wujen ning thought with genuine horror it would apparently have reflected very badly on the governor ning didnt understand or think much about this either but from the time theyd left chenyao he had made it his task to stay as close as he could to master shen and dynlal he honoured shen tai he loved the horse how could anyone wujen ning thought not love the horse the kanlin woman who frightened all of them a little and elicited some crude talk at night appeared to have decided ning was all right after an amused expression or two she had accepted him as having a place close to them while they rode or when they settled for the night ning didnt understand her glances he didnt know what anyone could find amusing in any of this but he had learned to accept that what made others smile could be a source of perplexity for him they were stopping at large inns now at sundown imperial posting stations good meals a change of horses they had documents signed by the governor ning was always entrusted with dynlal at the end of a days ride he tried not to let his pride show but it probably did he talked to the horse at night waking and walking out from whatever space he shared with the other soldiers bringing apples to the stable sometimes hed sleep there master shen didnt look at him much as they rode or at any of them he spoke occasionally with his kanlin guard more often with the poet who had joined them another mystery his preoccupation was with speed none of the soldiers knew why not even the one who acted as if he knew everything if wei song and the poet knew the reason they werent telling the poets name was master sima the others said he was famous immortal one of them declared ning knew nothing about that but he didnt think anyone was immortal maybe the emperor what he did know was that shen tai was in a great hurry to get to xinan ning wasnt at all but his own wishes and desires were as those of the silkworm that spins in subdued light amid a hush and lives only to do that on the fifth day out of chenyao just before crossing an arched river bridge tai had always loved theyd come to a road branching south running alongside the stream he had known it was coming of course hed been careful not to look down that road as they reached the junction or to speed up his horse in feigned indifference as they went across the bridge above bright water there were plum blossoms in the stream he saw it was difficult he knew that southern road as surely as he knew his own face in a bronze mirror every turn every fall and rise knew the towns and hamlets you would pass the fields and mulberry groves and silk farms the one genuinely good wine shop and the places to find a woman and a bed between the imperial road they were on and the home where hed grown up where his mothers and youngest brother were and his fathers grave not him not liu not limei the three of them were in the world entangled in it in the dust and noise jadeandgold after two years by the lake he didnt know how he felt about that hed been moving east so fast he hadnt had time to think about it that was he decided a component of the dust and noise never enough time for limei it would be worse tai remembered the dust storms of the north real ones stinging blinding dangerous not a poets imagery there was so much anger when he thought of her hed felt a tug within a feeling nearly physical as they passed the cutoff south two years and more since hed been there seen the gates in the stone wall the wornsmooth statues beside it to frighten demons away the alwaysswept path the goldfish ponds the porch garden stream his fathers gravemarker would be raised by now he thought the allotted time had passed his mother would have done things properly she always did but tai hadnt seen the headstone hadnt bowed before it didnt know what was inscribed what verse had been chosen what memorial words who had been selected to do the calligraphy hed been at kuala nor and was going elsewhere now riding past the road that would bring him home there could be peace there at night he thought after two years of hearing the dead he knew that this speed was almost meaningless it crossed into some showy gesture a display of love for his sister driving riders and horses hard towards xinan and to no point shed already been gone when sima zian left the capital hed said so the decision had been made before poor yan had set out for tais family estate thinking to find him there to tell him what was being done to her there might have been enough time if hed been home too late now so why was he pushing on so fiercely all of them awake before sunrise riding till nightfall the days were longer now too approaching the summer festival no one complained not by word or glance the soldiers would not would never but neither did wei song who had given considerable evidence of a willingness to advise him as to correct conduct and sima zian older and presumably suffering most from their pace did not seem to be suffering at all the poet never spoke to tai about their speed the folly of it the absence of proportion perhaps with a lifetime of observing men hed understood from the beginning what tai only gradually came to grasp he wasnt thundering down this road on his glorious horse in a wild attempt to rescue his sister he was going to his brother accepting that truth acknowledging it didnt bring anything like the calm that resolving uncertainty was supposed to do for one thing there was too much anger in him it seemed to find new channels with every li they rode every watch of the nights when he lay awake even in the fatigued aftermath of the days riding he didnt talk about any of this with the poet and certainly not with song though he had a sense they both knew something of what was troubling him he didnt enjoy the feeling of being understood so well even by a new dazzling friend and certainly not by a kanlin woman who was only here to guard him and only because hed made an impulsive decision at iron gate he could have dismissed her by now he had thirty soldiers he didnt dismiss her he remembered instead how shed fought at sunrise in a garden in chenyao it was late in the day tai felt it in his legs and back the sun was behind them a mild summers day slight breeze the imperial road was thronged with traffic it was too crowded too noisy for any attempt to appreciate the beauty of late afternoon the twilight to come they were three days past the cutoff to his home now which meant less than two days from xinan they might even be there tomorrow right around curfew he knew this part of the road very well had gone back and forth often enough through the years even with the crowds they were going quickly they used the middle of the three lanes reserved for soldiers and imperial riders a pair of imperial couriers galloping even faster than they were shouted for them to make room and they did jostling some farm carts and laden peasants right off the road towards the drainage ditch the couriers carried full saddlebags obviously packed with more than message scrolls lychees for wen jian one of them shouted over his shoulder as the poet threw out a query sima zian laughed then stopped laughing tai thought about helping the farmers right their carts and goods but there was too much urgency in him they would help each other he thought and looking back saw that it was so it was the way of life for country folk theyd probably have been fearful and confused if soldiers had stopped to aid them he looked over at the poet zians horse was beside his dynlal could have outrun all the others easily a foolish thing to do it might not be as foolish in a day or so tai had been thinking about that of making his way ahead entering xinan quietly before the gates closed at dusk he had someone to see and it might be more possible after dark the other mans expression was grave as they watched the couriers disappear into dust ahead of them carrying a delicacy for the precious consort lychees the military post wearing out horses with them that is wrong it is not sima zian began he stopped recklessly tai said not proportionate zian looked around to ensure that no one else was near them he nodded one word for it i fear chaos in the heavens here on earth words that could have you beaten and exiled even killed tai flinched sorry hed spoken the poet saw it and smiled my apologies shall we discuss the verses of chan du let us do that it always brings me pleasure i wonder if hes in xinan i believe he is the best poet alive tai cleared his throat followed the lead i believe i am riding with the best poet alive sima zian laughed again waved a hand dismissively we are very different men chan du and i though he does enjoy his wine i am happy to say a brief silence he wrote about kuala nor when he was younger after your fathers campaign do you know them those verses tai nodded his head of course i do he had studied those poems zians eyes were tigerbright did they send you there to the lake tai thought about it no my fathers sadness sent me there one poem may have given me a task the other man considered that then said why sir it is true on the shores of kuala nor white bones have lain for many years no one has gathered them the new ghosts are bitter and angry the old ghosts weep under the rain and within the circle of mountains the air is full of their cries you thought it was a poets imagery about the ghosts tai nodded i imagine everyone does if they havent been there a short silence and then the poet asked son of shen gao what is it you need to do when we arrive how may i help you tai rode a little then said very simply i do not know i am eager to be counselled what should i do but sima zian only repeated back to him i do not know they rode on the light very rich now nearing days end the wind behind them tai felt it stir his hair he reached forward and patted the mane of his horse he loved the horse already he thought sometimes it took no time at all the poet said you told me you wanted to kill someone tai remembered late night in the white phoenix pleasure house i did say that i am still angry but trying not to be unwise what would you do in my place a quick answer this time take care to stay alive first you are a danger to many people and they know you are coming of course they did hed sent messages the commander of iron gate had governor xu would have sent letters using allnight riders but tai took the point or what might have been part of a subtle mans point it truly would not be wise to ride alone through the walls to do whatever it was he wanted to do if he decided what he wanted to do he realized that zian was reining up beside him slowing dynlal tai looked ahead towards the side of the road at a grassy space across the ditch he realized doing so that it had become more than just foolish any notion of slipping quietly into the city as darkness fell he stopped his horse lifted a hand so the others would do the same wei song came up beside them and so a little behind her did the gaptoothed soldier whose name he could never remember the one who always took care of dynlal who is it song asked quietly isnt it obvious asked the poet not to me she snapped look at the carriage said zian there was an edge to his voice the sun from behind them lit the road the grass and the carriage he was eyeing there are kingfisher feathers on it that isnt the emperor song said stop being obscure i need to know to decide what kanlin look at the soldiers said sima zian their uniforms a silence oh said song and then she said it again the poet was looking at tai are you prepared for this a real question the large eyes grave you may not have any more time to decide what you wish he cannot be ignored my friend tai managed a thin smile i wouldnt dream of doing that he said he urged dynlal forward towards a tight cluster of forty or fifty soldiers surrounding an enormous sumptuously extravagant carriage a carriage so big he wondered how theyd got it across the small bridge that carried the roadside ditch maybe he thought one of the bridges was larger farther east at a crossroads it didnt matter the mind he decided could be peculiar at times like this with what it chose to dwell upon or ponder he heard hoofbeats looked back he wasnt alone after all rumpled poet small fierce blackclad kanlin he reined up looked across the ditch at the carriage kingfisher feathers decorating it as the poet had pointed out in the strict code of such things these were reserved for the imperial household but some near enough to the throne in high favour might display that favour by using them he reminded himself that those in the palacein all the different factionswould be wanting to enlist him to their cause if they could not end his life he moved dynlal across the roadway to the grass beside the ditch the door of the carriage was opened from the inside a voice unexpectedly light slightly foreign used to commanding said bluntly master shen tai we will talk in here come now tai drew another breath let it out he bowed he said i will be honoured to converse with you illustrious lord shall we speak at the posting station east of us your servant must attend to the needs of his soldiers and friends they have been riding all day no said the man in the carriage flat absolute tai still couldnt see the speaker not from where he was beside the road astride dynlal the voice added i wish not to be seen and known tai cleared his throat my lord he said there can be no one on this road who matters who does not know who is in this carriage i will meet you at the posting inn perhaps we can dine together it would be a great honour for me a face appeared in the window of the carriage enormous round as a moon under a black hat no repeated an li usually called roshan governor of three districts adopted son of the precious consort get in or i will have your soldiers killed and your friend decapitated and have you brought in here anyway it was surprising given how crowded the road had been but a space seemed to have somehow been shaped where they were in both directions east and west tai looked ahead then over his shoulder saw that other travellers were holding back it was quiet suddenly it matters he told himself it matters what i do now so he said speaking very clearly sima zian it is a grief to me as it will surely be to the empire that our friendship may end your illustrious life but i must trust you to understand why this is so of course i do said the poet what is friendship if it comes only when the wine cups are readily filled tai nodded he turned to the kanlin wei song be good enough to ride back and advise governor xus escort that they must prepare to be attacked by cavalry of the he glanced over at the horsemen by the carriageis it your eighth or ninth army honourable governor from within the carriage there came no reply the man would be thinking hard tai had just said something perhaps two things that would register he was pleased to note that his voice had remained level as if he did this sort of thing every day i believe it is the ninth said the poet i obey my lord said song in the same moment he heard her galloping back to their cavalry he didnt turn to watch he looked at the carriage at the round silent moonface within just visible he said quietly my lord i amhonorary though the commission may bean officer of the second military district commanding cavalry some of them assigned to me by governor xu himself regulations must shape my actions more than inclination i carry important information for the court i believe you know this i believe that is why you have done me the honour of being here i am not in a position to follow my desires and accept the privilege of hidden converse with you there is too much embodied by that with so many watching a carriage that bears kingfisher feathers i am certain you will agree he was certain in fact of the opposite but if he had any hope of remaining free in his own alignment his decisions surely he needed to from within coldly an li said this is truly that drunken poet beside you the one they call immortal tai inclined his head the banished immortal yes i have the honour of his companionship and counsel sima zian on his horse next to tais sketched his bow he was smiling tai saw amazed that drunken poet from within the carriage a moment later came a string of oaths startling in their crudeness even to someone who had been a soldier in the silence that followed the poets smile deepened are those formal requests of me my lord i admit i would find some of them difficult at my age roshan stared out at them both the generals eyes were nearly lost in the creased folds of his face it was hard to see them to get any reading of his thoughts he was tai realized even more frightening because of that it was said that once fighting in the northeast he had defeated an army of shuoki tribesmen beyond the wall part of a border insurgency he had ordered his soldiers and their bogu allies to cut off one foot from each man captured then he and his army had ridden off taking the enemy horses leaving the shuoki to die in the grass or survive somehow maimed there were other stories now in that oddly high accented voice he said dont be clever poet i have little patience for cleverness my apologies said sima zian and tai had a sense he might mean it your being here limits my actions for that said the poet calmly i must decline to apologize my lord if your actions were to be as you suggested roshan leaned back in his seat they couldnt see him any more tai looked to his right the sun was setting he had to squint wei song was arranging their men in a defensive alignment they had not yet drawn their weapons traffic had come to a halt the tale of this encounter he knew would race ahead of them now it would be in xinan before him that was the reason he was acting as he was but there was a risk of dying here of others dying for him if a celebrated poet had not been with them from within the carriage he heard son of shen gao accept my sympathy for the passing of your honourable father i knew of him of course i have journeyed two days from my own route to speak with you i will not for my own reasons go back to that posting inn they are not reasons you require to know but if you enter my carriage if you honour me by doing so i will begin by telling you what happened to a man you will be looking for and show you a letter tai registered the changed tone he said carefully that man would be his name is xin lun tai felt his heart thump lun he repeated yes he arranged for the assassins sent to kill you tai swallowed hard his mouth was dry how do you know this he told me himself when did he what did happen to him a mistake perhaps asking this it created an obligation of courtesy if the other man answered the other man answered he was killed some nights ago oh said tai the same night word came that you were on your way to xinan and the news of the white jade princesss gift the horses your own is magnificent by the way i assume you will not sell him the same night tai said a little stupidly the vast incongruous face reappeared in the carriage window like the moon from behind clouds i said that he sent me an urgent request for sanctuary explaining why i offered it he was murdered on his way from the taming to my house a fat finger appeared pointed at tai master shen you know your trouble isnt with me it is with the first minister your life depends on realizing that it is wen zhou who is trying to kill you you need friends tai was badly shaken lun was dead drinking companion fellow studenta man hed intended to kill himself in yans name discharging an obligation to another ghost one less obligation now was that good did it free him it didnt feel that way there was a letter it might tell him the other thing he needed to knowand feared to learn get in said roshan impatience in the voice but not anger he swung open the carriage door again tai took a breath sometimes you just went with the way the wind was blowing he dismounted he handed dynlals reins up to the poet who said nothing tai jumped down into the ditch and accepted the hand of an officer of the ninth district to climb to the other side he entered the carriage closed the door himself it was a response to the realities of the main imperial roads that in most of the posting inns along them the stables were larger than the accommodations available for travellers civil service messengers and military couriers the most regular users of the staging inns were constantly wearing out and changing horses often not lingering for the night a meal back in the saddle the whole point was to ride through the darkness down the middle of the road not to seek out a feathered bed let alone wine and a girl time mattered in a farflung empire there were merchants and army officers on the roads aristocrats going to and from country estates moving with rather less urgency and there were civil servants travelling to or returning from postings to various prefectures or on tours of inspection there for these of course rooms and adequate food were required the inns nearest to xinan tended to be different their wine was generally excellent and so were the girls and music highranking mandarins making short journeys from the capital didnt need their carriage horses changed but did demand a better quality of chamber and meal if for example they wished to time a return to the city for the hours before curfew fell the mulberry grove rest house not far from xinan qualified as one of the more elaborately appointed places to spend a night on the main eastwest road mulberry trees were long gone from the environs of the inn as were the silk farms associated with them the inns name evoked quieter days many hundred years ago before xinan had grown into what it now was there was a plaque in the main courtyard inscribed in the fifth dynasty a verse extolling the serenity of the inn and its countryside it made for some irony by the time tai and his company rode into the inn yard well after darkfall it was as noisy and crowded as the road had been two riders had been sent ahead to arrange their stay or finding rooms would have been doubtful torches were lit in the inn yard the night had been starry as they approached the sky river showing a sliver of moon these were lost in the smoky clattering chaos of the main courtyard tais horsemen were bunched around him on guard aggressively alert he imagined song had given the orders issues of rank in their company had been worked out his kanlin warrior could speak for him the soldiers might hate her for it but that would have always been the case with a woman in any event song didnt seem inclined to worry about being well liked by soldiers tai was too preoccupied as they rode in to be unhappy about how protective they were in fact with some ruefulness he realized that he didnt even mind it any more hed been frightened in that carriage by the road and was still disturbed the two advance riders theyd sent reported to song and their captain their company had three rooms seven or eight to a room there was a chamber for tai and sima zian to share the other soldiers would sleep in the stable there were to be guards posted tonight tai learned listening without much concentration to orders being given in his name he ought to be paying closer attention probably he found it difficult he had no problem sharing a room with the poet for one thing zian hadnt made it to their chamber from the pleasure pavilions in the other inns where this had happened this was a man who had earned legendary status in diverse ways tai could never have sustained the hours and the drinking the poet managedand sima zian had to be twenty years older than tai was they dismounted in a clatter of weapons and armour and the stamp and snort of tired hungry horses servants ran in every direction through the courtyard it would not tai thought be difficult to kill him here one suborned servant one assassin with a knife or on a rooftop with a bow he looked up smoke from torches he was very tired he forced himself to stop thinking about it held to the core truth underlying all of this killing him now with word of the sardian horses already in xinan represented a reckless possibly suicidal act for anyone even an enormous and enormously powerful military governor of three districts even the first minister of kitai he looked around trying to bring himself into the present not let his thoughts run too far ahead or linger behind song was at his elbow so until a moment ago when tai dismounted had been the gaptoothed soldier from iron gate he shook his head suddenly irritated what is the name of that one who always takes dynlal he spotted the man leading the horse towards the stables i should know it by now song tilted her head a little as if surprised a border soldier not really but hes called wujen wujen ning he saw her teeth flash youll forget it again i will not tai said and swore under his breath he took immediate steps to fix the name in memory an association ning was the metalsmith in the village near their estate he looked at the woman in the flickering light torches were above them over the portico other lights moved through the yard insects were out now after dark tai slapped at one on his arm we are less than a day from your sanctuary he murmured do you wish to go home kanlin hed caught her by surprise he saw wasnt sure why it was an obvious question do you wish to dismiss your servant my lord he cleared his throat i dont think so i have no cause to question your competence i am honoured by your trust she said formally zian strode over frompredictablythe direction of the music to the right of this first courtyard i have arranged a table he said cheerfully and i have requested that their best saffron wine be heated seeing as we have had a long difficult day he grinned at song i trust you will approve the expense i only carry the money she murmured i dont approve the spending of it except for the soldiers make sure they have wine tai said the poet gestured with one hand and tai went with him through the crowd song stayed beside them her expression alert it made him weary this need for vigilance it was not a life hed ever wanted how many men were allowed the life they wanted maybe this one he thought looking at the poet moving eagerly ahead of him towards where they could just hear a pipa being played in a room beyond the courtyard noise this one or maybe my brother your brother roshan had said without preamble as tai closed the carriage door and sat opposite him is not named in the letter it was read to me several times i do not hed added read myself it was widely known a source of derision among the aristocrats and the examinationtrained mandarins it was regarded as a principal reason why the endlessly subtle chin hai once first minister once feared everywhere now gone to his ancestors had allowed roshan and other barbarian generals to acquire so much power on the borders an illiterate had no chance of threatening him at the centre of his webs in the taming the way an aristocrat with an army could such at any rate had been the view of the students taking the examinations or preparing to and of course whatever they agreed upon had to be true did it not settling into the carriage tai had immediately felt out of his depth which was he was certain the point of roshans remark why would you imagine id consider that possible that my brother could be accused of anything regarding me he was delaying trying to get his bearings the governor leaned back against a profusion of cushions eyeing him an li was from this close even more awesomely vast a size that seemed mythic a figure of legend he had when not yet promoted to the rank of general led three companies of seventh district cavalry through five brutal days and nights of riding to turn the tide of battle against an incursion from the koreini peninsula the koreini of the far east ambitious under their own emperor had elected that spring to test the kitan emperors commitment to the building of garrison forts beyond the wall they had been given an answer to their very great costbut only because of roshan that was twenty years ago tais father had told him about that ride he had told liu as well tai remembered an li shifted on his cushions again your brother is principal counsellor to the first minister shen liu has made his choice of paths the letteryou may read itindicates that prime minister wen had his reasons for wishing you no longer among us or in a dear womans thoughts or perhaps able to disrupt your brothers plans for your sister he does after all depend on shen liu for a great deal it was the first minister who formally proposed your sisters elevation to exalted status you did know that tai shook his head he hadnt but it made sense the governor sighed fluttered a hand his fingers were unexpectedly long he wore a sweet floral scent it filled the carriage he said spring rain is that the charming creatures name it will puzzle me until i draw my last breath how men can be so undone by women he paused then added thoughtfully not even the highest among us are immune to the folly of that nothing he says is unplanned tai told himself and that last remark was treason since the highest among us could only mean the emperor tai said possibly making a mistake i might risk such a course myself for a woman indeed i had thought you might be different this lin changthat is her name nowis she so very appealing i confess i grow curious i never knew that name we called her rain but i am not speaking of her my lord you have mentioned two women roshans eyes were slits tai wondered how well the man could even see the governor waited he shifted in his seat again tai said if you can bring my sister back from the bogu lands before she is married there i will claim and then assign all of my sardian horses to the armies of the seventh eighth and ninth districts he hadnt known he was going to say that an li made a small involuntary movement of one hand tai realized hed startled the other man the general said as much you are more direct than your brother arent you we have little in common tai said a sister the other man murmured and a father of distinction as you were gracious enough to mention but we see different paths to extending the family honour i have made you a formal proposal governor an you would do this you would give them to me all of them for a girl for my sister from outside tai heard sounds again traffic on the roadway had resumed creaking cartwheels laughter shouts life moving on a spring day he kept his gaze on the man opposite at length roshan shook his head i would do it for two hundred and fifty sardian horses of course i would i am thinking now right here of how to do it but it is impossible i believe you know that i might even accuse you of toying with me it would be untrue tai said quietly the man across from him shifted yet again stretching a massive leg to one side with a grunt he said five horses would have been generous as a gift princess chengwan has shaken your life hasnt she tai said nothing she has the governor went on like a storm shakes a tree or even uproots it you have to choose what to do now you might be killed to stop you from choosing i could do it here only if it did not get back to the taming to the first minister whose action cost the empire those horses an li stared at him with those slitted eyes you all want them too much tai said not if they go to an enemy shen tai tai noted the word he said i just offered them to you i heard you but i cannot do it since it cannot be done your sister is gone son of shen gao she is north of the wall by now she is with the bogu he grinned suddenly a malicious smile no sense of any genial amusing figure of the court the one whod allowed himself to be swaddled like a baby by all the women she may be with child to the kaghans son as we speak at the least she will know his inclinations i have heard stories i wonder if your brother knew them before he proposed her as wife to the kaghans heir the sweetness of the perfume was almost sickening suddenly why be uncivilized tai said before he could stop himself he was fighting anger reminded himself again that the other man was not saying these thingswas not saying anythingwithout purpose roshan seemed amused why uncivilized because i am i am a soldier all my life and my fathers tribe warred with the bogu shen tai you are not the only one to be direct by inclination let me see the letter tai said being direct it was handed across without a word he read quickly it was a copy the calligraphy was too regular no mention of liu as roshan had indicated but tai said he is clear xin lun says he expects to be killed that night begs you to guard him why did you not send men to bring him to you the expression on the other mans face made him feel again out of his depth childlike an li shrugged turned his neck one way and then the other stretching it i suppose i could have he did ask for protection didnt he perhaps you are right perhaps tai was struggling heard it in his voice the general betrayed impatience shen tai it is important in any battle to know your own strengths and weaknesses and to understand your enemys your father must have taught you this what does that have to do wen zhou would have learned of your horses and your survival as soon as word reached the palace as soon as anyone learned it that night that is why xin lun knew he was in danger the first minister could not let him live knowing what he knew and with what hed done zhou is a fool but dangerous so why not send your soldiers for lun the general shook his massive head as if sorrowing for the ignorance of the world where was this happening shen tai where were we all xinan but i dont think i dont have an army there it is not permitted to me to anyone i am on my enemys ground without my forces if i shelter lun in the capital i am declaring war on the first minister that very night where he has the weapons he needs and i do not you you are the favourite of the emperor of the precious consort no we are both favoured it was a policy but our soglorious emperor is unpredictable now too distracted and jian is young and a woman which means unpredictable they are not son of shen gao reliable i could not bring lun into my home and be halfway certain of leaving xinan alive tai looked down at the letter in his hand read it again mostly to give himself time he was beginning to see so you let lun believe you would you offered him sanctuary that led him to start down through the city good said an li you are not a fool are you as dangerous as your brother tai blinked i may be dangerous to him the general smiled shifted again a good answer it amuses me but come work it through what did i do that night tai said slowly you did send men didnt you but not to escort xin lun only to observe good again and why tai swallowed to see when he was killed an li smiled when and by whom the killer was seen of course he was and by the gold bird guards as well my men made certain of it the guard were persuaded not to do anything yet but have recorded what they saw that night tai looked at him the small eyes florid face one of wen zhous retainers killed lun of course as simple as that but if lun is dead the honourable xin lun is as useful to me murdered as alive especially if the city guards know who did it the letter is what i needed along with the observed killing of the letterwriter by a known person the first minister has generously obliged me xin lun in my home might have had me arrested xinan was the wrong place for me to begin a battle tai let that last sink into awareness stone in a pond are you beginning a battle there was a silence he wasnt entirely sure he wanted an answer sounds from outside again the customary back and forth of the road an irritated outcry an oath more laughter a day moving towards a usual end sunset and the stars tell me the man opposite said were you really burying dead soldiers at kuala nor for two years yes tai said were there ghosts yes that was bravely done then as a soldier i honour it i could kill you here if i decided your horses would somehow determine the course of events you dont think they will they might i have decided to act as if it is not so and to spare you he shifted position yet again youd have lost rank title all granted lands possibly my life and so shen tai what does that tell you by way of answering the question you asked are you beginning a battle hed asked tai cleared his throat managed a halfsmile it tells me i need to be grateful youve decided the horses might not matter as much as some others seem to think a moment of stillness then the carriage rocked to roshans laughter it lasted a long time when he finally subsided coughing the governor said you cant see it can you you have been too long away i am being pushed towards my destruction or to resisting it wen zhou is rolling dice that is his nature but i cannot i will not linger in xinan to see what the emperor does whether jian chooses her cousin or her adopted child tai had never seen a smile so lacking in mirth he shivered the governor saw it of course the narrow eyes in the folds of flesh roshan said you may keep that copy it might be of use to you and perhaps to me if you choose to remember who gave it to you eventually he shifted his outstretched leg one more time eventually everything he said had layers of meaning and so tai abruptly realized with a sudden hard shock of understanding did his movements they had nothing to do with restlessness the man was in pain once you saw it it was obvious tai looked away an instinct to hide what hed realized he wasnt at all sure how hed intuited this but he was certain he was right and that an li would not be pleased to have it noted i i am not part of this he said thinking hard he wondered now about the scent that toosweet perfume was it covering something else im afraid that is not true everyone will be part if this happens that includes you unless you go back to kuala nor and the dead and maybe even there i told you the princess in rygyal has seized hold of your life he gestured his hands outspread i would be very cautious with those horses you may find yourself between cliffs and tigers as we say in the northeast he dropped one hand in his lap motioned with the other you may go son of shen gao i have my own road to take now remain guarded in xinan you are not going back the other man shook his head it was a mistake to go to court this spring my oldest son said as much tried to stop me i sent him back north four days ago to our own ground that cold smile he knows how to read my son even writes poetry i dont understand it another piece seemed to be trying to slide into place like one of the puzzle toys his sister used to love tai tried to remember what he knew about the sons but you came this way yourself to to meet you and decide if you might give your horses to wen zhou i have satisfied myself you will not tai felt a calmness descend and if you had satisfied yourself otherwise there would have been a fight here a small first battle your cavalry would have been killed and probably the poet but certainly you first of all i would have had no choice why a reckless question but he never received an answer to it not in words only another mirthless smile it was then looking at that expression that a feeling overtook tai unlike any hed ever known he said before an instinct for caution could stop the words governor an honoured general you do not have to shape your sons legacy you have your own to devise yet my lord we who follow great fathers we must make our own paths and choices this empire has been defended by you all these years surely you can allow yourself some rest now some easing of of painful burdens too close too much said the look he received was as bleak and frightening as anything hed ever experienced he thought of wolves of teeth and claws in his own flesh coming directly after the earlier inward sensation an impulse sharp as a thorn it almost made him ill an li did not speak again tai said nothing more the carriage door was opened for him by the governor leaning over to do so a gesture of courtesy from someone of such rank tai bowed where he sat then stepped out and down into the lateday light and what looked surprisingly to be the ordinary world he was irritably aware that wei song was watching them from the far side of the room near the doorway to the courtyard he was in a recessed alcove with the poet drinking good wine too quickly quiet music was playing there was food he wasnt hungry hed felt a need to become drunk wasnt there yet he didnt want to be dealing with the thoughts he was carrying a river too deep as a friend had written once not a very good line in truth though it lodged in the mind it didnt matter how deep a river was what mattered was how swiftly the water flowed how cold it was if there were dangerous creatures in it if it had rapids or falls tai drained another cup of saffron wine looked around the room saw his kanlin watching him some distance away he didnt like the set of her toowide mouth or that intense alert scrutiny the mixture of concern and disapproval in it so im drinking he wanted to say there a reason i shouldnt be it wasnt as if shed ever cast that sort of glance at sima zian though the man spent every single night and most of the days doing exactly this it occurred to him gazing across the crowded room that hed never seen her in anything but the black tunic and leggings or robe of a kanlin and he never would her hair had been unbound that first sunrise at iron gate hed thought she was another assassin she wasnt rain had sent her rain was sleeping now a little more than a days ride from here in wen zhous home in his bed perhaps or maybe she was in his bed and not asleep she had tried to tell him this might happen it came to him to be irritated again by the too obviously professional appraisal his kanlin was still giving him his kanlin that was why the poet never got this look zian hadnt hired her he just enjoyed her presence the poet was an easy companion he could talk if that was your mood or sit as quietly as you needed tai shook his head found himself returning against his will to the end of the encounter in roshans carriage the reason he was drinking the pipa subsided a flute took up the melody across the small platform the poet was as best tai could tell a few drinks behind him for the first time ever no judgment in those eyes no amusement either you could say that was a judgment of sorts tai didnt feel like saying it or thinking it or having his mind working on anything at all tonight he gestured vaguely and a sleek figure in paleblue silk was beside them filling his cup he was vaguely aware of perfume the cut of her gown xinan fashion for this season he imagined they were almost there hed been away two years they were almost there a woman is generally better than wine for pushing thoughts away and almost always better for your head zian smiled gently tai stared at the other man the poet added quietly in the depths of the wood i hear only birds you need not say anything but i am listening tai shrugged im here were all alive my brothers name wasnt in that letter id say it was a good encounter respectful illuminating would you it was more than the words the calm forestdeep gaze that brought him up short in his striving for irony in the depths of the wood his reply had been unworthy of this man of what had just happened of what tai was dealing with the pipa resumed joining the flute the players were very good im sorry he said he lowered his head looked up you told me earlier today that it felt as if something was approaching you called it chaos i did i think you are right i think it is almost certain and you want to do something that is what troubles you shen tai we need to remember what we are our limitations and so tai did end up saying after all what hed been thinking or trying not to think i could have killed him in the carriage he is not young he is in great pain all the time i had my knife do you understand i was there and i listened to him speak and i thought this is what i must do for the empire for all of us he looked away i have never had such a feeling in my life well you spoke of killing someone while we rode he had hed meant xin lun that was about yans death a response this was different it felt as if i owed roshans death and my own to to everyone else that it was required of me before it is too late he saw that hed disturbed the other man finally what does he intend hes left xinan going back northeast his son has already gone he feared remaining in the city says wen zhou was forcing him he has xin luns letter it shows the first minister tried to kill me will anyone believe it i think so roshan has people including the gold bird guards who saw that zhou had lun killed because he knew too much he had never seen the poet look like this he went northeast to do what tai just looked at him youd have been killed immediately zian said finally surely you know it of course i do sometimes you have to accept that dont you isnt that what courage is in a soldier i think i was a coward today tai drained his cup again the poet shook his head no ending a life two lives that way and other people on that road you werent ready to pretend to be a god perhaps or i wasnt ready to accept my own death offer it it might have been that the poet stared at him then said full moon is falling through the sky cranes fly through clouds wolves howl i cannot find rest because i am powerless to amend a broken world sima zian added i love the man who wrote that i told you before but there is so much burden in chan du duty assuming all tasks can betray arrogance the idea we can know what must be done and do it properly we cannot know the future my friend it claims so much to imagine we can and the world is not broken any more than it always always is tai looked at him and then away across the room wei song had gone he didnt know where the music continued it was very beautiful part three chapter xv he woke from another dream that escaped him slipping away like a salmon from his childhood grasp in a cold river awareness of morning came it was not a dream of a foxwoman not this time no desire no sense of desire spent instead wistfulness loss as if something someone was leaving was already gone like the dream itself a path in life a person a shape to the world all of these i am powerless to amend a broken world it occurred to him still half asleep that the way chan du had phrased that celebrated grief it suggested other worlds than this others that might need mendingor amending the two words were not the same tai thought though they glided into each other in the way the best poetry did then that thought too fled from him as a rapping came at his door and tai understood that he had heard it already asleep that it was the knocking that had awakened him sending the dream away down the river of night with the moon he glanced over the second bed was empty had not been occupiedas usual although the poets manner had been sombre when tai had left him after their talk last night wei song and two of the soldiers had been in the courtyard when hed crossed it to go to bed theyd walked him to the door of his room it was clear they were going to stay outside three guards now roshan had warned him to be cautious tai hadnt told that to song but shed made changes anyhow hed said nothing not even a good night another knocking not imperative or demanding but it was alsohe knew this from the courtesy of that soundnot his kanlin summoning him from outside came a voice carefully pitched exquisitely cultured honourable shen tai be so gracious as to acknowledge a humble servants presence and request tai sat up in bed you havent made any request and i dont know whose presence i am acknowledging i bow twice in shame forgive me noble sir my name is too unworthy to be offered but i am entrusted with the office of second steward in the household of the shining and exalted companion you are invited to present your honourable self she is here the steward said with the faintest hint of asperity no no she is at mawai we are sent to bring you there with all courtesy tai began dressing very quickly it was beginning you could say it had begun by kuala nor when bytsan sri nespo had brought him a letter or at chenyao when the governor of the second and third military districts had sought to claim him and his horses had even sent a daughter to him at night a sign in silk of what might come you could say there never was a clear beginning to anything in life unless it was the moment you drew your first breath in the world or you could say it was beginning now because the shining and exalted companion was also called precious consort and beloved companion and her name was wen jian the court hadnt waited for him to get to xinan it had come for him he splashed water on his face at the basin tied his hair hastily and then did it again to marginally better effect rubbed his teeth with a finger used the chamber pot put his swords on his boots he went to the door just before opening it a thought occurred wei song please report silence tai drew a breath he truly didnt want a confrontation here but steward where is my kanlin guard on the other side of the door the steward cleared his throat his voice was as smooth as before however the shining and exalted companion is not always enamoured of kanlin warriors my lord not everyone is what does that have to do with the present circumstance your guard was assertive in trying to prevent us from knocking at your door as was her duty since i was asleep once more where is she a hesitation she is here of course then why is she not answering me i do not know my lord tai knew steward unless wei song is released by those holding her and until she speaks to me i am not opening my door to you i have no doubt you can break it down but you did speak of respect and of courtesy i expect both this was not the mildest way to begin a day he heard quick low speech outside he waited master shen he heard her say finally i am shamed i could not prevent them from disturbing your rest they would have been holding her she would have refused to speak until she was free he opened the door he took in the scene before him the steward was bowing there were a dozen soldiers in the courtyards morning light two of them had wounds one was on the ground being attended to another was upright but holding a hand to a bleeding side both he saw with relief looked as if they would be all right song stood among them with her own swords removed from her they lay beside her her head was lowered she had evidently fought imperial soldiers for him he saw his other two guards of the night they were kneeling to one side unharmed tais soldiers far outnumbering these new arrivals were standing in the middle of the courtyard but the difference in numbers was meaningless this steward was leading men of the imperial guard of the emperor taizu might he rule a thousand years in joy upon the phoenix throne these were elite soldiers of the taming palace you didnt fight them or deny them anything unless you were keen to have your head on a spear at the city gates tai saw the poet among his own soldiers zian didnt seem amused or curious this morning he looked concerned and alert though rumpled as ever hair untied belt askew there was a crowd in the courtyard beyond all of these gathered early of a morning to see what was happening why a company from the court was here who it was they had come to seize or summon or honour the second son of general shen gao once left side commander of the pacified west said carefully steward you do me too much honour the man straightened from his bow a practised movement he was older than tai had little hair just fringes at the sides he affected a thin moustache likely a fashion no sword the black robe of a civil servant red belt of rank key of office dangling at his waist the steward bowed again fist in palm this time in response to tais words they were doing this very formally tai thought it made him nervous he had a sudden image in his mind vivid as a masterpainting of the mountains ringing kuala nor in springtime rising up and up no men to be seen just birds mountain goats and sheep on the slopes and the lake below he shook his head he looked to his left and saw a sedan chair waiting for him he blinked it was dazzling it gleamed in the sunlight it made roshans carriage yesterday look like a farmers market cart there was gold adorning the four pillars the rods the bearers would hold were banded in ivory and onyx and he was fairly certain even from here that the wood was sandalwood the curtains were heavy worked silk with the phoenix symbol and they were yellow which only the emperors household could use kingfisher feathers were everywhere iridescent shimmering too many of them an opulence that was almost an assault if you knew how rare they were brought from how far what they would have cost he saw jade decorations at the cross pieces top and bottom of the curtained cabin on the rods white jade and palegreen and darkgreen the rods were long enough for eight bearers not four or six and there were eight men standing by expressionless to carry him to mawai he had tried vainly in the event to keep some control some distance yesterday when an li had summoned him beside the road he tried again wei song reclaim your weapons and make arrangements for dynlal to be saddled he glanced at the steward i prefer to ride i will be grateful for your escort however the steward looked utterly composed his expression formally regretful i fear your kanlin cannot be permitted arms she drew upon the imperial household guard she must of course be punished tai shook his head that is not acceptable she was under orders that my night not be disturbed there have beeni imagine your mistress knows thisattempts upon my life if i die the empire suffers a great loss and i am not referring to my own unworthy life the slightest hint of unease in the mans smooth face adjustments being made even so my lord it remains that she she did exactly what she was ordered to do in the interests of kitai and her current master i am curious second steward did your soldiers explain their purpose did they invite her to knock at the door and address me a silence he turned to song wei song report were these things done her head was high now i regret it was not so my lord they came up on the portico ignored requests to stop ignored requests for an explanation this one the steward went straight to your door surely you saw their imperial livery my lord livery can be a disguise it is a known device men have been slain through that artifice and the sedan chair did not arrive until after i had engaged the soldiers i am shamed and sorry to have caused you distress i will of course accept any punishment due to me none is due tai said flatly steward i will make answer to your mistress for my servant but i will not accompany you willingly if she is in any way harmed or impeded from guarding me soldiers have been injured the steward repeated so was she tai said it was true he saw blood on songs shoulder a rip in her tunic she would be he thought more distressed at being defeated by a dozen of the besttrained soldiers in the taming than anything else he let his voice grow cold if there is anyone who can confirm the report she has offered i daresay the faultand the punishmentdoes not lie with my guard and i will say as much at mawai he lifted his voice sima zian will you be good enough to assist it was useful sometimes to have a celebrated name to bring into a conversation and see what ensued in a different time and place he might have been amused the steward wheeled stumbling as if caught in a swirl of wind he spied the poet who had obligingly stepped forward to be spied the steward achieved two bows with speed but his composure was clearly shaken zian smiled genially i do not believe to my great distress that the lady wen jian is fond of me this spring i would be honoured and grateful to have the chance to express my respect for her should the opportunity arise hed hinted to this effect tai remembered in their first conversation a reason hed left xinan master sima the steward spluttered this is unexpected to find you in the in the company of master shen gao er shen tai poets turn up in strange places i was here this morning to see your soldiers refuse a request to explain themselves at master shens doorway i believe a kanlin must respond to that refusal by the code of their order han chung of the seventh dynasty has a verse on the subject praising their dedication the poem was a favourite of the glorious emperors illustrious father now with the gods and his ancestors perhaps he is even listening to han chung recite in one of the nine heavens zian lifted a hand piously we can only hope amid the dust and noise of the world that it might be so tai felt an impulse to laugh so befuddled did the steward look he schooled his features he said as gravely as he could steward i am accompanied by the illustrious master sima by a kanlin guard and by a company of soldiers personally assigned to my command by governor xu bihai i will ride among them i am humbled by your mistresss invitation to attend upon her and will make my way to mawai immediately would you do me the honour of riding with us he said it loudly he wanted people to hear from this point forward he thought a great deal of what happened would be for displaypositions and posturing he knew that much about the court the steward of wen jian knew more of course but the man seemed acutely uncomfortable now he cleared his throat again shifted his feet an awkward silence descended he seemed to be waiting for what tai didnt know ride with me tai repeated there has been a minor embarrassment here nothing of consequence i will happily tell your mistress that you were properly zealous in her cause master shen your entirely unworthy servant begs forgiveness it was not considered that you might decline the sedan chair it is known that you are attached to your horse and we wished to ensure it came safely with us some of our soldiers took it already this morning from the stables here they are to meet us at mawai of course no harm will come to you took my horse tai felt a hard pulsing at his temples he was aware that wei song had reclaimed her weapons just below him in the courtyard the imperial soldiers made no movement to stop her zian stepped forward to stand beside her the poets face was cold now the wide eyes watchful tai said to song dynlal was guarded as always my lord she replied the steward cleared his throat again this mornings encounter had not quite evidently unfolded as he had expected it to two of the three men by the horse i understand were prompt to stand aside as was proper given who we are and the third said tai the third i greatly regret also elected to draw blade upon officers of the imperial palace guard defending my sardian horsea gift from the princess chengwan as hed been instructed to do steward where is he another silence i am informed that he unfortunately succumbed to wounds incurred my lord may i offer my regrets and the hope that the passing of a nameless soldier will not tai threw up both hands fingers spread palms outward compelling silence it was a gesture of force arrogance a superior stilling an underlingin public even as he did it he was trying to sort through if he did carry rank against this man tai was a middlelevel purely symbolic military officer but also an honoured generals son andimportantlyyounger brother to the prime ministers principal adviser but this steward in the redbelted black robe of a mandarin of the eighth degree high in the household of the beloved companion outranked him by any and all possible no he didnt and that was why the man bowed yet again instead of snarling in outrage at tais gesture the steward knew tai was over and above all other possible truths and alignments and ranks brother to royalty now to limei princess limei elevated into the imperial family before being sent north in marriage in kitai in the ninth dynasty of the emperor taizu that relationship mattered it mattered so much it was why liu had done what hed done sacrificing a sister to his ambition and it was why tai could stand here hands thrust forward to silence another man and see a taming palace mandarin stand abashed before him through clenched teeth fighting anger rage could undo him here he needed to think tai said he is not nameless his name was wujen ning a soldier of the second district army posted to iron gate fortress assigned by his commander to guard me and my horse serving the emperor by obeying the orders of his officers including myself he was trying even as he spoke to remember the man his features words but wujen ning had never said anything tai could recall hed simply been there always near dynlal a worriedlooking gaptoothed expression came to mind thinning hair exposing a high forehead sloped shoulders or maybe not tai was relieved hed remembered the name had been able to offer it to this courtyard assembly to the gods he said steward i await the formal response of office to the killing of a soldier and the theft of my horse theft was a strong word he was too angry he saw zian glance at him lips pursed together as if urging caution thena small motion in a crowded courtyardhe saw something else discreet as the movement was it seemed as if every man and woman girls from the music pavilion had come out by now in that open space in morning light saw the same thing and responded to it as if a dancing master had trained them all a hand appeared through the silk curtain of the sedan chair it gestured to the steward two slowly curled fingers there were rings on those fingers tai saw and the fingernails were painted red then he was on his knees head to the ground so was everyone in the courtyard except her guards and the steward tai allowed himself to glance cautiously up and look heart pounding mind askew the steward bowed three times then walked slowly across to the curtained chair as if towards his own beheading tai watched the man listen to whatever was being said to him from within the steward stepped aside bowed again expressionless the hand reappeared through yellow silk and beckoned a second time exactly the same way two fingers but this time to tai everything had changed she was here herself after all tai stood offered the same triple bow the steward had he said quietly to song and zian stay with me if you possibly can we wont be going quickly in that ill do my best to ensure your safety and the soldiers we arent in danger sima zian said still kneeling well be at mawai one way or another master shen he heard his kanlin say her expression was odd looking up at him be careful she is more dangerous than a foxwoman he knew she was tai took the steps down from the portico crossed the dusty courtyard through a crowd of kneeling people and found himself beside the curtained sedan chair he said loudly looking at the steward and at the captain of the imperial escort beside him i give my companions into your protection if my horse is missing or harmed i lay that upon you both the officer nodded standing straight as a banner pole the steward was pale tai looked at the closed curtain his mouth was dry the captain gestured at tais swords and boots he removed them the steward pulled the curtain back just enough tai entered the curtain of the sedan chair fell closed with a rustling sound he found himself enveloped by scent in a softened silkfiltered light that seemed to not be entirely of the world hed just left it wasnt of course it wasnt the same world in here he looked at her at wen jian he had known lovely women in his life some of them very recently the false kanlin whod come to kill him by the lake had been icily beautiful cold as kuala nor the daughters of xu bihai were exquisite the older one even more than that spring rain was golden and glorious celebrated for it the preferred courtesans in the best houses in the north district were lovely as flowers the students wrote poems for them listened to their singing watched them dance followed them up jade stairs none of these women none of them were what this one was in the brightness of what she offered and she wasnt even dancing now she sat opposite leaning upon cushions gazing at tai appraisingly enormous eyes beneath shaped eyebrows he had seen her from a distance in long lake park at festival ceremonies with the emperor and court in their elevated place on a taming balcony removed from ordinary men and women above them nearer heaven she wasnt removed from him here she was annihilatingly close and they were alone and one small bare higharched foot seemed to be touching the outside of his thigh very lightly as if it had drifted there all unawares tai swallowed hard jian smiled took her time assessing him utterly at ease an entire courtyard of people at an imperial posting station had seen him enter this sedan chair a man could be killed for being alone with the emperors beloved unless that man was a eunuch oran abrupt thoughtwas made into one as an alternative to having his throat cut tai tried to find a safe place to rest his gaze light came gently through silk she said i am pleased you are handsome enough it is better when men are pleasant to look upon dont you agree he said nothing what did you say to this he lowered his head her foot moved against his thigh as if idly a restlessness she curled her toes he felt it desire was within him he worked fiercely to suppress it head down avoiding those eyes he saw that her toenails were painted a deep red almost purple there was nowhere safe to look and with every breath he caught the scent she wore he made himself look up her mouth was full and wide her face heartshaped skin flawless and the silk of her thin blue summer gown patterned in a soft yellow like the curtains was cut low he saw an ivory pendant in the shape of a tiger between the rich curves of her breasts she was twentyone years old from a wellknown family in the south had come to xinan to be married at sixteen to a prince of the imperial family the eighteenth son then the everglorious emperor taizu her husbands father had seen her dance one night in the palace to the music of a flute the story was very well known and the course of her life and the empires course had been altered forever by the time the music and the dancing stopped the pious had declared quietly that what followed was a profanation of marriage and family the eighteenth son accepted a larger mansion another wife and exquisite concubines time passed at court pleasantly there was music in the palace and at mawai and a woman danced for the emperor poets began to write of four great beauties the empress was invited to follow her own clear inclination towards devotion and withdraw to a retreat outside xinan and the palace to enfold her life in prayer tais sister had gone with her he used that quick image of limeibrave and brightto bring him back from what felt truly like intoxication there was he thought no wine in the world like the presence of this woman there might be a poem in that it occurred to him someone had probably written it he said as the chair was lifted and they began to move my lady your servant is too greatly honoured by this she laughed of course you are you wont be killed for being here if you are thinking about that i told the emperor last night i intended to come and bring you myself will you take a lychee i can peel it for you master shen tai we could even share it do you know the most enjoyable way to share lychee fruit she leaned forward as if inclined to show him right then he said nothing he had no words no idea what to say she laughed at him again the eyebrows arched she regarded him another moment nodded her head as if a thought was confirmed you reminded me of your brother when you held your hands up to my steward just now power hidden behind courtesy tai looked at her we are not very like my lady you believe he shows power liu of course he does but carefully said wen jian she smiled you say you are greatly honoured but you are also angry why are you angry with me my lord she didnt have to call him that the foot moved again unmistakably she would use her beauty any mans desire for her as an agency a weapon he told himself her long neck was set off by golden earrings to her shoulders set with pearls the weight of the gold making her seem even more delicate her hair was coiled but falling to one side famously her own invented style the waterfall copied throughout the empire now the hairpins were jewelled variously and he didnt even know the names of all the gems he saw she laid a hand as if carelessly upon his calf he caught his breath she smiled again she was measuring his responses he realized why so angry she asked again in a voice suddenly like a childs grieving at being punished he said carefully one of my soldiers was killed this morning illustrious lady i believe you heard a soldier of the emperor my kanlin guard was wounded and two of your own men and my sardian horse i know it it was uncivilized there was violence in my presence which is never permitted she lifted her hand from his leg i have instructed my understeward to kill himself when we reach mawai tai blinked wasnt sure hed heard correctly you he this morning said the beloved companion did not proceed as i wished it to it made me unhappy her mouth turned downwards you could drown in this woman tai thought and never be found again the emperor was pursuing immortality in the palace men said using alchemists and the school of unrestricted night where they studied the stars and asterisms in the sky for secrets of the world tai suddenly had a better understanding of that desire your brother she said doesnt look like you no said tai she was going to do this he realized change topics make him keep up with her test him that way he advises my cousin she said i know this illustrious lady i dont like him she said tai was silent do you she asked he is my brother tai said he has measuring eyes and he never smiles said wen jian am i going to like you do you laugh he took a breath then answered more seriously than hed thought he would less often since my father died since going to kuala nor but yes your servant used to laugh illustrious lady in the north district i have been told as much you and my cousin appear to have admired the same woman there treacherous ground tai thought and she was doing it deliberately yes he said he has her now yes do you know how much he paid for her no illustrious lady how would he have known a very great sum more than he needed to he was making a declaration about himself i see i have seen her since she is very lovely he considered that pause he said there is no wine in kitai or the world as intoxicating as the lady wen jian the smile that brought him was a gift he could almost believe she was flattered a girl reacting to a wellturned compliment almost she said you never answered about your brother did you clever man you might survive at court they tried to kill you they such a dangerous word he nodded not trusting himself to speak twice he nodded again the palace would have known this several nights ago xu bihai had written the commander at iron gate had sent word she would know what the taming knew twice that i know about he said was it roshan terrifyingly direct this was no girlwoman seduced by a turn of phrase but he could sense apprehension as she waited for his reply there was he thought a reason shed come to speak with him alone this might be it no said tai i am certain it wasnt he persuaded you of that yesterday this had become a precise interrogationamid silk and scent with a bare foot against his thigh he had been certain that a report of yesterdays encounter in the carriage by the road would reach the court but the speed of it made him realize something belatedly shed have had to travel half the night from mawai to be here now he calculated distances quickly shed have left almost as soon as word came of his meeting with an li he didnt know what to make of that he had never been part of the court never even near it he was coming from two years of solitude beyond iron gate he did persuade me illustrious lady you believe what he told you was true i do she sighed he couldnt interpret that it might have been relief what he didnt say yet was that he knew that what roshan had told him was true because hed already known who had tried to kill him in the westspring rain had risked her life so he could know this he was going to need to see her jian said because an li can order men killed without a thought i have no reason to doubt it illustrious lady he chose his words carefully she smiled slightly lips together noting his caution but he still made you believe him tai nodded again yes my lady he didnt know if she wanted him to say more it crossed his mind to consider that this questioning was being done here and in this way by a woman the emperors dancerlove his lateinlife dream of eternity it came to tai that this was a part of why the ninth dynasty might be as precarious as it was dazzling why sima zian had said what hed said yesterday i feel chaos coming this matchless creature across from him lovely as a legend was the cousin of the first minister and the supporter the adopting mother of the man who was his rival and she had the trust and passion of an emperor who wanted to live forever because of her the balance of kitaiof the known worldmight be reclining across from him it was tai thought a great burden to lay upon slender shoulders he sat there the sedan chair moving steadily along the road breathing perfume in an enclosed intimate place removed from the ten thousand noises of the world and he waited for the next question the one that could plunge himall of theminto the chaos zian feared it wasnt roshan who was it then she was going to ask him she never did either she knew already or she was afraid to know or to have it said aloud be brought into the world compelling a response her hand lifted from his calf where it had been resting again she selected a lychee from a bowl beside her peeled it expertly she extended it towards him please said wen jian tai took the ripe slippery fruit from her fingers it tasted like the south and summer like memories of sweetness lost that last he realized was what he was feeling something slipping away almost gone yesterdays encounter by the road and now this one both of them coming to meet him on the way entirely different encounters but also the same at their core power approaching to know what he was going to do needing to know because power always needed thatknowledge was how power preserved itself or tried he had set out from a mountain bowl the battleground his father had never left behind determined to reach xinan to do to do what precisely he had never decided hed been moving too fast kill a man hed told the poet yesterday as an answer for yans death but xin lun was dead already no fault of tais no achievement of his no credit to his name with yans ghost by the lake and lun had only been an instrument what else what else had he been racing here to do straight down the imperial road past the cutoff south that could have taken him home deal with the horses somehow that lifeclaiming gift lifeclaiming the thought reverberated strangely in his mind tai hadnt lived a life where enemies on a murderous scale had played any kind of role but the first minister wanted him dead on a whim most likely because he could wen zhou who was this womans kin holding office because of her he looked at jian across from him she had peeled her own lychee and as he gazed placed it delicately between her front teeth and bit down tai shook his head then smiled he had to smile she was so obviously playing with her own desirability oh good she said she licked her lips glistening with the fruit this will be a tedious journey if you are serious all the time the back and forth of it he thought hard questions ripe fruit bitten a slow tongue tracing wet lips a foot or fingers touching him conjuring desire then the questions would come again in that moment tai arrived at a decision it seemed obvious enough and it had the virtue of simplicity hed only needed to finally grasp something that he could never be subtle enough to match those waiting for him he didnt have time to know enough or gain an awareness of relationships at a level that would let him move with these men and women to their music he wouldnt even hear the notes they heard he wasnt able to probe for what they knew or wanted play the game of words spoken and unspoken with the court and the higher civil servants and even some of the governors in and around the taming palace and the emperor he would be among them today and he couldnt learn that rhythm not in the time he had so he wouldnt even try hed go another way like a holy wanderer of the sacred path choosing at a fork in the road following his own truth a hermit laughing in the mountains tai drew a breath he said i offered the horses to governor an yesterday she stared sat up straighter carefully put down an unpeeled lychee shed just picked from the bowl all of them he nodded but i had a condition and he declined an li rejected two hundred and fifty sardian horses i said they were his if he brought my sister back from the bogu he said he could not do it the horses are yours illustrious lady if you can do this all of them he nodded again she was clearly shaken roshan had been as well i dont is she your lover your sister he could not allow himself to be offended this was the court such thoughts would occur to people he shook his head nothing like that this is to honour my father as much as anything he would never have let my brother do this in our mourning period it was an act of disrespect she was staring as if dazed and the woman in this sedan chair was no simple concubine or dancer however exquisite this was someone who defined the life of the taming now who shaped and balanced it in a dangerous time he was beginning to understand how dangerous since yesterday and the thought hed had of the knife he carried and committing murder in that carriage by the road you are not suggesting it was wrong to give your sister to this marriage and send her north he needed to be careful the son of heaven cannot be wrong no he cannot her voice was emphatic this is a personal request my lady only that you do understand she said her voice controlled now how much you can expect at court as the last hero of kuala nor and brother to a new princess have you considered that the emperor cannot be less generous than the lion of tagur or he is shamed he must give you gifts that exceed those horses from sangrama he hadnt thought about that at all including before this morning the connection to limei how much her elevation meant for him he said as much jian shook her head impatiently her earrings made a jingling sound son of shen gao you are angry with your brother for what he did you are a rival to my cousin for a woman very well do you think their ranks and honours are set in jade reserved to them forever do you think they might be just a little fearful of your coming tais turn to be unsettled i dont know enough to judge such matters i have little experience or guidance sima zians perhaps the woman made a face not the surest counsellor master shen he has never held office and he owes me a sweeter poem than the last he offered perhaps later today tai said if he is permitted to i have other intentions today some people have been summoned to mawai this is too important to go any longer unaddressed what is you are son of shen gao you are too important why do you think i am here because because of the horses a slow smile honey poured to sweeten a drink a hand shining with rings touched his unshod foot where he had kept it carefully against the side of the sedan chair you are permitted to think it is only them but consider what i have said i will be disappointed if you prove unintelligent or lack decisiveness fingernails moved he said a little desperately illustrious lady you do not want the horses ten of them she said promptly if you wish to give me a gift in exchange for company on this road and lychees peeled for you i want to train them to dance i have been told it can be done but what would i do with more than that lead them to war then then surely the emperor i will give the sardians directly to the son of heaven you are anxious to be rid of them arent you no think shen tai our exalted emperor is not permitted to be indebted to any of his subjects his is the duty of supreme generosity hed have to return more than you gave him or be shamed in the eyes of the world you control more of these horses than kitai has received at any one time ever the son of heaven must honour you as soon as you arrive and if you also give him the horses tai suddenly wished hed taken that turnoff south that he were riding home along a road he knew not all men surely needed to be part of the ten thousand noises the swirling dust the palace struggles the guiding of the world he closed his eyes not the wisest thing to do her foot moved immediately as if shed been waiting for that the toes flexed against his thigh if she chose to move just a little more tai opened his eyes quickly have you ever made love in a sedan chair wen jian asked guilelessly those enormous eyes met his from under perfect painted eyebrows it can be done she moved her foot tai made a small involuntary sound directness he had decided upon that he said my lady you are making my heart pound my mouth is dry with desire i know you are toying with me like a cat and i wish only to honour you and the emperor that smile again you know i am doing this this toying do you he nodded his head too rapidly and that is my only purpose you have decided he stared at her couldnt speak poor man would a lychee help at all that dryness tai laughed he couldnt help it her expression was mischief incarnate a moment ago shed been crisply explaining affairs of the empire and the world now she was enjoying her beauty and the power it gave her she took and peeled another fruit without waiting for his answer she extended it her fingers touched his she said quietly i told you the emperor may he live eternally and in joy knows i am here knows you are with me he will ask me at mawai if you were respectful and i will tell him you were because indeed you are does this make you feel easier he was doing a lot of nodding or shaking of his head he nodded again she said i have arranged that compensation will be paid to the family of your soldier my understeward has been instructed to do this before he attends to his own affairs and ends his life hed forgotten about that tai cleared his throat may i ask gracious lady that the steward be permitted to live wujen ning my soldier and my kanlin will both have been aggressive in defence of me and of the horse the eyebrows arched again you may ask i am disinclined however this morning was incorrectly undertaken it reflects badly upon me and the throne she selected another lychee in a short while we will reach a waiting carriage and your horse and companions you will ride to mawai escorting me i like this chair but not for longer journeys do you like it again he nodded then said illustrious lady i think i would like being anywhere you are that unhurried smile genuine pleasure it seemed though he truly couldnt be sure a smoothenough tongue shen tai as i said you might survive in the palace will you help me he asked he hadnt known he was going to say that her expression changed she looked at him i dont know said wen jian a short time later they halted at a place wherewhen the yellow silk curtain was pulled backhe saw that a carriage was indeed waiting this one too had kingfisher feathers beside it on the road not the imperial road now they had turned off northeast tai saw zian and song and his soldiers on their horses and the restless magnificent figure of dynlal he gave his horse a lychee by way of apology and mounted up no great speed now they were escorting a carriage a west wind blew there was birdsong as the sun climbed they saw green hills ahead of them they rode that way these were the forested slopes where the most extravagant country estates of xinans aristocracy were to be found the five tombs district it was called near the burial place of the last emperor and his ancestors and the vastly larger tomb the emperor taizu might he live another thousand years was building for himself just before they reached the first foothills they passed a large postal station inn on this northeastsouthwest road then they came to a small lake surrounded by trees a place celebrated for hot springs and healing waters on the western side of the lake were a silk farm and a kanlin retreat on the other shore lay mawai chapter xvi limei has lost track of how long theyve been riding five nights the landscape is unvarying remorseless the approach of summer has made the grass very tall and there are few paths or tracks time blurs she doesnt like it she has lived her life anticipating possibilities knowing what is happening where she is going shaping where she is going to whatever degree she can she is much like her oldest brother in this but would not happily acknowledge that she knows how to ride was taught as a child because her father thought it important even for a girl but this much time on a horse day after day is hard for her and meshag is not inclined to rest very often she is in pain at the end of each day and then weary through the next mornings riding because nights sleeping under stars are cold and not restful shed hoped this discomfort would pass she says nothing about it but is aware that he knows she has a sense they are travelling more slowly than he wants to because of her shes tried to shorten their rest times herself being the first to stand up but meshag has simply ignored her when she does this he will only move when he is ready to move or decides that she is more likely but hed said back in the cave another world where she killed a man that his brother would follow them with shamans and it is clear to her that whatever meshag son of hurok has become whatever dark link he might have to wolves and the wild and spirits he doesnt want the shamans catching them surely for her sake possibly for his own hes avoided his people hasnt he stayed clear of his brother all these years since her brother saved his life maybe saved his life but now for herfor shen limei a woman from kitaihes approached the bogu again stolen her away and they are being pursued so he has told her limei has no way of knowing the truth it leaves her uneasy even angry she asked him some time ago why they hadnt already been caught since they werent travelling at great speed they have to find us he said have other princess to carry north they do not know which way we travel he had to wait for a shaman a long answer for him she has only the barest idea of where they are they have been riding east these are shuoki lands but if she remembers rightly they move north as the weather warms the shuoki are enemies of the bogu there are kitan garrison forts somewhere in this direction northern outposts the long wall is south of them of course she doesnt know how far but it will be rising and falling with the land like some serpent heading to meet the sea ahead of them will be nothing but grassland if the shuoki are indeed north the bogu do not graze their herds this far east and they are nowhere near the koreini peninsula he is taking her into emptiness it has been two days since any sign of human lifemorning smoke by a distant lake meshag had decided not to go that way for water though theyd been rationing theirs by that point hed found a small pool towards evening they camped there the wolves on guard so she does have some notion of time after all she tells herself a pool of water two nights ago a slight rise in the land last night in the open no real shelter since the cave with the horses on the walls they have made no fires of their own at night he hasnt touched her except to help her on her horse she has thought about that has thought about it a great deal shed expected to have been taken physically by now has been preparing for it from the time she waited in the yurt in darkness she is a woman alone with a man in an expanse of empty landcertain events usually follow upon that meshag is too different however in visible unsettling ways she doesnt know what to think any more she has never made love to a man has only played with the other girls at court giggling or whispering explorations to little import some of the others have done morewith each other with courtiers or one of the princes in the tamingbut limei has not the empress even when they were still in the palace was devout and demanding her women were expected to observe rules of wellbred conduct which were clear on this matter once the emperors named heir prince shinzu a special case of course had come to stand behind limei during a musical performance in the mintan the hall of light as the musicians played and the dancers began she had felt sweetened breath on her neck then a hand brushing her lower back through silk gliding down back up down again shinzu was regarded as vividly irresponsible charming rarely sober there were endless rumours as to how long hed remain heir or even why he was taizus chosen successor among so many sons she remembers that day extremely well remembers standing eyes forward towards the dancers not moving at all breathing carefully suspended between outrage and excitement and helplessness as he touched her from behind unseen he hadnt done anything more hadnt even spoken with limei afterwards then or at any other time before she went away from the palace with the empress into exile with a murmured phrase she hadnt even heard the words clearly hed moved on when the music ended shed seen him talking to another lady of the court after laughing another wine cup in his hand the woman was laughing too limei could recall ambivalent feelings seeing that she has never considered herself the sort of beauty to drive a man to excesses of desire or recklessness nor even was she the kind of woman who normally elicited even transitory attention on an autumn afternoon in the hall of light had her father been alive shed be married by now undoubtedly and would know much more about this aspect of the world men and women shes been ready to learn for a while were shen gao still living his daughter would not now be alone with a barbarian rider and wolves among the grasslands of the north meshag sleeps a little apart from her the wolves take stations like sentinels in a wide circle around them the stars have been more dazzling each night as the moon wanes she sees the weaver maid set each evening then the sky river appear overhead as darkness deepens and then the lost mortal lover rising east on the far side of the river she is never easy about the wolves still tries not to look at them but they arent going to harm her she knows now because of meshag every day he has ridden away before sunrise mist rising from the grass hes made her keep riding alone heading into the sun as soon as it is up and the mist has burned away the wolves guide her guard her she still hates them you couldnt change a lifetimes thinking and feeling and fear in a few days could you each time meshag has caught up with them before midday with food he is hunting in the hunters time before dawn he even brings firewood kindling on his back he tramples grass shapes a space builds low careful daytime fires they eat rabbits or marmots most recentlytodayskinned and cooked a whittled stick through them he gives her some kind of fruit to peel she doesnt know the name of it it is bitter but she eats it drinks water washes her face and hands always more symbol than anything else she is kitan and her fathers daughter stands and stretches does it before meshag does they ride on the sun overhead clouds no clouds the days mild evenings chilly the nights cold the plain stretches all directions unlike anything shes ever known the grass so high nearly hiding them even on horseback as they go it does conceal the wolves she can just about forget that they are there she can almost imagine they will ride like this forever in silence through tall grass with wolves nothing is forever not since the world changed after the war in heaven late that same day the sun behind them limei is weary trying to hide it glad meshag rides in front and seldom looks back he leaves it to the lead wolf to be sure she is keeping up she has been reciting poetry not with any theme or coherence only to distract herself keep herself riding until he calls a halt then he does halt too sharply she hasnt been paying attention almost bumps his mount with hers she pulls up quickly twitches her reins comes around beside him he is looking at the sky a few clouds ahead of them some to the north pink and yellow in the light of the low long sun no sign of rain any kind of storm the wind is easy it isnt anything like that she sees a swan sees that this is what he is watching his face has become very still it is just a bird she wants to say but she has been among strangeness long enough now to know that he would not be looking up like this looking like this if it were simply a bird flying by she sees him draw the short thick bogu bow from his saddle he hadnt had a bow when hed come for her hed taken this one when he stole the horse limei moves her own mount away to give him room the swan is flying south towards them it is springtime even she knows a swan should not be flying south in spring it is alone perhaps lost having wandered in the high roads of the sky she doesnt really think that not when she looks at the man beside her arrow now to bowstring the bow lifted it is a very long shot she has time to think she hears the arrows release red song of war arrows red sun there are so many poems about bowsongs and war in kitai back a thousand years to the first shaping of the empire meshag has not looked awkward or rigid she realizes not claiming his bow fitting the arrow letting it fly the swan falls out of the sky so white against the colours of the clouds and the blue it disappears into the grass she sees two wolves go after it swift avid there is silence why she asks finally he is looking back west sky and grass he puts the bow away he has found me he says ill chance she hesitates your brother he nods the wind moves his hair the a swan was searching he nods his head again absently this time it is clear that he is thinking devising he says now when shamans will call it there is no answer they know direction each bird was sent will know i killed it she is afraid again it is the strangeness of all things that frightens her most you killed a bird in the sky just as you killed rabbits or marmots in morning mist and that meant couldnt it have been hunted for food by someone else he looks at her the black eyes bogu never kill swans oh she says he continues to gaze at her a longer look than any she can remember his eyes take in light and swallow it he says my brother would hurt you she has not expected this hurt me he is like that she thinks a moment some men are too in kitai he seems to be working with a thought he says when i was i was not like him when i was when he was a man she doesnt want to go towards that it is dark in that direction she says to fill silence not really needing an answer why would he hurt me a kitan princess bringing him glory he moves a shoulder the awkward shrug far too many questions you are always asking not proper for women she looks away then back then i need to thank you again and be grateful i am not going to him dont i will they catch us now where are we riding what have you decided to do they are a test of sorts these swift immediate inquiries she is the way she is she sees the expression she has decided to call a smile there are ways of beating back fear strangeness the sense of being profoundly lost in the world they have ridden until darkness has almost gathered the land eating cold meat in the saddle and the remains of the fruit the waning moon has set limei in real discomfort has continued to remain silent about it they will be pursued now he is trying to save her this is no springtime ride in the deer park to see animals feeding or drinking at twilight he brings her to water again she isnt certain how this far from bogu lands it is the wolves she decides he tells her they can rest only a short while that she is to sleep right away they will ride in darkness now will do this every night but then after staring towards her in the almostlost gloaming his features difficult to see he orders her to lie face down on the short grass by the pond she obeys now it begins she thinks her heart beginning to race against her will how does one control a heartbeat but she is wrong again he comes to her yes but not in need or hunger he kneels beside her and begins to work the muscles of her back his fingers mingling pain with the easing of pain when she tenses wincing he slaps her lightly the way you might slap a restive horse she tries to decide if shes offended then makes herself settle into his hands she is going to be riding again soon this is no time or place to carry pride what can offended mean here his movements remain stiff but very strong she cries out once apologizes he says nothing she wonders abruptlyperhaps an illuminationif his physical restraint this indifference to her being a woman is caused by what happened to him those years ago could it be he has been rendered incapable of desire or the accomplishment of it she knows so little about this but it is possible surely and it would explain then at one point as his hands slow and then slow again and linger near her hips she becomes aware that his breathing has changed she cannot see anything by then is face down in the grass can only be aware of him as a presence touching her and though shen limei only daughter of an honourable house has never shared a bed or couch with any man or explored very far along even the first pathways of lovemaking she knowswith instinctive certaintythat this man is not indifferent to her as a woman in the dark with him and alone which means if he is holding himself back it is not because he cannot feel and in that moment she understands another part of what is happening now and since he came for her between the campfires back west she closes her eyes draws her own slow breath his is in truth a gesture from a largeness of spirit shes not been prepared for these are barbarians everyone living outside the borders of kitai is a barbarian you didnt expect grace from them you couldnt could you she listens to his breathing feels his touch through her clothing they are alone in the world the weaver maid alone as well is shining in the west limei realizes that her heartbeat has steadied after all though she is aware of something new within herself she thinks she understands more now it calms her it always has it makes such a difference and shandai was after all the first word hed spoken to her the name she says softly thank you i think i will sleep now you will wake me when it is time to ride she shifts position onto her side and then up on her knees he stands she looks up at him against the stars she cannot see his eyes the wolves are invisible she knows they are not far still on her knees she bows to him her hands touching the earth she says i thank you for many things son of hurok for my unworthy self in my fathers name and in the name of my brother shen tai whom you are honouring by in the way you guard me she does not say more some things cannot be made explicit even in the dark night breeze he says nothing but she sees him nod his head once he walks off not far but far enough nearer the horses limei lies down again closes her eyes she feels the wind hears animal sounds in the grass and from the waters of the pond she becomes aware with surprise that she is crying for the first time since the cave eventually she sleeps spring rain has not thought of herself by the name her mother gave her since she left sardia years ago she had come to kitai as part of a small company of musicians and dancers sent as tribute to taizu the son of heaven the sardians were a careful people offering annual gifts to kitai and tagur and even to the emerging powers west of them when your small homeland lay in a fertile valley between mountains that was what you needed to do sometimes not always it sufficed she wasnt enslaved and she wasnt abducted but she hadnt had a great deal of choice in the matter you woke up one morning and were told by the leader of your troupe that you were leaving your home forever shed been fifteen years old singled out for her appearance already and for skill in singing and on the pipa all twentyeight tunings of it in the kitan fashion which may have been why she was chosen she remained with that troupe for two years in xinan all twelve of them coming to terms with the fact that the great and glorious emperor had twenty thousand musicians they all lived in a vast ward east of the palaceit was like a city in itself larger than any in sardia in two years they had been summoned to play three times twice for minor court weddings once at a banquet to welcome southern emissaries on neither occasion was the son of heaven present you might be greeneyed and yellowhaired lovely and lithe and genuinely skilled in music and still see your life disappearing down the years you could be invisible and unheard among the taming palace entertainers to the court perhaps but not to those on watch for a particular sort of woman rain had been noticed at that second wedding apparently shed been seventeen by then it was time to begin achieving something shed thought a life if nothing else she accepted an invitation to enter the pleasure district and be trained in one of the best houses theretrained in many things and on terms that were she knew by then having paid attention better than most girls received green eyes and yellow hair made a difference after all her ability to leave the musicians district was a matter of bribing the eunuchs who controlled the taming entertainers it happened all the time she was to become a courtesan and was under no illusions about what that meant she was taught to be a mistress of the table the highest rank among the pleasure district women they were the ones hired to perform at banquets by aristocrats or high mandarins to perform also more privately and in other ways after the feasting had ended and when there were no wealthy courtiers on a given evening or afternoon in the pavilion of moonlight there were always the students studying for the examinationsor not actually studying not if they were in the north district but aspiring to the rank that would come with passing the exams spring rain tended to like the students more than the courtiers which wasnt the cleverest way for a girl to be but their enthusiasms their dreaming spoke to something in her that the extravagance and hauteur of taming aristocrats didnt touchand they made her laugh sometimes the palace guests gave better gifts it was a lifewhile a woman was young at any rate a better life most likelythough no one could ever say this for certainthan shed have had back home xinan under emperor taizu was the centre of the world she did sometimes wonder if the centre of the world was always the best place to be she can remember the moment years before as theyd passed through jade gate fortress into kitai when shed made the decision to leave her name behind the girl born to that name was gone shed decided she was almost certainly never coming backto home family the view of the mountains north of them range upon range to heaven the girl travelling east would leave her name with her memories at fifteen it had felt like a way to go forward to survive but if her birth name is long since gone that does not mean she must accept in her mind the one wen zhou has chosen for her as if selecting among fabrics or polo horses she answers in the compound to lin chang because she must and does so smiling effortlessly gracious but that is as far as she will go the surface of a lake he cannot see what she is thinking or feeling she has a talent for deceiving men by now shes had time to learn it is a skill like any other a woman can teach herself music conversation lovemaking simulating yearning and the tumult of desire she ought to be more grateful she tells herself many times a day or lying at night alone or beside him hers is a destiny thanks to zhou that marks like a banner the highest summit of the dreams of every courtesan in the north district he is the second most powerful man in the empirewhich means in the world really she lives in a vast compound with servants at her whim and call she entertains his guests with music or witty talk watches him play polo in the deer park shares his pillow many nights she knows his moods some of his fears she wears silks of the finest weaving and jewellery that sets off her eyes or dazzles by lamplight at her ears in her golden hair he can dismiss her at any moment of course cast her out with or without any resources to survivethat too happens all the time to concubines when they age when skilful use of masicot onycha indigo sticks for beauty marks sweet basil plucked eyebrows and painted ones powder and perfume and exquisitely adorned hair are no longer enough to sustain necessary beauty it is her task to ensure that he has no cause to send her from his presence now or when that day comes when the mirror of mens eyes tells a darker tale in which case she has not been acting prudently at all kanlin warriors hired secretly listening on porticoes she has been distracted and disturbed the last few days is afraid that it might show there are other eyes besides his in this compound his wife is famously inattentive to the women her gaze turned towards the heavens and alchemical mysteries but the other concubines are not her friends and each of the important ones has servants devoted to her a household like this can be a battleground there are poets who have seen this lived it written of it events seem to be moving faster now late this morning a messenger came from mawai wen zhou and his wife left the compound by carriage not long after zhou was swearing flushed and angry through the flurry of preparations his cousin had evidently requested their presence for the afternoon and evening short of the absolute dictates of warfare or crisis this is not an invitation that may be declined even by the prime minister he holds office because of her after all a case could be made and she knows zhou wishes he could do it that they are in a time of crisis but the growing tensions with roshan are not the sort of matter he can use as an excuse to offer his regrets to jian not until hes ready to reveal this raise it with the emperor and rain knows he isnt not yet there are too many dangers and they need working through he has already sent word to his principal adviser liu will follow to mawai in his own carriage zhou always wants him nearby when there is any likelihood they might see the emperor and in mawai there is a good chance the first minister is increasingly dependent on liu everyone in the compound knows it what rain does not yet know though she has done her best to find out is whether liu was privy to or even the agent of certain instructions given with respect to a man coming back now it seems from the far west having escaped attempts upon his life escaped them possibly because of her that of course is how shes been most reckless zhou would kill her and she knows it at least one man in xinan has already died in this affair in the past few days xin lun after word of tais journeying had come lun was killed to preserve a secret if tai chooses to reveal it the prime minister will be exposed shes made her peace with that any loyalty to the man who brought her here stops short of this attempted assassination a woman as much as a man is surely allowed her own sense of right conduct in the world no her real fear right now is of herself word has come by courier from chenyao that was days ago travelling at any normal speed a horseman from that city could be here tomorrow or even tonight and tai is riding if the tale is to be believed a sardian steed a heavenly horse from her home rain is too selfpossessed too controlled always has been to attach meaning or weight to that last nor is she a poet as some of the courtesans are she sings the songs others have written but still sardian horses and he is alive very nearly here after two years the morning passes a midday meal a rest in her rooms a walk in the gardens by the bamboo grove time crawls at a pace that kills it occurs to her sitting on a stone bench by the artificial lake shaded from the sun by sandalwood leaves that if zhou has been summoned to mawai for this afternoon and a banquet after he will not be home tonight it is just about then that the second messenger arrives the household steward stalks into the garden to find mistress lin she doesnt think he likes her but he doesnt like anyone so it isnt significant it seems there is another message from mawai this one sent to her that has never happened before she wonders if shes being summoned to play for them but no it would be too late by now and there is hardly a deficiency of performers at mawai the courier is escorted through the sequence of public rooms and courtyards back through the garden preceded by the steward and a warning to her that someone is comingso that she can be properly seated and composed on one of the benches she is or presents herself as such the courier bows she is after all the newly favoured concubine of first minister wen there can be power in that for women he hands her a scroll she opens it breaking the seal this message is also from wen jian the precious consort it is very short do not retire early tonight unless you are excessively fatigued not all windows above jade stairs need be seen through tears the second line is derived from a celebrated poem about a woman left alone too long jian has changed three words you can imagine her smiling as she wrote or dictated that actually that isnt quite true it is difficult to imagine that woman she eludes too easily and frightens because of that you can begin to feel your own heartbeat going too fast however as you consider those words on the scroll dismiss the courier with a grave expression give instructions that he be offered food and drink before starting back to mawai for one thing how does wen jian even know of her existence for another why would she be disposed to assist rain in anything if indeed she is doing that if this is not some trap or test rain feels like a child overwhelmed by complexities the steward leads the courier past pagoda trees her maidservant lingers ready if called rain sits alone looks across the water at the island hed had made in the lake hed had made the light breeze ruffles leaves overhead touches her skin and hair shed liked amber and apricots and music very young horses a little later but only to look at them theyd frightened her her eyes had drawn attention very young her mother had named her saira when she was born a sweet name left behind many years ago chapter xvii i should like said wen jian to be entertained cousin will you offer a poem for me her cousin the first minister smiled he was as tai remembered him in the north district or glimpsed in long lake park a big man handsome and aware of it he wore blue silk with dragons in silver there was a lapis lazuli ring on his left hand a breeze entered through unshuttered windows rippling pennons outside it was late afternoon they were in mawai where the hot springs had eased imperial weariness for centuries and where the decadent games of various courts had been notorious for as long just north of here not far away were the tombs of the ninth dynasty poets had written of this conjunction of symbols though doing so carried risks and one needed to use care tai wasnt feeling careful just now which was unwise and he knew it he was tense as a drawn bowstring wen zhou was here and tais brother was here they didnt know he was in the room jian amusing herself or perhaps not so had arranged for tai to enter before her guests and to seat himself on an ivory bench behind one of two painted room screens cranes flying a wide river mountains rising the tiny figure of a fisherman in his boat he hadnt wanted to do this it felt too passive acquiescent but he didnt know on the other hand what he did want here he had arrived this was the court he had decisions to make alignments to choose or reject it would also be useful he thought wryly to remain alive one person here had been trying to kill him at least one person for the moment he would accede to what the beloved companion wished of him he could start that way at least jians women had bathed him when their party arrived and washed his hair gravely with propriety no hint of rumoured immorality after in a chamber overlooking the lake they had laid out silks more fine than any hed ever worn in his life liao silk compared to ordinary weaving once in a poem as what a glistening waterfall was to a muddy stream dried out in summer heat he remembered that image as he dressed his robe was a shimmering textured flicker of greens the colours of a bamboo grove in changing light his slippers and belt and soft hat were black with paleyellow dragons on them his hatpin had an emerald two women had led him silently hands in full sleeves eyes downcast along corridors of marble and jade then across a courtyard and down more corridors to the chamber where wen jian evidently purposed to receive certain guests tai had not seen her since theyd arrived she had told him in the sedan chair that she had a plan for this afternoon he had no notion of what this might be or of his own role in it at kuala nor each night watching the stars set and rise or the moon hed known his task at every moment what he was there to do here he was one of many dancers and he didnt know the dance he wished zian were with him wei song hed released for the afternoon to report to her own kanlin sanctuary farther along the shore it had crossed his mind that now that theyd arrived her duties her employment could be considered over hed felt oddly exposed when shed bowed and gone away the poet was somewhere in mawai hed been a guest here before they hadnt had a chance to speak before being led in different directions zian was almost certainly sampling some celebrated wine tai wondered if the women were as proper with the banished immortal as they had been with him his two escorts had led him into this audience chamber showed him the room screens the paintings were by wang shao and the low seat behind one of them theyd invited him prettily to sit he could have refused but he didnt know what hed achieve by doing so it seemed wisest for the moment to see what jian was doing what she was playing atif it was a game he discovered he could see quite well through tiny holes in the screen he hadnt noticed them from the painted side he was entirely certain the viewing holes his ability to observe the room unseen were not accidental the ceiling he saw looking up in wonder was of beaten gold there were lotus flowers and cranes worked upon it the walls were sandalwood the floor was marble jian smiled at his screen when she walked in with her stewarda different man from the one this morning the one this morning was probably dead by now it was not tai thought the smile shed offered when they were alone on the road hed asked just before getting out to ride dynlal the rest of the way if shed help him here at court i dont know she had said this wasnt about helping him he decided he might be wrong but it didnt feel that way he felt cowardly sitting here he wanted to confront wen zhou and his brother he had a quick clean image of drawing swords with them liu was hopeless with a blade zhou was likely a match for tai or more than that it was an idle thought no weapons were allowed here hed been made to surrender his when they arrived seen through the screen jian looked very different cooler more serene with a gravity that had not existed could not exist while she reclined in a perfumed sedan chair peeling lychees curving a bare foot against his thigh she was in green as well with imperial phoenixes in the same pale yellow as his own dragons he wondered if that meant something her hair was as before the widely imitated sideslipping style it could do things to a man looking at her there was a small discreet door behind him he could get up right now and walk outif the door wasnt barred he wondered if it was he wondered if there was a door behind the other painted screen set diagonally to this one against the same wall the two of them framing a space for wen jian and her friends at mawai in springtime he stopped wondering about such things when jian seated herself on a platform in the centre of the chamber accepted a cup from the steward and gestured for her guests to be admitted tall doors opened a number of men came in no women jian was the only woman in the room even the servants pouring wine into jade cups were men there were no musicians among the arrivals was sima zian a surprise the poet was properly dressed and groomed with a dark hat and his hair neatly pinned his expression was alert amused as ever tai registered this but didnt look at him for long his attention was pulled away not to the first minister though wen zhou had also entered the room hidden silent afraid and fighting anger tai looked at his older brother for the first time in two years liu had gained weight it showed in his face but he was otherwise unchanged smaller than tai softer in a mandarins rich sober black silk with the darkred belt of highest rank and symbolic key at his waist he entered discreetly bowed formally took a place behind wen zhou a little to one side tai was staring at him he couldnt stop fear and fury he recognized another of those who entered the imperial heir another surprise if jian intended anything serious today prince shinzu was notorious for sensuous luxury though seldom seen in the city and never in the north district women were brought to him he didnt go to them he was an even bigger man than the first minister affecting a short beard but wider than the mandarin fashion he already carried a cup of wine tai saw scanning the room from a position he took near an open window the prince smiled at zian who bowed and smiled cheerfully back jian waited until her guests had wine then spoke her first words to her cousin inviting a poem entertainment from behind his screen tai saw zhou offer his confident lazy smile we retain people to offer poetry cousin you ask the one man here whose effort would surely not amuse you but surely he will make an effort if only to please me tai could hear the sly smile in her words i love you too much for that said zhou one man laughed appreciatively tai couldnt see who it was wen zhou added and we seem to have for some reason or other a poet among us let him divert you cousin is he here for any other purpose a fair question the poet had left the city under one of his usual clouds and it had to do with jian and a poem the banished immortal as in heaven so on earth that was the way the stories ran jian only smiled she had tai was realizing more than a dozen ways of smiling this one was closer to the cat with a mouse hed sensed in the sedan chair it occurred to him that she wasnt really pursuing amusement here he wondered if zhou knew that yet he shivered suddenly wasnt sure why in the tales his nursemaid used to tell you shivered that way when someone was walking across the ground where your grave would one day lie if you never shivered so she used to say you were doomed to die in water or lie unburied his brother knew those same stories from the same source liu knew the same orchard fruits the same treeswing in the farthest garden stream for fishing or swimming paulownia leaves on the path all at once in autumn the same teachers sunsets birds returning at winters end the same lightningriven summer storms of childhood in a room theyd shared listening for thunder i am afraid to have master sima offer any lines after the last ones he gave us in the taming said the precious consort a poem about an ancient emperor and his beloved she looked at the poet and did not smile it is a grief to my soul and will last all my days if anything your servant has ever written brings you or the son of heaven other than pleasure sima zian said earnestly well said the prime minister grinning a number of them have failed to bring me pleasure i can tell you that another laugh from someone probably the same person zian looked at him he bowed again some griefs he murmured we learn to expect in life it was jian who laughed this time she clapped her hands cousin cousin she cried never play at words with a poet dont you know that wen zhou flushed tai was fighting an impulse to grin id have thought a disgraced poet without rank or office would be the one who needed to be careful the first minister said coldly tai looked instinctively to his brother he had spent a good deal of his childhood looking at liu trying to read what he might be thinking lius face was impassive but his watchful eyes went from the woman to the poet then quickly to the man whounexpectedlybroke the ensuing silence there are many ways of measuring rank as the cho master has taught said prince shinzu quietly on the matter of taking care as it happens i have a question of my own for the first minister though i fear to interrupt our dear jians pleasures you of all men need never fear doing so said wen jian prettily tai had no idea how to interpret that or the manner of the prince leaning against the wall by a window a cup held so casually it almost spilled its wine shinzus voice was more crisp than tai had expected hed never actually heard the heir speak he only knew the tales i am of course at your service illustrious lord wen zhou bowed he had to of course tai didnt think it pleased him already from his place of concealment he was exhausted trying to trace the lines of connection and tension here read surface meaning let alone what lay beneath i am grateful said the prince he sipped his wine gestured to a servant waited for the cup to be refilled the room waited with him when the servant had withdrawn shinzu leaned back again at ease he looked at wen zhou what have you been doing with an li he asked behind his screen tai found himself breathing carefully my lord you invite a discussion of state policy here zhou looked pointedly at the poet and then at two or three other men in the room i do said shinzu calmly among other things i would like to know what state policy is in this matter there was another silence did the emperors heir have the right to demand this of a prime minister tai had no idea cousin began zhou turning to the woman in the room surely a pleasant springtime gathering is not in truth jian interrupted gently enough i admit i should like to know as well about an li after all she favoured the room with an exquisite smile he is my adopted child a mother always has concerns you know everlastingly the silence this time was almost painful zhou looked back over his shoulder at liu tais brother stepped forward a little only a little he bowed to jian then to the prince my lord prince illustrious lady it is our understanding that governor an has left the capital which was true and tai happened to know it but wasnt an answer to anything he did said shinzu promptly three days ago in the evening and his eldest son left before that added jian she wasnt smiling now an rong rode northeast with a small company on good horses roshan went west however said liu his brother was shifting them away from whatever questions the prince had tai realized not successfully we know that said the prince he met with your brother on the road to chenyao tai stopped breathing with my brother said liu he looked shaken and this would not be an act liu was skilled at hiding feelings not simulating them with shen tai said the first minister in the same moment why did he do that id imagine it was regarding the sardian horses said shinzu carelessly but that isnt what i wish to discuss it should be snapped the prime minister roshan is obviously he is obviously interested in their disposition he is commander of the imperial stables among other offices it is his duty to be interested is it not the prince shifted himself off the wall no my question is for you first ministerand your adviser of course since he seems well informed why pray tell me have you been engaged in actions designed to drive him from the city or worse tai swallowed hard made himself breathe again carefully the son of heaven did invite him here cousin we all know that jian shook her head i even asked for him myself he amuses me so whenever he comes to court it was only in that moment that tai realized that she and the prince were working together and it was not spontaneous at all drive him from the city wen zhou repeated how could i do that the prince sipped his wine by planting stories in the taming and the mandarin courtyards as to his intentions and doing so while he was in xinan away from his soldiers and feeling vulnerable because of it there was nothing idle about the room now tai saw two or three of those present begin to back away as if removing themselves from a combat sima zians wideset eyes went from one speaker to another avidly absorbing it all like light sometimes said tais brother softly my lord prince sometimes the stories being told can be true shinzu looked at him they can but there are ways of dealing with a man as powerful as an li these do not include making him feel as if his back is to a stone wall or that he faces ruin at the hands of a first minister ruin not from me said zhou regaining his composure i am no more than a servant of the empire it would be our glorious emperor may he live forever who decreed anything at all in that case said the prince in a voice delicate as silk might it not have been wisest to advise the glorious emperor and others perhaps as to your intentions this is he added a game so deeply perilous minister wen it beggars description hardly a game my lord said wen zhou i believe i will disagree with you said the prince there was nothing remotely indolent or drunken about him tai thought what was this moment what was happening here he saw the prince set down his wine on a lacquered table shinzu added this feels i am sorry to say to be about two men and power not the empire or the emperor may he rule another thousand years i am distressed to hear you say so zhou murmured im certain you are agreed the prince my father was as well he said it quietly you you spoke of this with the emperor zhou had flushed again yesterday morning in the pagoda tree garden here my lord prince if i may it was tais brother we are confused please enlighten us all you say there are ways of dealing with roshan that suggests you agree he needs to be dealt with if your servant may be so bold the first minister and all of us who labour unworthily to assist him in his heavy tasks will be grateful for guidance how does one address the danger general an represents for kitai and this dynasty there was nothing nothing tai thought of the amusing here now the prince taizus heir said speaking as quietly as liu by giving him honour and power by summoning him here to be given more honours and more powerwhich is what the precious consort and my exalted father have been doing offering him banquet after banquet in the taming or here at mawaiand then watching him die of the sugar sickness which he is doing in any case wen zhou opened his mouth shinzu held up a hand and after the great and glorious an li has lamentably gone to join his ancestors by giving him the most sumptuous funeral any barbarian military leader has ever had in the long history of kitai he paused the room was riveted and then by bringing his eldest son into the palace to whatever forms and variations of luxury appeal to him most making that son a supreme officer of the palace army or leader of the hundred horsemen or both and doing the same thing for the younger sons keeping them all here for life giving them every woman in xinan their fancy might turn towards every horse they wish to ride giving mansions and jade and country homes endless wine and finer clothing than they have ever wornwhile three new governors take control of the armies and districts in the northeast he looked at zhou that is what you do first minister wen if you are thinking about the empire and not a private war between two men who hate and fear each other private wars wen zhou can become more than that a silence no man rushed to fill it every woman said jian a hand to her breast oh dear prince shinzu laughed aloud tai realized hed been forgetting to breathe again he resumed as silently as he could it is not my lord prince so simple as that said wen zhou strongly not when the man in question ill as he might or might not be remains ambitious beyond words nothing at court is simple said jian before the prince could speak you are tasked cousin with guiding an empire an li is one of those charged with expanding and defending it if you spend your days and nights circling each other like fighting cocks with metal claws what happens to kitai do we just watch and place wagers from his place of hiding tai could not help but ask in the silence of his mind and where is the emperor in all of this is it not his task to resolve such matters for his people under heaven then something occurred to him and he caught his breath again fighting cocks wen zhou repeated head high shinzu nodded a good description who shall be lord of the battle ring vanquish the other whatever the cost minister wen with the burdens that lie upon you great privileges also come this was true of chin hai before you he waswe all know ita potent fearsome man roshan has chosen to test you in your first year can anyone be surprised military leaders exploring the strength and will of the taming palace how do you think you have responded first minister of my father wen zhous voice was firm i have warned the exalted emperor repeatedly i warned the censorate the treasury and the ministers including those supervising the army i warned my lovely cousin had you expressed the least interest in these affairs before today my lord prince i would have warned you you are my lord being unjust cousin i have spoken to all of you about roshan but he said jian smiling gently also warned us about you where does that leave the son of heaven cousin he an li has spoken to you about me you think him a fool cousin of course not hed not be a danger if he was that is not always so said the prince folly can be dangerous tai was being forced moment by moment word by word to change everything hed ever thought he knew about shinzu cousin said jian until lately the danger has seemed to be from each of you to the other not to the empire but if kitai is placed in peril because two men hate each other she left the thought unfinished you arrested two of his advisers this spring for consulting astrologers the princes eyebrows were level tais brother said quickly the inquiry established it was true my lord prince did the inquiry also establish it mattered very much the prince said just as swiftly or was this simply provocation do tell me adviser to the first minister zhou lifted a hand a small enough gesture to forestall lius reply wen zhou bowed then to the prince to jian with dignity he said it is possible i have erred no servant of the emperor should regard himself as infallible i desire only to serve kitai and the throne to the best of my abilities i am prepared to be counselled good said jian indeed good said shinzu and surely no more need be said about this on a lovely afternoon in mawai but before we turn to our diversions will you tell me first minister where i may find one of your guards feng is his name i am told what said zhou the honourable the prince is asking after one of my household i am said the prince affably he had reclaimed his wine cup he held it out to be refilled i sent some of my own men to your compound to bring him to the taming he appears to have left xinan where might the fellow be tai looked at his brother instinct again lius face showed perplexity whatever this was about liu didnt know it wen zhou said my guardsman you want to speak with one of my guards i did say that the prince murmured i also said he seems to have disappeared not at all said zhou hes been sent to my family my parents are at greater risk with all these instabilities and i thought they should have an experienced guard supervising their household retainers instabilities the prince repeated so hell be there now still on his way he departed only a few days ago actually no hes here in mawai said jian her voice was gentle the room turned to her perhaps i ought to have informed you both cousin my lord prince i had the man followed and brought back after receiving certain information you knew hed left the princes expression was admiring it seemed a reasonable expectation he would do that you stopped my man on his journey zhous voice was odd greatly esteemed lady please what information it was liu tai didnt know whether to be amused by his brothers confusion or to pity it liu hated even more than tai did not understanding what was unfolding anywhere any time we received a suggestion said jian still gently that the man might have committed a murder before leaving dear cousin this will all be new to you of course it wouldnt be of course tai reminded himself he was among the dancers and he didnt know the music of course it is new the first minister exclaimed murder who alleges such a thing the gold bird guards have submitted an account of something they say happened a few nights past they were alerted that an act of violence might take place and some of them were there when it did they made no arrest seeking counsel from the palace first you will appreciate why they did this the murderer was your guardsman i am shocked who alerted them to this terrible thing the prime minister did not tai noted ask who had been killed zhous demeanour under the circumstances was remarkable aristocratic breeding did make a difference tai thought the wen families of the south were not among the very wealthiest in this dynasty but they had a lineage that went back a long way that was of course how jian had become a lesser princes wife before rising beyond that who alerted us roshan did as it happens said prince shinzu liu asked the question what man is he alleged to have slain a minor civil servant said the prince i am told he was a drinking companion of your own brother his name was xin xin lun i am told and you say an li told the gold bird guards that this might be about to happen liu was struggling well said jian sounding regretful the fellow master xin seems to have feared he might be in danger after certain tidings reached the taming from the west he wrote roshan asking for protection tai was watching the first minister zhou was impressive in that moment showing nothing of what would have to be extreme agitation and governor an liu asked alerted the gold bird guards quite properly they arrived too late it seems to prevent a death it is said jian an unfortunate business most unfortunate the first minister murmured i can imagine how it distresses you cousin to have been sending such a violent man to guard your dear parents my own uncle and aunt the spirits shield them said jian we will of course learn more when this feng is questioned this has not yet happened wen zhous voice was a little strained tai was suddenly enjoying himself that didnt last long we were waiting for master shen tai said jian matteroffactly to learn what he might add to the story i spoke with him earlier myself with you spoke with my brother said liu i did since this seems to have to do with him jian looked at her cousin and she wasnt smiling i think i like him i decided he should have a chance to listen before speaking himself it was liu who figured it out he looked at the two screens from one to the other his face was unreadable almost if you knew him well there were clues jian glanced over as if casually to where tai was hidden and that was tai thought as clear a signal to join the dance as he was ever going to get he stood up straightened his clothes then he stepped around the screen brushing the rich sandalwood of the wall and came out to be seen there was a degree of astonishment thathe supposedthe precious consort might find enjoyable he didnt he had no idea what he was expected to do he bowed to the heir to jian not to the first minister or his older brother both would have been proper of course he managed a brief smile for sima zian the poet was grinning clearly delighted by this theatre tai cleared his throat a roomful of highranking figures was staring at him thank you exalted lady he said i admit i was unhappy about concealing myself but your servant defers to your greater wisdom she laughed oh dear you make me sound ancient greater wisdom i just wanted to see their faces when you came out which wasnt the truth and he knew it all of them knew it but this was a part of how jian danced at this court tai was realizing how she made others dance this lay beneath the silk and scent you didnt have to be with her long to see it now that he was among them the fact that he and she were wearing similar colours was unmistakable tai had wondered if it was deliberate of course it was hed made a decision before he reminded himself if he could not weave subtle intentions towards a known design he would have to do things differently there wasnt really a choice was there either he was a puppet or a piece of wood in a river in spate or he had some control over what was happening and he could do that here only one way he turned to wen zhou how did you know i was at kuala nor he ought to have phrased it with courtesy prefaced by bows and a deferential greeting he ought not to have asked it at all zhou stared bleakly at him said nothing second brother said liu a little too loudly be welcome back among us you have brought great honour to our family liu bowed and not just the minimal salute of courtesy there was no way forward here tai thought but straight and you have shamed our fathers memory eldest brother did you never think how he would have felt about limei being sent north to barbarians but of course cried prince shinzu i had forgotten that our newest princess was of this family how interesting tai doubted hed forgotten it at all liu did not answer him that could come later he turned back to zhou you havent responded first minister he could only be direct here or accept being a wood chip in rapids i am unaware said wen zhou coldly of any protocol in any dynasty that would require a prime minister to respond to a question phrased that way a beating with the rod is possibly in order tai saw zian signalling with his eyes urging caution he declined he was here limei was gone yan was dead by a cold lake and his father was dead lying under a stone tai hadnt even seen he said i see roshan suggested you might avoid the question zhou blinked you spoke with him tais turn to ignore a question a beating with the rod you said how many people die under the rod first minister that could cost the empire two hundred and fifty sardian horses if he was doing this tai thought he was going to do it there was exhilaration in having the chance to be out from concealment standing before this man and saying this protocol might be amended dont you think when murder is involved i ask again how did you know i was at kuala nor murder you seem healthy enough are you a ghost yourself then shen tai it was upon them tai thought the poet had stopped trying to get his attention the prince moved forward from the wall again only jian seemed composed sitting the only person sitting on her platform in the midst of all of them tai said no first minister i am not dead yet but the scholar chou yan is at the hands of the assassin sent after me admissions have been made by that false kanlin who killed my friend by two other assassins who confessed their purpose to governor xu in chenyao he paused to let that name register those two were also seen by my friend sima zian and the governors own daughter brought us the name the killers offered up so there are others who can speak to this and then first minister roshan presented me with a copy of the letter sent him by xin lun saying he feared he would be killed since he knew too much a copy of a letter from roshan he cannot even read zhou actually managed a laugh after all weve heard this afternoonsome of us skulking behind a screenabout his designs you dont think that would be an obvious forgery meant to damage me the only one openly resisting him surely you are not so entirely it is not a forgery tai said lun died that night exactly as he feared he would and the gold bird guards saw who did it he turned to his brother as if ignoring zhou as if there was nothing left to say to him at all he looked at liu his heart was pounding someone tried to kill you at kuala nor liu asked he said it quietly assembling informationor that was how it sounded and at chenyao i see well i did know where you were said liu you did it was strange speaking to his brother again looking at him trying to read his thoughts tai reminded himself that liu was easily skilled enough to dissemble here i tried to persuade you not to go remember you did said tai again did you tell the first minister where i was the question hed been waiting to ask since leaving the lake and the mountains liu nodded his head i think i did in conversation as simple as that no hesitation someone else could be direct or appear to be i would have to check my records i have records of everything everything tai asked yes his brother said it was probably true lius face carefully schooled from childhood gave nothing away and the room was much too public for what tai really wanted to say again face to face this time a hand bunching lius robe tightly at the collar that his brother had shamed their fathers memory with what hed done to limei this wasnt the time or place he wondered if there would ever be a time or place and he also realized that for reasons that went far beyond his own story this encounter could not turn into anything decisive about murder attempts there were issues too much larger his thought was mirrored anticipated there was a dancer here perhaps we should wait for my cousins guardsman to answer some questions said jian perhaps we can talk of other matters i dont find this as amusing as i thought i might an order to desist if ever there was one tai looked at her she was icily imperious he drew a breath forgive me illustrious lady a dear friend was killed in a place beyond borders he died trying to tell me about my sister my sorrow has made me behave unpardonably your servant begs indulgence and you have it she said promptly you must know you will have itfrom everyone in the tamingfor the honour you have done us and for the horses said shinzu cheerfully he lifted a cup towards tai whatever questions or troubles any of us might have surely our task now is to amuse our hostess what sort of civilized men could we call ourselves otherwise a servant appeared at tais elbow with wine he took the cup he drank it was pepper wine exquisite of course it was i asked for a poem jian said plaintively half a lifetime ago my cousin declined our wandering poet declined is there no man who can please a woman here sima zian stepped forward gracious and exalted lady he murmured beauty of our bright age might your servant make a suggestion of course said jian it might even earn you forgiveness if it is a good one i live only in that hope said zian i propose that someone present a twinned pair of subjects and our two brothers the sons of shen gao each offer you a poem tai winced jian clapped her hands in delight how very clever of you of course that is what we will do and who better to offer the subjects than our banished immortal i insist upon it you choose general shens sons improvise for us i am happy again does everyone have wine his brother tai knew had passed the imperial examinations in the top three of his year he had been preparing for them all his life his poetry was immaculate precise accomplished it always had been tai had spent two years at kuala nor trying to make himself a poet in a solitary cabin at night with little success in his own estimation he told himself that this was just an entertainment an afternoons diversion at mawai where they liked to play not a competition that signified anything he felt like cursing the poet what was zian doing to him he saw liu bow to jian grave unsmiling he never smiles shed said in the sedan chair tai also bowed and managed a wry smile it probably looked apprehensive he thought sima zian said xinan and this nights moon any verse format you choose the prince chuckled master sima did we even have to wonder do you always choose the moon zian grinned in great good humour often enough my lord i have followed it all my days i expect to die by moonlight many years from now we hope said the prince graciously tai was wondering amid all else how everyone had been so wrong about this man he did have an answer or part of one it had been fatally dangerous through the years for an imperial heir to show signs of ambition and those signs might all too easily be thought to include competence intelligence perception it was safer to drink a great deal and enjoy the company of women which did raise a different question what was shinzu doing now zian murmured do you know well no you cant possibly know since i have never told anyone but i have sometimes dreamed of a second moon to write about wouldnt that be a gift id like a gift like that said the beloved companion quietly she was tai remembered it needed remembering sometimes very young she was younger than his sister jian turned to look at him and then at liu the first son must surely go first whatever other protocols we are abandoning wen zhou had stepped back as this new game began he smiled thinly at this however tai felt as if his senses had become unnaturally sharp as if he was seeing and hearing more than he ever had was this what life at court was like what the dance involved liu folded his hands carefully in his full black sleeves he had been doing this all his life tai knew preparing for such moments as this xinan and tonights moon he reminded himself it was customary in such contests to pair two images liu said looking at no one measuring stresses no one ever rests in xinan under a full moon or the hook moon of tonight as springtime turns a pale face to summer a place for winning renown if deserved and gems and trappings of great worth the city is alive all night and even more from the drummingopen of the great gates as the white sun rises dispelling mist here the son of heaven shines forth his jade countenance upon his beloved people and so here the world is all the world may be there was a kind of pain in tais chest shaped by and entangled with memory this was his brother they were at the heart of the court the heart of empire and liu could do this effortlessly all the world may be but what else had he done what else could he do as easily everyone in the room seemed to be looking at tai there had been no response at all to lius exquisite offering that too was proper when two or more people had been set a verse challenge you waited until the last one was done they did these in the north district often very drunk often very late tai sipped his wine he was impossibly sober he thought of yan of his sister he looked across at liu if deserved he murmured i like that his brothers mouth tightened tai hadnt expected a reaction nor had he expected to have to compose a poem in this setting this was the court not a pleasure house among fellow students he took another drink he had only one thing to bring to this room he realized that these elegant dancers would not have he looked at zian the poets face was attentive it would be tai thought when poetry was concerned this was his life air and water tai thought of a first phrase and thenquite suddenlyof a conclusion a contrast to his brothers and he began speaking slowly picking his way as through a moonlit wood and as the words came so too did images hed lived with south of us xinan lies under a sickle moon lanterns will soon be bright in the spring night laughter and music and rich wine poured far to the west where all roads end cold stars shine on white bones beside the stone shores of a lake thousands of li stretch empty from there to east and west and mountains rise birds wheel when the sun goes down and grieving ghosts are heard in the dark how may we live a proper life where is the balance the soul must find he looked at liu first in the silence that came when he was done a stillness coming into the room like the breeze from outside hed spent so much of his childhood looking to his brother for approval liu turned away reflexively and thenit must have been difficult tai thoughtback to his younger brother a bright loom he said old phrase poetry and silk it is more than that said sima zian softly laughter was heard well that didnt take long did it said wen zhou caustically only a few moments out from hiding and shen tai hastens to remind us of his soheroic time in the west tai looked across at him and he realized two things in that moment that he could do this could dance to at least some of the music here if he choseand that someone else in the room had even more anger than he did he stared at the handsome figure of the prime minister this was the man who had taken rain had killed yan tai took his time they would wait for him he realized he said there were past a hundred thousand unburied there half of them were ours i wouldnt have thought youd need reminding first minister of kitai he saw his brother wince which meant he knew how deeply tai had thrustand couldnt hide it you will spoil my pleasure if you quarrel said jian she let her voice sound petulant tai looked at her the exaggerated downward curve of that lovely painted mouth she was toying with them again he thoughtbut with a purpose he bowed my apologies again illustrious lady if i am to spend time at this court i shall need to show restraint even when others do not he saw her suppress a smile we have little intention of letting you leave us shen tai i imagine the emperor will wish to receive you formally very soon where are you staying in xinan he hadnt given it a thought you could find that amusing i have no residence there any more gracious lady i will take rooms somewhere and i will she seemed genuinely astonished take rooms prince shinzu stepped forward the precious consort is right as ever it would be a shocking lapse on the part of the court if you were allowed to do that will you accept one of my homes in xinan for the present until my father and his advisers have had time to consider the proper ways to honour you i have i have no need for honours my lord prince i did what i did at kuala nor only only out of respect for your father i understand the world is permitted to honour this is it not the prince grinned he drained his cup and there are those horses one of my men will call upon you this evening to make arrangements there were indeed those horses tai thought he wonderedyet againif princess chengwan in rygyal on its far plateau had had any idea what she was doing to him when she decreed that gift the other woman who seemed to be entering and shaping his life now the one who seemed to know precisely what she was doing declared an end to her gathering guests bowed to her and began filing out the doors shinzu remained in the room tai looked at the screen hed hidden behind the viewing holes were invisible he looked at the other screen he went out last to leave the steward closed the door tais exquisitely delicate escorts were there hands demurely in sleeves he saw zhou and liu striding away together hed wondered if his brother would linger to speak he wasnt certain if he was ready for that sima zian had waited can you spend a few moments with me tai asked i would be honoured the poet said gravely no hint of irony they started down the first long hallway together with the two women sunlight came from the west through tinted silkpaper windows casting a mild afternoon light at intervals they walked through it as they went light and shade then light and shade chapter xviii the sun is low reddened there is a murky tint to the air it has been cooler today windy limei wears a bogu shirt over her tunic and a camel hair vest over that she has no idea where meshag found these for her in this emptiness she has seen no signs of human life not even smoke on the wind in the luxurious hot springs retreat of mawai to the south and west across grasslands the wall the wide dangerous river her older brothers are reciting poems for members of the kitan court in a room of sandalwood and gold their listeners drink spiced pepper wine and a sweet breeze softens the spring air limei keeps looking over her shoulder shes been doing that nervously from the time the sun rose offering light enough to see theyd begun riding under stars the thin moon down the wolves invisible night noises some small animal had died in the dark shed heard a short scream meshag never looks back he allowed only two brief halts in a very long day he told her during the first rest that they would not be caught that day or the next they will have had to wait to learn which way we go they know now but there is a dust storm it will cost them some of a day and us he shook his head the storm not this far only wind only wind and endless grass and a sky so much farther away than any shes known it is difficult to feel that your life means anything under this sky are the heavens more removed from humankind here do prayers and souls have a greater distance to travel meshag signals another halt towards sunset shes anticipated this one sunset is the other time he hunts she dismounts he nods curtly his awkward motion and rides off east this time along the way theyve been going she has no idea how he chooses his direction if she understood him yesterday these are lands where his people rarely travel the shuoki here are enemies and have also been restive unsettled in their submission to kitan authority she doesnt know much about the shuoki remembers a story about general an li suppressing a rebellion a heroic ride something of the sort they havent seen anyone she has a sense it would be bad if they did if they were found here the grasslands are vast however beyond belief that may be what saves them she thinks no water this time where hes decreed their evening rest she was hoping for a pond she badly wants to be clean again it is a part of how she understands herself this begrimed lankhaired creature on a bogu horse in bogu clothes the shirt is much too large and smells of animal fat is not who or what limei considers herself to be shes aware that this is more and more inadequate as a way of thinking with every day that passes every li she travels the person she was has already been altered destroyed by the decision to name her a princess and send her north if she were really strongminded she thinks shed declare the girl whod been raised by a stream near the wai river the woman whod served the empress at court and in exile to be dead shed leave her behind with memories like a ghost it is hard to do harder than she expected perhaps it ought not to surprise her who can so easily lay down habits and images of a life ways of thinking an understanding of the world but it is more than that limei decides stretching out her aching back she is livingand ridingin a fragile but undeniable condition of hope and that changes things meshag son of hurok is strange beyond words barely human at times but he is helping her because of tai and his dead eyes do not undermine or refute steadiness and experience he killed a swan with a single arrow and he has the wolves he returns to her before night has completely fallen she is sitting in the tall grass looking west the wind has died the hook moon has set she sees the star of the weaver maid there is a song about how the moon swings past her then under the world through the night and comes back up carrying a message to her love on the far side of the sky meshag has water in the flasks and a saddlebag full of red and yellow berries nothing else she takes the water uses some to wash her face and hands she wants to ask about rabbits other meat does not he crouches beside her places the leather bag between them he takes a fistful of berries he says as if shes spoken aloud would you eat marmot not cooked limei stares at him not not yet why no fires shuoki more swans maybe at night searching for them he has said she asks too many questions she is not ready to let this part of her be dead or lost she takes some of the berries the yellow ones are bitter she says is it am i allowed to ask where we are going his mouth twitches you did ask he says she wants to laugh but it is too difficult she runs a hand through her limp tiedback hair her father used to do that when he was trying to think so do both her older brothers she cant remember a sorrow if her little brother does she says i am afraid i dont like feeling that way sometimes fear is proper it is what we do that matters shed not have expected a bogu rider to admit the idea she says it helps me when i know what is to come who can know this limei makes a face it occurs to her that they are having an actual conversation i only mean our intention where we are riding he is already harder to see it has grown dark quickly she hears the lead wolf in the grass not far from them she looks at the sky she is looking for a swan meshag says there is kitan garrison not far we sleep now ride tonight see it in morning she had forgotten about the garrison the soldiers posted beyond the bordershere in the north in the southwest or west along the silk roads beyond jade gatethese seldom enter the thoughts of the kitan and many of them are recruited barbarians she knows moved from their own homelands to serve the emperor in a far place but that is not what she is thinking about now a hand goes to her hair again she says but i cannot go to them when they learn who i am they will take me back to your brother you must understand she hears her voice rising tries to control it the emperor is dishonoured if they dont i was i was given as a bride the garrison commander will be terrified if i arrive he will he will hold me and send for instructions and they will tell him to escort me back this is not she stops because he has held up a hand in the darkness when she falls silent the night is very still around them the only sound the wind in grass meshag shakes his head do kitan women all speak so much not listen she bites her lip resolutely says nothing he says quietly i said we see garrison not go there i know they take you back west i know they must do this we see walls and turn south kitan fortress is protection for us from shuoki they not go near it oh limei says i take you he pauses shakes his head difficult tongue i am taking you to long wall is only three days if we ride quickly but the wall she thinks the walls soldiers will do exactly the same thing whichever watchtower they come to she remains silent waiting he says soldiers there also send you back i know we go through long wall into kitai but how she cannot help herself she sees him shrug with one shoulder not difficult for two people you then see no you will see she is heroically silent then she hears a strange sound and realizes he is laughing he says you are try so hard not to ask more i am limei says you shouldnt laugh at me he stops then says i take you through your wall sister of shendai near to it is flat mountain drum mountain you call it we go we are going there her eyes widen stone drum mountain she whispers he is taking her to the kanlin warriors the two women bowed at the tall doorway to tais chamber one of them opened the door tai let sima zian enter first the women waited in the corridor they didnt lower their eyes now it was clear that they would come in if he invited them it was equally clear that there was little he or the poet might think to request that would not be granted zian smiled at the smaller prettier one tai cleared his throat i thank you both i must speak now with my friend how may i summon you if needed they looked perplexed it was zian who said theyll be right here shen tai they are yours until you leave mawai oh said tai he managed a smile both women smiled back he closed the door gently the two large windows were open screens rolled up it was still light outside he didnt imagine any real privacy existed here but he didnt think anyone would be spying on him there was wine warming over a brazier on a small lacquered table he saw that the cups set beside it were gold he felt overwhelmed zian crossed to the table poured two cups he handed one to tai he lifted his own in salute and drained it then poured himself another what just happened tai asked he set his own wine down he was afraid to drink any more the intensity of the gathering theyd just left was washing over him this happened in wartime too he knew this afternoon had been a battle hed been placed as an ambush had engaged in single combat not necessarily with his true enemy enemy that word again zian raised his eyebrows what happened you created a very fine poem so did your brother i will make copies of both no i mean i know what you mean i can judge the poems i cant answer the other question zian crossed to the window looking out from where he stood tai could see that the gardens were glorious this was mawai they would be a little way north of here were the ninth dynasty tombs tai said i think the emperor was behind the other screen what zian turned quickly why how do you i dont know for certain i think two painted screens and what lady jian and the prince did together in there it felt like it was meant for an audience and it wouldnt be me it might have been i dont think so ive never heard of prince shinzu behaving in such a talking so they were both fumbling for words so strongly yes neither have i said sima zian almost reluctantly he was challenging zhou and he couldnt have done it without knowingsurelythat his father would learn of it so it seems to me that he might have been doing it for the emperor yes zians last word hung in the room with all its obvious implications and all those they could not see the breeze at the window was mild scented with flowers could you see us from where you were tai nodded shed arranged for that so what happened there i need help the poet sighed he refilled his cup again he gestured and tai reluctantly drained his own zian crossed the room and poured for him he said i have spent my life between cities and mountains rivers and roads you know it i have never had a place at court never sat the examinations shen tai i am not the man to tell you what is unfolding but you listen you watch what did you hear in that room zians eyes were bright the afternoon light streamed in the room was large gracious inviting a place to be easy to seek tranquility that was what mawai had always been about the poet said i think first minister wen was given a warning i do not think it will cost him his position even if he was plotting murder sima zian shook his head no not even if he had achieved your killing what they will say is the meaning of so much power if you cant use it to rid yourself of someone you dislike tai looked at him said nothing zian went on theyd have cheerfully allowed him to have you killedbefore the horses it would have been a matter of no consequence whether he did it because of a woman or to prevent you from threatening his adviser your brother no one here would have blinked if youd died at kuala nor or on the road the horses have changed that but i think today was about roshan your presence was that warning to zhou hes at risk they were telling him that he poured another cup he smiled again i very much liked cold stars shine on white bones thank you said tai there were two preeminent writers among thousands in ninth dynasty kitai this man was one of them you could go happily to your ancestors carrying praise from sima zian for lines youd written tai said you just gave me guidance after all treat it with caution said the poet i claim no wisdom those who claim are those who lack said tai it was a quote the poet would know it zian hesitated shen tai i am not a humble man i am only being honest i keep returning to this jadeandgold it draws me sandalwood and ivory the murmur and scent of women but to visit to taste it is no home i need to be here and when i come i need to be gone a man must see it as his home to understand the court tai opened his mouth to reply but realized he didnt know what he wanted to say zian said there is more beauty in the taming or here at mawai than anywhere else where men have built palaces and gardens it may be that there is more beauty here right now than there has ever been who would deny the wonder and glory of that or resist seeing it or fear that it might end tai asked that is one fear yes sometimes i am happy i am no longer young zian put his cup down i am awaited friend there are two women who promised me flute music and saffron wine when the sun went down tai smiled no man should keep another from that truly will you come tai shook his head i need to think i imagine there will be a banquet tonight i have no idea how to conduct myself because of wen zhou yes no because of my brother the poet looked at him he should not have done what he did tai shrugged he is head of our family he will say limei brings us honour stature in the world the poet looked at him he is correct in that his eyes were bright again a trick of the light still i could understand if you killed him for it but i am not a clever man in these ways tai said im not certain i am either zian smiled a wintry look you were made to remember that hed been a warrior in his time perhaps but you must be clever now tai for a little while or for longer than that you have importance now the world can bring us gifts or poison in a jewelled cup tai quoted the poets expression changed i dont know that who wrote it my brother said tai quietly ah said sima zian i see tai was thinking of summer thunderstorms watched from a sharedbedroom window he was walking towards the door to open it for the poet when the knocking came it didnt come from the hallway outside both men froze where they were a moment later the tapping came again tai turned to look at the wall beyond the handsome bed as he watched a doorshaped panel swung away into shadow and then a second panel did double doors hidden in the wall no one appeared from where tai stood he couldnt see within the recess a corridor an adjacent room the two men looked at each other this is not a time for me to be here said zian quietly the poets expression was grave close to tais ear he murmured be clever friend be slow to act this will not play out in a day and night he opened the door to the hallway himself tais escorts were still there one against the windows the other across from her the corridor was now lit by lanterns all the way down in anticipation of sunset they smiled at the two men zian went out tai closed the door behind him turned back into the room six soldiers came in quickly almost running they took positions paired by the two windows and the door moving past tai ignoring him their expressions impassive they had swords and helmets and leather armour the four at the windows looked out carefully but did not close them the light coming in was beautiful this time of day one of the soldiers knelt and looked under the bed he stood up and nodded towards the recessed passage wen jian entered the room she didnt look at tai either she walked across to the window opposite then turned back to face the double doors her expression sober she was still wearing the green silk with paleyellow phoenixes decorating it tais heart was pounding he was afraid now through the doors in the wall came six more soldiers carrying a curtained palace chair on poles the curtains hid the figure they were carrying you knew however you knew who this was the chair was set down in the middle of the room tai dropped to his knees forehead to the floor hands stretched before him he didnt look up he closed his eyes for a moment trying not to tremble he remained that way prostrate that was what you did when the serene and exalted emperor of kitai ruling in glory through the mandate of heaven entered a room any room let alone your own bedchamber having come to you in secrecy through a passage in the walls you have permission to stand son of shen gao it was jian who spoke tai scrambled to his feet he bowed three times towards the curtained chair and then twice to the woman by the window she inclined her head but did not smile the soldiers whod carried in the chair took positions along the walls heads high eyes staring directly ahead the curtains enclosing the chair were red decorated with yellow suns there were nine on this side tai saw and there would be nine on the opposite for the legend too much brightness for mortal men that was the meaning here he had seen the emperor taizu three times in his life from a distance the emperor had stood on a high balcony of the taming overlooking a throng in the square before the palace on three festival days the imperial party had been so far away and so far above that one of the students had said they might easily have been people hired to pose in imperial colours under banners while the real court were hunting or at ease in the deer park beyond the august shepherd of our people wishes you to answer a question jian murmured tai bowed to the curtains again he was sweating your servant is honoured beyond deserving he stammered from behind the red curtain a voice came stronger than tai had expected did you truly hear the voices of the dead at kuala nor tai dropped to his knees again forehead to floor you have permission to stand said jian a second time tai stood he had no idea what to do with his hands he clasped them in front of his waist then let them fall to his sides his palms were damp your servant did gracious and exalted lord he said did they speak to you there was vivid interest in the voice you couldnt miss hearing it tai refrained with an effort from kneeling again he was still trembling trying to control that he said gracious lord they did not your servant only heard them crying in the night from the time the sun went down until it rose again crying in anger or in sorrow son of shen gao tai looked at the floor both exalted lord when when when bones were laid to rest that ghost would cease to cry there was a silence he glanced at jian out of the corner of his eye she stood by a window late sunlight in her hair we are well pleased said the emperor of kitai you have done us honour and your father it is noted tai knelt again great lord your servant is not worthy of such words there came a chuckle from behind the curtain do you mean that i am wrong in what i have said tai pressed his forehead to the floor speechless he heard jians laughter she murmured dearest love that is unkind you terrify the man dearest love the emperor taizu unseen but also laughing said a man who lived two years among the dead i hope it is not so tai didnt move didnt speak you have permission to stand wen jian said again and this time there was exasperation in her voice tai stood he heard a rustling of the curtainbut it was on the other side away from him a moment passed then the rustling again the emperor said we will formally receive you when such matters have been arranged we wished to express our approval privately we always have need of brave men in the taming palace it is good that you are here your servant thanks you great lord tai murmured he was perspiring now the emperor in a quieter voice said honour falls into three parts son of shen gao one part restraint one part rightthinking one part honouring ancestors we will leave you he didnt care what the woman had told him three times now tai fell to his knees again and put his head to the floor he heard the soldiers moving a creak as the chair was lifted then the floorboards as they carried it back through the hidden doors he was thinking of those last words trying without success to remember if hed ever heard or studied them then wrongly entirely wrongly the thought came to him that the unseen man whod spoken them had taken his young sons young bride for his own concubine was pursuing forbidden immortality with hidden alchemies and was also building himself a tomb that dwarfed his fathers and all those of his line ones own thoughts could be terrifying he heard the tread of the other soldiers again almost running across the room after a moment he looked up jian was by the double doors alone smiling at him that was well enough done she said i will confess for my own part that i find restraint to be overpraised do you not agree shen tai it was too much too many different directions for a man to be pulled in one day tai simply stared at her he had no idea what to say she could see it in his face obviously she laughed not unkindly you are excused from my banquet tonight she said he flushed i have offended you illustrious lady she shook her head not so there are gifts from the phoenix throne on the bed these are the emperors not mine my gift is your freedom tonight the little kanlin so fierce in your service is waiting outside this room with nine other warriors you will need guards when you go to xinan tonight i am going to xinan and had best leave soon darkness will find you on the road i what am i my cousin said jian with a smile that could undo a mans control over his limbs is here with me tonight and with others tomorrow morning in discussions about roshan i see said tai although he didnt she has been told you are coming said wen jian tai swallowed found that he could say nothing at all this is my gift your kanlin knows where your horse is stabled and you have a steward now for the city home the emperor has just presented you you will need a steward a steward tai repeated stupidly he was mine this morning i have reconsidered a decision taken he owes you his life i expect he will serve you well the smile deepened there was no woman on earth tai thought who looked the way this one did but there was another woman in xinan with golden hair who had put her life at risk for him who had warned him more than once of what might happen if he went away she had also told him tai remembered that he was going to need to be much more subtle if he had the smallest hope of surviving in the world of the court they will send word when you are summoned said wen jian there will be an audience and then of course you will need to go back west to bring your horses of course gracious lady said tai you have promised me ten of them she reminded him i have he said for dancing for dancing she agreed one more gift she turned and laid something down on the bed and then went out through the doors in the wall someone closed them the room was as it had been it was still light outside on the bed lay a heavy key beside it was a ring set with an emerald larger than any tai had ever seen in his life there was a third object as well he saw a lychee not yet peeled he took the fruit he took the keyit would be for the house in xinan he placed them in a pocket of his robe he took the ring and put it on the ring finger of his left hand he looked at it there for a moment thinking of his father and mother then he took it off and placed it in his pocket as well he drew a strained breath let it out for no good reason he removed his hat he crossed to the door and opened it i am happy to see you he said to wei song she stood there straight small unsmiling fierce as a grassland wolf she made a face said nothing did incline her head mind you behind her were as promised other kanlins blackclad beside song kneeling was the steward from this morning at the inn the man whod been ordered by jian to kill himself when they reached mawai i have reconsidered a decision please stand said tai the steward stood up there were embarrassingly tears on his cheeks tai pretended not to see them he took out the key i will assume you have been told which gateway which house in xinan this will unlock i have gracious lord said the steward it is in the fiftyseventh ward the very best a handsome property it is even close to the mansion of the first minister he looked proud saying this tai blinked he could almost hear jians laughter he said i wish you to take horse or carriage whichever is easier for you and prepare this house for me tonight there will be servants there of course this was a home belonging to the emperor may he live a thousand years they will be waiting for you my lord and they will be honoured and grateful as as i am to serve you tai scowled good he said i will see you in xinan the steward took the extended key bowed turned went hurrying down the hallway a man with a clear shining purpose again in a life hed thought was over his name is ye lao said song you neglected to ask he looked at her the neat calm figure in black her intense features she had killed for tai had been wounded again this morning ye lao thank you would you prefer him dead she hadnt expected that she shook her head no she hesitated this is a different world she said she wasnt as calm as she seemed he realized he nodded it is it will be she looked up at him he saw her smile the wide mouth and you will have your thighs torn raw my lord if you try to ride to xinan on a sardian horse while wearing liao silk have you riding clothes he looked to the window and then the wall his two women were still there looking fearful and proud have i riding clothes he asked they hurried gracefully past him into the room he heard them opening a chest heard rustling sounds giggling he went in a moment later he did it seemed have riding clothes exactly fitted and his own boots had been cleaned he changed neither woman looked away he noted he kept the ring and for no very good reason the lychee fruit he went back out joined song and the other kanlins assigned to him they led him to the stables to dynlal and horses for all of them and they rode out from mawai near the end of the day towards the city of dust and noise of two million souls where lights would be shining by the time they arrived and would shine all through the night no one ever rests in xinan his brother liu had just said in a poem and rain had been told he was coming chapter xix there is a rosewood gazebo near the back wall of the compound it is set among fruit trees and flower beds a long way beyond the artificial lake and the island set within it past the grassy space for entertaining guests and the bamboo grove with its laidout paths and the open area where wen zhous guards practise swordsmanship and archery for rain the gazebo is a favourite place she has many reasons rosewood is named not for its colour but for its scent which she loves the wood itself is dark with lines running through it as if trying to reach the surface to break through you can see that imagine that in daylight rosewood comes to xinan from forests in the far south it is imported overland and then along rivers and up the great canal at a cost that does not bear thinking about there are nightingales here sometimes this far back from the rooms and pavilions of the compound the street beyond the wall is quiet at night in a sedate very wealthy ward they can be heard most often in summer it is early in the year to expect one tonight she has meandered back this way carrying her pipa plucking it as she walked through the twilight she has noticed that when she carries the instrument people dont look at her as closely as if shes part of the setting not a woman to be observed or carefully watched it is dark now shed had hwan the servant who loves her a little too much light one of the gazebos lanterns for her and then shed dismissed him she doesnt want it to appear as if shes hiding see there is a light although youd need to come a long way back and look through trees to see it earlier in the afternoon hwan had run a different errand for her outside the compound she has done what she can do and is here rain plays a few notes of an old song about the moon as messenger between parted lovers then she decides thats the wrong music to be thinking about tonight she is alone here shes confident of that her maidservants have been dismissed for the night one will remain in the suite of rooms against her mistresss return but rain has stayed out late in the garden with her pipa before a mild eccentricity usefully established and wen zhou doesnt spy on his women his mind doesnt run that way he cant actually conceive rain believes that they would not be devoted and compliant where and how could they have a better life no his fears are cast like a shadow outside these walls he and his wife have been gone all day summoned to mawai no warning he wasnt happy about the suddenness on the other hand there was never a great deal anyone could prudently do in the way of resisting when jian wanted them rain sees fireflies among the trees watches them for a time moths flutter around the lantern the compound has been quiet since the master left this morning or at least since the arrival of the second message from mawai the one sent to her not all windows above jade stairs need be seen through tears no jade stairs here neither real jade nor a poets symbolshaped imagining she sits on a bench with her instrument in a rosewood gazebo roofed but open to the night on all sides the scent of the wood scent of the air nearly summer now no jade and no tears rain decides although she knows it would be possible to make herself weep she isnt going to do that she is thinking too hard mostly about wen jian no one knows this mountain where i dwell tai found it ironic in an overelaborate way that when the nearness of xinan first announced itselfa wide diffused glow on the southern horizonthe phrase that came to him was from a poem about solitude yan would have had a remark about that he thought so would xin lun actually the one man gentle amused the other wittily astringent both were dead and the memories he was conjuring were more than two years old so was the memory rich as the emerald he carried but didnt wear of the woman he was riding through the night to see he wasnt sure why he hadnt put on the ring he wasnt ready yet he decided for people to look at him the way one looked at a man with so much wealth on display he didnt want rain seeing him like that though he couldnt say why it wasnt as if she would be unused to opulence in the first ministers house even in the pavilion of moonlight she had moved through a world that included extravagantly wealthy men it had never seemed to touch her shed been as happyor had made them think she wasamong the students singing for them teasing listening to latenight philosophy and verse and plans to remake the world that was what a skilled courtesan did of course induce every man to think he was the one shed choose had she only the freedom to pursue that innermost desire but he knew tai knew that to think that way about her was to deny a deeper truth about the goldenhaired woman behind the walls so many of them xinans walls loomed now in the middle distance beyond the bridge they were clattering across the bridge had bright lanterns and soldiers guarding it two years ago rain had told himhad warned himthat the stylish southern aristocrat wen zhou cousin to the emperors beloved might be minded to take her away from the north district both of them had seen it happen many times mostly it was a dream for a courtesan that this might occur a doorway opening on a better life tai immersed in his studies and friendships trying to decide what his own idea of a properly lived life should be had been painfully aware that what she said might be true but there was nothing a student preparing for the examinations the second son of a retired general could do if an aristocrat with wealth and connections wanted a north district woman for his own and then his father had died he was thinking of her green eyes and yellow hair and the voice late at night as they came to the city walls tai looked up at the enormous manystoreyed tower above the gates there were lights now hiding the stars the gates were locked of course it was after darkfall that didnt seem to matter jian had sent word ahead of them the leader of his kanlin escort not wei song there was a more senior figure now handed a scroll through a small sliding window and a moment later the gold bird guards manning this entrance through the northern wall opened for them with a shout then as he and his kanlins rode through the city guardsthose on the ground and those in the tower and on the nearby wallsall bowed twice to tai he truly wasnt prepared for this he looked at song who had stayed close through the hours of this ride she didnt meet his glance was staring straight ahead hood up watchful and alert shed been wounded this morning seemed to show no signs of it the gates swung closed behind them he turned in the saddle and watched patting dynlal absently tai wondered why he wasnt exhausted they had been travelling most of the day except for an interlude at mawai that was likely to change his life he was in xinan again heart of the world he still didnt know why jian was doing this his best guess was that it was a small part of the endless balancing act she performed in the palace wen zhou and roshan ambitious mandarins the heir other governors the eunuchs other princes and their mothers and now one more man arrived from the west the brother of an influential adviser and of a newly named princess a man with an absurd number of sardian horses in his control to a woman in jians position it would only make sense to assert a claim to such a man and so when it had emerged through routine inquiry that hed had a relationship with a singing girl in the north district a girl who might even be the reason jians cousin had sought to have him killed well you might undertake certain things in such a circumstance set them in motion if you were a clever woman dealing with a fiendishly difficult court and with an aging emperor tired of protocols and conflicts and finance and barbarians obsessed with you and with living forever while shaping the most opulent tomb ever built should that second dream not come to pass because the gods did not wish it so gates had been opened for tai not just symbolically as in a verse but real ones massive and intimidating looming by torch and lantern light he had never done this enter the city after dark if you approached xinan towards days end you found an inn or a farmhouse with a barn if you were a student watching your money and listened from outside the walls to the long ceremony of drums that closed the gates then you entered with the market crowd in the morning amid the chaos of another day among two million souls not now now the gates had just swung wide four of the gold bird guards even came with them to preclude the necessity of showing their scroll all the way through the city the streets were eerily quiet within the lanes and alleys of some of the wards there would be raucous violent life even now tai knew but not along the main roads they turned east immediately inside the gate passing in front of the vast palace complex until they turned south down the central avenue the widest street in the world running from the taming to the southern gate straight as a dream of virtue she had pressed her fingers to his mouth their last night to stop him from being clever he recalled he had once been a man who prided himself on being clever he remembered her scent her palm against his face he remembered kissing her hand he looked around him he had never done this either ride a horse right down the central avenue after dark he didnt like being in the middle of the wide street it felt too much as if he were laying claim to something he wasnt hed have liked to claim a cup of wine in the pavilion of moonlight if she had still been there over more please he said quietly to song too much of a procession where we are she looked quickly at him they were near a guard station with lanterns he saw concern in her eyes then they moved from the light and he couldnt see her face any more song twitched her horses reins moved ahead and spoke to the man leading them they began angling southeast across the vast open space to continue along the roadway nearer one side now there were only a handful of people abroad on the street and no group so large as theirs those on the far side west were so distant as to be almost invisible there were guard stations at intervals large ones at the major intersections all the way down the centre of the road he saw a sedan chair being carried north the bearers stopped as their company passed by a hand pulled a curtain back to see who they were tai glimpsed a womans face they carried on ten kanlin warriors four of the gold bird guards and the second son of general shen gao down the principal avenue of xinan under stars all journeys come to an end one way or another they reached the gate of the fiftyseventh ward he had been born in the south beyond the great river in lands that knew tigers and the shrieking of gibbons his family were farm labourers for generations going back further than any of them could have counted he himselfhis name was pei qinhad been the youngest of seven a small child clever when he was six years old his father had brought him to the understeward of one of the wen estates there were three branches of the wen family controlling most of the land and the rice and salt around there was always a need for capable servants to be trained qin had been accepted by the steward to be raised and educated that had been thirtyseven years ago he had become a trusted unobtrusive household servant when the eldest son of the family decided to make his way to xinan and the courtly world not quite four years ago observing the useful astonishing rise of his young cousin qin was one of the servants hed taken north to help select and teach those they would hire in the capital qin had done that capably and quietly hed been a quiet child was unchanged as a man never married he had been one of the three servants entrusted with laying out clothing for the master with preparing his rooms with warming his wine or tea had he been asked at any time hed have said that his was a privileged life since he knew the conditions in which his siblings lived among the rice and salt one eveningthe wrong evening for reasons heaven decreedhe had been distracted by the inadequately supervised presence in the compound of a dozen girls from the pleasure district they were being fitted with costumes for a pageant zhou was hosting on his lake the lake was new then hearing their uninhibited laughter worrying about who was watching them qin had overheated the masters evening wine the wine had evidently burned wen zhous tongue thirtyfive years with the family had been as nothing qin would think after decades of service had been less than nothing he was beaten in itself not unusual the life of a servant included such things and a senior retainer could be required to perform the beating of a lesser one qin had done that the world was not a gentle place no one whod seen a brother mauled by a tiger would ever think that and a short time in xinan could make a man realize there were tigers here too even if they might not have stripes or pad through forests and fields after dark the thing was wen zhou had ordered sixty strokes with the heavy rod for qin his tongue must have been quite badly burned one of the other servants said bitterly afterwards or something else had greatly distressed the master that night it didnt matter sixty strokes of the rod could kill a man two and a half years ago that was in the days just before the cold food festival qin did not die but it was a near thing the household steward not a bad man for a steward arranged for two doctors to attend upon him taking turns day and night in the small room where theyd brought him after the public beating in the third courtyard it was important for all the servants to see the consequences of carelessness he survived but never walked properly again he couldnt lift his right arm that side of his torso was twisted like some trees above the great river gorges that grow low to the slanting ground to stay out of the wind and suck moisture from sparse soil he was dismissed of course an aristocrats compound was not a place for the unemployable the other servants undertook to look after him it was not something hed expected not something normally done usually a man as deformed as qin would be taken to one of the markets and do what he could to survive by begging there it might have helped if he could have sung or told tales or even served as a scribe but he had no singing voice was a small shy man and his writing hand hed been taught by wen zhous fathers steward how to write was the one that was twisted and useless after the beating hed have been better off dying qin thought for a long time he shaped such thoughts in the street behind wens compound where the other servants had placed him after he was dismissed it was not a busy thoroughfare not a good place for a beggar but the others had said theyd look after him and they had done so qin would limp on his crutch to the shady side of the street in summer and then cross as the sun moved or huddle in an alcove in rain or winter winds begging brought little but from the compound each morning and many evenings food and rice wine came out for him if his garments grew threadbare he would find that one day the person bringing his meal would be carrying new clothes in winter they gave him a hooded cloak and he even had boots he became skilful with the crutch at beating off dogs or rats eyeing his provisions last autumn his life had even changed for the better which was not something pei qin had thought was possible any more one cold clear morning four of the household servants walking the long distance around from the southfacing front doors had come along the street towards where qin kept his station against the compound wall they carried wood and nails and tools and set about building a discreet shelter for him set in a space between an oak tree and the stone wall not easily seen from the street not likely to offend he asked and they told him that the new concubine lin chang had heard qins story from one of zhous other womenapparently meant as a cautionary tale she had made inquiries and learned where he was she had given instructions that he be provided with a shelter and his food rations became more substantial after that it appeared that she had assumed responsibility for him freeing the servants from the need to feed him out of their own allocation he never saw her they told him she was beautiful and on five occasions he remembered them perfectly he heard her play the pipa towards the back of the garden he knew it was her even before they confirmed for him that it was mistress lin of all the women who played and sang best and who liked to come alone to the gazebo qin had decided she was playing for him he would have killed or died for her by then hwan the servant who most often brought his food or clothing clearly felt the same way it was hwan who told him shed been bought from the north district and that her name there had been spring rain he also told qin what the master had paid for her it was a source of pride qin thought it an unimaginable sum and also not enough it was hwan who had told him at the beginning of spring that a kanlin warrior would be coming to meet privately with mistress lin hwanspeaking for the lady he made clearasked qin to show this kanlin how to get over the wall using his own sheltertree and to give her directions to the gazebo from there it was a distance back west in the compound it brought intense joy to qins battered body and beating heart to be trusted with such a service for her he told hwan as much begged him to say so to mistress lin and to bow three times in qins name the kanlin came that night a woman which he hadnt expected but it made no difference she looked for qin in the darkness carrying no torch shed have had trouble seeing him had he not been watching for her he called to her showed her the way over the wall told her where the gazebo was it was a cold night he remembered the woman climbed with an ease qin would never have matched even when he had his legs and a straight back but kanlin were chosen for their aptitude in these things and trained qin had been chosen for intelligence but had overheated wine one night you might call the world an unjust place or make of life what you could he was grateful to the servants in love with a woman he would never see and he intended to live long enough to celebrate the death of wen zhou he watched the kanlin woman disappear over the wall and saw her come back some time later she gave him a coinsilver which was generous he was saving it for an extravagance lychees would be in season now in the south where hed been born the court might have them already the xinan marketplaces would see them soon qin intended to ask someone to buy him a basket as a way of remembering childhood hed actually gone once to the nearer eastern market the summer before just to see it again it had been a reckless misguided thing to do getting there had taken him most of a day limping and in pain mocked by children hed fallen several times and been stepped on and had then been at real risk at days end of not getting back inside the ward when the drums began you were beaten by the gate guards for that he would ask someone to buy him lychees there were several of the servants he trusted and he would share his bounty they had saved his life after all and surely there was value in any life even one such as his earlier today hwan had come out again taking the long walk around to tell him someone else would be coming along qins street tonight and would need to be shown the tree and how to climb and where the gazebo might be found it is for her was all qin asked of course it is hwan said please bow three times tell her that her most humble servant in the world under heaven will ensure that it is done that night a man did come walking with five kanlins one of these qin saw was the woman whod come before he knew because he didnt need to call out to them she came straight over to his tree since it was the woman whod been here they didnt need instructions the man looked down at qin in the darkness they carried no torches he saw the small shelter built for him he gave qin two coins even before going over the wall three of the kanlin went with him two remained in the street on guard qin wanted to tell them that he would have served as a guard but he wasnt a foolish man these were kanlin they had swords across their backs they wore black as ever and melted into the night after a time he had no idea where they were but he knew that they were there her pipa rests on the wide smooth waisthigh railing she is standing by one of the gazebos rosewood pillars leaning against it it is chilly now but she has a short jacket green as leaves with gold thread to cover her bodice which is gold her green anklelength skirt has stripes running down it also gold the silk is unexceptional it would have been noted had she worn finer silk with the master away she wears no perfume same reason she is on her feet because she has heard someone comingfrom the eastern side of the garden where the oak tree can be climbed the one lantern casts an amber glow the gazebo will seem like a cabin in a dark forest she imagines a refuge sanctuary for a lost traveller it isnt she thinks there is no sanctuary here footsteps ascend the two steps and he is here he kneels immediately head lowered before she can even see his face register his presence properly she has not expected him to do this shes had no real idea what to expect no jade stairs she reminds herself no tears at window ledges he looks up the remembered face she observes little change but it is not light enough to see closely here and two years need not alter a man so much she murmurs i am not deserving of this my lord he says i am not deserving of what you did for me rain the voice she also remembers too vividly why and how does one voice one person come to conjure vibrations in the soul like an instrument tuned why a given man and not another or a third she hasnt nearly enough wisdom to answer that she isnt sure if anyone does master shen she says formally please stand your servant is honoured that you have come he does stand up when he looks at her his face beneath the lantern shows the intensity she recalls she pushes memories away she needs to do that she says are you alone my lord he shakes his head three kanlin are with me to keep watch two more in the street im not allowed to be alone any more rain she thinks she understands that she says is the one i sent to you wei song is here yes she is very capable rain allows herself a smile she sees him register that i thought she might be but did she how did you survive he hesitates he has changed she decides is weighing his words you know where i was she nods she is glad of the pillar behind her for support i didnt know before i had to have her find your home start there i didnt even know where your fathers home was i am sorry he says simply she ignores that says i know that wen zhou had lun hire a woman to kill you sent with yan yes is he all right hes dead rain she killed him i was saved only by by the ghosts and tagurans who came to help when they saw riders by the ghosts she isnt ready to ask about that to know about it yan is dead a hard thing to learn a sweet man im sorry she says he is silent looking at her she is accustomed to men looking at her but this is different he is different eventually he says he was dead the moment she became his guard i think she wishes there was wine she ought to have brought some so i did nothing at all she says he shakes his head there was a second attempt at chenyao wei song fought a number of men alone outside my room a very capable woman then she isnt sure why shes said it that way tai only nods as i said he hesitates again he isnt being awkward she decides he is choosing what to say it is a difference from before rain you would have been killed if this had been discovered it is a statement not a question it was unlikely it would be she says he hasnt moved from under the lantern neither has she from her place by the pillar she sees fireflies behind him hears crickets in the garden no sign of the kanlins he mentioned or anyone else there is a silence i had to go away he says finally this will become difficult now she thinks i know she says your father died when did when did he bring you here she smiles at him her smile has always been an instrument she could use not long after his appointment as you tried to tell me as i did tell you tai she hadnt meant to say that so quickly or use his name she sees him smile this time he steps closer she wants to close her eyes but does not he says no perfume i have remembered it for two years have you really my lord she says the way she might have in the pavilion of moonlight he looks down at her where the light touches her features catches yellow hair she has not posed herself it was simply a place against a column where she could lean back for support and be on her feet when he came he says i understand you wear scent now only for him and hes away she keeps her tone light i am not sure how i feel about you becoming this perceptive he smiles only a little says nothing i can also move more easily undetected without it she says but she is disconcerted that he has so swiftly understood is that important he is asking something else now she knows she lifts her shoulders again lets them fall has he been cruel he asks she hears strain in his voice she knows men well this one very well no never she says a silence he is quite close may i kiss you he asks there it is she makes herself meet his eyes no never she says and sees sorrow not anger not balked desire sorrow which isperhapswhy and how anothers voice or soul can resonate within you she thinks never he asks he does not move nearer there are men who would she knows she knows many of those no jade stairs she tells herself are you asking my views on eternity and the choices of life she says brightly are we back to discoursing upon the sacred path he waits the man she remembers would have been eager to cap her own halfwitticism with a quip of his own that or take the exchange deeper despite her teasing she says to delay you have changed in two years where i was he says only that he has not touched her she lifts a hand to his cheek she had not meant to do that she knows exactly what shed meant to do among the fireflies tonight it was not this he takes her hand in his and kisses her palm he inhales as if trying to bring her back within himself after so long she closes her eyes she has not changed tai thought and he realized that it had been childish for him to imagine that shed appear to him like some fragile princess abducted into sad captivity what had happened to rain was not he finally understood his sisters fate it was a difficult truth had he merged the two of them in his mind journeying east what truly was better about a singing girls life in the pavilion of moonlight serving any man who had money and desire compare that with existence in this compound with one powerful man she knewclearly she knewhow to entrance and lure as for when she grew older also clear as moonlight on snow her chances of a protected life were better here this destiny was what the north district girls all longed to find he felt a wave of selfreproach and sadness then she touched his cheek and then she closed her eyes he bent and kissed her on the lips he did it gently trying to acknowledge what had happened the reality of it and that hed been away two years her mouth was soft her lips parted his own eyes closed he made himself draw back he said rain there has never been a woman who reaches into me as you do her eyes opened the gazebo was lit by only one lantern so it was hard to see how green her eyes were but he knew he remembered he wondereda shockingly hard thoughtif hed ever see those eyes again for that was where this night was travelling he realized she said i am sorry for it my lord and pleased am i permitted to be both of course he said she had slipped effortlessly into the mixture of formality and intimacy that had characterized her manner in the pavilion of moonlight he tried to match it could not he said why did you come tonight she shook her head suddenly impatient with him he remembered that too wrong question tai would you have me shame myself with an answer he looked at her im sorry she was angry now he could see it i came because the beloved companion sent a note advising me not to sleep tonight and she quoted the jade stairs poem i see he thought about it she told me you were alerted i might come she kept wen zhou at mawai gave me guards and a pass into the city after dark so we are both serving her needs he heard amusement under the bitterness how compliant of us he smiled rain i would say the feel of your mouth the taste of you serves my needs very well she looked up at him for a long time then away into the dark and then she said with finality i cannot be your lover tai there is no proper way for it to happen i did not send a kanlin to you for that i know he said sorrow in the quiet dark the astonishing truth of this woman proud and seductive more subtle than he was needing to be more subtle he thought in the life shed lived i could accuse zhou of trying to kill me he said it was almost said at mawai today not by me he did have yan murdered and lun it might change your you would accuse the first minister of kitai governing this empire of killing students or minor civil servants and this would accomplish what tai who would care how would you prove it others would do that wen jian has the man who killed lun what feng he saw that she was startled by this he was heading south to wen zhous family she told us all that she had the man there were important people in the room including prince shinzu he didnt mention the emperor it was not the sort of thing you spoke about he said i think we think that she is giving her cousin a warning hes in difficulty rain mainly because of roshan she crossed to the bench sat down looking up thoughtfully at him now moths darted around the one light the air was cool he remembered this about her the way her mind could be so suddenly engaged who is we she asked not the question hed expected i was befriended on the road sima zian has been with me since chenyao she stared then inclined her neck as if in submission the banished immortal oh my how may a singing girl from the north district a simple girl ever hope to keep the interest of a man with such illustrious connections tai laughed softly for one thing she isnt simple at all for another she isnt in the north district and her own connections are more potent than his he grinned how else may i assist you he saw her return his smile this time if i said you could kiss me again that would be wrong wouldnt it he took the one step necessary and did so her mouth came up to meet his it was rain who pulled back this time she looked away that was wrong she said forgive me he sat on the bench beside her he was aware that shed left room for him to do so rain your life has changed i have been foolish in my dreaming most of us are foolish in our dreams she said still looking the other away the trouble comes when we bring folly out of dream rain listen to me if i am right if jian is sending a warning to her cousin and it has to do with me does that endanger you she thought about it i dont think so there is a servant who could destroy me but he wont if you were seen here i would be killed she said it matteroffactly but wen zhou is worrying about roshan right now not you an li left the city a few days ago and so did his oldest son i know said tai i spoke with him on the roadside coming here he saw that hed shaken her again he was young enough to feel a flicker of pride in that and old enough to know it was unworthy she said tai what is all this you are in a swift river yes he said because of the horses only that and the ghosts she said what you did the horses come from what i did it is the same she was silent considering that then said sardian horses second thing from that country to change my life she smiled i havent changed your life you might he said rain we cant know what the next days will bring us sima zian thinks something grave is happening he could see her thinking about it he said i have a house in the city now in this ward if you need to get word to me can someone do that if i need to or if i wish to she turned to look at him his turn to smile with every word they spoke some of the old manner was coming back like the steps of another dance it was unsettling he said you were always better at judging you will know if there is danger for you or something i need to be told she took his hand looked at the interlacing of their fingers i think i am not so much better than you any more tai if i ever was you were you are and you risked your life what is it i can do please ask he was wondering how many men had said i love you to this woman late at night he wondered what zhou said to her her head remained lowered as if she were fascinated by their twined fingers on her lap she wore no perfume hed understood why immediately but there was a scent to her to her nearness after so long and it conjured desire drew it forth she said i will have someone learn where your house is if i need to send word i can the man by the wall may be trusted with messages they will get to me the servant here to approach is named hwan no one else she fell silent still gripping his hand when she spoke again her voice had changed i think tai you need to leave or i will relinquish my pride this is more difficult than i thought it would be he drew a breath and for me i am sorry but rain i am also pleased am i permitted to be both she squeezed his hand hard for that it was painful because a ring of hers bit into his skin she meant to hurt him he knew for so neatly echoing her phrase from before how clever she said you students are all alike she released his hand clasped hers together in her lap her gaze remained lowered as if submissively he knew she wasnt submissive at all he didnt want to leave he realized there came a rustling sound from the trees then a voice beyond the spill of light gracious lady master shen someone is walking past the lake we can kill him but it would not be wise it was the kanlin leader where is wei song tai asked quickly farther along the garden awaiting instruction kanlin is the man carrying wine rain asked he is gracious lady she stood up thats hwan do not harm him tai i mean it you must go he hesitated then did something she couldnt see or the kanlin he stood up looked at her in lantern light she clasped her hands before her bowed formally my lord it was too kind of you to visit your servant i will see you again he found it difficult to speak i would like that but it is hard to know the winding of paths as you said my lord tonights was not the greeting i would have most wanted to give you she still knew exactly what to say to set his heart beating nor mine for you he said it pleases me to hear that said spring rain eyes demurely lowered come my lord said the kanlin tai turned and went from her she watches him go down the steps and away into darkness she hadnt even seen the kanlin only heard a voice in the night she looks to her pipa on the railing sees the moths still fluttering then she sees what he has left behind him on the bench where theyve been sitting she picks it up looks at it under the light her hand begins to tremble she swears aloud in a voice that would shock many of the men who once valued her for serene grace in the pavilion of moonlight she looks up the guard had said she calls out wei song are you still there a moment no sound no woman appearing from the blackness then i am my lady how may your servant be of use to you come here out of the night garden the woman comes the one shed met here earlier this year had hired and sent west the kanlin woman bows the servant will be here very soon she says i know he has seen you before i remember rain looks at her a small woman hooded she extends the ring tai has left for her take this give it back to master shen tell him i could never sell it or wear it or even have it cut down to sell without being at risk there is writing on the band this is from the emperor isnt it i have never seen it says the other woman he didnt wear it riding her voice is odd but rain has no time to work that through i believe the emperor might have been with indeed this ring suggests he was or sent someone tell tai he must have this and be seen to have it he has to wear it it will protect him he needs to learn these things he cant go around making gifts of something like this take it the ring is stunningly beautiful even in this light it would match her eyes she believesin fact she is certainthat tai will have thought of that not his reason for doing this but a part of his wanting to the kanlin hesitates then bows again takes the ring i am sorry i failed you she says i did not reach kuala nor and i master shen told me rain says briskly he also said you fought attackers for him and he is alive no one failed do i need to pay you more to continue guarding him the kanlin who is smaller than rain remembered draws herself up straight no she says you do not why not says rain we have been retained by lady wen jian ten of us he is defended she did that i see it is out of my hands then says rain she isnt sure why she says it that way she looks at the woman more closely but the light isnt strong and the kanlin is hooded the other woman seems about to say something she doesnt she goes down the stairs and east through the garden the way the others have gone rain is alone not for long and she knows it she picks up her pipa is tuning it when she hears hwan calling to let her knowquite properlythat he is approaching he comes into the gazebo bearing a round tray with a small brazier heating wine and a cup for her why are you here she asks coldly he stops shaken by her tone he bows handling the tray carefully my lady it is cold now i thought you might want i left instructions did i not hwan she knows why he is here there is a balance to be achieved in this as in all else she needs his devotion but he must not be allowed to assume or presume there are lines to be drawn not to be crossed my lady he says abjectly forgive me your servant thought only that you might that i might want wine very well leave it and go you will not be punished but you are aware that the master has instructed that servants are to be beaten for failing to follow instructions he said it is our task to ensure this it is not she knows the response he expected that is all right she thinks he bows again the tray wobbles slightly put it down and go rain says again she allows her voice to soften it was a kind thought hwan tell my woman that i will be back shortly i will want a fire to take the edge off the night of course my lady he says and backs away do you do you wish an escort back through the garden no she says i just gave you your instructions hwan yes yes my lady she smiles makes certain he sees it she is in the light no one will be told of this you are a loyal servant and i value you for it my lady he says again and leaves her bowing twice dealing with men of all stations and all ranks learning their needs and anxieties is this not what a girl from the north district especially from one of the best houses is supposed to be able to do she actually does want the wine hes brought she removes the top of the warmed flask and pours for herself trained girls know how to pour another skill they are taught she seems to be crying after all she sips the spiced wine and puts down her cup she takes the pipa and begins to play for herself but she knows someone will be listening and she owes him this an emerald ring she is thinking from the emperor perhaps from his own hand tai hadnt said a delicacy in that the world is a place of surpassing strangeness she thinks and then she is thinking without knowing why of her lost home in the west qin saw the man and his guards come back over the wall it was harder to get up and out you needed to be boosted over and the last one had to be exceptionally skilled at climbing the last kanlin was the woman qin saw and she seemed to do it easily the man seemed distracted not even certain which way to walk the kanlins led him away including the two whod been waiting here in the street the fellowclearly an aristocrat of some kind though he wasnt dressed like onedid pause long enough to offer qin two more silver coins that made four in all which was more money than anyone had ever given him out here he saw the last kanlin catch up with the man and draw him aside he saw them speaking saw her hand over something small they walked on farther into the ward and were lost to sight down the street qin had managed to push himself to his feet and offer what passed for a bow with him when he was given the money but he wasnt sure the fellow noticed he sat down again looking at the four coins silver a breeze came up stirring the dust he was thinking about lychees and when theyd reach the markets then he stopped thinking about that from within the garden pipa music began the sound came faintly to him for she was some distance away from where he sat against the wall in the small hut shed had made to shelter him she was playing for him qin knew she was a music more precious than any coins anyone could give he heard sadness sweet and slow in the plucked strings and thought about how a beautiful woman from within her sheltered easeful life of luxury and power was offering sorrow to the spring night for what had been done to him qin listened claimed unconditionally by love he imagined that even the stars were still and listening above the haze and lights of xinan eventually the music stopped and the night street was quiet a dog barked far away chapter xx as he had promised her they see the kitan fortress before sunrise even in the night and far away it is imposing it is another unsettling moment for limei among so many looking under stars at something her own people have built here this heavy squaredoff structure on the grass something set solidly walls rising an assertion about permanence in a world where the presence of mankind was transitory lying lightly on the earth everything carried with you where you went what did it mean wanting to proclaim this permanence was it better or wisera new thought for herto be a people who knew there was no such thing it is as if she thinks looking at the fortress her people have erected some giant heavenly civil servant had taken his scrollstampthe seal he used to signify hed read a documentand dropped it on the grass and left it there there is something so unnatural so foreign about the walled fort being here that she misses the important thing meshag does not he mutters something beside her under his breath in his own tongue and then more clearly he says it is empty she looks quickly over at him how do you know no torches no one on the walls the pastures there should be night guards for the horses something has happened he stares ahead they are on a rise of land the fortress lies in a shallow valley meshag makes a sound to his horse come he says to her i must see fearfully hating her fear she follows him down the fortress is even larger than shed realized which means it is farther away there is a hint of grey in the sky as they finally come up to it limei looks to left and right and now she can see their wolves this close she can see the strangeness of the fort the thing he understood right away there is no one here at all not on the wall walks not above the gates in the squared corner towers this is a hollow structure lifeless she shivers meshag dismounts he walks to a fenced pasture ahead of them goes to the gate which hangs open unlatched it creaks in the wind banging at intervals against the post a thin sound she sees him kneel then walk a distance south and kneel again he stands and looks that way he turns and walks towards the main gate of the fort it is far enough that she loses sight of him against the looming walls in the dark beyond the pasture she sits her horse beside wolves and feels fear blow through her like a wind at length she sees him walking back the loping rigid stride he mounts up his face is never easy to read but she thinks she sees concern in it for the first time when did they leave she asks she knows that is what hes been trying to determine only two days he says towards the wall i do not know why we must ride quickly now they ride quickly they are galloping the horses up out of the valley along the southern ridge the sun about to rise when they are attacked it is called the raiders hour on the steppe though that is not something limei has any way of knowing attacks in darkness can become confused chaotic random daylight undermines surprise twilight and dawn arefor hunters of any kindthe best times limei is able to piece events together only fitfully and only afterwards she experiences the attack in flashes images cries cut off the screaming of horses she is sprawled on the ground before she even understands they are being attacked he must have pushed her down she realizes she looks up a hand to her mouth from deep grass three no four now of the attackers fall before they even come close meshags movements are as smooth as they were when he shot the swan he is shooting men now and it is the same sighting release another arrow nocked and fired he keeps his horse moving wheeling the raiders have bows too she seesthat is why he pushed her down there are a dozen of them at least or there were one more falls even as she watches the others move nearer screaming but there is something strange about their horses they rear and wheel hard to control she is in the grass they can see her horse but not her she doesnt know who these are shuoki or the pursuing bogu come upon them this is a battle she has time to think this was her fathers world all his life men die in battle and women if they find themselves in the wrong place two riders come thundering towards her whipping their mounts into control tracking her by her own horse she can feel the earth vibrate they are close she is going to scream these are not bogu their hair is short shaved on both sides long in the middle there is yellow paint on their faces they are near enough for her to see this and understand that these painted features may be her last sight under nine heavens then the wolves rise up they rise from the grasslands that were theirs to rule before men came with their families and herds whether treading lightly or tryinghopelesslyto set wooden structures down to endure as a stamp upon the land and when the wolves appear from hiding she realizes how many more of them there are than shes been aware of in these days of journeying shes seen only the nearest of themthe lead wolf a handful of others but there are fifty or more rising like grey death in the dawn they have been hidden by the tall grass are not any more they go straight for the shuoki horses panicking them wildly into screams and rigid bucking halts the horses thrash kicking out but to no avail for there are fewer than ten riders left now and five times as many wolves and there is a man if he is a man shooting steadily lethally at them again and again and the wolves are his limei sees a yellowpainted shuoki fall very close to her she hears something crack as he hits the ground he screams in pain in throatraw terror four wolves are on him she looks away burying her face in the earth she hears the man stop screaming she doesnt watch it happen snuffling sounds snarling then another sound she never forgets flesh being torn ripped away nothing frightens her more than wolves she would be dead or taken if they were not here the world is not something to be understood it is vanity illusion to even try her body is shaking where she lies she cant control it and then as suddenly as the first cries came and the terrifying vision of those riders there is stillness again the light of morning dawn wind limei hears birdsong amazingly she makes herself sit up then wishes she had not beside her much too near the dead shuoki is being devoured he is blood and meat the wolves snap and grunt biting down snarling at each other she is afraid she is going to be sick and with the thought she is on her knees in the grass emptied out in spasms a shadow falls she looks up quickly meshag extends one of the water flasks she sits up takes it and unstoppers it she drinks and spits does so again heedless of dignity or grace or any such concepts from another world she drinks again swallows this time then she pours water into her hand and wipes her face does that again too almost defiantly not everything is lost she tells herself not unless you let it be come meshag says to her we take four horses we can change ride more fast will will there be more of these shuoki might be soldiers have gone shuoki come to see why do we know why he shakes his head come he says again he reaches a hand she gives him back the stoppered flask but though he takes it and shoulders it he puts his hand out again and she understands that he is helping her get up he chooses two more horses for each of them the shuoki horses have scattered but are well trained and have not gone far she waits by her own mount and watches him he reclaims his arrows first approaches one shuoki horse examines and leaves it takes another she has no idea how hes making these choices around her hideously the wolves are feeding on the dead she remembers from another life tai telling their father she is in the trees listening how the bogu take their dead out on the grass away from the tribe to be devoured under the sky souls sent back that way the sky is very blue the wind milder today he has left her a flask she drinks again but only a little to take the bad taste from her mouth she watches him ride back he has four horses looped to each other tied to his own he doesnt appear to say anything at all but suddenly wolves spring up and lope away to be lost in the grass limei takes her reins and does the leap not graceful shes taught herself to get up on a horse without his aid when you lose your access to pride in almost all things perhaps you find it somewhere else she says shouldnt two of them be tied behind mine to make it easier not easier we must go wait please he does wait the sun is washing the land in morning light his eyes are dark nothing comes back from them forgive me she says i told you when i dont understand it makes me fearful i am better when i know things he says nothing she says can you do you control wolves do they follow you he looks away north the way theyve come says nothing for so long she thinks hes chosen not to answer but he hasnt moved yet she hears birds singing looks up almost involuntarily for a swan he says not all one pack this one the lead wolf is near them again he is always close to limei she looks at him fights a new horror and an old fear she turns back to meshag the black eyes the wolfs are so much brighter the man is waiting she says only thank you he twitches his reins and she follows him south leaving the dead behind under birds and the sky under stars that same night they have ridden all day two brief halts no cooking fires berries only but theyve stopped by a pond this time limei takes off her clothes and bathes in the dark a need to wash away the memory of flesh being shredded the sound it made after dressing again she asks him what you said before about the wolves this is because of what was done to you it is easier to ask in the night he has been crouching in the grass after watering the horses she sees him look away she says im sorry you dont have to he says shaman in north was making me a wolfsoul bound to him his command hard magic bad not not done wolf his totem creature he summoned a wolf to come your brother killed him as he was doing this i was i am caught between between there are frogs in the pond she hears them croaking in the night he says man and wolf this body and the other the other she looks over against her will the lead wolf is in the grass the grey shape shed seen him tearing flesh at sunrise blood dripping from those jaws the animal looks back at her steadily she can barely make it out but these eyes unlike meshags seem to shine a fearful sensation comes over limei and the realization that it would be wrong wrong for her to push him more to ask for more she lowers her head her hair is wet she feels it dripping down her back but the night is mild she says i am sorry perhaps it would have been better if tai had not no he says strongly she looks up quickly startled he stands a shape against horizon and stars better this than what i would have been i am i have choices if that shaman bind me i am only his and then die shandai gave me this she looks up at him he says i choose to come for you to honour shan shendai and after after this she had just decided not to ask more questions he makes his oneshoulder shrug she looks over at the wolf again a shadow more than something you can see there is a question she cannot ask ride now he actually puts it as a question thank you she says limei gets up and walks over and mounts one of her horses by herself they are changing mounts every time they stop just before sunrise he shoots a second swan but a third one following behind wheels away west very high someone had a wolf for a totem she thinks someone has a swan you can fall asleep on a horse but not when it is galloping limei collapses into an aching fitful slumber whenever he allows a halt she knows why hes pushing so hard since shooting the second swan but body and mind have their demands she lies on her back in shorter grass now consciousness reasserts recedes she has been dreaming of swingingthe swing in the garden at homearcing higher and higher among spring blossoms back and forth she doesnt know who is pushing her she never looks to see but she is not afraid the pushing is meshag shaking her shoulder she opens her eyes pale light morning he hands her the water flask gestures towards the saddlebag beside her more berries if there are further days of nothing but this limei thinks a rabbit eaten raw might begin to seem appealing then she remembers the wolves and the shuoki and that thought slides away she drinks splashes water on her hands and face takes a fistful of the berries and then does it again she has learned to avoid the unripe ones picks them out she is a kitai princess isnt she shes too weary to be amused by her own irony she gets to her feet her legs hurt and her back meshag is already mounted he is scanning the sky as it brightens she does the same nothing to be seen another fresh day high clouds she goes to the horse hes freed from the line for her she flexes stiff limbs and gets herself into the saddle shes become better at this she thinks she looks at him it will change now he says what do you mean the land you will see we are leaving the steppe your wall is not far even fatigued as she is this makes her heart beat faster just the words the wall means kitai and an exiles return if they can get through it to the other side hed said they could we are leaving the steppe she looks back turning in the saddle as far as she can see under the risen sun and the high sky the grass stretches yellowgreen darker green tall moving in the breeze there is a sound to its swaying and that sound has been a part of her existence since the bogu claimed her even in the sedan chair shed heard it incessantly the murmur of the steppe gazing north her eyes filled with this vista imagining how far it goes she thinks if there was a morning in the world this is the way it looked and that is not a thought natural to her people they start south limei looks to left and then right and sees the lead wolf beside them the others are out there she knows but this one is always near by midday the land begins rising the grass is shorter differently textured darker and there are clumps of green and silvergreen shrubbery and then bare rock in places when she sees a stand of poplar trees it is almost shocking she realizes she isnt fatigued any more they cross a shallow river on the other bank meshag halts to let the horses drink he refills the water flasks limei dismounts as well to stretch her aching legs she keeps looking at the sky more wind today the clouds moving east sometimes they pass before the sun and a shadow slides along the land and then away she says do you know how close they are behind us he stoppers the flasks he takes the line that holds the four horses behind his and makes the changes needed to give each of them new mounts he swings himself up and limei does the same he says most of a day i think we are enough ahead she is afraid to ask him how he knows this but she also thinks she knows the answer not all the wolves are with them here thank you she says they begin to ride again south under the high sky and the coming and going of light and shadow across the changing land one more stop midafternoon he switches their horses again they see a swan late in the day flying too high for an arrow a little after that they crest the long steady rise of land they have been climbing there is a downward slope in front of them beyond it stretching to the ends of sight west and east lit by the long late sun is the wall he has brought her home tazek karad had never made any real distinction between the nomads of the grasslands however much they might have hated each other he looked out over shuoki lands now having been abruptly shifted two hundred li east of his normal gatehouse on the wall both the shuoki and the bogu were domesticated nosewiping sheepherders to him their women dominated them in their yurts by day and by night that his fellow kislik joked was why so many of the steppemen slept with their sheep they might boast of their thickmaned horses of battling grassland wolves hunting gazelle but what did these things mean to a kislik his were a people of the desert where men murdered for half a cup of water and sometimes drank the blood of the victim too where youd have to drag your camel down to the ground and shelter against it wrapping your face completely to try to survive a sandstorm the deserts killed these steppes nurtured life you could make a guess couldnt you as to which land produced harder more worthy men tazek would have denied it if someone had called him bitter still when it came to talking about worthy you could make a case that command of only fifty men in the kitan sixth army after twelve years along or north of the wall was not even close to showing proper respect a dui was nothing he ought to have had two hundred or more by now true kitai and its empire had fed and clothed him since he was fifteen and had made women and wine or kumiss more often available for soldiers posted along the wall true he had not died in desert sand as his father and two brothers had serving the kitan emperor was a way of life and not the worst but surely anyone worth being named a man wanted to rise to move nearer the centre what sort of person would come this close and look and say it is enough what i have i dont need more not the person tazek karad was at any rate add the factit was on his recordthat hed accepted uncomplainingly doubled sixmonth shifts at outpost forts in the grasslands three times and you had to concede that the officers either had it in for him for some reason or they were just too incompetent in the sixth district to recognize a man ready for promotion not that he was bitter part of the problem was that the flaccid sheeplovers of the steppe were too quiet these days the bogu had become a subject people of the emperor selling him horses at the spring gathering by the rivers loop requesting kitan intervention in their own squabbles but not fighting nearly enough in those to let good soldiers engage in the sort of actions that got you promoted the shuoki were more contentious and the forts in their landsnear fort and far fort the soldiers called themsaw some combat the nomads here had even tried to break through weak places in the wall on raids a mistake and theyd suffered for it but the two outpost forts and the wall below them had been manned by soldiers of roshans seventh army so the glory and citations from that fighting didnt get anywhere near tazek karad or his fellows in the sixth in the sixth army they supervised horse trading heard whining complaints about sheep raids levelled by one rancidsmelling tribe against another and let longhaired bogu riders through with furs and amber destined for markets in xinan or yenling it was predictable safe unspeakably dull until four days ago when dui commander tazek karad had received urgent orders to lead his fifty men east to take up a position at the gatehouse and towers directly south of near fort other officers and men went with them some halting sooner some going farther east thinning the numbers at their own guard posts along the way changing orders overtook a number of them causing confusion there was an apparent need to move quickly the emerging report was that the soldiers of the seventh along the wall had been withdrawn all of them they were gone the gates and the watchtowers between gates were undefended it was almost inconceivable no one told them why no ranking officer in the sixth army anyhow would bother telling a lowly commander of fifty men anything nor did anyone explain why just two days ago the garrison soldiers of the seventh and eighth posted in near fort and far fort had come marching and riding back both armies together thousands upon thousands of them funnelling through the wall section tazek now controlled they disappeared south through a curtain of dust that took most of the morning to settle leaving an eerie empty silence behind soldiers had asked soldiers what was happening as the garrisons passed through soldiers didnt know they never did and although army life was almost always lived in a state of ignorance and one grew accustomed to that there were times when sudden and shifting orders could unsettle the most dour and steady of minor officers even one with the western desert in his blood the sight of the seventh and eighth garrisons approaching his gate and passing through and disappearing south had done that for tazek karad he felt exposed looking north he was commanding an important unfamiliar gate he was undermanned and he was above shuoki lands now a man might want the chance to fight the barbarians earn a reputation but if the nomads raided right now in any numbers he and his men could be in serious difficulty and with both forts emptied out there was a good chance the shuoki would come down to at the very least see what was happening here tazek didnt even want to think about what they would do to the two forts not his problem until someone made it so he stood in the wooden gatehouse at sundown and looked east and west along the rise and fall and rise of the long wall of kitai to where it vanished in each direction theyd used rammed earth to build it here above the grasslands pressed between wooden frames mixed with lime and gravel carted north theyd used stones hed been told where the wall climbed towards mountains over rocks it was a staggering achievement difficult to think about they said it stretched for six thousand li they said four hundred thousand men had died in building and rebuilding it over the centuries tazek believed that last part he hated the wall hed lived twelve years of his life defending it one of his men said something he was pointing north tazek sighted along the mans extended finger two traders approaching still far off a string of horses behind them here in shuoki lands this was uncommon it was the bogu who went back and forth who had the spring meeting by the golden rivers bend where thousands of horses were brought and bought and led away south for the kitan armys endless need the shuoki traded more sporadically often the goods were stolen horsesoften from the bogu it wouldnt surprise tazek if that were so now as the pair drew nearer he saw four horses in addition to the two being ridden in theory he could arrest the wouldbe traders hold them for tribal justice which was never pretty and keep the horses as the price of inconveniencing kitan soldiers in reality they tended to let traders through standard army policy these days horses mattered too much you wanted the nomads to keep bringing them they would stop if it meant being captured the usual practice was for the gate commander to accept discreet compensation for looking the other way while stolen goods went into kitai he waited for the thieving shuoki to get closer he had questions to ask he needed information more than the horse or the handful of coins theyd likely offer their mounts were tired he saw even the ones being led on a rope theyd been ridden hard probably confirmation they were stolen tired horses sold for less tazek stared stonily down at the approaching riders he wasnt a happy man the two men came up to his gate and halted below they werent shuoki first sign of the unexpected request to pass through with horses to sell the larger one said he was a bogu you could see it in the hair he spoke kitan like the barbarian he was the smaller one was hooded sometimes they did that out of fear in the presence of kitan soldiers well fear was proper wasnt it this was a father and son tazek decided stealing together but it was a surprise to find bogu this far east especially just a pair of them not his problem his problems were different what have you seen to the north thieving bogu he demanded what do you mean no reaction to the insult tazek noted the garrison fortress empty agreed the big man he was barechested kept his eyes cast down this too was normaland appropriate these were barbarians talking to an officer in the sixth army of kitai the man said tracks of horses and men go this way they not come here that was none of his business was it what about the other fort not go so far but many soldiers go this way more than one fort two days maybe he didnt look up but he had it right the nomads knew how to read their grass anything happen up there happen you see any shuoki no said the big one i need a better answer snarled tazek no honourable sir the man said which would have been funny some other time any of those shiteaters coming this way you see them no shuoki there are bogu behind us why we are we are exiled from tribe honourable sir and that put an answer in place as to why these two were so far east interesting that they were being pursued but not interesting enough the tribes had their laws if they stayed north of the wall and didnt bother the garrisons it had nothing to do with kitai or with tazek karad of the sixth it could however get complicated if the bogu showed up and he was seen letting these two through there were horses horses mattered tazek looked north emptiness he nodded to the man beside him open them up he looked down at the two riders where you taking these these horses requested by kanlins the bigger man said a surprise you aim to go all the way to stone drum mountain with these requested by them three smaller horses some kanlin are women well the gods send a sandstorm to blind fools as if tazek didnt know some of the blackrobed ones were women and that the women could kill you as easily as the men in that case we have a problem my shirtless friend stone drum is what six days i am not letting bogu horsethieves ride alone that far through kitai it is only four days dui officer you are properly cautious but it is all right we are here to escort them the voice was behind him speaking impeccable kitan tazek turned quicklyand saw three kanlin warriors astride their horses just inside his gates it had happened to him before they could be right up on you in among you before you were aware theyd even been approaching two men one woman he saw they had hoods down in the evening light carried swords across their backs bows in saddles tazek stared down if hed been unhappy before it was as nothing now how did you know they were coming he demanded the first kanlin smiled he seemed amused it had been arranged he said it is not hard to watch for riders from places along the wall well fuck your bythehour mother tazek wanted to say you learn anything about the garrison soldiers the ones who came through seventh and eighth armies the kanlin said promptly they are all moving south do you have enough people to deal with this stretch of the wall course i do snapped tazek as if he was going to admit anything to a blackrobe good the man said equably be generous enough to let our horses through and please accept for you and your soldiers some rice wine we have brought as a humble offering to those who defend us here it might be better than what you have might be better it couldnt help but be better because the accursed soldiers of the seventh the ones posted here before the ones whod gone away south had taken all the wine and most of the food stores with them he had sent word about the stores as soon as theyd arrived he was expecting provisions from the west as soon as tomorrow with luck on the other hand the sun was going down and a dry night stretched ahead he nodded to the three in the black robes and then to the soldier beside him the man barked the orders the gate bars were pulled back the heavy gates swung inward slowly the bogu father and son waited then rode through with their horses three of the horses were tazek saw smaller ones he still didnt know how the kanlin had gotten a message a request for horses through the wall to bogu exiles that part didnt make sense he was trying to decide if it mattered he decided it didnt not his problem he looked down and saw that the three kanlins had dismounted and were shifting flasks from their pack horse into the extremely eager hands of his own soldiers hold off opening those till i get down he shouted hed need to count and estimate figure out how to do this but rice wine meant that at least one good thing had happened today pretty much the only good thing he was turning to go down the steps when out of the corner of his eye he saw a grey shape streak through the gate the fuck was that he roared a wolf i think the kanlin leader said looking up it just went through my wall tazek shouted the kanlin shrugged they do go back and forth well shoot it for you if we see it is there a bounty this spring there sometimes was it depended how many there were tazek had just arrived here he was short of men of food of water and wine and he had no idea what had happened with the seventh and eighth no he said sourly there might well have been a bounty for all he knew but he felt like saying no to someone shoot it anyhow the kanlin nodded and turned the five of them rode off the extra horses trailing after the big barechested bogu tazek watched them for a while discontented something was still bothering him a thought teasing at the edge of his mind then he remembered the wine and went quickly down the stairs he never did chase down that stray thought when a party of bogu riders appeared the next morning he ordered his men to begin shooting as soon as the riders were in arrow range he was undermanned he did not want the nomads to get close enough to realize it they were chasing the horsethieves obviously well hed made his decision to let those two pass through an officer in the kitan army didnt show uncertainty or doubt to barbarians or his men you didnt get promoted that way and your soldiers would lose faith in you they were allowed to hate you they just couldnt worry about your competence he watched the bogu withdraw out of range and linger there arguing amongst each other they had wolfhounds with them he saw he had no idea what the quarrel was about he didnt care he watchedwith the quiet satisfaction of a man who had done his assigned task welluntil they turned and rode off two swans appeared flying towards the wall tazek let his men amuse themselves shooting at them they brought one down the other wheeled away higher and went back towards the steppes she is in kitai again the kanlins silent courteous bring them to an inn as darkness falls limei sees torchlight and lanterns hears music she is shown by bowing servants to a room with walls and a bed and she bathes in a brazierheated bath chamber with hot water and servants to attend her and she weeps as they wash her hair her hands are shaking the girls make pitying sounds when they see her nails and fingers and one of them spends a long time with brush and file doing the best she can with them limei weeps through this as well they tease her gently trying to make her smile they tell her they cannot paint her eyebrows or cheeks if she will insist on crying she shakes her head and they leave her face unpainted for this first night she hears the wind outside and the knowledge that it will be outside tonight that she will sleep sheltered sinks into her like a promise like warm wine she goes downstairs unadorned but in clean robes and sandals and sits with the kanlin warriors in the dining pavilion they speak politely and gracefully one addresses her by name they know who she is fear for a swift shattering moment until she understands that if they were going to expose her reveal her identity theyd have done so at the wall you are taking me to stone drum mountain she asks the leader an older man nods his head both of you he says my lady how do you know who i am the briefest hesitation we were told he says do you know who is with me who he is a nod they wish to see him at stone drum as well limei realizes that there is wine in front of her she sips carefully it has been a long time since she drank rice wine why she asks the kanlins exchange glances the woman is very pretty limei thinks she has silver hairpins for the evening the older man says you will be told when you are there questions will be answered but you do know your brother was among us once so it is tai she thinks it is tai again even so far away one brother had exiled her another is drawing her home he told us that when he left stone drum some of you some were not some were not happy no the kanlin leader says he smiles not everyone who comes to the mountain becomes a warrior the woman says she sips her wine fills three cups she gestures with the flask to limei who shakes her head where is meshag she asks hes outside of course wooden walls a wooden roof a room full of people kitan people hell be out in the night he knows although the land is no longer known a thought occurs to her you mustnt kill the wolf she says we know that says the kanlin leader the wolves are why they want to speak with him at the mountain she looks at him a thought forms it was a wolf that brought you word of our coming wasnt it you werent looking out from the wall for us it sounds impossible even as she says it but he nods his head you are very like your brother he says she begins to cry again you knew him i taught shen tai for a time i sorrowed when he left us i asked to be one of those sent to bring his sister she is not a woman who cries they wait patient even amused she wipes her eyes with her sleeve she says looking at the leader what has happened the armies have all left the garrisons the wall why again they look at each other the older one says i think it is better if you are told this at the mountain there is something to tell he nods his head she asks no more questions she eats with them and there is a singer not very skilled but they are in a remote place and then limei goes to her chamber and sleeps in a bed and dreams of wolves there are three more nights travelling meshag stays with them she wasnt certain he would do that he keeps to himself sleeps outside each night she never sees the wolf though shed watched him burst through the gate at the wall on the second day she sees stone drum mountain for the first time rising from tableland magnificently alone green slopes like jade in the sun one of the five holy mountains on the fourth afternoon they reach it the kanlins lead them up a slow switchback path along the forested slope until finally they come to the flat summit that gives the mountain its name where the sanctuary is and she is welcomed there with courtesy because of her brother and that evening she is told as promised what has happenedby the wall and elsewhereand what it means for the empire and the times into which they have been born at least three historians of a later dynasty working within the hall of records after it had been rebuilt expressed the view that tens of millions of people might have been spared famine war displacement and death if someone had stopped the kingfisherfeathered carriage of governor an li as it sped northeast that spring returning to his own territories and his armies the soldiers of the command posts that carriage passed had no reason to do so the historians agreed they were not attaching censure to the officers and men who watched it go by rolling heavily through mild days and nights along the roads of kitai they were only observing a truth the historians wrote others from the same period and later dissented these writers suggested that truth when examining events and records of the past was always precarious uncertain no man could say for certain how the river of time would have flowed cresting or receding bringing floods or gently watering fields had a single event or even many unfolded differently it is in the nature of existence under heaven the dissenting scholars wrote that we cannot know these things with clarity we cannot live twice or watch as moments of the past unfurl like a courtesans silk fan the river flows the dancers finish their dance if the music starts again it is starting anew not repeating itself having noted this having made the countervailing argument as carefully and in one case as lyrically as possible these historians without exception appeared to join in accepting the number of forty million lives as a reasonable figure for the consequences of the an li rebellion chapter xxi an tsao second son of general an li resided in the taming palace and had done so for three years enjoying the many pleasures of courtly life and the honours appropriate to a son of a distinguished father he had formal rank as a commander of one thousand in the flying dragon palace guard butalong with most other officers in a largely symbolic armyhis days were spent hunting in the deer park or farther afield playing polo or riding abroad in pursuit of diversion with sons of aristocrats mandarins and senior officers of the army his nights were given over to pleasure in various houses of the north district or among sleek lithe women invited to city mansions or the palace itself to entertain the wealthy and empowered with their music and their bodies on the same day word reached the taming of his fathers rebellion in the northeast roshan proclaiming himself emperor of kitai and founder of the tenth dynasty an tsao was decapitated in a garden of the palace the engraved sword that did this was wielded by the first minister wen zhou himself a big man skilled with a blade somewhat impulsive this action was widely considered among senior mandarins to have been a mistake even at the time the son had been useful alive as a hostage or an earnest of good faith in negotiating peace dead he was worthless and possibly worse than that if the father proved vengeful wen zhou was also of course the proclaimed reason for general ans treacherous rising the need to free the empire from the reckless incompetent stewardship of a corrupt first minister whose presence in power proved that the aged emperor had lost his wayand the mandate of heaven that was the declaration sent in a letter to the taming carried by a kanlin courier the kanlins were important in times of conflict they could be hired and trusted by either side given this stated cause of revolt the fact that wen zhou had killed the son himself was seen by many with wringing of hands and shaking of heads as worrisome it was noted by some however that judgments and reactions among the civil service in those first days of the rebellion could not be called calm or poisedor sound there was in truth panic in the palace and abroad an attempt to suppress news of the rebellion proved predictably unsuccessful xinan was not a place where tidings could readily be contained and once word spread through the capital it began running everywhere someone said that a red fireball had been seen in the northern sky the week before that this had been reported to the astrologers in the school of unrestricted night true or not there was an army a large one in the north and it appeared to be moving down towards the second city of the empire the obvious initial target yenling was east of xinan nearer the great canal on the far side of teng pass roshans advance put nearly a million of the emperors loving subjects in extreme peril behind those city walls they were likely to surrender a number of cities north of the golden river had already done so it appeared word came that roshan was treating prefecture officials with courtesy that many were crossing over to him it was difficult to judge the truth of this distances were great communication became uncertain there were obvious truths the armies to resist roshan were south and west and northwest and could not possibly reach yenling in time to defend it the best they could doand it became the immediate military planwas to defend teng pass in making these decisions it was agreed first minister wen showed decisiveness and confidence amid military leaders and mandarins in various stages of terror and uncertainty he expressed the steady view than an li would falter soon that turmoil behind him would stop his progress kitai he declared would never accept or support an illiterate barbarian as emperor as soon as people started to think this through events would take their course the sixth army was pulled back from the rivers bend and stations along the wall and sent east to disrupt roshans supply lines put the northeast in play force some of his rebel soldiers back that way the second and third and fifth armies were commanded to proceed as fast as they could to seize and hold teng pass five thousand of the flying dragon palace guard were sent there immediately from xinan these were hardly distinguished soldiers but the pass was narrow famously so and could be held for a time by even a small number if they had any courage at all and adequate commanders it had happened this way many times in the history of kitai yenling was sent instructions to hold out as best it could delaying the rebels mattered the first and fourth armies were kept where they were along the northwestern and western borders calamity would result if kitai lost control of the silk road fortresses and the corridors there and it was considered unwise to withdraw from the tagurans at any time from the south would come three other armies but messengers had a long way to go just to summon them and those forces would be some time in coming wen zhou predicted a short campaign others were less certain roshan had command of the seventh eighth and ninth and had merged them these soldiers were the most battlehardened in kitai and since general an had not been shifted from district to districtonce the rule for military governorstheir loyalty to him was absolute if the golden river was crossed and yenling besieged they would have made their own commitment roshan had also been the imperial stablemaster for years and had assigned to his own cavalry the best of the horses obtained from the bogu at the rivers loop each spring in hindsight not the wisest power to have given him either beyond all of this as if this were not enough to make a civil servant panic appeasing the northeast had always been a delicate matter for this dynasty that region was the home of powerful families with intermarrying lineages that they claimed truthfully or not went back a thousand years to the first dynasty itself there were many in the northeast who saw the ninth dynasty as illbred interlopers xinans measures to reform taxation and land ownership to the benefit of the farmers had not been well received in the northeast the aristocracy there called themselves the five families and their response to rebellion could not be known with certainty it was entirely possible that they might see a gross illiterate general in precarious health as an improvement for their own purposes because he would surely be transitory and easily manipulated once change was set in motion clever men could very well shape where it went and as it happened both chin hai the first minister who had instituted the loathed reforms and wen zhou now were from southern families and therefore rivals it could matter something like that another element might also be important someone pointed out in the taming it was the imperial heir who said this given the size of the empire the vast distances that had to be dealt with for communication and the always critical importance of cavalry two hundred and fifty sardian horses were suddenly even more important than before the second son of general shen gao was summoned to the palace the message from the court came at the end of two weeks of intense frustration even before news of rebellion began to run through xinan tai had heard stories of how slowly the wheels of the taming turned in matters such as audiences granted and decisions made within the multitude of layers in the civil service there were one hundred and forty thousand mandarins in xinan through the nine degrees speed was not a strength hed never had anything near the importance that would have caused him to experience this directly had never been someone who might expect a summons to court in anticipation or apprehension that had changed he wore the emperors ring he hadnt wanted to hadnt even wanted to keep it thinking it more important for rain to have a secret access to funds for her in the event of of what and had he entirely lost his bearings in the world to think she couldnt find jewellery to sell if she needed to in that compound concubine to the first minister how else he thought ruefully had she managed to hire a kanlin warrior in the first place hed asked wei song about that predictably shed given him a scornful glance as if as if a kanlin would answer such a question she wasnt the one whod made him wear the ring though shed brought it back to him in the street the night they climbed the wall two weeks ago he hadnt seen rain since then hadnt seen many people at all and the summons to the palace had not come his kanlins had told him he could not go to the north district too dangerous theyd said the lanes and alleys after dark he knew those alleys extremely well no one can attack me now tai had snapped angrily the horses are my protection remember only from a known assassin the kanlin leader had replied calmly his name was lu chen not if it is unknown who attacks you if they escape how do you plan to stop me from going tai had demanded song had been present that evening behind her leader head lowered hair neatly pinned hands in the sleeves of her robe hed suddenly remembered the first time hed seen her coming across the courtyard at iron gate fortress just risen from sleep her hair unbound it wasnt so long ago he thought he knew her well enough by now to read her posture for a kanlin she didnt hide her feelings well she was angry he could see it we cant stop you master shen lu chen said quietly but our assigned task from the precious consort and the imperial heir is to guard you and xinan is an uncertain place you understand that if harm comes to you all of us forfeit our lives song looked up then he could see fury in her eyes thats thats not fair tai said lu chen blinked as if this was an observation that had no immediately obvious meaning tai didnt go to the north district he didnt try to see his brother either though the thought crossed his mind several times a day that he might as well just go to lius house and confront him he knew liu spent many nights at the taming in the purple myrtle court of the mandarins but it was easy enough to have a servant track his movements he had servants now and a steward who seemed effective and alarmingly dedicated he had a city mansion he could ride out or even be carried out in a sedan chair and confront liu such a falsesounding word confront to say what that what liu had done to their sister was a disgrace to their fathers name hed already said that at mawai liu would simply disagree again smoothly and the bitter truth was that most menand womenat higher levels of the court would agree with adviser liu the first ministers trusted counsellor and not with his inexperienced younger brother how could it possibly be wrong to have a sister elevated to the imperial family how could that not be a glorious thing for the shen line did it not border upon an insult to the phoenix throne to even hint at less than rapture the offence the nature of the wrong was unique to their family to their father and how hed seen the world and perhaps in truth only to general shen as hed become later in life after kuala nor on the other hand tai could accuse his brother of trying to have him killed he could do that the conversation there was even more predictable and he wasnt sure in any case about this if he ever was certain his proper task might be to kill his brother he wasnt ready to do that late one night struggling with a poem he looked out the window at the stars and an almostfull moon shining and realized it was likely he never would be ready to do that someone might call it a weakness wen zhou he avoided easy enough one didnt encounter the prime minister in the marketplace or riding outside the walls sima zian visited often sharing wine and talk and notquitesober good humour he urged patience or careless indifference in the waiting period depending on his own mood tai made sure the poet had chambers in his new mansion ink and good paper spiced wine kept warm and whatever else he might want zian came and went spent some nights with tai others abroad he wasnt forbidden the north district tai rode dynlal in long lake park the vast green space in the southwest of the city was open to all and much loved he took the track around the lake under plum blossom trees there were memories here as if in ambush gatherings with friends three years ago less than that rain and other girlsallowed out from the pavilion of moonlight three days each month and at festivals tai even had images of xin lun from that time when they were all students together dreaming of what might be lun who was playful and brilliant in the general view likeliest of them all to pass the examinations with honours rise to rank and distinction in the purple myrtle court the general view hadnt been especially reliable tai found himself thinking as he rode wei song was with him on those rides with four of the other kanlins all of them poised alert even before word of roshans rising came and panic began heads would turn to watch as they rode past who was this unsmiling man on a magnificent sardian horse guarded by the blackrobed ones who indeed he had never been inside the palace never nearer than standing in crowds at festivals to receive the emperors elevated blessing xin lun made the same joke every time how did they know it was glorious emperor taizu up there so far away in white and gold three hundred thousand bodies could be in the square at festivals a crushing dangerous press in the vast space before the tamings inner wall people did die trampled a lack of air sometimes knifed in a quarrel then kept upright by the dense mass of people even after they were dead while the murderer squeezed himself away nimblefingered thieves could retire on what they stole at such times lun had said that too often there was no crowd this morning as tai rode up with his kanlins the gold bird guards were present in numbers keeping traffic moving briskly through the square and along the streets no one was being permitted to linger and look up at the palace not with a rebellion under way order and flow were the mandate tai realized or at the very least a simulation of such things the illusion of calm appearances mattered his own appearance was formal his steward had been unyielding the man showed indications of being a tyrant tai wore blue liao silk two layers two shades a wide black belt black shoes a soft felt hat also black the pins holding it placed carefully by the steward himself were gold with ivory elephants for decoration tai had no notion how hed come to own gold hatpins with elephants he wore the emperors ring the emerald was noted he saw by all those in the chamber into which he was finally ushered he had proceeded under escort through five enormous courtyards and then after dismounting and leaving dynlal with his kanlins who were not allowed any farther up a prodigiously wide flight of fifty stairs through two large chambers into this one the ceiling supported by massive pillars of pinkandyellow marble twelve men were seated crosslegged on couch platforms advisers standing behind them servants in the distant corners of the room at the head of the gathering was wen zhou tai made a point of meeting his gaze and so tracked the prime ministers glance as he approached approaching took time the room was ridiculously oversized he had to cross an arched marble bridge over a pool there were pearls embedded in the railings of the bridge because he was watching refusing to look away he saw when the first ministers expression shifted from frigid to uneasyin the moment wen zhous gaze registered the emerald ring sima zian had predicted this would happen it was very simple hed said the night before drinking the seasons first lycheeflavoured wine tai had not yet been formally received newcomers to the court were not seen by the emperor without precise observance of protocol and priority no one knew of the emperors visit through the walls at mawai two weeks ago the ring was a signature it was known to be taizus and tomorrow a new arrival a man who hadnt even taken the examinations let alone passed them who had no military rank that mattered no claim by birth to favour was going to walk into the taming wearing the emperors ring the poet had expressed a wish that he could be there to see it tai looked away from the first minister beyond him to his brother behind wen zhou for the first time in his lifeand it was unsettlinghe saw extreme anxiety in lius face staring back at him tai stopped with his palace escort beside the platform couch opposite the first ministers the one evidently left for him he bowed turning slightly each time to include all those here he saw the heir shinzu halfway along one side the prince had a cup of wine the only one there who did he smiled at tai if he noticed the ring if it surprised him there was no sign of it tai had briefly wondered if jian would be here but it had been an idle thought women did what they did behind such scenes as thisnot among a council tasked with running an empire facing an armed rebellion hed known not being a complete innocent that the emperor would not be present once he might have been not any more kitais glorious emperor would receive a reportor more than onein due course although tai looked around trying to do so casually there were tall room screens behind zhou between him and the doors at the back if someone wanted to listen and observe unseen it would not be difficult the servants would see him or her but servants didnt matter be seated second son of shen gao zhous voice was almost casual we have been discussing the movements of the sixth army this does not concern you your presence has been solicited on a small matter by the imperial heir tai nodded and bowed again to the prince he gathered his robes and sat down opposite the first minister there was something almost too direct about that shinzu was between them on tais right side wen zhou went on we saw no reasonas evernot to accede to the illustrious princes wish to summon you we tai thought he wasnt sure what that meant he inclined his head again i am anxious to be of any possible assistance among such august company well said zhou airily i believe i have a sense of what his excellency has been thinking in truth the matter is already in hand indeed how so first minister it was shinzu and though he still held his wine cup at a lazy indifferent angle his voice wasnt lazy at all instinctively tai glanced at his brother again lius expression was transparently unhappy suddenly uneasy himself tai looked back at the prime minister zhou said with an easy gesture it is the western horses of course my lord prince how else could this fellow be of significance accordingly i dispatched twenty men yesterday to fetch them from the tagurans i trust your lordship is pleased he smiled tai stood up it was almost certainly barbaric he thought to do so at such a gathering it might even be an offence there were precise rules for how one spoke to power in the taming especially if one had no proper standing he didnt care what was astonishing was how calm hed suddenly become it was when you cared he thought that you felt at risk he said without any salutation did you ask your adviser my brother before you did that did liu really let you do something so foolish there was a shocked silence wen zhou stiffened have a care master shen you are in this room only he is in this chamber at my invitation first minister as you noted what were you about to say master shen while wearing my revered fathers ring as a sign of very great honour so he had noticed the prince put down his wine tai couldnt help himself he looked again at the room screens behind zhou it was impossible to tell if anyone might be behind them he bowed again before answering i only asked a question august lord perhaps my brother might be allowed to answer if the first minister remains disinclined my advisers do not speak for me wen zhou snapped shinzu nodded briskly a sound policy it would undermine confidence in the first minister even further if they did so tell us was this done after consultation with your advisers even further no possible way to miss that the proceedings of the first ministry are hardly a matter for this council decisions are taken in widely varied ways anyone with experience of governance knows that a return arrow shot at a dissolute prince perhaps said shinzu but i must tell you i would dismiss any adviser who had urged me to send those men ah the prince wishes now to discuss the staff of the first ministry too boring in every possible way shinzu smiled thinly wen zhou did not smile back my lord prince this man has not yet been received by the emperor he is placed in the list for attendance until he appears before the phoenix throne he cannot leave the city the horses matter as you have said yourself therefore i sent for them what my lord do you wish to tell me is improper about that it sounded impeccably reasonable it wasnt tai opened his mouth but the prince was before him i wish to tell you that those men were stopped on the imperial road last night at the first posting station this time zhou stood up protocol was taking a fearful beating here tai thought his heart was racing no one would dare such a thing wen zhou snapped a few of us might have thought it necessary but only one would dare you are almost correct first minister your riders were halted by soldiers of the second military district who happened to still be at mawai after escorting master shen tai from the west what is this how can we defend ourselves against roshan if we if we ignore very clear information as to the conditions under which those horses will be released master shen is required by the tagurans to collect them himself they are his zhou shook his head he was taut with fury the sardian horses are a gift to kitai from the exalted emperors own beloved daughter the tagurans would not embarrass themselves by denying a gift merely because a small aspect of the transfer please said tai zhou stopped they all looked at him my lord first minister allow your adviser to speak for himself not for you brother did you urge this course upon him liu cleared his throat as all eyes turned to him he was an accomplished speaker with a real skill at pitching volume and tone to circumstances he had worked at this all his life from before he could grow a beard he was visibly uneasy now he looked from wen zhou to the prince he said his gracious lordship the prince was surely correct when he suggested we require those horses more than ever with the need to communicate over great distances which is why i invited your brother to join us said shinzu the horses are an honour given to one man if twenty soldiers simply ride up to the border and demand them well be insulting tagur by ignoring their conditions wed shame ourselves with our actions who stopped my men wen zhou said ignoring what the prince had said there was a hard edge to his voice a wolf cornered tai thoughtor thinking he might be tai knew by now zhou had to know as well your cousin gave the orders said shinzu quietly the lady wen jian told me i might say as much if asked it would have had to be her tai thought and it meant so much that she would do this that she was watching her cousin so closely the empire was facing open rebellion and the two men shed favoured had tried to keep in balance were at the centre of that one in this room one with his armies moving even now the prince paused then added even more softly also i was to tell you that she has now spoken with that man of yours the one stopped some weeks ago riding south the one who had killed xin lun a conversation i should enjoy learning about said zhou with genuinely impressive calm but this is a far more important matter my lord first minister tai said and he said it formally this time the august prince is surely right we risk losing two hundred and fifty sardian horses the terms of a supremely generous gift one far beyond my deserving were conveyed i wrote myself so did the tagurans so did the commander of iron gate fortress how vulgar and vainglorious to see yourself as so important second son of shen gao and do note supremely generous gifts are in the giving of the emperor of kitai not tributary subordinate nations who beg imperial daughters from us as a sign of heavenly favour tai knew what he had to do next it was not in his nature and he was realizing that more and more with each passing moment this was not where he wanted to be not now and perhaps not ever but he could dance a little here he held up his hand with the ring i know all too well how supremely generous to his leastdeserving servant our beloved emperor can be may he live and rule a thousand years there was a short silence may it be the will of heaven said that emperors son and heir zhou said nothing tai turned to shinzu my lord prince do you wish me to take men and go west for the horses i am at the service of the court they are being held across the border from hsien so we understand i am prepared to leave immediately the prince shook his head zhou was still on his feet tai saw he faced the first minister down the length of the council space in a vast and echoing chamber if zhou had somehow obtained the horses tai thought there would have been nothing to stop him from having a certain second son killed nothing at all the prince said as it happens the prime minister is correct in one respect you cannot leave xinan while awaiting an audience your name has been put forward tai stared at him i would rather serve the emperor as best i can than seek an appearance at court shinzu smiled he had an effortless charm it might have been tai thought one of the things that had kept him alive all this time that and a reputationdisappearing moment by momentfor indifference to imperial affairs the prince shook his head again events must flow as they are decreed under nine heavens master shen the palace and the empire will spin into disarray if they do not when the periphery is unstable as the cho master taught the centre must be firm my father will receive you you will be given honours thatbecause they mustwill exceed those given by sangrama in rygyal this is the way the world unfolds and then if it should be the desire of the phoenix throne you may be asked to ride for your horses my lord time might matter which is why i sent for them interjected wen zhou is it asked prince shinzu the prince looked at tai time always matters but order right conduct right thinking have always mattered more it is our way tai lowered his head he felt selfconscious now standing so conspicuously i do understand my lord but if that is so why am i here you said you asked for me a flicker of amusement in shinzus eyes this was tai suddenly thought the son of a man renowned for intelligence and command if the emperor had grown old and weary thoughts not to be spoken it did not take away from the lineage the prince said i asked for your attendance as soon as we learned of those riders sent for the horses those men would have been rejected at the border we all know it or should have known it your presence will be required there and then the horses will be required by the empire if you are good enough of course to make them available accordingly i have asked you here in the presence of the first minister because we have need of his great power tai blinked he looked at zhou and only now did shinzu turn that way first minister i would dedicate myself and my own limited abilities to protecting this man for the sake of kitai and my father but the times are dangerous and my own resources are meagre i ask you in the presence of this council to pledge your office and life to guarding him for us only someone with your wisdom and power can ensure his safety in troubled times and we know roshan is aware of those horses the expression on zhous face was genuinely interesting defeat was there unmistakably but behind it tai thought he saw an amused aristocratic flicker of irony acknowledgement of a game well played as if this had been a match on a polo field and the ball had just been elegantly struck into his goal he agreed of course there was no way sima zian said over salmon river wine that evening that he could have failed to agree the moon past full was overhead they were on a curved stone bench under lanterns in the garden of tais home the garden was nowhere near the size or intricacy of wen zhous but it had a small pond a bamboo grove winding paths an orchard the scent of flowers was around them the prince said tai hes changed zian thought about it he is letting people see now what he has always been he was hiding it zian nodded why now perhaps it is time tais turn to think about it is he in danger because hes doing this shinzu yes the poet drank his wine a servant filled his cup and withdrew perhaps but no more than any of us there are a quarter of a million soldiers moving on yenling he looked at tai and then away and murmured bitter wind blows battle smoke wild geese and cranes fly later moons disk in the water plum blossoms mirrored in the river until they fall hed written that himself during the last taguran war tais fathers war tai was silent a while then said the first minister seems to think it will be over quickly that the northeast will not accept roshans ambitions will rise up behind him and the sixth army will cut his supply lines sima zians enormous tigereyes met tais we must hope he murmured that the first minister is correct tai dreamed that night that he was back in the north by that cabin beyond the steppe watching men burned and devoured beside a jewelbright blue lake it wasnt a dream that came often any more but the memory was never entirely absent either smoke was drifting and through it leering faces surged barechested bogu looming close waving severed limbs of human beings in his face offering them as if they were gifts then drifting away blood dripped from arms and from hackedoff slices of thigh the cabin burned with a roaring sound tai felt terror and an overwhelming grief he had a sense that he was crying aloud in the dream and in xinan he became aware as if in fog and mist half asleep of a voice soothing him he was trying to see he looked for yellow hair a hand brushed his forehead or so it seemed to him someone beside his curtained canopied bed in the dead black of night he felt himself struggling to wake then surrendered and slipped back into sleepan easier sleep without the horrifying images of memory in the morning waking at sunrise he said nothing about his night and no one else did either nine days after this the second son of general shen gao was summoned to the taming palace and received in the hall of brilliance by the emperor taizu in the presence of the most illustrious members of his court including the precious consort tai clad by his steward in white for the occasion approached the phoenix throne making the triple obeisance three times as instructed he stopped the stipulated distance from the imperial presence his eyes cast down also as required he was then presented by an admiring and grateful empire with an estate in the mingzhen hills the aristocracys hunting and riding playground north of xinan he received another estate and considerable land in the south near the great river once the property of a minister convicted of stealing from the treasury the corrupt minister had been executed his property confiscated it now went to the brave man who had lived among the ghosts of kuala nor laying them to rest he was further presented with a staggeringly large sum of money ceremonial artifacts jade coral pearls ivory and precious gems and two ceremonial swords that had belonged to an emperor of the fifth dynasty not speaking speech was forbidden tai rose at a tall eunuchs discreet hand signal and bowed again nine times as he backed slowly away from the throne outside lightheaded but breathing in a sunlit courtyard he fully expected that orders would now come for him to set out immediately to claim his horses it did not happen that way events intervened word came that same afternoon that yenling second city of the empire east of them on the far side of teng pass had surrendered to roshan he had declared it the capital of his tenth dynasty his soldiers had it was reported left the general population substantially unharmed but they were butchering every civil servant and soldier who had not managed to flee when the rebels appeared before the walls more ghosts tai thought more to come chapter xxii it is not one of the things shes ever thought about but limei has never been on a mountain she never even climbed the hills east of their home women didnt do that she remembers dreaming about seeing the sea a different sort of thought in her first days here with no tasks no need to rise in darkness and ride anywhere clutching the unimaginable luxury of time to herself she walks the broad flat top of the mountain and the green terraces below there isnt even anyone escorting her not here there is no need stone drum one of the five holy mountains stands out vividly because of where it is above mostly level land in all directions the top looks as if some god had taken a sword and sliced creating the level summit she can see a long way whichever direction she looks sometimes she imagines she can even see the wall but she knows that is an illusion she has no restrictions can wander anywhere she wears the grey robes of a kanlin acolyte though she isnt one she watches them training in combat or with the bow or practising movements that seem nearer to dance than fighting she watches men and women run up walls spring back across open space and down a different wall and then do it again she hears the bells that summon the kanlins to prayer and she drifts that way among grey and black figures on a green mountain she loves the sound of bells in this high place she stands at the back of a temple watching the rites tall candles burning hearing the chants rise and fall feeling more peace than she can remember it is the same at twilight when she finds a quiet place on one of the terraces and watches the sky grow dark and the stars appear she has to deal with some guilt slipping into peace at this moment is surely selfish even shameful they know by now why the long wall and the garrisons beyond have been emptied out they know where the armies of roshan have gone are going even soor perhaps more honestly because of thisby the evening of her third day on stone drum limei has decided she wishes to remain on the mountain all her life training to be a kanlin or simply serving them early the following morning summoned before the trio of elders who govern the sanctuary she learns that she will not be allowed to do this she is to leave almost immediately in fact they do not look like men inclined to alter any decision made she thinks standing before them their faces are austere two are very tall the third has only one hand they wear the unadorned black of all the kanlins she has ever seen they sit on cushions on platform couches in a pavilion open to light and wind the sun is rising she has questions she sinks to her knees isnt sure if that is the proper thing to do but it feels correct she says looking from one to the other am i so unsuited to becoming a kanlin unexpectedly the elder in the centre the one with a single hand laughs aloud a highpitched merry sound he isnt so remote after all she thinks neither are the others they are smiling unsuited hopelessly so says the laughing one rocking back and forth in mirth just as your brother was she stares you knew my brother i taught him we tried he tried he calms himself wipes his eyes with his sleeve he looks more thoughtfully at her his was not a spirit meant to grow within a larger group a shared belief neither is yours daughter of shen gao his voice is actually kind this is not to be seen as a failure it feels that way she says but it is not so your brother had too strong a feeling of what he was within so do you it is a nature not a flaw i dont want to leave she is afraid of sounding like a child you love the mountain because you have come through peril and it is peaceful here of course you want to linger i cannot even as a servant one of the tall ones stirs he is still amused she sees he murmurs you are a princess of kitai my lady circumstances have now changed in the world and it is nearly certain you will not go back north you cannot be a servant it shames the taming palace and us too many people will know who you are i didnt ask to be made a princess this time all three of them laugh although it is gentle enough who chooses their fate it is the third one the tallest who asks to be born into the times that are theirs well who accepts the world only as it comes to them she says too quickly they grow quiet i do not know that passage the one in the centre says is it from a disciple of the cho master she says not fighting a ripple of pride it is not it is from general shen gao my father said that to all his children she remembers him saying it directly to her his daughter more than once it was not something shed only overheard the three men exchange glances the tallest inclines his head it is a challenging thought and places burdens on those who heed it but forgive me it only makes more clear why you are not meant to be a kanlin we are of many minds and natures but our way is to find fulfilment and harmony in the larger identity you know this she wants to fight but finds it difficult my brother could not do that no more than he could find harmony in the ranks of the army says the one on the right it seems your father succeeded in shaping independence in his children kanlins cannot be independent of course they can it was the small one again in the centre but only in some measure and only after acceptance of the self as gathered into our robes and the duties they bring she feels foolish young these are things they might have expected her to know she says why are you helping me then they look surprised the one in the centrehe appears to be the leadergestures with his one hand for your brother of course because he was here three smiles the tall one on the left says not that no certainly not that it is because of kuala nor my lady and so she asks having never learned what it was that tai had done after he left home and went west in the mourning period they tell her on a faroff mountain they explain about the horses and the attempts upon his life one by a woman disguising herself as a kanlintrained here in fact before leaving the order though still wearing the black robes deceiving people something they deeply regret the tallest one says a burden they feel it is a great deal to absorb limei has the sensation that the world she left behind when she departed from xinan in a litter travelling north to the bogu is coming back in a rush of words and thoughts why would anyone have wanted to kill him the first question that comes they shake their heads do not answer choose not to answer is he all right she asks he is in xinan we are told and guarded by kanlins which is as it should be the horses will be even more important now and they are his it is a good assurance the tallest says they are not smiling now she sees a good assurance she shakes her head it is all so strange enough to change the way you understand everything but it seems as if her second brother has done something astonishing and that even so far away he has been with her has protected her after all here on stone drum and before that on the grasslands because of what about meshag she asks suddenly the one who brought me will he be allowed to stay can you do anything for him do you understand what has happened to him the one on her left answers this time our teachings and our understanding do not go so far into the north she stares at him they have been nothing but kind to her still she dislikes being told something untrue they are right of course hers is not a kanlin nature these are elders wise and revered she says forgive me but that is not correct is it someone here understood a wolf messenger isnt that how three of you came to meet us by the wall she has had several days to think about it kitan do not like wolves the one in the centre says the one who had been tais teacher here it is not an answer she says hes bound to the lead wolf isnt he meshag that is what happened to him his life ends when the wolf dies shes had time to think about this too perhaps says the elder on her right but it would be a presumption for us for anyone to believe we understand this for anyone that means her and here again she knows what he says is true how could what happened by that far northern lake be grasped you wont let him stay she doesnt ask it as a question he has no wish to stay the one in the middle corrects her gently she hasnt seen meshagor the wolfsince the evening they arrived surely she thinks he would say farewell before going back it isnt necessarily a wellfounded belief she has no good assurances she tells herself it must not be allowed to matter the world came to you and you tried to make of it what you wanted it to be if you broke upon rocks as the seas did in room screen paintings shed seen at court you broke with your pride but no one was allowed to choose the times into which they were born her father was right and the elders were there was no true contradiction in the teachings she stands up and bows where will you send me my lords the small one has a kind face she decides it is a kindness hidden by scars his bald head the black severity of the kanlin robes but it is a gentle face nonetheless and so is his voice he explains speaking for the three of them what is to happen to her she feels a flicker of fear listening like the first tongue of flame as a fire is started but she pushes it down she is after all a princess of kitai and her fathers daughter and she sees now with clarity that it would have been pursuing a false simplicity to live out her days upon this mountain pretending otherwise she goes looking for meshag and his wolf when she leaves the pavilion and the elders she doesnt expect to find them unless he wishes it but she is still certain he will not have gone away not without speaking with her as she winds her way down green terraces late in the day away from others among pine trees the scent of them she is remembering the cave where she placed her handprints on the body of the kinghorse on the wallbefore the entrance to the last cave where shed been afraid to go hed gone in there meshag she watches the sun go down late at night she lies in the narrow bed they have given her in a simple room with a fireplace one small table for a washbasin a chest for belongings and nothing else and he comes to her a tapping at the door once and then again soft you could think you had imagined it wait she says she has not been asleep she rises and dons her grey robe and goes to the door and opens it moonlight in a cold clear night she is barefoot goes out nonetheless to where he stands a little distance from her threshold she sees without surprise the grey wolf not far away the yellowgold of its eyes it is achingly quiet upon the mountains summit no one stirs no bells in the dark hours the moon dims all but the brighter stars a wind blows thank you she says he is lit by moonlight but she cannot see his eyes which is always the case at night he is wearing the leggings and boots he wore on their journey the wolf sits it is alert but calm she thinks she doesnt understand wolves however she might easily be wrong he says you were looking for me before his kitan has improved she thinks several days of talking with the kanlins the open space and the buildings here are silver in the moonlight otherworldly i was afraid you had gone afraid but you are safe now she had thought he might say that it pleases her to be right if only in small things it is a way of not being lost there is a rebellion i wonder if anyone is safe they will not send you back they have told me this they wont someone else might i dont know she hears the wind the wolf rises moves a little settles meshag standing very still says i do not think so too much will change now kitan and bogu and others but if if they do this i will know it and i will come for you again and with that she begins to cry she sees the wolf stand up again as she does so though she is silent only the tears sliding down her face meshag does not move and because she hates to cryshe tells herself laterbecause of that she steps forward and reaches up and takes his head in both her hands and kisses him first time she has ever done such a thing outside of dream it feels like a dream here on the mountain in silver light she holds her eyes open as long as she can and so she sees when his dark eyes shut and only then does she close hers knowing he is not after all entirely gone from the world and needs of men his mouth is unexpectedly soft but his arms do not come around her and when she steps back lightheaded a little unsteady on her feet her heart pounding much too fast he says gravely i did not take you from my brother to claim you for myself i know she says too loudly of course i know that the small movement of his mouth she has learned to call a smile you are so certain she feels herself flush finds she has nothing to say he murmurs i lose what there is in this if i take you now i understand a silence wind she is suddenly aware that the wolf has gone at length he says softly in different lives he leaves the thought unfinished he doesnt have to finish it i understand she says again eventually she adds you are leaving now yes shes expected that she feels the tears on her cheeks in the night she manages a smile i have questions she says she hears the sound that is his laughter always another sound to her right the wolf is back and has growled though softly meshag says something to it in his own tongue he looks back at her that stiff nod last time he lifts one handit is not at all a graceful lovers motionand touches the side of her face then he goes running after the running wolf his horse will be waiting somewhere she knows probably two or three horses for the bogu seldom ride just one when they have a long way to travel she thinks of walking out to where she can overlook the slopes and the plain below them to the north she might see them go it is cold though and there really is no reason to go look she stands in the moonlight alone on the mountain she wipes at her cheeks with the sleeve of her robe the world she thinks is impossible to measure two mornings later she leaves as well with a goodsized party of kanlins heading south she is dressed in black with a hood as if she is one of them they are riding to teng pass the elders considering and communing have decided that this is where kanlins will be needed this has happened at that pass it seems years ago and before that and before in warfare there are times of frenzied urgency and violence that saturate the churned earth with blood and there are periods when everything seems to slow or even come to a halt the rebel armies had taken yenling with alarming ease and some savagery an lis wellhorsed cavalry thundered down from the north forded the golden river and appeared before yenlings walls before any opposing force could arrive to defend the second city of the empire this had been anticipated within the taming palace it was accepted by the emperors senior mandarins in the purple myrtle court that this would be so there would be casualties in the east lamentably how not this was an armed rebellion and no one was unaware of how ruthless an li could be teng pass which protected xinan itself was manned and guarded not with the very best soldiers at first roshan might possibly have been able to fight through had he moved immediately from yenling but the pass was notoriously narrow easy to defend and going south of it through the hills or crossing and recrossing the river north were appallingly treacherous especially with horsemen attempting such manoeuvres had destroyed armies over the centuries teng pass was a central square on the kitan gameboard put another way warfare could also be a dance and often the steps and music were well known by both sides the vanguard of the rebelsnow calling themselves the tenth dynasty of kitaiconsolidated their hold on yenling killed anyone they decided to kill seized control of the grand canal ports nearby and waited for their foot soldiers to subdue the north and join them subduing the north proved a difficult matter however made more so by the arrival of imperial forces from the sixth army to attack supply lines rebel troops were forced to remain northeast in order to prevent cities from being retakenor even throwing open their gates to the emperors troops roshan and his generals had nourished hopes that the five families long displeased with certain measures taken regarding taxation and land rights might join the rebellion or at least not oppose it in the event though there was some discussion among the northern aristocracy this did not happen instead almost from the start there were insurrections north of the river in the supposed heartland of the newly proclaimed tenth dynasty one might dislike the current imperial family find them presumptuous of modest lineage and far too inclined to consolidate power in xinan but compared to a barbarian and his vulgar sons and generals well there was really nothing to choose between was there and no one in the northeast having lived with roshan as governor for years was inclined to be seduced by the notion that he would be easily manipulated once in power in addition to which the proud leaders of the five families knew their history and geography as well as anyone roshan had probably missed a chance they agreed exchanging elegantly scripted missives on silk paper or meeting at one estate or another over summer fruit and wine he had erred by waiting in yenling to have himself crowned then setting up the trappings of a court by not moving swiftly enough with the advantage of the first army in the field it was understandable that he might try to assume the mantle of legitimacy of a new emperor a hero of the suffering kitan people bent on destroying a corrupt first minister and replacing an aged hapless lovesnared emperor this was the tale as roshan needed it told but keeping his army in the field away from barracks and families as summer heated up and autumns harvest cameand was not gatheredwas going to be a challenge with teng pass secured and xinan safe the emperors forces could slowly gather from all directions assemble ranks and regiments and eventually squeeze the rebels north and south as a man might squeeze a grape between his fingers this was in fact the almost universally accepted opinion among historians of what should have happened for all his disclaimers that hed never held a position at court never wanted one and would not pretend to understand manoeuvres there it was sima zian who continued to anticipate the events that began the change of the world zian did not write the song of everlasting sorrow that was a younger poet years after but the banished immortal did over lychee wine in tais city garden on a summer evening indicate what he thought was about to happen the second army under governor xu bihai himself was in teng pass by then blocking the rebels there were skirmishes no major engagements armies of both rebels and empire were moving all over kitai locusts crossing ruined fields a poet had written during another war long ago a second blazing star had been reported falling in the east it had to do with apprehension zian said that night amid fireflies great events often begin in fear and the taming is a frightened place mistakes can be made tai remembered looking around even in his own garden to see who might be placed to overhear they were alone except for two of his kanlins at some remove they were always with him now hed stopped permitting himself to be unhappy about it zian not even nearly sober had expounded on what he expected in the nottoodistant future he quoted two poems and a passage from the cho master tai had listened and looked at him under two lanterns burning and had said when the poet was done my brother would not permit that it will not happen zian he remembered had laughed that uninhibited amusement that was so near to the surface in him an ability to find joy in the world not permit the poet said once hed subsided have you considered that your brothers influence is not what it might once have been it isnt said tai he put his wine cup down why not because you came back to xinan liu reminds the first minister of you think about it what am i thinking about those twenty riders he sent for your horses you think your brother approved those tai knew the answer to that hed seen lius face that day no he said he knew it was wildly foolish wildly foolish that is good but wen zhou still went ahead didnt he do you think liu was even told it was happening i doubt it you see i speak for the sage in the cup pour me more of your good wine friend he waited for his cup to be filled then added softly we will pick our way through the shards of broken objects that folly leaves behind and some of what breaks will be very beautiful tai would remember that too she has always been able to tell when he is uneasy it is a part of her trainingand her nature the ability to read a mans mood is critical in the north district it is one of a singing girls essential skills when it comes to wen zhou it is notunlike some other menan important signal when he shows no inclination to make love he can absently take her on a bed or against the wall when he is disturbed his attention entirely elsewhere or he can linger at ease let her make music for him on an evening when his thoughts and mood are perfectly tranquil with zhou gauging his mind often has to do with how he answers when she speaks to him or does not answer rain can almost feel the whirling of his thoughts some nights and knows that though he is with her though he might even be inside her he is scarcely presentand is even though hed be angered if she were ever so foolish as to say this afraid but he is for several nights now when he arrives home late from the taming and comes to her she has sensed his disquiet and tonight it is even stronger although she has no understanding of what has happened she is aware that shen liu his most trusted adviser has not appeared at the compound for days they must be meeting at the palace she decides she very much misses one aspect of the north district all kinds of tidings arrived there in a steady endless flow like a river you needed to be skilled in extracting what was true or might be true from what was only the idleness of streets and markets but you heard things in a house like the pavilion of moonlight you felt connected to the world here ironically in the home of the most important man in kitai according to some rain is cut off from events and their report the other women are useless in this regard and the servants alternate between stolidly uncurious and wildly credulous she knows that the rebels have taken yenling and that the emperors forces are holding teng pass it is summer now fighting season but when autumn comes with winter to follow the rebels in the field should be in serious difficulty the imperial forces might be in trouble as well mind you since grand canal supplies will be interrupted but the west is theirs and roshan is bottled up in the northeast and in his proclaimed capital of yenling on the other hand zhou is clearly uneasy so there must be something she doesnt know she puts aside her pipa and says a slight risk you are quiet my lord he does not answer after a moment she takes up the instrument again and begins to play they are in her chamber it is very late the sliding doors are open to the summer gazing out he says quietly as if hed not even heard her words rain have i ever been cruel to you she is genuinely startled hides it as best she can my lord your servant knowsall your servants knowhow good you are to us his expression is odd but have i been cruel to you rain shapes a smile never my lord not ever he stares at her a long time he stands up and finishes his wine sets the cup down thank you he says and walks out she hears him speaking commands he wants his horse and guards he is going back to the palace at this hour and rain hed called her by her north district name he never does that and expressing gratitude it is disturbing the next day she dismisses her servants midafternoon claiming a need to rest after a tiring night with the master and she sets about filling a discreet cloth bag with some of her most valuable jewellery later walking alone as is her carefully established custom towards the far end of the gardennot far from the rosewood gazeboshe buries those jewels at the base of a cherry tree the flowers on the tree have come and gone by then beautiful for a little time then falling in the taming palace and in mawai when she wishes to be there a woman dances for the emperor of kitai part four chapter xxiii there have been rebellions before in kitai civil wars from the time the earliest dynasties of the empire were forged and shattered and reforged in one of these conflicts notoriously a sixth dynasty army was treacherously undone by a false order sent to its generals purporting to be from the palace since that time measures have been undertaken to offer commanders on a battlefield assurance that communications from court are truly their orders a certain number of imperial seals are made fired in a small and guarded kiln on the grounds of whatever palace the emperor is using on these seals dragons are variously depicted on the backs of the seals are numbers in a recorded sequence in the presence of military leaders and mandarins from the purple myrtle court these seals are ceremonially broken in half it is considered an honour to be the man entrusted with doing this before taking his army to the field a commander is given a certain number of these sealsor halfseals to be precise orders relayed to him from court are accompanied by the matching halfseal the messengers carrying these have been kanlin warriors for several hundred years they are trusted by all parties to any conflict and in that trust lies their sanctity the military commander must ensure that the piece they bring to him fits in shape and number one he carries if it does match he must accept those orders or death and shame and ruinous dispossession will invariably follow as wolves follow sheep through summer grass of the two men who met on a summer morning at the eastern end of teng pass one arrived on horseback as a general in the field always should in his own view he needed help dismounting however and used a walking stick to make his way forward swinging a stiff leg the other man approached the shadows of the pass from the open ground east carried in an enormous sedan chair by eight large men the number is a concession to the circumstances normally there are twelve behind this two other soldiers could be seen bearing a westernstyle chair very wide cushioned and backed in yellow cloth it was when viewed closely a throne or meant to be seen as one the colour indicated as much they placed this on level ground not far inside the pass the sedan chair was also set down the curtains were drawn back with assistance a fabulously large figure emerged and made his way to the thronechair and subsided into it the other man waited leaning upon his stick he wore a battle sword not a decorative one he smiled thinly throughout all of this watching with interest birds circled in the updrafts overhead it was windless below a hot day though cooler in the shade of teng pass each of the two men had five others accompanying him aside from those allowed by agreement to carry the sedan and the throne and to handle the generals horse none but the general was armed his sword was in truth a transgression as symbolic in its way as the throne and the kingfisher feathers on the sedan chair there were in addition fifty kanlin warriors in the pass supervising this parleyas kanlins had done during such encounters for hundreds of years five of these were sitting crosslegged before writing tables with brushes and paper and black ink they had arrived before anyone else these would record with precision to be checked against each other everything said this morning one scroll would be presented to each party attending after the gathering was over three would be kept and archived by the kanlins as evidence of any agreement emerging here there was no great expectation on anyones part that an agreement would emerge from teng pass today the other blackrobed ones were spread out around the canyon and these men and women bristled with weapons two dozen of them held bows where they were posted some distance up the slopes on either side of the pass they were here to monitoror to preservethe peace of this meeting and the safety of all who came to it the kanlins even the ones preparing to write were hooded their identities meant nothing here they were emblematic of their order and its history no more than that but certainly no less general xu bihai commanding the imperial armies of kitai in teng pass waited until the other man had settled himself in the large chair it took some time xu bihais thin smile never wavered but one would have been deceived in thinking there was anything but ice in his eyes it was in most instances of this sort customary for one of the figures behind the principals to speak first addressing the kanlins formally requesting them to begin transcribing this did not happen instead general xu said i have a personal proposal for you an li no title of course no title i await it with eagerness said the other man his voice was unexpectedly high if you were hearing it for the first time a slight accent even after so many years why dont you and i settle this conflict with a single combat right here after the fashion of ancient days said xu bihai all those gathered where sunlight did not penetrate seemed to grow still to breathe more shallowly roshan stared at the other man his creased eyes widened and then he began to shakehis prodigious belly his shoulders the folds of face and chin highpitched laughter wheezy and urgent echoed in the narrow pass a startled bird flew up and away xu bihai eyes still hard allowed his own smile to grow wider one is always pleased when a jest however barbed encounters an enthusiastic response gasping quivering roshan lifted an unsteady hand as if pleading for mercy eventually he regained control of himself he wiped at his small streaming eyes with a sleeve of his liao silk robe he coughed he wiped his face again he said a fight for poets that would be youd kick me to death with one leg or id sit on you crush the life out of you right out of me agreed the other man his thinness the lean austere appearance seemed shaped by a mocking deity to provide as vivid a contrast as possible to an li his smile faded i could fight your son the son bulky and fit stood beside his fathers chair the man in the chair was no longer laughing his eyes nearly lost in the folds of his moonface became as cold as xu bihais he would kill you he said you know it the taming would not allow it or honour it we are not children these are not the ancient days you asked for a meeting the blackrobes are writing say what you have come to say and then leave my presence blunt heavy harsh all of these things and deliberately so the standing mans turn to be amused or pretend to be ah well you would have to leave my presence wouldnt you since it is my army that holds this pass why dont you attack roshan or do you like camping on the hot plain out there is it soothing for your afflictions i hold the grand canal an li said grimly you hold the northern ports of it but have you not heard the weather has been glorious in the southwest we have great hopes for that harvest and have you not also heard the twelfth army is on its way here even as we enjoy a morning together and the five families are restless behind you or so our tidings tell roshan smiled ah the five families do your tidings also tell of the fate of cao chin and his family behind me as you say or has that news not yet reached the taming be the first to know his castle has been burned down his wives and daughters taken by my soldiers granddaughters too i believe the men did need some diversion after all cao chin hangs naked castrated meat for carrion birds from a hook on a pillar outside the ruins of his home when it grew quiet as it did now you became more aware there was no wind it was clear to anyone watching that xu bihai had not known this and equally clear that he believed what he was being told that was a great name he said softly it brings even more shame upon you roshan shrugged vast shoulders he was a traitor to the tenth dynasty the families needed to learn there are consequences to the elegant exchanges of missives and musings over wine discussing which way to turn when an army is among them i doubt the northeast is as restless now as you might think xu bihai stared time and the winter will tell whether you can feed the army that keeps them quiet you are trapped here and you know it perhaps you would prefer to withdraw to yenling i enjoy siege warfare myself when autumn comes without an eastern harvest you are done roshan birds calling no breeze in the pass may i tell you something the man in the chair said i dont like you i never have i will enjoy killing you i will begin by hacking off your crippled leg and showing it to you then dripping your own blood in your open mouth it was even for such a setting as this savage enough to elicit another silence i tremble said xu bihai finally before i commence to babble like a terrified child hear the words of the emperor of kitai you are declared accursed of men and the gods your life is forfeit and your sons he killed my son said an li one of them a hostage to your own conduct he was executed when that conduct became treacherous wherein lies your grievance tell me there was something magnificent about the lean thinbearded man standing there with his heavy stick he was no hostage do not shape lies that are being written down he was an officer in the flying dragon army and a member of the court he was killed by a fool in an act of fear will you pretend you approved i was in chenyao said xu bihai it was an admission of sorts nothing near to an answer but i know your answer however much you hate me governor xu i will wager the lives of my remaining sons against your daughters that you despise wen zhou as much there was no reply roshan went on his voice a hammer now you were afraid to challenge him all this time you stayed west and let a vain polo player whose only claim to rank was a cousin in the emperors bed turn kitai into his own fiefdom while taizu drank potions to straighten his male member and drank others to live forever he glared at the other man was yours governor xu the conduct of someone mindful of his duty to the state do you accept the fool whose cause you are serving here i require wen zhou at my feet blinded and begging for death why are you the first man to lose a battle for power he is worth nothing then neither are you the first to lose to a lesser man will you kill so many destroy an empire for it why not said an li the words unadorned hung in the air because you cannot blame wen zhou for this you rose against the throne your son died for it you had to know it could happen and sons die every day in the world so said roshan do daughters xu bihai shook his head gravely now he said ministers of the empire come and are gone leaving memories or only tracks in sand the phoenix throne is more than the man who sits it or those who serve him well or badly i have my views on the first minister i have no inclination to share them with a foul and accursed rebel i am neither if i win said roshan you are both now and until you die and the words will cling to your name forever wherever your body lies xu bihai stopped then he said hear my offer i am listening said an li you and your eldest son have forfeited your lives you will be graciously permitted to commit suicide and be buried though not with monuments i have the names of five of your commanders who must also accept their deaths all others in your army here or in the northeast or in yenling are offered pardon in the name of the glorious emperor taizu an offer to be recorded now by the kanlins and with my own name and honour behind it his voice grew quiet you are dying you know it all men who look at you know it with your life already ending and six others you can save all those who follow you and kitai from this he ended five kanlin scribes their hands dipping brushes shaped words otherwise there was a stillness in the pass why would i do that roshan said he sounded genuinely puzzled he scratched at the back of one hand he drove me to this wen zhou was stripping me of choices poisoning the emperor against me erasing anything i might offer my sons what should a man with any pride in what he leaves behind do in the face of that is that it said xu bihai legacy it is different for you said roshan dismissively you have only daughters he shifted in his chair if this is all you came to say we have wasted a morning unless it is of importance to you to understand that i do know of your daughters and i will find them to their very great regret you may trust me in this the thin man appeared undisturbed i thank you he said you turn the duty of destroying you into a pleasure rare and delicate that last word delicate lifted into the air and was recorded strange as it sounded in that place on pale silk paper by five brushes moving swiftly dipping and strokingdelicately in fact the yellowbacked throne was carried out of teng pass roshan waited in the kingfisherfeathered sedan chair curtains drawn respectingperhaps surprisinglyformalities it may have been the case that having named himself an emperor these mattered more to him than they might once have done eventually three hooded kanlins walked over two escorting the one carrying a scroll that preserved the record of what had been said the kanlin extended the scroll a hand reached through the curtain and took it the sedan chair was lifted and carried away into sunlight limei is deeply disturbed not even close to working through all the reasons for this one of them however is surely the savage intensity of what has just happened in teng pass the words spoken violence embeddedand with more to come surely now to come another reason on an infinitely smaller scale shameful almost unworthy of acknowledging is that shes still recovering from the effect of the heavy toosweet smell that had come from an lis sedan chair when shed accompanied the kanlin carrying the scroll to him shed been next in line when he was given the completed record theyd motioned for her and one other to go forward a sweetness of perfume overlaying thickly an odour much darker something corrupt she feels ill in the aftermath of it and the air in teng pass is too still too dense when she tries to breathe deeply it will be very hot outside the pass where the rebels are camped in the sun she remains shaken by a thought that came to her walking towards roshan standing by watching the scroll being extended to him she isnt remotely capable with a sword or knife but there was surely a chance that armed as she wasas a kanlin for todayshe could have stabbed him ending this ending all safety and tradition and respect for the kanlin warriors too mind you hundreds of years of being judged worthy of trust destroyed in a moment by shen limei only daughter of general shen gaoafter theyd welcomed her on stone drum mountain given her shelter and guidance and even a way to make her way home through civil war not to be thought of or if thoughts cannot be barred not to be permitted to be more than that roshan is dying in any case that was the odour she smelled the thinbearded man whod faced him down she knew who he was remembered her father speaking of him had said it in blunt words words shed watched being recorded in swift calligraphy by the scribes killing him she thinks wouldnt have ended anything necessarily the sonsthe one standing here and there are two others alive she believesand probably the five men whose names are carried on a second scroll the ones whose deaths are required these would carry on even if an li died rebellion might not always be tied to one mans will and life perhaps it took on its own force after a given point was reached and passed you could turn back and turn back and then you couldnt has that happened here shed like to ask someone but cant she is disguised as a kanlin no one is to know who she is and a warrior would not be asking questions like that of anyone theyd made her carry twin swords on her back during the ride south so she wouldnt look awkward and inept moving with them when the time came theyd been heavy at first the swords painful against her spine in their backscabbards shes more accustomed to them now a persona womancan adapt to more than she might have thought she could what shes unsure about is when that stops being a virtue and turns to something else leaving you too much changed undefined unanchored like a fishermans empty boat drifting on a river with no way to be returned to where it belongs thinking so ashamed to be dealing with thoughts of her own life at such a time limei sees three riders racing towards them up the pass from the western end the leading one carries a banner the imperial insignia these are couriers shed seen them often enough in her days with the empress the second rider is a kanlin he is the one who dismounts from his lathered horse before the stallion has even entirely halted he approaches general xu bows he is perspiring from the heat the black robes are soaked with sweat he extends a small object it is a seal broken in half limei knows what this signifies though shes never actually seen one the courier also extends a scroll to the general xu bihai accepts both he hands the halfseal to one of his officers this man reaches into a leather satchel he carries and extracts a similar object rejects it pulls out another no one speaks the man holds this second piece to the one the courier has brought he looks at the fit examines the back nods his head only then does xu bihai untie the scroll and read limei sees him grow older before her eyes he leans on his stick for a moment then he straightens when was this given to you he asks the couriers his voice is thin limei is suddenly frightened hearing it the courier bows before speaking he is clearly exhausted three nights ago my lord we left in the middle of the night and it came from from the first minister himself my lord general his hand to my own the scroll and the halfseal rage appears in xu bihais features it is impossible to miss he breathes in and out slowly he says very clearly he is afraid he has decided that the longer we are here holding them back the more likely it is that someone might decide this can be ended by delivering him to an li no one says a word in teng pass limei is remembering someone else this morning i need wen zhou at my feet blinded and begging for death after a moment general xu says quietly this time as if to the stillness of the air not to anyone beside him if i were a different man and roshan were i might even have done it what limei feels hearing this standing so near is fear it chases away as wind chases fallen leaves all thoughts of her own destiny there is too much more here now not long after that eight kanlins ride west out of the pass through the assembled armies of the second and third districts the armies are stirring orders have been given the eight riders go swiftly once beyond the canyon with the wide river on their right and hills to the leftthe features that make teng pass what it is vital for so long in kitai two of these riders are bound for the kanlin sanctuary at mawai with three of the records of the morning from there two scrolls will be sent on to other sanctuaries for greater security two of the other riders will go only as far as xinan with the scroll for the taming palace along with newer ones the justdictated words of general xu bihai sent to the imperial heir and the beloved companion but not to the first minister three of the riders are escorting the last one farther west and south because of a promise made at stone drum mountain these four will branch off halfway to xinan that last one wrapped in fear and doubt as they ride is the daughter of general shen gao there have been many chronicles of warfare in kitai from the first dynasty onwards disagreements as to strategy and tactics not surprisingly are everywhere in the texts and a component of the civil service examinations is for students to analyze two or three such writings and express a preference for one of them defending that choice victory or defeat in battle can be attributed to many different elements some writers stressed the somewhat obvious point that numerical superiority all else being relatively equal could usually determine a combat that a prudent general would wait for such superiority decline to engage without it others noted that all else was rarely equal weaponry for example made a great difference an oftencited example was the fate of an army in the northeast some time ago an incursion into the koreini peninsula undone before the crucial battle by a sudden rainstorm that soaked their bowstrings eliminating the archers from playing any role leading to a terrible defeat this incident was also cited in the context of preparation the fact that the leaders of the expedition had failed to anticipate the rain was judged significant all of the surviving generals were later executed or ordered to kill themselves other writers placed emphasis on terrain positioning the army with higher ground or territory protected by natural features would have a significant advantage the capable commander sought such terrain supply lines played a role food clothing horses even boots for a marching army so could the ratio of infantry to cavalry and the quality of horsemanship experience in general battlehardened soldiers were worth much more than new recruits surprise whether by way of an unexpected assault at night in difficult weather sooner than anticipated or a battle conducted using new tactics could make a difference there were examples those taking the examinations were expected to know them morale and passion were seen as important and were linked to leadership there was a very old tale of a commander who committed his army to battle with a river in spate behind them having refused to move forward from the edge of the water to better ground waiting for the enemy there his soldiers had no possible retreat they did not retreat they won a famous victory that day against significantly greater numbers when men have nowhere to escape the lesson went they will fight more bravely and often prevail so too will soldiers who are aware that defeat for them is decisive and likely to mean death on the other hand an army that knows there need not be for them finality to a given field that flight is possible is less likely to engage the enemy with the same ferocity this last distinction it was subsequently agreed with a degree of consensus was the best explanation for the victory of the an li rebels against the forces of the second and third armies in the battle joined east of teng pass the imperial army had an advantage in numbers and they did surprise the rebelswhod had no thought that general xu bihai would lead his forces out of an impregnable pass and onto a sunbroiled battlefield the initial appearance of the emperors troops caused extreme consternation in the rebel ranks general xu had increased this likelihood by moving most of his men into position outside of the pass during the night so the rebels woke to see their enemies gathered and then had to face a charge this surprise changed swiftly to something else something that could be described as hope or even joy short of an attack such as this a mistake such as this they had been almost certainly fated to withdraw from here and face the uncertainty of autumn and winter with too little ground gained a large army to feed and house through the cold months and unrest in their own base all the while learning of the steady mustering of even greater numbers of imperial forces readying themselves for the resumption of fighting in spring the attack out of the pass once the initial shock was over presented itself to an li and his forces as what it was a gift an opportunity unlooked for it was a gift they did not fail to grasp there were a great many casualties on both sides that day there were more in the imperial army when the dead and wounded reached a certain number there is always such a number for any army the soldiers of general xu bihai broke and fled they raced back up teng pass pushing through the rearguard left to hold the pass running over them pursued with triumphant ferocity by the rebel cavalry into the pass and along it through shadows and out the other end into light again at the end of that day more than half of the second and third armies lay dead east of the pass or within it or overtaken in flight to the west most of the others were scattered in their frenzy to get awayto let others take on the burden of resisting these rebels while serving a court that issued commands that made no sense forcing them out of a secure position into unnecessary battle general xu was one of those who escaped the wreckage of that battlefield and headed west riding at speed with his guards towards xinan which lay open now undefended before roshan xu bihai was seen to be weeping as he rode though whether the tears were of rage or grief no man felt able to say it was a catastrophe for kitai that battle leading to chaos that would last a long time the ensuing nightmare ended eventually all things end but not before the changing of the empire and the world beauty was not easily sustained in that time nor music nor anything that might be linked to grace or serenity not easily sustained at the best of times those things sorrow lasts longer word of the disaster reached the taming in the dead of night three days later the glorious emperor was awakened from sleep and informed as to what had happened at all costs taizu beloved of heaven had to be saved xinan had fallen before it could be lost and retaken but not if the dynasty fell with little time for decisionmaking with roshans army of hardened soldiers approaching and xinan wide open to themand with panic certain in the morning when these tidings became widespreada small imperial party escorted by some of the second army who had been left with them proceeded in secrecy out a northern gate of the palace into the darkness of the deer park and then through another gate in the walls of the park on the road towards mawai under stars with the wind rising chapter xxiv wei song woke him in the dark of night the kanlins had never let tai bolt his chamber door in xinan there were entrances to his bedroom through sliding doors from porticoes on two sides these were guarded but they needed to be able to enter at need or so theyd told him hed thought about making a jest about needs in a bedchamber but never had hed been deeply asleep not dreaming it took him time to fully rouse to her voice and her touch on his shoulder she stood by the bed holding a candle her hair was unbound shed been sleeping too he realized what is it you are summoned to the palace an escort is waiting right now she nodded what has happened he was naked under the bedcovers trouble east we think east meant the rebellion there should not be any trouble there now not with two armies blocking roshan in teng pass who sent for me i do not know she handed him the scroll she carried she ought to have done that first he thought she never did things properly he took it sat up do you know what this says she nodded a kanlin brought it thats why were allowing you to go allowing he ought to correct her but there was no point if any harm came to him his kanlins would die he untied the scroll read it by the candles light it clarified nothing was simply a command to come immediately with a permit to pass through the ward gate and up to the taming the permit was signed by a senior mandarin not a name he knew get dynlal for me it is being done he looked at her sometimes not often you were reminded of how small she was for someone so fierce then go put up your hair and let me dress she looked embarrassed it occurred to him that song might be as uneasy about a middleofthenight summons as he was with armies in the field the times were deeply troubling she put the candle on the table that held his washbasin and went to the door on impulse he added is master sima here he never knew whether the poet had come in late or lingered wherever else hed spent the night she turned in the doorway and nodded please wake him song say that i would like him with me the please and her name were an apology in the courtyard another thought came he hesitated he might be making a large thing out of a small one but trouble east and a summons under stars carried weight didnt they he saw the poet rumpled as ever but moving quickly alert walk into the courtyard zian had his sword across his back tai felt a measure of relief seeing him he beckoned lu chen the leader of his guards and arranged for two of the kanlins to carry a message he called for paper and ink and wrote that message quickly by torchlight on a small table brought on the run into the courtyard then he sent the two kanlins to deliver it to spring rain by way of the crippled beggar who lived in the street behind wen zhous mansion the two guards had been there before the night hed met her in the garden they would remember how to find the man he instructed them to be respectful request his aid then stay until there was a reply if they saw the lady lin chang that was her name now they were to guard her life as surely as theyd been ordered to defend his he could give that order he could assign them as he chose there was no time to shape a better plan possible danger hed written in hurried ungraceful script be very alert two kanlins in street behind garden awaiting word from you he didnt sign it to protect her but the reference to kanlins probably undid that measure if anyone saw this there wasnt time for clearer thought he didnt have a clearer thought he rode out of the gate on dynlal taken againalways in the moments when he mounted upby the sensation of being on such a horse his baycoloured sardian they went down the night street of the ward and through the ward gate then north towards the taming along the starlit main avenue of xinan tai saw gold bird guards at their stations patrolling then a handful of people on the far side of the wide street increasing the sense of emptiness their horses hooves were the only sound the kanlin whod brought the summons was with them at the cityside gates of the taming another was waiting the gates were opened at a signal then closed behind as they rode through tai heard the heavy bar slide shut they continued north through the vast palace complex with its hundred buildings and courtyards no paths were straight here so that demons who could travel in a straight line only might be forestalled in any evil designs against heavens beloved emperor within his palace the emperor tai learned was not in the taming any more he was on the road heading northwest he exchanged a glance with the poet they reached the northern wall of the palace complex and passed through another gate into the deer park and rode through that continuing north theyd have eventually reached a stone wall by the riverside they turned west instead led by their kanlin escort song was at his side tai realized hair precisely pinned swords on her back they passed a bamboo grove on their right an open space an orchard then they came to a western gate in the park wall and went out they began riding quickly now in open country not long after they saw the imperial party ahead of them on the road torches under moonlight fear and strangeness were in tai as they caught up with the others he saw prince shinzu near the back of the small procession it was shockingly small in fact two carriages some riders from the court twenty or thirty cavalry of the second army guarding them no more than that normally the emperor would journey to mawai accompanied by two or three dozen carriages preceded by an army of servants and five hundred soldiers and escorted by five hundred more the prince looked back hearing them approach he slowed when he saw the kanlins he greeted tai who bowed in the saddle briskly with nothing in the way of warning or preamble shinzu told them of the disaster that had happened east or the first disaster with teng pass fallen there was much more now to come tai felt his mouth go dry he swallowed hard had the world their world come to this the emperor they were told was in the carriage just aheadno kingfisher feathers jian was with him the prime minister was riding at the front of the party it is good that you are here said the prince he was riding a handsome stallion though it was almost a full head smaller than dynlal i dont understand said tai what can i do he felt lost this night ride felt dreamlike as if through some starworld not their own we need your horses shen tai more than ever as cavalry mounts or for couriers we are going to be spread very widely distances will need to be covered swiftly when we reach the posting station ahead i am going to propose we head north to shuquian the fifth army is still mostly there and we will summon the first army from the west now i think we can hold roshan in xinan while other forces come up from the south we we have to do that dont we dont we why was a prince asking him was he waiting for a considered answer a disagreement what was tai expected to know it was obvious the prince was shaken how could he not be it was the middle of the night they were fleeing the capital the palace with twenty or thirty men and an army of rebels was behind them would be approaching xinan unopposed was the mandate of heaven being withdrawn right here could the shape of the world change in a night i am to go to shuquian with you he was confused himself the prince shook his head you will take riders southwest to the border you must claim your horses shen tai then bring them as speedily as possible to wherever we are tai drew a breath precise instructions were good they freed him from the need to think my lord there are a great many of the sardians i know how many there are said the prince sharply there was a halfmoon shining but it was hard to see his eyes another voice my lords let the kanlins do this take fifty of us master shen from our sanctuary ahead it was wei song still beside him she was always beside him through that night he would later remember it made sense what she said are there enough of you at the sanctuary will they release so many tai was calculating quickly if they are good with horses we can do this with sixty five horses behind each rider ten to guard us there are enough she said and they will be good with horses the prince nodded attend to it kanlin this is why you sent for me my lord tai was still wrapped in strangeness struggling to believe what had happened i didnt send for you the prince said it took a moment they looked ahead at the nearest carriage it wouldnt have been the emperor once perhaps in his burnished brilliant youth new to the throne or ready to claim it but not now not any more it was jian who had summoned him tai realized awakened in the middle of the night herself amid panic preparing to fly from all they knew she had thought of this a question came it ought to have been he thought his first my lord forgive me but i dont understand how was there a battle general xu held the pass he would never have he was ordered out said shinzu flatly and then very deliberately he looked ahead towards where a handsome moonlit horseman rode at the front of their small procession in the name of all nine heavens exclaimed sima zian that cannot be he would not have done that but he did do that said the prince he smiled mirthlessly look where we are poet it seemed as if he would say more but he did not the prince flicked his reins and moved up beside his fathers racing coach then they saw him go past it to ride with the soldiers guarding them just as the sun rose on a summer morning they reached the posting station by the lake at mawai tai had been warned that the soldiers were beginning to murmur amongst each other as the night drew to an end lu chen a shrewd experienced man had moved up for a time among the cavalry escort then the kanlin drifted back towards tai where he and zian and song had kept to the rear of the party chen had spoken to song first then brought his quick bogu horse over beside dynlal my lord he said i am not certain how it is but the soldiers know what they should not what do you mean someone has spoken to them about teng pass word is spreading as we ride the second army was in the pass my lord these men will be grieving and angry zian moved up song shifted her mount to let him the road was wide they rode four abreast in the night they know who gave xu bihai that order the poet asked i believe that is so my lord lu chen was invariably courteous to the poet do you think it was intentional that they know this zians voice was grim tai looked quickly over at him i do not know my lord but i believe it would be wise to be cautious at the posting station he glanced at tai my lord i have determined that your honourable brother is in the other carriage i thought you might wish to know never much of a horseman tais honourable brother to their fathers regret even less so now undoubtedly clever in the extreme however hardworking ambitious precise with foresight and discipline he would never have let wen zhou send that order to teng pass tai knew it with certainty as surely as he understood how liu could send their sister to the barbarians he knew he would not have ordered xu bihai out of that pass into battle his kanlins were gathered tightly around him now someone had obviously given instructions he looked ahead at the carriage nearest to them the emperor of kitai was in there rolling through the night fleeing in the night could the world really come to encompass such a thing tai knew it could that it had before hed studied a thousand years of history hadnt he preparing for the examinations he knew the legacy of his people the dark and the brightly shimmering he knew of civil wars palace assassinations slaughter on battlefields cities sacked and burned he had not thought to live through any of these it suddenly occurred to him belatedly how almost all of the court and imperial familychildren grandchildren advisers concubineshad been left behind tonight to get away as best they could or face roshan when he came and there were two million people in xinan undefended his heart twisted be very alert hed written to rain so helpful that what would she do what was possible would she even get his message from that twisted figure in the street hed left two kanlins behind for herat least hed done that his mouth was dry again he spat into the dust beside the road zian handed over a wine flask wordlessly tai drank only a little he needed to be clearheaded surely above all else he glanced ahead wen zhou was still among those up front lit by torches he was easy to see on a splendid black horse a riding posture to be envied born to ride they said about him the light grew as they went on all but a handful of the brightest stars disappeared then these too were gone individual trees took shape on their right and fields on the other side of the road ripe with summer grain torches were extinguished and discarded end of night morning soft and clear tai looked back thin clouds east underlit pale pink pale yellow he caught a flash of blue bright between trees then he saw it again the lake ahead and to the right they came to the branching road that would lead around its shore to the extravagant luxury of the hot springs at mawai jade and gold there alabaster and ivory from the silk roads porcelain flawless silk marble floors and columns sandalwood walls room screens painted with mastery rare dishes from far lands exquisitely prepared music not today they carried on along the road straight past that lakeside cutoff so often taken by this court and not long after they came to the postal station inn and yard and stables instead riders had galloped ahead they were awaited the officers and attendants of the station were assembled in the courtyard some bowing three times some already prostrate in the dust all visibly terrified to have their emperor suddenly among them like this there was a clatter of coach wheels and horses and orders shouted then an odd intense nearsilence as they came to a halt birds were singing tai would remember it was a summer morning the imperial carriage stopped directly in front of the stations doors it was a handsome posting inn mawais so near xinan so very near the hot springs and aristocrats country estates and the tombs of the imperial family the carriage door was opened and they saw the emperor step down the exalted and glorious emperor taizu wore white unadorned with a black belt and hat alighting behind him in a vivid blue travelling robe with small gold flowers for decoration came jian the two of them went up the three steps to the stations porch it was deeply disturbing to see the emperor walking he was carried always his feet seldom touched the groundnot in the palace and certainly not here in the dust of an inn yard tai looked around and saw that he wasnt the only one unsettled by the sight wei song was biting her lip too much had changed too swiftly in a night the world was a different place he thought than it had been when they went to bed on the porch the emperor turnedtai hadnt thought he wouldand looked gravely out at those in the courtyard he lifted a hand briefly then turned and went inside he held himself very straight tai saw leaning on no one he didnt look like a fleeing man whod lost the guidance of heaven jian went in behind him the prime minister and the prince followed handing their horses to servants going quickly up the steps they didnt look at each other the other carriage door was opened by a servant tai saw his brother step down and walk into the station as well three other mandarins alighted and followed the posting station doors were closed there followed an interlude of disquiet in the courtyard no one seemed to have any idea what to do tai gave dynlals reins to a stable boy with orders to feed and water the horse and rub it down uncertainly he went up on the covered porch standing to one side zian came with him and then song and five of the kanlins staying close song was carrying her bow had her arrowquiver at one hip so did the other five on the western side of the yard tai saw a company of soldiers fifty of them a dui such as he had commanded once they appeared to have just arrived their banners and colours marked them as also being of the second army a mixed unit forty archers ten cavalry escorting them their presence was not unusual when the main eastwest road was congested troops would routinely be diverted this way the posting stations were used by soldiers in transit throughout the empire to change horses eat and rest receive new orders these men would be coming from the west assigned to the capital very likely or they might even have been heading all the way to teng pass to join their fellows there not any more tai thought some of the soldiers who had escorted their party here could be seen making their way across the inn yard to talk to the others they were all of the second army and there were tidings to share this is not good said sima zian quietly the two companies of soldiers were intermingled now talking with increasing intensity in small clusters tai looked for their officers wondering if theyd assert control that didnt seem to be happening the dui commander just drew his sword said song tai had seen it too he looked at her i have sent two of our people for sixty riders from the sanctuary lu chen said they cannot be here before end of day he said it as if apologizing of course not said tai they will not be in time to help said chen he had stepped in front of tai and the poet holding his bow they were towards one end of the porch away from the doors we are not the target of their anger said tai it doesnt matter sima zian murmured this mood finds targets as it goes and with that tai thought of a cabin in the north long ago when anger had turned into flames and worse he shook his head as if to shake off memory he said keep together no aggression there are more than seventy of them this cannot become violent the emperor is here the emperor is here hed actually said that he would recall later invoked the imperial presence like a talisman a ward something magical perhaps once it would have been but too much had changed by the time that days sun had risen an arrow flew in morning light it struck one of the doors of the posting station straight on burying itself vibrating there tai winced as if hed been hit himself so shocking was the sight and the sound it made hitting the wood three more arrows and then ten rapidly the archers of the second army were widely known for their skill and they were shooting only at doors and not from far away this was solidarity the dui acting together none of them would leave any others to face consequences alone tai looked for the dui commander again hoping he could stop this a vain hope entirely awry the commander not a young man grey in his short beard cold anger in his eyes strode to the foot of the steps leading up to the porch and shouted where is the first minister we demand to speak with wen zhou demand to speak demand knowing this might end his own days aware of what men in such a state as this could do they would be thinking about their fellows at teng pass tai stepped forward do not he heard song say a low strained voice he didnt feel as if he had a choice dui commander he said as calmly as he could this is unseemly please hear me my name is shen tai i am the son of general shen gao a name of honour among soldiers and you might know it i know who you are said the man only that but he did sketch a bow i was in chenyao when the governor assigned you an escort and gave you rank in the second army we share that army then said tai in that case said the commander you should be standing with us have you not heard what happened i have said tai why else are we here our glorious emperor is consulting even now with his advisers and the prince we must stand ready to serve kitai when they emerge with orders for us no said the officer below him not so not until wen zhou comes out to us stand aside son of shen gao if you will not come down we have no quarrel with the man who went to kuala nor but you must not be in our way had this been a younger man tai would later think what followed might have been different but the officer however lowranking had clearly been a soldier for a long time hed have had companions friends at teng pass and he would have just this moment learned what happened there the dui commander gestured towards the door more arrows struck all together loudly they had to sound like a hammer blow inside tai thought a hammering from the changed world he thought of jian more than any of the others in there even the emperor he wasnt sure why come out to us or we will come for you the officer shouted first minister wen commander of the armies of kitai your soldiers are waiting we have questions that must be answered must be from an officer of fifty men to the first minister of kitai tai wondered how the sun was climbing in the sky how birdsong sounded as it always did the door to the posting station opened wen zhou whom he hated came out long years after when that rebellion was another part of the pasta devastating part but over with and recedingthe historians charged with examining records such as remained from a disjointed time and shaping the story of those days were almost unanimous in their savage writings as they vied to recount the corrupt character from earliest childhood and the foul treachery of accursed an li more commonly known as roshan virtually without exception for hundreds of years roshan was painted in text after text as the grossest possible figure pustulent oozing with depraved appetite and ambition in these records it was generally the view that only the heroic and wise first minister wen zhou had seen through the vile barbarians dark designsalmost from the firstand done all he could to forestall them there were variations in the writings complicated by certain aspects of the records and by the need until later dynasties not to be at all critical of the great and glorious emperor taizu himself accordingly the most common explanation of the events at the outset of the an li rebellion involved incompetence and fear among the generals and officers assigned with defending teng passand xinan behind it a certain general xu bihai an otherwise inconsequential figure was routinely described with contempt as physically infirm and a coward this solution to the problem of explaining what happened was obvious given that official historians are civil servants and serve at the court of any dynastyand can readily be dismissed or worse it would have been deeply unwise to imply let alone assert any error or failing on the part of heavens emperor or his duly appointed ministers easier and safer to turn ones gaze and calligraphy to the soldiers the handsome aristocratic preternaturally wise first minister was also of course part of a legendary tragedy one embraced by both the common people and the artists of kitaiand this too surely played a role in the shaping of official records when the desire of the court and the tales of the people meld with the vision of great artists how should any prudent chronicler of the past set himself to resist the first minister showing no sign of unease stopped at the front of the porch above the three steps leading to the yard it left him tai thought looking disdainfully down on the dui commander and the soldiers wen zhou had had no real choice but to come out but this encounter needed care and part of that surely was to make clear the gulf wider than the great river in flood between himself and those below tall and magnificent zhou looked out into the sunlight of the yard he was dressed for riding no court silk but perfectly fitted cloth and leather boots no hat he often disdained a hat tai remembered from days in long lake park seeing him at a distance a much greater distance than this zhou extended an arm and swept it one finger extended in a slow wide arc across the inn yard he said his voice imperious each man here has forfeited his life for what has just been done the officers must be executed first no murmured sima zian under his breath not that way wen zhou went on but our infinitely merciful emperor mindful that these are difficult times for ordinary men to understand has elected to let this moment pass as if it were the troublesome behaviour of small children put away your weapons form ranks no punishment will be visited upon any of you await orders when we come out you will be needed in defending kitai and he turned amazingly to go back inside without waiting to see what they did as if it were inconceivable that anything other than immediate compliance could take place no said the dui commander tai could see that it cost him a great deal to say that single word the man was perspiring in the sunlight though the morning was mild wen zhou turned what did you say he asked his voice and manner tai thought could freeze a soul i think you heard me the officer said two others came to stand with him an archer and one of his officers of ten i heard treason said wen zhou no said one of the archers we have learned of treason just now why was the army ordered out of teng pass cried the greybearded commander and tai heard pain in his voice what snapped zhou will the heavens crack above us the sun fall are common soldiers asking questions of the taming now they didnt have to fight cried the dui commander everyone knows it and you are fleeing from xinan leaving it to roshan shouted the archer a small fierce figure why was any of this done they say you gave those orders directly the officer of ten said first hesitation in wen zhou tai saw his mouth was dry again he didnt move he couldnt move zhou drew himself up who says such a thing those who rode with you have told us cried the archer your own guards heard it on the ride tai turned to sima zian the poets face was stricken tai wondered how he looked himself he heard wen zhou again this encounter is over soldiers take custody of these three men your dui commander is relieved of his post bind them and hold them for execution when we come out kitai will fall if such chaos is permitted soldiers of the second army do as you are ordered no man moved in the inn yard a flurry of wind stirring the dust birdsong again and always no you must answer us said the archer his voice had altered tai heard song draw a breath behind him he saw wen zhou look down into the inn yard with the withering lifelong contempt a man such as he would have for those below he turned to go back inside and so the arrow that killed him struck from behind sima zian the banished immortal master poet of the age who was there that day at the mawai posting inn never wrote a word about that morning a thousand other poets over centuries did take those events as a subject beginning with the death of wen zhou poets like historians have many reasons for varying or amending what might have taken place often they simply do not know the truth before the prime minister fell there were five arrows in him the bowmen of the second army would not let one of their number carry the burden of this deed alone by the time the poems of lament were in full spate like a river some versifiers had twentyfive arrows with nightblack feathers protruding from the first ministers back as he lay in his red blood upon the porch poets straining for pathos and power oblivious to the excesses of their images tai stepped forward his swords remained sheathed his hands were shaking no my lord cried song shen tai please hold and hold echoed the dui commander below eyeing him narrowly visibly afraid frightened men were dangerous tai saw that the mans hands were also trembling the commander stood alone now exposed in the dusty inn yard the archer was no longer beside him nor his officer they had withdrawn blending back in with their fellows tai was quite sure he could recognize the archer the man whod fired first the bowmen in the yard all had arrows to string so he saw glancing back did song and the other kanlins they stepped forward to surround him they would be killed before he was this must stop he cried a little desperately he pushed forward past song he looked down at the dui commander you know surely you know it must stop you know what he did said the commander his voice was harsh with strain he sent all those menan armyto their deaths left xinan open to ruin and only because he feared for himself if the officers in the pass decided hed caused this rebellion we cant know that cried tai he felt weary and sick and afraid there was a dead man beside him and the emperor was inside there was no reason for our army to leave the pass that one there sent the order in the middle of the night with the halfseal he gave it himself ask those who escorted you here how do you know this cried tai how would they know and the officer in the inn yard below not a young man said then quietly ask the prince you came here with tai closed his eyes hearing that he felt suddenly as if he might fall because it fit it made a terrible bitter kind of sense the prince would be readying himself to take command now with a fullfledged war upon them and his father so frail and if the prime minister was the one who had created this sudden nightmare they had seen shinzu ride ahead in the darkness on the road to join the escort from the second army speak with them a mans actions could have unexpected consequences sometimes they could come back to haunt you even if you were a prime minister of kitai also perhaps if you were a prince of kitai tai opened his eyes found himself unable to speak just then and so instead he heard in that bright clear morning light near mawai and its blue lake another man do so from among the gathered soldiers lifting his voice one more must die now or we will all be killed tai didnt understand not at first his immediate thought was you are all going to die in any case he didnt say it he was too shaken to speak very near him blood slowly spreading on the wooden porch lay wen zhou oh please no said sima zian barely a breath not this tai remembered that too that it was the poet who realized first what was happening he turned quickly to look at the other man then wheeled back to the courtyard and with a sorrow that never left him that lay in memory in his days forever after as powerful in its way as the terrible images of the bogu by the northern lake tai saw the soldiers step forward together well trained and he heard the one who had just spoken speak again and this manwhose face tai never properly saw among seventy or so of themsaid very clearly he was prime minister for only one reason all kitai knows it we will be slain in vengeanceby her she destroyed the emperors will with her dark power and has brought us all to this through her cousin she must come out to us or this cannot end dancer to the music bright as morning light lovely as green leaves after rain or green jade or the weaver maids star in the sky when the sun goes down chapter xxv this will not happen said tai he said it as forcefully as he could feeling a frantic need to push back against where the morning had now gone a trickle of perspiration slid down his side fear was in him a twisting thing he said she was working to control her cousin wen zhou had even tried to kill me at kuala nor she was gathering information on that against him he felt ashamed telling soldiers this but the moment was surely beyond shame or privacy hidden among the others the archer he would remember the voice shouted this family has destroyed kitai driven us to civil war as long as she lives they will poison us that was clever a part of tai was thinking a moment ago it had been about their own safety those who had killed wen zhounow it was something else bring her out said the dui commander tai felt like cursing him he held back this was not a time to let anger overwhelm he said as calmly as he could i am not going to allow another death commander control your men the man shook his head i will but after the wen family poison is purged from among us our companions were sent out from teng pass will you measure two against so many you have been a soldier you know how many men are dead there does not the taming invoke execution when someone in power has erred so greatly she is only a woman a dancer he was dissembling now but desperate and women have never shaped power in kitai tai opened his mouth and closed it he stared at the man below a twist of the officers mouth i sat the examinations twice he said studied eight years before accepting that i would never pass them i know some things about the court my lord tai would wonder about this later too if the world as it went forward from that day might have been otherwise had another leader and his fifty men been shifted to the northern route from the congested highway to xinan there are always branches along paths i will not permit this tai said again as coldly as he could the commander gazed up at him he didnt look triumphant or vengeful tai thought the man said almost regretfully there are eight of you we have better than seventy men why would you wish to kill your kanlins or yourself do you not have tasks in the war upon us now tai shook his head aware again of anger he fought it the man was telling only truth tai could kill a great many people with the wrong thing said or done here even so i have no task greater than stopping this if you wish to move into that posting station you will have to kill me and my guards and deprive kitai of two hundred and fifty sardian horses he was willing to play that card too there was a short silence if we must said the dui commander eight more deaths will not change what is to come along with however many of us fall including myself i dont matter i know enough to know that and the horses are your duty not ours stand aside my lord i am asking you tai said sima zian softly at his elbow they are not going to stop for you nor i for them said tai there comes a point when life is not worth enduring if one steps back i agree master shen a womans voice from the open doorway to the posting station she had come out tai turned and he looked at her their eyes met he knelt near the blood of her cousin where it was spreading on the porch and with a shiver he saw that not only did his kanlins also kneel and the poet but every soldier in the inn yard did the same the moment passed the soldiers stood up and tai saw that the archers still held their bows arrows to strings it was only then that he accepted that this was going to happen and he could not stop it in part because he saw in her eyes that she willed it to be so poet she said looking at zian with the mocking smile tai remembered i still grieve that you chose to be ironic with your last verse about me not more than i do illustrious lady said sima zian and tai saw that he had not risen from his knees and there were tears on his face you brought a shining to our time her smile deepened she looked pleased and young tai stood up he said will the emperor not come he can stop this surely she looked at him for what seemed a long time those in the courtyard were waiting motionless the posting station of mawai felt to tai as if it were the centre of the empire of the world all else everyone else suspended around it unknowing this is my choice she said i told him he must not she hesitated holding tais gaze he is no longer emperor in any case he gave the ring to shinzu it is the right thing to do there will be a hard war and my beloved is no longer young you are said tai it is too soon my lady do not take this brightness away others are taking it some will remember the brightness she gestured a dancer shen tai i remember sharing lychees with you on this road i thank you for it and for standing here now she wore blue with small golden peonies royalty of flowers embroidered on the silk her hairpins were decorated with lapis lazuli and two of her rings were also of lapis he saw she wore no earrings that morning her slippers were silk and golden with pearls he was near enough to tell that she had not left the taming in the middle of the night without the scent she always wore nor had she left without considering the sardian horses at the border and sending a messenger through the night city for the only man who could claim them for kitai you must let me go jian said softly all of you he let her go he dreamed of it and saw it in his minds eye waking all the rest of his days he watched her turn poised unhurried stepping lightly past her fallen cousin who had brought them all to this she went down the steps alonelifting her robe so it might not catchand into the yard and she went forward there in morning sunlight now to stand before the soldiers who had called her out to kill her it was a dusty inn yard filled with fighting men not a place for silk they knelt they knelt down again before her she is too young tai thought in the room she had left an old emperor and a new one remained out of sight tai wondered if they were watching if they could see with mild surprise he saw tears on songs face too she was wiping at them angrily he didnt think shed ever trusted or liked jian perhaps liking was without importance sometimes with some people the dancers like summer stars you didnt say you liked a star in the sky he moved to the top of the steps leading down he had no idea what he was doing he was living inside sorrow jian said clear as a temple bell sounding across fields i have a request dui commander the officer was still kneeling he looked up for an instant then lowered his head again my lady he said i would not like to die as my cousin did to have arrows disfigure my body or perhaps my face is there a man here kind enough to kill me without marring me with with a knife perhaps that faltering her first since coming out the commander looked up again but not directly at her my lady such a man would be too clearly marked for death it is not proper for me to name anyone in my company to that jian seemed to consider it no she said i understand i am sorry to have troubled you with such a request it was childish of me do as you must dui commander childish tai heard a footfall behind him then a voice by his side i will do it said the voice i am marked in any case the tone was precise not beautiful as a temple bell but firm no uncertainty tai looked at his brother liu was gazing at the commander in the yard his posture and expression defining authority a man accustomed to being heard without raising his voice he wore his mandarins robe and a soft hat and the belt and key of his rank as always the man he had served was lying in blood at his feet that was it of course add wen zhous death to the emperors abdication a new emperor for kitai consider lius position as the first ministers principal adviser and and you had this tai thought added to the other moments unfolding here one by one a morning tale the dui commander nodded his head jerkily he seemed for the first time overawed by what theyd set in motion not so as to falter his soldiers would not allow it by now but by the weight the resonance of this liu lifted a hand in a practised gesture one moment then dui commander and i will be with you jian had turned was looking up at the two brothers my lady said liu and bowed to her then he turned to tai this needs to happen he said crisply quietly i was the prime ministers man there is a price to be paid for a failure such as this did you have anything to do with that order teng pass liu looked contemptuous tai knew that look am i such a fool in your eyes he never spoke of it he stopped seeking my counsel on some things from the time you returned to xinan second brother lius thin superior smile you might say your return caused all this you mean my failure to die at kuala nor or chenyao if i understand it rightly tai blinked stared anger slipped away lius smile also faded they looked at each other the sons of shen gao you didnt truly think i had anything to do with that the sensation was so strange relief like a wave and then another wave of sorrow i wondered tai said we knew it came from wen zhou liu shook his head it would have made no sense i knew how far away you were if you were still alive you could do nothing about limei even if you were foolish enough to want to why would i need you dead why would he tai looked down at the dead man beside them he didnt which is one reason he never told me about it it was nothing but arrogance he did it because of the woman and because he could and teng pass he was afraid of xu bihai afraid the general would decide the rebellion was zhous fault and come to an arrangement with the rebels i think he feared all soldiers a slight smile makes this morning amusing doesnt it tai said that wouldnt be my word for it liu flicked his fingers dismissively you have he said no sense of irony listen now and carefully he waited for tai to nod an instructor confirming a students attention liu said the horses will save your life let it be said abroadby the kanlins if you can do itthat i did try to have you killed they wont lie you must make them think you believe it why why do i need to the familiar impatient look because shinzu is more clever than any of us suspected and if he thinks you are linked to me i am linked to you first brother lius expression was impatient again think in this imperial family brotherhood can mean hatred and murder as easily as anything else shinzu will know that tai there is a clear path to power for you for our family he honours you already he will have need of advisers his own men over and above your bringing the horses tai said nothing liu didnt wait for him to speak also the lands given you by the great river a very good property but not safe for the next while i have no idea which way roshan will go but he might move south after they take xinan and finish killing there he will allow killing in the city a small headshake as if it pained liu that someone might not see these things of course he will wen zhou slew his son and the rebel soldiers are hard men more than half of them barbarians almost all of the imperial family are still in the city they are dead when he finds them xinan will be a bad place for the rest of this summer at least people will be leaving in panic as soon as today his voice was brisk low no one else could hear the soldiers were waiting jian tai thought was waiting liu seemed to come to the same awareness i cannot linger to teach you he said our own estate will likely be safe for our mothers but have an eye to them wherever you are keep shinzu content stay as close to him as you can if this rebellion lasts a long time and i think it will now there is a man in hangdu near our property his name is pang he has only one leg you cannot miss finding him at the market he has been buying and storing grain for me for our family in a hidden barn i had built some time ago he needs to be paid three thousand a month the middle of every month you are wealthy now but there will be shortages of food try to keep buying these things are yours now to look after do you understand second brother tai swallowed i understand he said pang in hangdu liu looked at him no affection no fear not much of anything to be read in the soft smooth face tai said i am sorry for this brother i am pleased to know you did not send the assassins liu shrugged i might have if i had thought it prudent for any reason i dont think so liu a superior smile well remembered you did until now i know my error i request forgiveness his brother glanced away then shrugged again i forgive you what i did for our family limei made a princess i would do again tai it was a master stroke tai said nothing his brother looked at him then away towards the courtyard so was kuala nor liu added softly it was suddenly difficult to speak i didnt think of it that way i know you didnt said liu if you can have me buried beside father in the orchard another thin smile as he glanced back you are skilled at quieting ghosts are you not and with that he went down the steps to the sunlit yard drawing a jewelled court blade from the sleeve of his robe tai saw him approach jian and bow to her the dui commander was the only one near them and now he withdrew backing away a dozen steps as if to belatedly distance himself from this tai saw his brother say something to jian too softly for anyone to hear but he saw her smile as if surprised and pleased by what she heard she murmured something to liu and he bowed again he spoke one more time and after a motionless instant she nodded her head she made a dancers spinning movement a last one the sort that ends a performance and releases the audiences approval and applause she ended it with her back to liu to the posting station she faced south her people had come from the south towards the cypress trees lining the road and the summer fields beyond them bright in morning light and tais brother placed his left hand around her waist to steady the both of them and he thrust his knife cleanly into her between ribs into the heart from behind liu held her gently carefully as she died and then he held her a little longer and then he laid her down on her back in the dust of that yard because there was nothing else he could do he knelt beside her a moment arranging her clothing one of her hairpins had come loose tai watched his brother fix it in place again then liu set down his jewelled blade and stood up and he moved a distance away from her towards the archers of the second army he stopped do it he said making it his command and was standing very straight as they sent half a dozen arrows into him tai had no way of knowing if his brothers eyes were open or closed before he died he did become aware after a time that sima zian was beside him saying nothing but present he looked out into the yard at liu face down and at jian on her back the blue robe spread about her and it seemed to him that sunlight was wrong for what the moment was what it would always be now even as it receded this morning brightness the birds rising and darting their singing he said that to the poet should there be birdsong zian said no and yes we do what we do and the world continues somewhere a child is being born and the parents are tasting a joy they never imagined i know that said tai but here should there be so much light here no said sima zian after a moment not here my lords it was song tai turned to her he had never seen her looking as she did now my lords we request your permission she said we wish to kill two of them later the commander and the first archer the small one only two but it must be done she wiped at her cheeks you have mine said zian eyes gazing out upon the courtyard you have mine said tai the starcloud of her hair flowerpetal of her cheek goldandjade of her jewels when she danced a different poet younger would write that part of a very long verse one that would be remembered among all the deservedly forgotten ones about that morning at mawai on the posting station porch shaded from sunlight two men came out a little later to stand before the soldiers the older one his hands trembling holding himself not nearly as upright as before formally presented the younger one his son with the phoenix ring in public this time making him emperor of kitai the soldiers all of them the posting inn servants the kanlins on the porch shen tai the older of the surviving sons of shen gao and the poet sima zian all knelt faces to inn yard dust or wooden porch and so became the first to pay homage to the glorious and exalted emperor shinzu of the ninth dynasty of kitai in the first year of the an li rebellion just before xinan fell the new emperors commands were exact measured appropriate there were three dead people here the kanlins were asked to attend to them with assistance from their sanctuary jian would be carried to the imperial family tombs close by the oldest son of general shen gao was after a consultation with his brother also given to the kanlins with the request that his body be preserved and taken to his familys estate for burial word would go ahead to the family the body of the former first minister wen zhou was to be burned by the kanlins on a pyre at their sanctuary duly shrouded and with rites but not with courtly honours the ashes would be scattered not preserved the absence of ceremony was obviouslyand cleverlydesigned to allay the fears of the soldiers who had killed him the fatheremperor taizu who had awakened in the middle of this night as ruler of kitai frailseeming grieving and bewildered in the bright day was to be escorted to safety in the far southwest beyond the great river in due course it was hoped he would recover his strength and purpose and be brought back with dignity to his sons renewed court in xinan the emperor shinzu himself would go north he would make shuquian in the loop of the golden river his base it had served that purpose before in kitai xinan could not be held but it could be retaken there was no hint of concession to the rebels in the new emperor no flicker of doubt or surrender an error had been made by a minister the man and his adviser were dead as required here this morning the woman lying in the dust might be considered a source of regret now and afterwards but no one judging the matter with clarity of mind could deny that her family was at the root of this disaster just as women in kitai could reap the benefit of the deeds of the men they knew they could not be immune when those men fell one small incident noted by only a handful of people in that inn yard occurred just before taizu reentered his coach to be escorted from mawai an alchemist a lean cleric of the sacred path emerged cautiously from the second coach where he had evidently remained through the violent events of the morning he approached taizu bearing what wasevidentlythe mornings elixir designed to help pursue immortality the emperor the former emperor waved this man away shortly afterwards master shen tai a person of some importance now was summoned by the new emperor into the posting station he knelt there and was presented with another ring pale jadethe first gift offered by shinzu as emperor of kitai shen tai was instructed to leave with the retired emperor for the posting station on the imperial road to chenyao from there as soon as his sixty kanlin warriors arrived from their sanctuary he was to proceed swiftly to hsien on the border with tagur to claim his horses and bring them safely back to shuquian the emperor formally requested that the sardians be made available to the empire shen tai formally acceded to this expressing great happiness at being able to be of use to kitai xinan was about to be one of the most terrible places on earth tai had realized it at some point on the night ride to mawai and then his brother liu had said the same thing to him and his brother liu was someone who waswho had beenbrilliantly clever about courts and armies and the world and if this was so if a red violence was approaching from the east dust rising even now beneath an armys marching tread and their horses hooves there was a woman to be taken from the city especially since that woman had been the concubine of the man who would surely be the most hated in xinan even before the rebels came vengeance could give birth to horrors not to be spoken aloud so could fear one woman who had given all of them music and more was dead this morning in her youth and grace tai wasnt ready to lose another now because of wen zhou he had always known that actions could have unintended consequences any mans actions of whatever rank but sometimes events could also be shaped words had been spoken to soldiers by the imperial heir on their ride from the palace consequences had followed wen zhou jian tais brother and the emperor yielding the throne that same morning to his son tai had knelt before the serene and exalted emperor shinzu ruling now with the mandate of heaven and realized he didnt know how much had been foreseen or intended by this man he didnt ever expect to know for certain he would do his duty kitai was an empire at war now beset from within but the kanlins from the sanctuary could not be at the imperial highway inn before nightfall at best so he had a little time though hed have to move at speed and probably through the night again depending upon what he found in xinan as ordered he started from the inn yard with his own kanlins taizus carriage and the soldiers whod escorted their party from the palace in the night the other fifty men of the second army were going north with the new emperor it was a great honour their dui commander had them standing in rigid disciplined order in the courtyard awaiting the command to set out tai had watched wei song observing this he thought about the idea that these men were being honoured he said nothing sometimes it was better not to know the details of what might come and he had his own task to attend to now a short distance from mawai he reined dynlal to a halt and in the middle of the roadway told song and zian and lu chen his intention he didnt present it as a matter for discussion they all came with him his other kanlins stayed with taizu and the soldiers theyd wait at the inn for the sixty riders from the sanctuary tai and three companions set out across the fields cutting south to intersect the imperial highway they rode through a latesummer morning and then an afternoon that ought to have registered as beautiful high white clouds and a breeze from the west he was thinking of death behind them and at teng pass and increasingly as they rode with a cold awareness of more to come in the days ahead the road system near xinan was exceptionally good it was rare that riders had to cross farmland or skirt the edges of what small bamboo forests remained they found a track leading east then another running off it south towards the highway passing through village after village a blurred progression people came out to watch them gallop through or stopped in whatever they were doing riders moving so fast was unusual something to talk about on a quiet day dynlal was a glory running easily the other three had changed mounts at the station even so he could have outstripped them had he chosen to he almost did make that choice but he knew hed need them when he entered the city he never entered the city he never came close to doing so they heard the noise like a heavy storm or a waterfall before they saw anything a roar of sound as they raced up a rise in their small roadway near the highway then they crested that rise and saw what was happening below the city was emptying out in panic his heart aching tai saw the imperial road thronged with the people of xinan pushing west in a tumultuous mass that spilled into the drainage ditches and across them into the clogged going of the summer fields beside the road people were struggling with their belongings on their backs or pulling carts with children and the elderly and their goods the noise was punishing at times a scream or cry would rise above it as someone was pushed into the ditch or fell and was trampled if you fell you were likely to die progress was agonizingly slow tai saw and the mass of people stretched back east as far as he could see he couldnt even see the city gates they were too far away but he could imagine them all the gates word of disaster had arrived xinans inhabitants were not inclined it seemed to wait for roshan to come to them they will starve out here said sima zian softly and these are just this mornings vanguard only the beginning some will stay said lu chen some always stay for their homes their families they will keep their heads down and hope that bloodshed passes eventually it probably will said tai he wants to rule doesnt he eventually agreed lu chen but that can seem like forever is it going to be forever this war tai looked at song who had asked that gazing down on the crawlingforward multitude on the road she was biting her lower lip no he said but much will change everything she asked looking at him much he said again not everything tai we cant get into the city it was zian we must hope she received your warning and responded but theres no way to swim against this current tai looked at him a bleakness in his heart then he shook his head yes we can swim is a good idea well get in through the canals it was a good idea but it didnt matter sometimes that happens they spent the rest of the afternoon cutting overland across fields and along small roads again forcing their way east even the back roads and rutted cart tracks had crowds by late in the day all fleeing west it became difficult to make any headway people cursed the four of them on their horses if it hadnt been for the kanlins the respect and apprehension they engendered they might even have been attacked tai fought anger and panic aware that time was running against them when they finally reached a vantage point forcing tiring horses up a ridge from which they could see xinans walls he heard a voice cursing and realized it was his own in the evening light xinan capital of the empire glory of the world was spread below them the city looked like a hive with all the insects in flight from it pouring out of every gate along all roads and within the walls they could see smoke rising roshan was days away and already xinan was burning look at the taming sima zian said the palace was on fire theyll be looting it said tai where are the guards song cried looting it tai said wearily zian murmured they know the emperor has fled what could the city understand from that other than that hes abandoned it abandoned them he left to regroup to gather armies the dynasty will fight songs tone revealed a great strain we know that the poet answered gently but how does that help those down there with an li coming for them tai was looking at the canals where they flowed lazily into the city under arches in the walls bearing firewood and lumber marble and other stone and heavy goods and foodstuffs on any normal day there were substantial punishments for being found in a canal they were known to be a weakness in the citys defences there were thousands of people he saw who had chosen to take the risk of a beating today so many bodies were in the water pushing fighting their way through bearing goods on their heads children on their backs or carrying nothing at all but terror and the need to get away people will drown he thought lu chen lifted a hand and pointed tai saw a new tongue of flame within the taming palace the others sat their horses beside him on the ridge they said nothing they were honouring his sorrow tai knew by letting him be the one to say it to surrender the days hopeless quest they had come with him and stayed by him he sat astride dynlal gazing at a nightmare or the beginnings of a nightmare the sun was setting its long light falling upon xinan making the walls seem gold he was thinking of rain of green eyes and yellow hair and a mind shrewder than his own even in the days when hed been immersed in his studies trying to understand ancient courts and longdead sages and the forms and rhythms of poetry he was thinking of her singing for him of her hands in his hair the two of them on a bed in a lamplit room there were so many poems over so many hundreds of years about courtesans young or not young any more at upper windows above jade or marble stairs at twilight time or by moonlight waiting for lovers to return the night comes and the stars the streets are lit by lanterns on stone walls the nightingale cries in the garden still no sound of horses hooves beneath my open window we cant do this he said we have to go back i am sorry he was for so many things as a long summer day finally went down to the dark they turned west again leaving the fires behind it took most of the night to reach the inn on the imperial road the same one where hed awakened on a morning in spring to find song wounded and held by soldiers and wen jian waiting to take him to mawai because they were riding even on tired horses and off the main roads eventually they outpaced the struggling exhausted vanguard of refugees from xinan theyd made their way down to the highway it lay open before them under moonlight serene and beautiful the kanlins from the sanctuary sixty of them as promised were waiting when they reached the inn taizu was asleep they reported tai had dynlal led away to be watered and rubbed down and fed they all needed to rest he knew it but he was unable to sleep he was boneweary and heartsick song and lu chen went off with the other kanlins he thought of inviting her to stay with him hed seen how distressed she was he didnt feel able to offer comfort shed be better off with the warriors he thought or perhaps not he didnt know he didnt have that much clarity in him tonight mawai what had happened there and xinan on fire with spring rain inside the walls or perhaps trapped among tens of thousands on one road or another he didnt know he walked through the reception chamber of the inn saw frightened men standing there unsure of what to say or think they bowed to him he went through into the courtyard the garden a little later zian came out and found him tai was sitting on a bench under a mulberry tree the poet carried wine and two cups he sat down and poured and tai drained a cup then held it out again zian filled it a second time and tai drank that too the poet was a quiet comforting presence it felt illicit somehow to take comfort in anything tonight friendship starlight the night breeze zian said you will need to rest i know you will leave in the morning before sunrise we should stay ahead of those fleeing the city tai looked at the other man a shadow beside him the leaves above blocked the moonlight you are coming with us a short silence then zian shook his head it may be arrogant of me a delusion but i believe i can do more good with the emperor the fatheremperor taizu cant keep up with us of course not but he will be grieving and he has only that fool of an alchemist with him and soldiers he has a long way to go and the roads are hard heavens way is bent like a bow now perhaps an old poet can help you arent old tonight i am there was a silence in the garden and then tai heard the poet speak again offering him a gift together our spirits soared to nine heavens but soon we will scatter like stars before rain i follow a fading dragon over hills and rivers you must journey to far borders perhaps one day you will go home my friend crossing a last bridge over the river wai tai said nothing for a time he was moved and very tired the wine the words the stillness i will see you again if heaven allows i will hope so well drink good wine in another garden listening to pipa music tai drew a breath i will hope so where where will you be i dont know where will you be shen tai i dont know chapter xxvi ye lao once understeward to the beloved companion wen jian was now principal household steward to the honourable and distinguished master shen tai son of the famous general this meant of course that he was burdened with formal responsibility for master shens quite substantial compound in xinan in extremely uncertain times household stewards without exception preferred certainty ye lao had never endured a major rebellion or the arrival of angry soldiers in any city or palace hed known you heard tales about such times you didnt live through themif the gods in the nine heavens were kind they werent always kind of course being quite good at his job and priding himself on it lao refused to allow himself to be unduly frightened or flustered and most definitely did not permit the household servants to see a hint of such feelings in him until the army of an li was actually sighted at the eastern gates of the city seven days after the emperor and a handful of the court had fled at that point as rebel soldiers began pouring into xinan and reports of shocking conduct reached master shens compound ye lao found himself becoming slightly perturbed the jackals were in the city someone quoted the dragons were in the wild xinan was left open for roshan of course only fools would close city gates when there were no soldiers to defend them but this courtesy had not induced any immediate limiting of violence one expected in the usual way of soldiers arriving in a civilized place a certain amount of intoxication destruction looting even killing unnecessary though it was it was undoubtedly wisest to keep women out of sight and hope the poor girls in the pleasure districts proved equal to the task of assuaging a drunken army about half a million citizens of xinan had if widespread reports were accurate chosen to flee ahead of the rebels theyd streamed out in all directions trampling each other in their haste some had even gone east right into the approaching storm probably towards country homes and family hoping to scurry north and south around the advancing army and get back to their farmland roots most of those escaping went west or south a certain number were reported to be making their way north once word arrived that the new emperor shinzu it was a difficult idea a new emperor was rallying the ninth dynasty there in ye laos view most of the people in flight were making a mistake unless they had family in the country with room for them an actual place to go starvation outside xinan was a real possibility in fact with so many on the move it was hard to imagine how they could all be sheltered and fed even with family waiting it was assumed by those who stayed that an li and his sons intended to establish themselves in the taming palace and would therefore act in a manner befitting a selfproclaimed new dynasty there would be some measure of undisciplined behaviour but that would surely be brought under control and life in the capital would resume in acceptable fashion with this underlying thought in xinan one that he shared it was profoundly shocking for ye lao to learn of wanton slaughter in the palace from the first hours and continuing there were public executions in the square before the tamings walls it was reported that the hearts of dead members of the imperial family were being ripped out and offered as a sacrifice to the ghost of an lis slain son it was said that some were executed by having the tops of their heads ripped off with iron claws bodies were piled in the square and it was forbidden to claim them for burial huge bonfires were built and men and women were burned with black choking smoke rising and an appalling stench it was barbarous in ye laos view all mandarins found even newly graduated lowly officials were killed within the purple myrtle court if they hadnt had the foresight to discard their robes and belts and hide themselves in the city or flee the women of the palace were report had it being fearfully abused many of taizus concubines and musicians were being shipped in wagons as slaves back towards yenling and the rebel soldiers left behind there roshan knew what needed doing to keep an army happy there was a widespread smashingin of private gates almost at random as inebriated soldiers crashed through spilling destruction and death not all of xinans wives and daughtersor younger boyswere successfully hidden there were fires everywhere in those first days you risked your life walking the streets in search of food the markets were closed bodies lay among refuse and wild animals smoke and yellow dust and the smell of burning word was conveyed by military heralds moving through the city that anyone offering to the new dynastys illustrious leaders the whereabouts of children or grandchildren of taizuonce emperor now unmasked as a coward and having lost the mandate of heavenany such information would be met with a reward and formal assurances of household safety what followed was ugly as the hiding places of taizus many offspring and their children often very young were promptly reported their disguises revealed these helpless hapless princes and princesses were every one of them brought to the bonfires before the taming walls and beheaded steward ye laos distaste for such conduct was beyond his capacity to express this man an li had proclaimed himself an emperor successor to nine dynasties of glory in kitai men lao thought grimly were no better than beasts they were wolves or tigers he kept his head up and his ears open gathered what information he could and ensured that the household of master shen remained as orderly as possible under trying conditions some of the staff had fled in the first days but most had nowhere to go and had stayed fearfully there was a private well in the second rightside courtyard of the compound a pleasing indication of its importance lao arranged for every bucket and pail on the property to be filled and kept in readiness should the fires one could see everywhere now reach them he had linens soaked in water every morning food was a difficult matter but not yet impossible after ten days roshan allowed the markets to reopen for those brave enough to venture forth either to sell or to buy some farmers began hesitantly coming in after that with milk and eggs vegetables and poultry millet and barley picking their way past dead bodies and crying abandoned children and smouldering ruins prices were high you could call them outrageous except that you really couldnt under the circumstances ye lao expected them to go higher he took thought one morning and an idea came to him a recollection hadnt master shen had an encounter with roshan himself on his way back to xinan from the west if memory served it had been the day before ye lao himself and his former mistress had encountered shen tai at the posting inn on the imperial road he didnt know any details and no one in the compound knew more he asked but on impulsea stewards instinct based on his masters natureye lao composed a brief careful note and had it conveyed by a terrified underservant one he judged expendable to the taming once roshan had ordered the killing there to stop he was occupying the palace himself and had probably realized he needed some people to run it an experienced steward could have told him that from the outset word was that the phoenix throne itself had been smashed to fragments and the gemstones embedded in it removed by some members of the imperial family before theyd fled this to prevent a barbarian usurper from placing his gross body on that throne ye lao approved quietly he never did learn if his note was received there was no reply in it hed simply advised the palace all who might be there serving the revered and august emperor an li of the tenth dynasty who owned this particular property he did note in the days and weeks that followed allowing himself a small measure of satisfaction that no soldiers came to their gates no one smashed them open to do what they were doing elsewhere it was disturbing to learn as they did learn what had been done to the household of the late first minister within his city compound not far away at all in this same ward as if those poor men and women had had any role in the crimes attributed to wen zhou the first minister was dead a ghost denied honourable burial why would anyone feel a need to take brutal blooddrenched vengeance on household servants concubines stewards ye lao was angry a disturbing feeling for a man who prided himself on a trained stewards composure he continued to manage the compound as best he could through the late summer which was hot that year and dry increasing the risk of fires as the days passed the city was slowly brought under control bodies were removed from the streets a subdued hesitant rhythm returned to the capital the sunrise drums the evening drums most of the rebel soldiers left for battlefields north and south shinzu appeared to be rallying the ninth dynasty forces against them in xinan the killings and looting diminished if they never entirely stopped some of it by now was pure thievery lao knew criminals using chaos for their own purposes every so often another member of taizus family would be discovered in hiding and killed ye lao awaited instructions of any kind though without any real confidence that theyd come he had no idea if master shen was even alive he knew hed left the cityhed watched him go in the middle of a night he did think perhaps too trustingly that theyd have heard if he were dead even with the empire fractured by war theyd learned of other deaths for exampleincluding that of the first minister and the lady wen jian that news had come right at the outset after the emperor fled well before roshans arrival to ye lao the tidings had for many reasons brought great sadness over time he heard that there were poems being written about her passing a brightness fallen from the world a star returning to the heavens words to such effect ye lao had no ear for poetry on the other hand later in what turned out to be a very long life he would tell stories about her warming himself on winter nights with the glow in peoples eyes when they understood that hed served wen jian that hed knelt before her been spoken to kissed the hem of her robe she had passed into legend by then back in that summer when the rebels came his task as he came to understand it was straightforward to preserve order in one small place one household in a world that had lost all sense of order or claim to being civilized he didnt give it a great deal of thought caught up in his daytoday tasks but one morning in autumn it suddenly came to him that the men and women here in master shen tais compound trusted him completely relied upon him were doing whatever he ordered for reasons that went beyond rank or deference he was keeping them alive most nights now rain awakens afraid disturbed by sounds that turn out to be nothing at all whether they are in some small inn on the road or a larger one in a city as now she doesnt like being so fearful it isnt how she thinks of herself but the times are very dangerous and she knows she isnt the only one feeling this way she is alive to feel anything at alland shes acutely aware of thisonly because of a note sent in the middle of the night and because two men turned out to be loyal beyond anything she might have expected and because of the kanlins of course perhaps also her own decisiveness but when she looks back at that night it doesnt seem to her that shed felt decisive she had been panicked as much as anything acted on impulse instinct fear small things a difference in her own mood that night a message not sent or lost or not delivered until morning by which time it would have been impossible to get away smallest differences living or dying such thoughts could keep you awake at night they now know here in chenyao to the west a little of what happened in xinan after they left the two kanlins still with her have ways of discovering information even in wartime a time when letters go astray when posting inn horses are all claimed by the army when news of any kind is worth a fortune in particular they have learned what took place in the city compound of the recently deceased first minister wen zhou when the rebel army arrived in the capital is it so surprising really if she startles awake at alarming sounds in the dark or never even falls asleep it is the narrowness of survival of her being here and alive that unsettles as much as anything that and the awareness of how many are dead and how savagely she knows names remembers faces it is impossible not to think about what would have been done to her as favoured concubine there are sickening stories worse than anything ever heard about the barbarians beyond kitais borders she is from beyond those borders sardia is a beleaguered little kingdom that has always known warfare and contended with invasion even so rain has never heard tales such as those that come to them from xinan xinan which lies behind her only because tai sent a note in the middle of the night hed been summoned to the palaceshe understands that from the kanlins wen zhou had been sent for as well that was what had put her on edge that night hed been with her when the message came sitting up in bed watching him read it by the light of a quickly lit lamp rain had understood that this wasnt any routine summons to the taming those didnt come at this hour and they didnt shake him so profoundly hed dressed in haste and left immediately with guards saying nothingnothingto her to anyone also disturbing hed burned the note or shed have retrieved it and read it as soon as she was alone some time laterthe passage of time that night is blurredhwan had come with another message this one addressed to her he might so easily have waited until morning that would have made all the difference or the note might not have reached her at all it had been carried by qin the crippled beggar in the street she understood and it humbled her even now that he had entrusted it to no one had paid coins to a drunken tradesman and why had he been in the street passing by so late to carry himcarry himall the long way around to the front gates of the compound and hed stayed there painfully on his feet banging at the gates and shouting until someone had sleepily angrily come and then hed demanded loudly fiercely without backing down that hwan be brought to him and no one else but hwan and improbably another source of fear in her imagining those moments they hadnt beaten him and turned him away hwan awake since the master had ridden out had come to see what the disturbance was the disturbance he had accepted the note hand passing it to hand and brought it to her immediately not waiting for morning perhaps hed known shed be awake perhaps hed been frightened shes never asked though hes been with her all the way here to chenyao so has qin she cant say with certainty why she kept them with her but it had seemed proper it had seemed needful as shed read tais note rain felt some inner imperative overtaking her possible danger be very alert hed written alert meant remembering zhous face as he read the summons from the palace as he burned it as he went away no good night or goodbye you could describe the first minister in many ways but he had never been a cowardand hed looked afraid that night and rain had already had enough of a feeling of danger to have hidden jewels in the garden it had been enoughshe remembers now in chenyao middle of another night late summer all these things together and a sense her mother had also had it of when something decisive needed to be done decisive thered been only one action she could take like a gambler throwing dice in a latenight game in the pleasure district staking everything he owned shed been a little unkind to hwan then trading upon his love for her the love shed nurtured for her own reasons on the other hand shed almost certainly saved his life her instructions had been precise much more assured than shed felt inside shed been terrified he was ordered to go out the gates alone he was to find a sedan chair in the streets of the wardthere were always one or two of them even late at night bearers ready to carry someone to an assignation or home from one he was to get the beggar qin into that sedan chair and lead it around to the back of the property hwans eyes had widened she remembers he was to do this immediately shed said coldly or never find favour in her sight again if he did do this shed said looking straight at him by the light of the lantern wearing her night robe he would find very great favour hed left to do as shed said she rose and dressed by herself moving quickly now that a decision had been made as if speed could overmaster second thoughts the gods alone knew what was to come but if she was wrong about this she was unlikely to live through the day she took more gems from the chest in the room there was no point leaving them she walked back alone through the vast and silent garden past the lake and isle and the small moored boats and the bamboo grove and the grassy space where wen zhou had played at games with others of the court the path wound through night flowers she breathed their scent she came to the gazebo found the tree where shed hidden that small bag she claimed it dirtying her hands and then she climbed the wall herself using the elm tree at the eastern end shed learned how to climb as a girl in sardia had been good at it better than most boys treating a skinned knee or elbow as a mark of honour she still has a scar on her left knee thered been little call for climbing in the north district or here at the compound but some things the body remembered the two kanlins appeared out of shadow as she dropped down into the street she hadnt doubted for a moment that theyd be there i am leaving now she said because of the message you brought will you stay with me they had stayed with her theyd done more than that through the flight west for one thing it was the kanlins who had gotten them out of the ward in the night no gate official was going to deny them it brought bad luck at the very least the understanding was if the blackclad ones were abroad they had reason to be and so did those they were escorting that was the way of things because of this theyd made it all the way across xinan and to the western gate were right there before curfews end opened the city while they waited for sunrise and the drums rain had hwan arrange a carriage and two good horses for the kanlins with the coming of morning they were out of xinan moving along the western road against the flow of traffic coming in with goods for the markets they bought food as they went wine millet cakes dried meat peaches hwan had brought cash she didnt ask where hed gotten it her jewels werent going to help until they reached a market town you didnt buy boiled eggs or barley cakes with amber earrings set in gold she was to understand later that they had been able to leave the city only because theyd moved so quickly were out and going west before word spread of the disaster at teng pass and with it tidings of the emperors flight later that day the capital learned of these events and mawai and panic erupted in the city choking every gate and every road with terrified people in flight rain and her party had left the imperial road by then shed decided there were too many people who might know her at the wellknown posting inn on the road it was used by the court which meant by people who might have visited the pavilion of moonlight pleasure house they branched off found another eastwest road kept going all day along that stopped the first night at a small inn near a silk farm rain never knew it no one can ever know such things but had they stayed on the imperial highway stopped at the posting inn that first night her own life and the lives of many others might have been different going forward this is a reason why we sometimes feel as though existence is fragile precarious that a random wind can blow changing everything they might have gone to the inn on the imperial roadit was an impulsive thought to leave the road she might not have been able to sleep could easily have risen to walk in the garden late and seen two men in conversation on a bench under a mulberry tree the kanlins kept them moving quickly staying on secondary roads they changed horses each day until horses became hard to come by one evening a discussion was started courteously by the older of the two his name was ssu tan they wished to know whether she intended to continue west or planned to go south or even north a perfectly good question but it meant she needed to have an idea where she was going shed chosen chenyao told them so that night as much to name a destination as anything else it was close by then large enough to let them melt into the city sell some jewels it had roads leading in all directions was accustomed to travellers coming through often from far away people had stories in chenyao and they didnt have to tell them when they arrived hwan negotiated the lease of a goodsized house with a staff to run it he was apparently skilled at such bargaining but it had also helped rain knows that both kanlins went with him and were standing by no one was inclined to offend the blackclad ones in any possible way and someone who had two of them serving her was not to be troubled an uncharacteristic lack of energy or will had settled on rain from the time they took the city house she knew it knows it tonight weeks later lying awake she has no clear or even vague idea what to do next along with everyone elsechenyao is crowded with refugees from xinan and elsewhere nowthey watch the movements of soldiers from the west and northwest passing through riding or marching grimfaced some of the faces seem very young to rain armies are moving all through kitai this summer they seize on news or the rumour of news qin spends mornings in the market begging for coins though it is hardly necessary but he finds that people talk to a crippled beggar and he learns almost as much as the kanlins do through their own channels rain has never asked what these channels are shes too grateful for their presence unwilling to intrude at night they gather and share what they know they know that the taming palace had seen wholesale slaughter as did much of xinan that it is quieter in the capital now but strange tense a city under occupation crouched against another blow someone said they know that the emperor taizu is now the fatheremperor reportedly heading southwest beyond the great river shinzu rules them now although xinan and yenling are held by the rebels which makes it a fair question if anyone can be said to rule kitai there was a battle in the northwest not far from the long wall depending on who tells the tale it was a victory against the rebels or a victory for them they have known from near the outset of their journey that zhou is dead and jian awake at night again because some animal has screamed in the street rain thinks about war the boys faces seen in the army ranks about kitai this land that she came to years ago with her pipa her yellow hair and green eyes and so young in summer darkness stars in her southfacing window she makesor acceptsa decision in her heart there is fear again with it and sorrow but also a kind of easing of disquiet and distress which is what acceptance is said to bring is it not with that it seems her clarity returns the sense that she can sort matters through make plans a choice and then the next one for one thing none of the four men with her is to be burdened with this it is her decision and is to be hers alone she thinks she falls asleep in the morning when the men are out and about in the market buying goods for the household pursuing information she has one of the servants call a sedan chair and she makes her way to a merchants place of business alone it is almost certain that he cheats her on the price he offers for a jade necklace and a golden brooch in the shape of a dragon but she doesnt think hes been outrageously dishonest perhaps intimidated by her manner and a casually dropped reference to kanlins awaiting her at home she makes one other stop conducts another negotiation and is back at the house before the others that evening in her chamber she calls for brush and ink and paper and some time later by lantern light writes a single message addressed to the four of them chenyao she suggests is a good place for hwan to remain for now he and qin will have money the point of this mornings first transaction to keep the house to buy food to live if the war does not last forever the kanlins she knows will not accept money from her they were hired and paid by wen jian it is another strangeness for rain that these twowho have meant so much to her this summer who have saved her lifeshe owes not just to tai whom she is leaving now but to the precious consort who is dead she thanks them by name ssu tan and the younger one zhong ma she asks them to accept her gratitude and to convey it to the leaders at their sanctuary and also if they will be so very kind to convey that same gratitude and farewell to master shen tai who sent them to her should they encounter him again there is sadness and she doesnt write this part quickly or easily but what woman has ever been promised a life has ever lived a life without sadness and at least she is not sitting above jade stairs in moonlight waiting waiting while life recedes he had asked her not to do that when he went home after his father died he had ended up at kuala nor among the ghosts she had ended up with wen zhou or no she thinks she has ended up here she finishes writing and puts the brush aside blows on the letter until the ink dries she leaves it on the writing table and she rises and takes the money shes received today and places most of it on the table they will be all right she thinks if the war does not last too long she looks out her window sees summer stars it is time she has not changed into her night robe she is not going to sleep shell need to be quiet leaving but the sedan chair she hired ought to be outside the door by now and the household is accustomed to her restlessness it ought to be all right she takes the part of the cash shes kept back for herself and the small bag with the jewellery she will need for a journey a long journey a hard one shes hired two guards paid them a third of the negotiated fee and shes arranged to join a goodsized group leaving at sunrise the two guards are her contribution to their safety that is how these things are done there are always parties of one sort or another leaving chenyao the leaders of this one seemed to know what they were about talking with her this morning which is good it is not truly safe of course especially not now and for a woman but the world never is she wishes she had her pipa a distracted thought perhaps shell find one on the way it is time to go she crosses the floor silently and opens her door to the dark hallway she will need to step over the third step on the stairway down she remembers it creaks shed tested for that earlier today as it happens it doesnt matter all four of them are in the corridor hwan qin both kanlins they are dressed to travel ah good says ssu tan we had just decided to wake you the chair has been outside for some time we have to go if we are to join the caravan before it leaves her mouth is open hwan is holding shielding with his hand a single candle she can see their faces amazingly all of them are smiling rain says you cant this isnt a journey i can ask any of you to take you didnt ask says qin when he has a wall to lean against he can stand for a time we have chosen you cant she says again do you even know where im going of course we do says ssu tan we thought youd decide this some time ago we talked about it you you talked about what id decide she would like to be angry hwan says quietly we talked about what wed do my lady once you made your decision the younger kanlin zhong ma has said nothing his eyes have never left her and hes still smiling but im going to sardia she cries you are going home says ssu tan but it isnt your home it isnt he agrees but zhong ma and i had you entrusted to our care and it would shame us both to let you slip away you have no duty once i leave kitai she says shes begun to cry however which makes it difficult to fight well not so says zhong ma quietly tan smiles you may argue as to kanlin duties once were on the road we will have much time i believe it is the tarkan desert rain says despairingly people die there the more reason for us to be with you says hwan and then we bought you a pipa in the market this morning for the journey it takes half a year a little more the silk road journey through the deserts and then up the narrow climbing mountain passes to sardia they do not die she almost certainly would have without them qin it emerges can ride a camel they are attacked twice the attackers are beaten off there are sandstorms the second of these costs ssu tan his right eye but there is a physician with them the party leader is experienced and he applies an ointment and gauze bandages and tan survives he wears a patch over the eye after that rain tells him it makes him look like a bandit from ancient days he and zhong ma no longer wear their black robes by then they had removed them after they passed through the third and last of the garrisons in the kanshu corridor at that point really they had left the empire behind around that same time shed made another decision my name is saira she told them there is a taste in her mouth like spring cherries saying it all of them use it or refer to her that way surprisingly easily from then on at the end of the very long road burnt and weary they arrive past the end of sand and rock to high green pastureland surrounded by mountains when she sees the horses for the first time the heavenly horses they still frighten her a little she knows she is home it has been nine years her mother and father are alive all but one of her brothers and sisters there is little of glitter and jade but less dust and noise entirely merchants go both ways east and often west now new powers rising there over time she is able to sell piece by piece her jewels kitan work is highly valued west of here she learns the sky is blue and the mountain air is entirely unlike what shed learned to live with in xinan with the yellow wind blowing and two million souls there are young children in her own family amazingly there is music she teaches herself not to be afraid of horses and eventually she rides one a moment never to be lost there is sadness there are memories qin stays is made welcome in her fathers home at first and then in hers hwan stays she is wealthy enough to need a steward to run a household zhong ma goes home he is young proud of his journey and of being a kanlin she gives him a letter to carry back it takes her time to write this one sadness memory ssu tan stays she marries him one of their children a greeneyed girl though with darker hair than her mother is gifted beyond words at learning music she masters all twentyeight tunings of the pipa before she is twelve years old the world saira thinks through her days can bring you surprising gifts chapter xxvii he had not been happy in that small fort above kuala nor but bytsan sri nespo could not truthfully say that his selfdescribed flanking manoeuvre to get away from there had improved his life yet his idea for dealing with the horses given to the kitan had been approved hed been promoted and was now understood to have had direct communication with the palace in rygyal which was useful obviously he was in a far larger fortress now on the other hand he had no clear role in the chain of command here which was awkward and made him disliked he outranked longerserving officers but he was here only to await one specific person or message from across the border he also knew each morning and through each day and into each long summer evening what his father thought of all this principally because his father was the commander of dosmad fortress dosmad where bytsan was posted to await the possible arrival of a kitan gifted with an absurd number of sardian horses bytsan hadnt known who had just been made fortress commander here when hed offered his clever suggestion about the sardians one of the many unfortunate aspects of having been in such an isolated fort it was an unhappy surprise his father entirely and unreservedly disapproved of the royal gift he thought it was an act of decadent folly but since it was impossible in tagur even for a highranking officer to say anything like that fortress commander nespo discharged his ire on his own worthless son who happened to be serving under him now and who had evidently proposed amendments to the gift making it more likely to happen the horses were here at dosmad in large pens outside the walls they needed to be fed and watered ridden regularly monitored for health to send defective horses east would reflect badly upon tagur commander nespo had been caused to understand and this in turn might have implications for him nearing retirement a small army of men had arrived with the horses to discharge these duties adding to the burdens of a fortress commander hed placed his son in charge of them it was beneath bytsans new rank but the sardians were the only reason for his sons promotion so he could make sure their hooves and diet were tended to and the shit and mud brushed off them when they rolled in it he could do it himself for all nespo cared in fact hed have preferred it that way hed said that to bytsan it was easy to blame his son for all of this bytsan had been the one to propose to the court that they hold the horses here as far as nespo sri mgar was concerned it was a foolish idea added to a foolish gift the thing to do if you had to go through with this would have been to dump all two hundred and fifty of them on the kitan at kuala nor and let him do what he could to get them back to wherever he wanted them if the horses were stolen or scattered grew sick or died on the way so much the better for tagur in nespos view you didnt give sardian cavalry horses to a once enemy who might be a future enemy you didnt do that and he wasnt going to listen to anyone especially his hopeless son going on about the treaty signed after kuala nor or honouring the wishes of the solovely princess theyd been so kindly granted by the eternally untrustworthy kitans in fact nespo had declared to his son one evening earlier in the summer this whole business of the princess and the horses might be part of kitais intricate plotting bytsan who was far too modern in his thinking and too inclined to disagree if his father said the sun was shining at noon on a bluesky day had said after twenty years long time to hatch a plot i think youre too much afraid of them nespo had thrown him out of his chambers for that he did that often throwing bytsan out hed call him back the next night or the one after if hed been really angered because well because this was his son wasnt it and because not every last thing he said was foolish it was possible just for an old army officer in tagur to accept that the world was changing he didnt have to like it mind you and he wasnt sure how he felt when messengers came from across the border in late summer two riders under a banner of peace to say that the kitan from kuala nor had come for his horseswhich meant his clever son had been proven right they met with half a dozen attendants each on open ground near a stand of elm trees the hilly country between dosmad fortress and the prefecture town of hsien was one of the places of relatively open land between kitai and the taguran plateau shen tai he saw riding up to where the other man was already waiting had kanlin warriors as his escort it surprised bytsan a little how pleased he was to see the other man nespo had wanted his son to wear armourhe was enormously proud of taguran linkedmail better than anything in kitaibut bytsan had declined it was a hot humid day they werent going into battle and hed be embarrassed if the kitan decided he was wearing the armour for show shen tai dismounted first from dynlal it affected bytsan to see his own horse again looking well cared for the kitan walked forward he stopped and bowed hand over fist bytsan remembered this about him he swung down from the saddle and did the same thing not caring what his own soldiers thought shen tai had done it first hadnt he and the two of them had shared a night in a cabin among the dead he said in kitan you havent had your fill of kanlins he grinned the other man smiled a little that one was false these arent i am pleased to see you again i am pleased you survived thank you they walked together a little apart from their escorts it was a heavy day a chance of rain which was needed shen tai said dynlal is beyond magnificent would you like him back they could do that to you the kitanor some of them could bytsan shook his head he was a gift i am honoured that he pleases you you have chosen three horses from the herd bytsan had done so of course hadnt been shy either he said im afraid i took three of the best shen tai smiled again though there was an odd feeling that smiling came hard for him bytsan looked more closely and wondered the other man registered the gaze he made a jest too deliberately ah well how would a taguran know a good horse bytsan allowed himself to smile back but now that hed noticed it it was obvious that even with the kitan skill at hiding their thoughts shen tai had changed since hed left the lake well why shouldnt he have did you find out who tried to kill you he asked he saw the other man stiffen hesitate you were there said shen tai too lightly the false kanlin did it was a rebuff bytsan felt himself flushing humiliated he turned away to hide it tai regretted his words as soon as he spoke them he hesitated again this was difficult the other man was taguran and kitai was in the midst of a rebellion he took a breath he had decided to trust this man back by the lake he said forgive me that was a shameful answer but i have not talked of this with anyone dont force yourself to it was wen zhou the first minister who sent that assassin and there were others on the road as you thought there might be he saw the taguran broadshouldered tanned by the summer sun turn to look at him there was no one nearby which was good tai heard a distant roll of thunder there would be rain the first minister of kitai hates you that much he hated me that much tai said he doesnt any more hes dead and if that told the tagurans something they hadnt yet learned so be it they were going to learn it and it might as well be this man his well his friend who relayed the news bytsan was staring this may be known in rygyal but im not certain it is there was an uprising in the northeast tai said first minister wen zhou accepted the blame for allowing it that was enough for now he thought and he was killed tai nodded so you arent in danger no more than any man in difficult days but did were you honoured by the emperor as you deserved to be i was i thank you for making it possible it was true of course tai had wealth a great deal of property and access to power if he wanted it though the emperor who had given him these things was travelling somewhere south of here even now towards the great river and he didnt rule kitai any more you didnt need to tell all the truth not with armies moving and you he asked you are not in your fortress any more this is good mostly so i am at dosmad obviously my my father is the commander tai looked at him did you know that he am i so obviously a fool hed just been transferred this is not good bytsan sri nespo shook his head so gloomily tai laughed im sorry he said fathers and sons i blame you said the taguran wryly and suddenly they seemed to be as theyd been during a long night by the lake i am your friend said tai with exaggerated seriousness one role of friends is to accept such blame unquestioningly he was jesting but the other man didnt smile after a moment tai added i know that this has also changed your life the other nodded thank you he said bytsan looked at the clouds overhead i can bring the sardians by late today or tomorrow morning if that suits better tomorrow suits very well i will have sixty kanlins with me they will have weapons they always have them but they are only here to lead and guard the horses please tell your men not to be alarmed why would a kitan alarm a taguran soldier tai grinned bytsan smiled back but i will let them know the taguran hesitated again what are you doing with the horses given the circumstances theyd shared a fair question tai shrugged the only thing that made sense in the end ive offered them to the emperor he didnt have to name the emperor he thought but he suddenly pictured bytsan some weeks from now learning the truth realizing that tai had you do know he said abruptly that emperor taizu has withdrawn from the phoenix throne in favour of his son they wouldnt know not here not yet bytsans mouth opened showing his missing tooth which son he asked quietly third son the heir shinzu of the ninth dynasty is emperor of kitai now may he rule a thousand years has has a message gone to rygyal i do not know perhaps if you send word swiftly it might come from you it is all recent i came here quickly bytsan stared at him again this may be a gift you are giving me a small one if it is not so small being the one with worldchanging tidings perhaps tai said again if so i am pleased for you bytsan was still looking closely at him are you pleased about the change near to the bone this time a man in my position or yours who are we to be happy or unhappy about what happens in palaces tai suddenly wanted a cup of wine but we are said bytsan sri nespo we always have thoughts on these changes perhaps eventually said tai the other man glanced away so you will take the sardians to the new emperor you will serve him with them and it was in that momentin a meadow by the border with tagur under a heavy sky with thunder to the southeven as he opened his mouth to answer that tai realized something it made his heart begin to pound so abrupt was the awareness so intense no he said quietly and then repeated it no im not bytsan looked back at him waiting tai said im going home then he added something else a thought he hadnt even known hed been carrying until he heard his voice speaking it the taguran listened holding tais gaze after a moment he nodded his head and said also quietly something equally unexpected they bowed to each other and parteduntil the next morning it was agreed at which time the heavenly horses of the west the gift of the white jade princess would be brought over the border to kitai looking back tai would name that day as another of those that changed his life paths branching decisions made sometimes you did have a choice he thought riding back from the meeting with bytsan he understood yet again that hed already made a decision within hed only needed to acknowledge it say it bring it into the world he felt a quiet within as they rode he hadnt felt this way he realized since leaving kuala nor but this awarenessthat all he wanted to do now was go home to his two mothers and his younger brother and his fathers grave and lius by nowwas not the only thing that would emerge from that day and night by the border the storm came that afternoon the heavy stillness of the air silence of birds had foretold it when it broke over them lightning lacerating the southern sky thunder cracking like the anger of gods they were blessedly under a roof in the trading station and inn between hsien and the border in times of peace and there had been twenty years of peace now tagur and kitai did trade and this was one of the places where it happened as rain drummed on the roof and thunder boomed and snarled tai drank cup after cup of unexceptional wine and did the best he could to fend off a verbal assault wei song was rigid with fury had even enlisted lu chen to join her attackand the very experienced leader of tais kanlins however respectful he remained wasnt diffident about agreeing with her song was less respectful she called him a fool he had made what appeared to be a mistake had told the two of them his intentions he was going home the kanlins would take the horses to the emperor tai you cannot do this later yes of course yes but not until you have taken the sardians to him yourself he needs to see you shed just called him by his name which she never did another hint that she was genuinely upset as if he needed more evidence he pushed a cup of wine across the wooden table to her she ignored it her eyes were fierce she was very angry i am touched that a kanlin warrior should care so much about her employers choices he said trying for a lighter tone she swore she never did that either lu chen looked startled you arent my employer any more song snapped we were hired by wen jian or did you forget there was another roll of thunder but it was north of them now the storm was passing shes dead he said he was somewhat drunk he realized they killed her at mawai he looked at the two kanlins across the table they were alone in the dining space of the inn on long benches at a rough table they had eaten already the sun would be setting but you couldnt see it a hard rain had been pounding down it seemed to be lessening now tai felt sorry for the kanlins whod gone back to hsien to bring the rest of the company they would claim the horses in the morning and start them north sixty kanlins would not tai he was going home crossing a last bridge over the river wai he thought for a moment wait if youre paid by jian then you arent being paid any more you dont even owe me he trailed off because song looked extremely dangerous suddenly lu chen lifted an apologetic hand he nodded to chen who said it is not so my lord the lady wen jian presented our sanctuary with a sum of money to ensure you ten kanlin guards for ten years what thats it makes no sense he was shaken again since when said song icily do the women of a court have to act in ways that make sense is extravagance such a startling thing id have thought youd learned that lesson by now she really wasnt speaking respectfully too upset tai decided he decided he would forgive her have more wine he said i do not want wine she snapped i want you to have some sense you arent a member of the court yet you have to be more careful i dont want to be a member of the court thats the whole thats the point i know that she exclaimed but take the horses to the emperor first bow nine times accept his thanks then decline a position because you feel a sons need to go home to protect his family with a father and older brother dead he will honour that he has to honour that he can make you a prefect or something and let you go he doesnt have to do anything tai said which was true and she knew it but he will why why will he and amidst her fury and what was also clearly fear tai saw a flicker of amusement in her eyes song shook her head because you arent very useful to him in a war tai once he has your horses using his name again she sat very straight looking at him lu chen pretended to be interested in wine stains on the table wood anger for a moment then rue then something else tai threw up both hands in surrender and began to laugh the wine mostly although wine could take you towards rage too another crack of thunder moving away song didnt smile at his amusement she stared angrily back at him think it through she said master shen please think it through at least she was back to addressing him properly she went on the emperor knows your brother was with wen zhou that puts you under suspicion he knows zhou tried to kill me too doesnt matter it isnt wen zhou it is your brother his death your feeling about that and jians he knows she paid for your guards for us tai stared at her song said he will remember that you were on the ride from xinan when he spoke to the soldiers about teng pass and caused what happened at mawai we dont know he did that tai exclaimed he looked around to be sure they were alone yes we do said lu chen softly and we also know it was almost certainly the right thing to do it was necessary sima zian thought so too said song if he were here he would say it and you would listen to him shinzu needed zhou dead and could have foreseen what would happen to wen jian after and even his fathers reaction to her death the empire needed a younger emperor to fight roshan who can deny it i dont want to believe he intended all that said tai gripping his wine cup the problem the real problem was that he did see it as possible he had been thinking that way himself through that terrible day and the thoughts had not left him since he looked at the two kanlins he drew a breath and said quietly you are right but that is one of the reasons im not going north i accept that what you say may be true i even accept that those are deeds men must do at court in power if they are to guide the empire especially in wartime but it is i do not accept it for my own life i know that said song in a quieter voice but if you are to pull away to remain safe and not under suspicion you need to bring him the horses first and be seen to bow wearing the ring he gave you the emperor has to see you are not hiding from him hear you petition for leave to go decide he trusts you she is right my lord said lu chen master sima would agree with me song repeated tai glared at her master sima has never in his life held any position at i know she interrupted though gently but he would still agree with me shen tai take the horses north then beg him to let you go home as your reward and if he refuses she bit her lip looked young again suddenly i dont know but i know im right she said defiantly he had called for a writing table paper and ink brushes lamps for his room the storm had passed his window faced south which meant good fortune his was the best room at the end of the long hallway upstairs hed pushed the shutters back the air was sweet and mild the heat broken by the rain tai heard the sound of water dripping from the projecting eaves the sun was almost down when he began writing it was a difficult letter he started with a full salutation impeccably formal summoning everything hed learned about this while studying for the examinations first missive to a new emperor explaining why he was not coming back as instructed because his small kanlin guard wasnt the only defiant person at this inn he employed every imperial title he could remember he used his most careful calligraphy this was a letter that could decide his life because of that he even invoked limei thanking the imperial family the ninth dynasty for the great honour done his fathers only daughter of course that expression of gratitude was also a reminder that the shen family was linked to the dynasty and could surely be considered loyal he didnt mention his brother liu had died honourably bravely but it was wisest not to raise any connection to wen zhou he did hint also obliquely that his mother and his fathers muchloved concubine were living alone with only a stillmaturing young son in the household and had been doing so for a long time he mentioned that he himself had not yet seen his honourable fathers headstone and the inscription on that stone had not been able to kneel before it or pour his ancestral libation hed been at kuala nor sardian horses were coming to the emperor because of that had already arrived if shinzu was reading this letter all but ten of the heavenly horses he was keeping ten because he had people to honour and reward for their help were humbly offered by shen tai to the exalted emperor shinzu to use as the son of heaven and his advisers saw fit it was a matter of great pride to the glorious emperors most unworthy servant shen tai son of shen gao that he could assist kitai in this way he used all of his fathers offices and titles at that point in the letter he wrote of his own devotion to the ninth dynasty and to the emperor himself since he who now held the phoenix throne and would rise like the phoenix from the ashes of war had helped tai himself deigning to intercede one day at mawai and another time in the palace against the murderous intrigues of a man whose disgraced name tai would not even write hed thought about that part for some time as the night darkened outside but it was surely right to make it clear that wen zhou had wanted tai dead he hesitated again sipping wine reading over what hed written then he mentioned the rings the august and illustrious emperor and fatheremperor may the gods in all nine heavens defend them and grant them peace had each given the unworthy but devoted shen tai by their own hands he was looking at that part and wondering about it if it could possibly be read as a thought that the father not the son should be on the throne when he heard the door to the room open he didnt turn around remained on the mat before the writing table facing the open window there was a breeze and stars now but the three lamps lit the room too much for them to be clearly seen if i were someone who wanted you dead you would be by now she said tai laid down his brush that was one of the first things you ever said to me at iron gate i remember she said how did you know it was me he shook his head impatiently looking out who else would it be really not an assassin from tagur perhaps trying at the last minute to stop their horses from crossing the border i have kanlin guards tai said he wouldnt have gotten near this room i recognized your footfall song i do know it by now oh she said i thought i barred the door this time you did this is an old inn the wood shifts too much space between door and wall a sword can be used to lift the bar he was still looking out the window shouldnt i have heard it probably she said though someone trained can do it quietly this is why you need guards he was tired but also amused really why would an assassin bother with me i am apparently of no use to anyone in wartime she was silent a moment i was angry i didnt mean that it is true however once the emperor has the horses i dont i dont think it is true myself i was trying to be persuasive her footfall moving into the room a moment later one of the lamps was blown out the one closest to him illuminating his writing table and because shed come nearer he caught the scent of perfume she never wore perfume he turned she had already crossed to the second lamp she bent and blew that one out as well leaving only the one by the bed she turned to him im still trying to be persuasive wei song said and let her tunic slip from her shoulders to the floor tai stood up quickly he looked away a moment then his eyes were pulled back to her the lithe form she had a long shallow gash across the ribs on one side he knew how shed received that wound please forgive my shyness with the lights she murmured shyness tai managed to say the single lamp beside her lit one breast more than the other and the left side of her face slowly she lifted both her hands and began unpinning her hair song what this is to persuade me to go north you do not have to it isnt she said hands lifted exposing her body to his gaze that wasnt true about persuading it just sounded like a clever thing to say a pleasure district remark they are clever there i know and beautiful she set one long pin on the table by the bed and then removed and set down another moving slowly the light falling upon her this is a goodbye she said we may not meet again since you will not come north tai was mesmerized by her movements she had killed for him he had seen her do it at chenyao in a garden she was barefoot now wore only thin kanlin trousers nothing down to the waist the last hairpin slipped free and she shook out her hair goodbye tai said you were hired for ten years you are mine until then he was trying to be ironic only if we live she said she looked away he saw her bite her lip i am willing to be yours she said what are you saying she looked back at him and did not answer but her wideset eyes were on his unwavering and he thought yet again of how much courage she had and then for the second time that day tai realized that within himself something had already happened perhaps some time ago and that he was only in this lamplit afterthunder moment coming to know it he shook his head in wonder i can leave now she said and be gone before morning to collect the horses no i have to be there remember tai said he drew a breath i dont want you to leave song she looked young small almost unbearably exposed he said a roughness in his voice i dont want you ever to leave she looked away again suddenly he saw her draw a breath this time then let it out slowly she said do you mean that it isnt because i have been so because i did this i have seen women unclothed before song she looked up i know and i am thin and have this new wound which will be another scar and one more on my leg and i know i am insufficiently respectful and she wasnt very far away at all he moved forward and put a hand gently over her mouth then he took it away and kissed her also gently that first time then he did so again differently he looked down at her in the one light left burning eyes on his she said i am not greatly experienced in these matters some time later her left leg across his body where they lay in the bed her head against his shoulder hair spread out the lamp had been extinguished some time ago the rain had stopped dripping from the eaves they could see moonlight hear a night bird singing tai said not greatly experienced he felt more than he saw her smile i was told men like hearing that from a woman that it makes them feel powerful is that what it does so i was told one of her hands was playing at his chest drifting down towards his belly then back up you were on stone drum mountain tai you ought to remember what happens there at night or did none of the women i dont think im going to answer that not yet perhaps she murmured the moon laid a trail of light along the floor of the room you seem to always be coming into my chamber he said well once i was saving you from a foxwoman remember she wasnt a foxwoman she was a trap extremely pretty extremely he agreed she sniffed even if it wasnt a daiji sima zian and i agreed you were not in a state to resist her that night and bedding a governors daughter would have put you in a very difficult position i see tai said carefully you and the poet agreed on this we did they wanted you in a difficult position of course xu bihai was after the horses you dont think she might simply have fallen in love with me i suppose theres that possibility said song her tone suggested otherwise she was very pretty tai said song said nothing so are you he said ah that will surely make me fall in love she laughed again id have attacked you if youd come into my room on the road i believe that i wouldnt do that now she said mockcontrite his turn to laugh i am pleased to hear it after a moment he said song i wanted you on the first night at iron gate when you came in i know she said he felt her shrug he knew that motion by now i didnt feel flattered youd been alone two years any woman no it was you i think from when you walked up in the courtyard my hair was down she said men are very predictable are we am i a silence not you so much they listened to the bird outside ill come north he said she shook her head emphatically no youve made that decision tai bad luck to start a journey after that finish your letter we will take it with us we have decided that your sister and the fact that zhou tried to kill you should keep you safe with the horses you have decided that yes lu chen and i and what if i decide tai you already did it was an honourable choice i was only afraid and now ill be afraid for you there is a war youre going a long way she laughed softly im a kanlin warrior riding among sixty others that is one fear you need not sensibly have when is fear sensible her hand stopped moving lay against his chest and after he asked after you reach the emperor she hesitated there is one thing i need to do he lay there remembering we wish to kill two of them later it must be done he squeezed her arm song if you kill those two yourself and anyone links you to me i know she murmured that isnt it those two from the second district army are likely dead already they shamed us and our sanctuary will not permit that i think the emperor knows it i dont think he will be unhappy that is not what i meant then what i have to ask leave to withdraw from the kanlins i must do it at my own sanctuary he said nothing he was deeply moved she misunderstood his silence i ask for nothing tai if this is only tonight i am he placed a hand over her mouth again you have to come back song i need you to show me another way to live i have only been a kanlin she said as he moved his hand away might we teach each other he felt her nodding her head but i dont believe the world will let you stay by that stream all your days it might not but i do not want to be lost in the dust and noise to be what liu became in the taming if they even reclaim the taming yes do you do you think they will tai lay in darkness thinking about it yes it may take time but the new emperor is wiser than roshan and i think roshan will die soon this is not the end of the ninth dynasty there will be changes he ran a hand through her hair the unimaginable gift of his being able to do so this is a change song i see you prefer me this way obedient and submissive her hand began moving again submissive is that like the inexperience before i have much to learn she murmured i know it and she lifted her head from his shoulder and slipped down towards where her hand had gone a little later tai managed with some effort to say did they teach you that on stone drum mountain no she said from farther down the bed and then in a different voice but im not a concubine tai hardly he murmured he felt her head lift what does that mean i lack the skills you are accustomed to you could possibly acquire them he said judiciously with effort and time enough to he made a sharp strangled sound i didnt hear that last she murmured sweetly he made an effort to compose himself oh song will i survive a life with you if you are more cautious about what you say she said sounding meditative i see no reason why not but im not a concubine shen tai i said i know that he protested before you bit me he cleared his throat he felt amazingly sure of himself sure of the world or this small part of it he said it would be a great honour if mistress wei song before you took my horses north i were permitted to learn your fathers name and your mothers and the location of their home that my mother might correspond with them as to possibilities for the future she stopped moving he had a sense she was biting her lower lip she said your servant would be pleased if your honourable mother were willing to initiate such a correspondence which formality given where she was just then and what she now resumed doing was remarkable he reached down and drew her up she was so small and laid her upon her back and shifted above her she began shortly thereafter making small sounds and then more urgent ones and then some time after with the bird still singing outside she said halfway between a gasp and a cry did you learn that in the north district yes he said good she said i like it and twisting her body the way hed seen her do springing up a wall in chenyao or fighting assassins alone with two swords she was above him again her mouth found his and she did something with her teeth that made him realize suddenly that it hadnt been any foxwoman hed been dreaming about so vividly those nights on the road from chenyao it had been her the strangeness of the world there was a brightness growing within him vivid as the first spring flower against snow and a sense that this was all deeply undeserved that he was not worthy of such a gift there was also nowand tai would not let himself turn away from ita farewell taking place inside himself a painful one to green eyes and golden hair music and her own courage you were surely allowed to remember these things it would be wrong not to remember tai thought branching paths the turning of days and seasons and years life offered you love sometimes sorrow often if you were very fortunate true friendship sometimes war came you did what you could to shape your own peace before you crossed over to the night and left the world behind as all men did to be forgotten or remembered as time or love allowed epilogue the second son of general shen gao crossed a bridge over the wai river and reached his home on the same day that an li usually named roshan died at the hot springs retreat of mawai not far from xinan roshan known to be unwell did not die of the sugar sickness he was murdered by a servant while he rested after taking the healing waters the servant had been instructed to do this and provided with a weapon by an lis eldest son an rong disagreed with certain of his fathers policies and was impatient by nature the servant was executed a man may agree to become an instrument of violent death in pursuit of rewards these rewards are not invariably forthcoming much farther north on that same day in the grey hour before sunrise tarduk the son and heir of the bogu kaghan was killed by a wolf in his yurt no dogs had barked none had signalled in any way that a wolf had entered the campsite where the heir and some of his followers were in the midst of a hunt tarduk had time to scream before his throat was torn open the wolf was struck by at least two arrows as it fled through the rising mist none of the dogs went after it conjunctions of this sortevents occurring at the same time far apartare seldom perceived by those living or dying through the moments and days involved only the patient historian with access to records is likely to discover such links reading diligently through texts preserved from an earlier time and dynasty he might take a scholars pleasure or be moved to reflection considering them the conjunctions found do not always mean anything the timing of such moments doesnt necessarily change the course of history or throw illumination backwards upon how and why men did what they did the prevailing view of scholars was that only if it could be shown that events emerged from the same impulses or if a significant figure came to know what had happened elsewhere and when did it become important to record such links in the record of the past there were some who suggested otherwise theirs was a view that held the past to be a scroll wherein the wise unrolling it could read how time and fate and the gods showed intricate patterns unfolding and patterns could repeat still it is likely that even those of this opinion would have agreed that shen taithat son of general shen gao returning homewas not important enough in those early days of the an li rebellion for his movements to be part of any pattern that signified only a talespinner not a true scholarsomeone shaping a story for palace or marketplacewould note these conjunctions and judge them worth the telling and storytellers were not important either on this the historianmandarins could agree shen tai hadnt even passed the examinations at that point he had no formal status in fact though any fairminded chronicler had to give him credit for courage at kuala nor and the role his sardian horses eventually played his mother and second mother were in hangdu the prefecture town they had taken a cart to buy supplies tai was informed by the household steward the steward kept bowing and smiling as he spoke you could say that he was beaming tai thought yes the steward said youngest son chao had escorted them with several of the bigger servants carrying heavy staves no trouble had not yet reached their market town in any serious way but it was always best to be careful master was it not it was tai agreed the steward and the household servants piling up behind him in the sooncrowded courtyard were clearly moved by the return of second son tai felt the same way himself the creak of the gate was a sound that might make him weep if he wasnt careful the paulownias shading the walkway still had all their leaves autumn was not yet fully upon them the peaches and plums had all been picked he was informed the family was being diligent about that this year the lady and second lady were supervising the preservation of the orchards fruit against winter and a possible shortage of food tai reminded himself that he needed to get to hangdu as well a man named pang onelegged owed money for supervising a hidden supply of grain liu had told him that liu would be buried here by now he went through the compound and into the garden carrying wine in an agate cup he went past the pond where hed spent so much time with his father watching shen gao toss bread for the goldfish the fish were large and slow the stone bench was still here of course it was why should such things change because a man had been away were two years any time at all for human beings they were two years could change the world for stones for trees growing leaves in spring dropping them in autumn two years were inconsequential a stone in a pond makes ripples the ripples are gone nothing remains when those one has loved are gone memories remain tai walked through the orchard and he came to the elevated ground where the graves were not far from where their stream flowed south to meet the wai and be lost there was a new mound for liu no marker above it yet no inscription considered and incised on stone that would come after a year had passed no time at all for trees or stone or the circling sun a single year but who knew what it would bring to men and women under heaven not tai he had no gift of sight he was not he thought suddenly a shaman he flinched wondered why that image had come to him he stood before his fathers grave it was peaceful here the ripple of the stream some birds singing wind in leaves trees shaded the place where his family lay and would lie where he would one day rest he set down his cup and knelt he bowed his head to touch the green grass by the grave he did this three times he stood reclaiming the cup and he poured the libation on the ground for his father only then did he read the words his mothers or perhaps his brother chao not so young now had put there it was not it really was not so great a coincidence that theyd have selected lines by sima zian the banished immortal was the preeminent poet of their age of course theyd have considered his words in choosing an inscription but even so tai read when choosing a bow choose a strong one if you shoot an arrow shoot a long one to capture the enemy capture their leader but carry within you the knowledge that war is brought to bring peace sometimes tai thought there were too many things within you at once you couldnt even begin to sort through them do more than feel the fullness in your heart it is well chosen isnt it someone behind him said the fullness in your heart he turned it was chao who decided on the inscription im proud of him said his sister fullness could overflow like a river in springtime seeing her hearing the remembered voice tai began to weep limei stepped forward brother do not or i will too she already was he saw speechless he drew her into his arms she was clad in kanlin robes which he could not understand any more than he could grasp that she was here to be enfolded his sister laid her head against his chest and her arms came around him and they stood like that together by their fathers grave and stone she was wearing kanlin black for safety she had travelled that way it was too soon to make her presence more widely known the family knew her and the household servants but the village understood only that some kanlins had come from the east to the shen estate and then others had arrived bearing the body of eldest son for burial and one of the warriors a woman had remained behind as a guard there were three more kanlins now they had come with tai from the border you saved my life limei said first words when they moved to the stone bench by the stream shen gaos favourite place on earth and sat together she told him the tale and the wonder of how the world was devised felt overwhelming to tai listening he had me place my handprint on a horse painted on the wall in a cave she said and tai i killed a man there and meshag is half a wolf but he did what he did because of you as of earlier that same morning he was no longer half a wolf and then towards the end i wanted to stay on stone drum mountain but they refused me for the same reason they said they rejected you i wasnt rejected i left she laughed aloud the sound of her laughter here at home healed a wound in the world he said limei i have chosen a woman a wife what what where is she taking my horses to the emperor i dont shes a kanlin shes taking them north with sixty other guards north through this and you let her do that tai shook his head ruefully that isnt the right way to describe it when you meet her youll understand limei she is she may even be a match for you his sister sniffed dismissively in a way he knew very well then she smiled is she a match for you she is he said listen i will tell you a story now he started at kuala nor while he was talking the sun crossed the sky passing behind and emerging from white clouds a servant came unable to stop smiling to say that his two mothers and his brother were back from hangdu and tai stood up and went to them in the principal courtyard and knelt and stood and was welcomed home watching a little apart because shes already had her moments with him and her own homecoming limei is annoyed to find herself crying again tai has already told her he intends to stay here not go to the new emperor she understands this of course she does there is a long tradition in kitai all the way back to the cho master himself of a strong man striving to balance the desire to be of service part of the court in the current and the opposite yearning for quiet for rivers and mountains and contemplation away from the chaos of the palace she knows this understands her brother realizes that some of what tai is feeling has to do with liu but she has a sensealready that first day when hes come homethat her own needs go the other way the empire is too much larger than this quiet estate by the stream she has even been beyond the borders now and she has too deep a hunger for knowing things for the thrust and dazzle of the world in time limei tells herself she is not in a hurry there are steps and stages involved in this traps to be avoided but the man who is their emperor now glorious and exalted shinzu had once trailed a hand down her back while watching a dance in the taming palace she wonders if he remembers if he can be caused to remember she looks around sees the servants weeping and smiling and finds herself unexpectedly remembering another dance this is the courtyard where shed tried once very young to offer a performance for her father and had fallen into leaves because of the wind tai had suggested that was why she fell liu had liu had told her never to let the performance stop even if you made a mistake to carry on as if youd never failed at all as if you couldnt imagine failing she still hasnt poured a libation for her oldest brother she isnt sure if she ever will many years later she does do thatpour an offering for shen liubut only after the immediate past had become the distant past how we remember changes how we have lived time runs both ways we make stories of our lives autumn came the paulownia leaves fell one night were on the ground when they woke they left them on the path for a day a family tradition then the leaves were swept away by all of them together the morning following in winter a message came from the court of the emperor shinzu from his temporary court in shuquian the glorious and exalted emperor acknowledged receiving a communication from his trusted servant shen tai he confirmed the arrival at shuquian of nearly two hundred and fifty sardian horses a gift to kitai from the same loyal servant of the empire it was understood by the compassionate emperor that after his labours in the west and disruptions within his family master shen might wish to spend an interval with his mother attending to affairs at his family estate the emperor approved such devoted impulses it was expected that master shen would agree that all loyal and capable men were needed by kitai in times so vexed as the current ones and his presence at the court wherever it was would be welcomed by his emperor in due course in confirmation of this imperial benignity and in recognition of services performed the emperor saw fit to extend a grant of lands in the south and east beyond those already given by the revered fatheremperor to shen tai documents were attached the emperor was also pleased to graciously accede to master shens request for seven of the sardians the emperor went so far as to express the personal view this was unusual that under the circumstances it was a modest number these seven horses would be arriving under escort soon if the gods willed it so tai drew a series of very deep breaths reading this and then rereading it he had succeeded it seemed the land wasnt really the emperors to give he thought there was too much uncertainty in the east still the documents were his tai held them in his hands and fortune might one day smile upon kitai and the ninth dynasty again the important thing was that his absence from court was accepted or it appeared that way seven horses were coming back to him it was a number hed chosen very simply hed promised ten to jian shed wanted to train them to dance he had left three with bytsan seven remained besides two for himself he had people for whom he wanted horses his younger brother his sister a fortress commander at iron gate a poet if he ever saw him again the woman he loved as a wedding gift if he ever saw her again the horses did indeed come not long after the letter escorted by twenty soldiers of the fifth military district the new soldiers stayed and were garrisoned at hangdu they were reassigned to the fourteenth army based here but more specifically to tai himself they arrived with documents making him a senior officer of the fourteenth cavalry carrying responsibilities for good order in hangdu and the surrounding countryside he reported directly to the governor it was suggested he call on the governor and the prefect as soon as circumstances permitted hed had his mother write songs parents it had caused him a day of reflection when hed learned who her father was in the end perhaps to honour the man as much as anything tai had ended up in laughter by the stream it did make sense who she was he told limei tried to make her see why it was amusing but she didnt laugh only looked thoughtful a reply came back addressed to his mother offering the formal acceptance by wei songs father of the shen familys proposal of honourable marriage to his daughter the letter communicated personal admiration for general shen gao but also noted that kanlin women by the code of the order always had the right to decline such offers in order to remain among the warriors her father would convey to wei song his own approval but the decision would be hers through the winter which was blessedly mild in their region given other torments unfolding tai dedicated himself to tasks in the prefecture warfare had not yet reached the district but fleeing people had and there was hardship outlaws whether from need or a seized opportunity became a problem and the soldiers of the fourteenth were busy dealing with them tai also made a decision not a difficult one and began doling out supplies of grain from lius hidden granary he put his brother chao in charge of that assisted by pang the man in hangdu their family had assets enough lius own wealth had been mostly in xinan and was probably forfeit after his death because of his connection to wen zhou it was too soon to explore this but tai was wealthy now himself and limei had been given considerable gifts when made a princess these had made their way here since she had been expected never to see kitai again tai gave a horse to her and another to chao in the evenings when he wasnt out with his cavalry on patrol he drank wine wrote poetry read another letter arrived one afternoon brought by a courier from the southwest sima zian sent greetings and love to his friend and reported that he was still with the fatheremperor there were tigers and gibbons where they were the poet had travelled to the great river gorges and remained of the view that there was no place in the world like them he sent three short poems hed written word came that an li had died there was a flickering of hope at this but it didnt last long the rebellion had taken on a life or lives that went too far beyond that of the man whod started it it rained the roads were muddy as always in winter nothing arrived from wei song until spring in that season when the peach and apricot trees were flowering in the orchard with magnolias in bloom and the paulownias growing new leaves and beginning to shade the path again a letter finally came tai read it and did calculations of distance and time it was six days to the full moon he left the next morning with two of the remaining kanlins and ten of his cavalry he rode dynlal and they led a second sardian horse the smallest one north along the river road they went the one hed travelled all his life he knew each inn along the way the mulberry groves and silk farms they saw a fox once at the side of the road they encountered one band of outlaws but a party as large as theirs heavily armed was far too intimidating and the bandits melted back into the forest tai took note of where they were hed send soldiers up this road later the people living here would be menaced by these men you could grieve for what might drive men to be outlaws but you couldnt indulge it on the fifth day they reached the junction with the imperial road there was a village to the west east of here was the place where hed sat in a carriage decorated with kingfisher feathers and spoken with an li who had brought destruction upon kitai and was dead now leaving ruin and war all around beyond that point along the road was the posting inn where hed met jian one of tais cavalry from iron gatehis name had been wujen ninghad died there defending dynlal wei song had been wounded defending him they didnt have to go that far they were where they needed to be the full moon would rise tonight he waited among a company of soldiers and two kanlin warriors they ate a soldiers meal by the side of the road he read her letter again i have learned from my father that he approves of my marriage i have also received leave from the elders of my sanctuary to withdraw from the kanlin warriors and have completed the rituals required for that i will be riding south to your fathers home if that is acceptable i have sat beside open windows through autumn and winter and have come to understand the poems about that better than i ever did at times i have been angry with you for causing me to feel this way at other times i desire only to see you and have my dust mingled with yours when i die it would please me greatly husbandtobe if you were to meet me by the bridge across your stream where it meets the imperial road between xinan and the west i will be there when springs second full moon rises perhaps you will escort me home from chofusa the moon rose as he looked east along the road and with it exactly at moonrise she came riding along the imperial way with a dozen or so companions and guards it took him a moment to recognize her she no longer wore kanlin black hed never seen her in any other clothing she wore no elegant bridal garb shed been travelling and they had a distance yet to ride wei song had on brown leather riding trousers and a lightgreen tunic with a short darkgreen overtunic for there was still a chill to the air her hair was carefully pinned he saw he dismounted and walked away from his men he saw her speak to her escort and she too dismounted and came towards him so that they met each other alone on the arched bridge thank you for coming my lord she said she bowed he bowed as well my heart outraced the both of us he quoted the winter was long without you i have brought you a sardian horse song smiled i will like that he said how did you know the old name for this bridge chofusa she smiled again i asked the elders at kanlin sanctuaries are very wise i know that he said she said it is pleasing to me to see you husbandtobe do you want me to show you how pleased i am he asked she actually flushed then shook her head we are not yet wed shen tai and others are watching us i wish to make a proper appearance before your mother and my sister he said she is waiting as well songs eyes grew wide what how is we have a few days to ride i will tell you that tale she hesitated and then she bit her lip i am acceptable to you like this i feel strange not wearing black as if i have lost protection there was a swirl of wind the water swirled below tai looked at her in the twilight the wideset eyes and the wide mouth she was small and lethal he knew how gracefully she moved and he knew her courage he said i have a few days of travelling to answer that as well to make you understand how pleasing you are in my sight truly she asked he nodded you make me wish to be always at your side she came and stood next to him on the arched bridgeat his side in fact she said will you show me my new horse and take me home they rode together under the moon south along the river from chofusa sometimes the one life we are allowed is enough tales have many strands smaller larger an incidental figure in one story is living through the drama and passion of his or her own life and death in that time of extreme upheaval in kitai of violence engendered by warfare and famine a young kanlin warrior was travelling back that same spring from faroff sardia with a tale to proudly tell and carrying a letter from a woman to a man he survived his return journey through the deserts but was killed for his weapons and horse and saddle in an ambush northwest of chenyao on his way down from jade gate fortress his saddlebags were rifled through anything of value seized and divided by the bandits they fought over his swords which were magnificent they also fought over whether to try to sell or to kill and eat the horse in the event it was eaten the letter was discarded tumbling in dust and wind and disappearing it might indeed have been thought that the death of roshan would end the rebellion this would have been a reasonable hope but not an accurate one his son an rong appeared to enjoy the idea of being an emperor he continued to assert the will of the tenth dynasty in the east and northeast with incursions south he had inherited his fathers courage and appetites and matched him in savagery but he had nowhere near the experience roshan had in and around a court nor did he know how to control his own soldiers and officers he couldnt have had those skills at his age coming to power as he did but explanations only clarify they do not offer a remedy an rong proved unable to achieve any discipline or coordination among the fragmenting rebel leadership this could have prepared the way for their defeat and a return of peace to kitai except that times of chaos often breed greater chaos and an lis rebellion caused others to see opportunity in disruption a number of military governors prefects outlaw leaders and certain peoples on the western and northern borders decided independently of each other that their own hour of glory had arrivedthe moment to make more of themselves than had been possible in the decades of kitan wealth and power under the emperor taizu taizu was praying and mourning it was said in the southwest beyond the great river his son was waging war in the north summoning soldiers from border forts negotiating for allies and horses when the dragon is in the wild wolves will emerge when the wolves of war come out hunger follows the years of the rebellionmore accurately called the rebellionsled to starvation on a scale unmatched in the history of kitai with all men from beardless fourteenyearolds to barely upright grandfathers forcibly enlisted in one army or another across the empire there were no farmers left to sow or harvest millet barley corn rice disease was rampant almost no taxes on produce or land were able to be paid however vicious enforcers became some regions as warfare shifted back and forth across their land found themselves facing taxation from two or even three different sets of overseers and with armies needing to be fedor they might rebel themselveswhat food could make its way to women and children left at home if there was a home left or children alive in those years children were sold for food or sold as food hearts hardened hearts broke one wellknown lament for the conscripted farmersoldiers and their families was composed by a poetmandarin who lived through those years he was looking back at a black period after hed retired from court for the third and final time to one of his country estates he wasnt judged to be among the very greatest ninth dynasty poets but was acknowledged as skilled he was known as a friend of sima zian the banished immortal and later also of the equally glorious chan du he wrote courageous women try to manage a plough but the rows of grain never come right in winter officials arrive in our villages fiercely demanding taxes be paid how under heaven can that be done in a shattered land never have sons they will only grow up to die under distant skies in time the rebellion ended the truth as historians learn and teach is that most things end eventually still the fact that this is so would not have found a placid acceptance in the burnedout abandoned shells of farms and villages throughout kitai in those years the dead are not assuaged or brought back by a philosophic view of events the emperor shinzu retook xinan lost it briefly then took it a second time and did not lose it general xu bihai reoccupied teng pass against incursions from the east the taming palace was restored if not to what it had been before the emperors father died and was buried in his tomb near mawai the precious consort whose name had been jian was already there awaiting him so was his empress people began to return to the capital and to their villages and farms or to new ones for with so very many dead there was much land unclaimed trade slowly resumed although not along the silk roads they were too dangerous now with the garrisons beyond jade gate abandoned as a result no letters came from the west from places such as sardia no dancers or singers came no lychee fruits were brought up from the far south either carried early in the season by military couriers on imperial roads not in those years an rong himself was murdered perhaps predictably by two of his generals these two divided the northeast between themselves like warlords of old abandoning any imperial ambitions the tenth dynasty ended faded away never was the number ten became regarded as bad luck in kitai for a long time afterwards among generations that had no idea why this was so one of the two rebel generals accepted an offer of amnesty from the emperor shinzu in xinan and turned on the other joining with imperial armies in a triumphant battle below the long wall not far from stone drum mountain in this battle two hundred cavalry four duis mounted on sardian horses played a devastating role sweeping across the battlefield from left flank to right and back with a speed and power other riders could only dream about three men two of them extremely tall the third with only one hand watched that fight from the northern edge of the summit of stone drum mountain they were expressionless for the most part except when one or the other would raise an arm and point to the sardians racing along the lines a glory amid carnage when the three old men saw this they would smile sometimes theyd laugh softly in wonder i would like one of those said the man with one hand you dont even ride any more said the tallest one id look at it id watch it run it would bring me joy why would he give you a sardian horse said the other tall one the one with a single hand grinned at him hes married my daughter hasnt he so i understand a clever girl not dutiful enough in my view shes better off having left us perhaps and he might give me a horse dont you think you could ask it would be difficult for him to say no the smaller man looked at one and then the other of his companions he shook his head regretfully too hard to say no thats why i cant ask he looked down again at the battlefield this is over he said it was over before it began you think peace will follow now up here perhaps not everywhere we may not live to see peace in kitai you cannot know that admonished the tallest one i am pleased at the least said the third that i lived long enough to have an answer about the wolf it was honourable of him to send us word unexpected you thought hed die himself when the wolf died i did and now he is sending messages to us it shows we can be wrong the need for humility the small one looked up at him and laughed it shows you can be wrong he said the others laughed as well it is entirely possible the teachings of the kanlins suggest to laugh while the heart is breaking for mankind they turned and walked away from the view of the battlefield the rebel general whod accepted the offer of amnesty from xinan might have expected treachery might even have been resigned to it but with the empire so desperately spent it was decided by the new advisers of the new emperor that the offered amnesty should be honoured the general and his soldiers were allowed to live and resume their posts defending kitai soldiers were urgently needed on the long wall and in the west and south before all borders collapsed inwards under waves of barbarian incursions weariness sometimes more than anything else can bring an end to war it was said to be the case that the emperors favourite wife regarded by some later historians as dangerously subtle and too influential played a role in encouraging him to keep that agreementwith a view to securing kitais boundaries the first treaty negotiated and signed was with the tagurans the second was with the bogu their new kaghan huroks successor was a man his people called the wolf it wasnt clear why then or later but how would civilized people understand the names let alone the rituals of barbarians there were stories told that the same imperial princess who was also shinzus second wife understood more than she ought to have about this matter of the bogu but the details of thisthe documents so vital to a historianwere lost some even said this had been deliberate but in truth the disruptions of those years the burnings of cities and market towns movements of people and armies emergence of bandits warlords disease and death were so very great it was hardly necessary to imagine or assume a purpose on anyones part if records disappeared and it is always difficult even with the best will in the world to look back a long way and see anything resembling the truth seasons tumble and pass so do human lives and ruling dynasties men and women live and are rememberedor falsely rememberedfor so many different reasons that the recording of these would take seasons of its own every single tale carries within it many others noted in passing hinted at entirely overlooked every life has moments when it branches importantly even if only for one person and every one of those branches will have offered a different story even mountains alter given enough time why should not empires how should poets and their words not become dust does not the true wonder emerge when something actually survives at kuala nor the seasons turned with sun and stars and the moon lit green grass or made silver the snow and a frozen lake for a number of years following the events recounted here however incompletely as with all such tellings two men met there each spring sharing a cabin by the lake and labouring together to lay to rest the dead birds cried in the mornings wheeling above the water the ghosts cried at night sometimes a voice fell silent both men knew why that was then there came a spring when only one of the two arrived by the shores of the lake this one worked alone that season and the next spring and then the next but the following springtime no one came to kuala nor the ghosts remained they cried at night under a cold moon or stars winter spring summer fall time passed in sweeping arcs of years and finally because not even the dead can grieve forever forgotten there came a moonlit night when there was no lost spirit crying at kuala nor and there was no one by the lake to hear the last ones final cry it drifted into that night within the ring of mountains above the lake rising there and gone peace to our children when they fall in small war on the heels of small waruntil the end of time robert lowell acknowledgements i find writing these acknowledgements both an opportunity and a challenge this is true for every book but perhaps even more so this time since ive been living with under heaven for so many years there are individuals who have helped in many different ways and a number of books and essays played roles in shaping this variation upon themes of the tang too many names listed becomes cumbersome and i fear risks seeming overelaborate or pretentious leaving people out feels worse im going to begin where many of these notes end this is a work of fiction spun out of and through history no one named here bears the remotest responsibility for what the author has done with the time the place and his story other people have sparked my thinking and my imagination however and my gratitude is considerable on httpbrightweavingscom brightweavingscom i have posted essays and speeches that offer i hope some clarity as to why i use the prism of the fantastic to treat the matter of history those interested will find some answers at that site my gateway to tang china was by way of the master poets of the dynasty du fu li bai the banished immortal wang wei bai juyi and so many others i read their works and biographies in english in many versions and the first acknowledgement i want to record here is to the poets and their translators i am indebted to among others david hawkes burton watson arthur waley david young red pine and arthur cooper there are dozens of renderings of tang poetry that i have read and profited from but these names need to be cited on a much more personal level my old friend andy pattonpainter poet tang aficionadowas profoundly important in the emergence of this book through years of discussion and encouragement it is daunting to choose among the historians whose work and in some cases personal communication has been vital to me im going to name the following susan whitfield edward h schafer his masterful the golden peaches of samarkand in particular edwin g pulleyblank on the background to the anlushan rebellion howard levy patricia ebrey edward shaughnessy jonathan tucker a gorgeous book on the silk road christopher beckwith historian of early tibet rene grousset on the steppes howard j wechsler c p fitzgerald william hung the invaluable arthur waley wrote biographies of both li bai and bai juyi under the thenstandard anglicized names li po and po chui the cambridge multivolume history of china in the volumes treating the tang was enormously helpful theres a fair bit written about courtesans and students in the tang which is a motif of under heaven ill mention here ping yaos the status of pleasure courtesan and literati connections in tang china the general reader looking only for a taste would do well to start with whitfields life along the silk road or have a look at charles benns chinas golden age everyday life in the tang dynasty which is full of detail ebreys illustrated onevolume history of china for cambridge is nicely done and so is shaughnessys for oxford the tucker book on the silk road has evocative photographs in terms of art the yale university three thousand years of chinese painting multiple authors china dawn of a golden age from the metropolitan museum in new york china at the court of the emperors from an exhibition in florence in the art of the horse in chinese history from an exhibition originating in kentucky and hugh scotts the golden age of chinese art focusing on the tang are among those i consulted with
