william dietrich the barbary pirates part one chapter one after i trapped three scientists in a fire i set in a brothel enlisted them in the theft of a stampeding wagon got them arrested by the french secret police and then mired them in a mystic mission for bonaparte they began to question my judgment so allow me to point out that our tumultuous night was as much their idea as mine tourists come to paris to be naughty accordingly i was hardly surprised when a trio of savantsthe english rock hound william strata smith the french zoologist georges cuvier and the crackpot american inventor robert fultoninsisted that i take them to the palais royal scientific luminaries they may be but after a hard day of looking at old bones or in the case of fulton marketing impractical schemes to the french navy what these intellectuals really wanted was a peek at the citys most notorious parade of prostitutes not to mention supper in a swank palais cafe a game or two of chance and shopping for souvenir trifles such as french perfume silver toothpicks chinese silks erotic pamphlets egyptian jewelry or ivory curiosities of an evenmore ribald nature who can resist the citys center of sin and sensuality it was even better the scientists reasoned if such entertainment could be attributed to someone as discreet and shameless as me monsieur ethan gage insisted on giving us this tour cuvier explained to any acquaintance he met reddening as he said it the man was smart as socrates but still retained his alsatian provincialism despite his rise to the summit of frances scientific establishment the french revolution has replaced breeding with ability and with it traded the weary worldliness of the nobility for the curiosity and embarrassment of the striving cuvier was a soldiers son smith from agricultural stock and fulton had been sired by a failed farmer who died when he was three bonaparte himself was not even french but corsican and his generals were tradesmens offspring ney the son of a cooper lefebre a miller murat an innkeeper lannes an ostler i sired by a philadelphia merchant fit right in were here to investigate revenue sources and public sentiment i said to reinforce cuviers dignity napoleon is keeping the palais open in order to tax it having resolved after my recent calamitous visit to america to reform myself i suppose i should have resented the presumption that i was expert at negotiating the notorious palais but i had in the spirit of social and architectural inquiry explored most of its corners during my years in paris now in june of it remains the place paris comes to be seen orif ones tastes run to the scandalous or perversesafely invisible smithrecently fired from his canalsurveying job in england and frustrated by the lack of recognition for his rock mappingcame to paris to confer with french geologists and gape he was a surveyor built like an english bulldog balding and thick with a farmers tan and the bluff ruddy heartiness of the ploughman given smiths humble origins english intellectuals had paid absolutely no attention to the rock mapping hed done and the snobbery rankled smith knew he was more intelligent than threequarters of the men in the royal society youre more creative for not being stuck in their company i suggested when cuvier brought him to me so i could serve as interpreter and guide my career is like the ditches my canal company digs im here because im not sure what else to do as is half of london the peace of amiens let loose a tide of british tourists who havent come over since the revolution paris has hosted twothirds of the house of lords already including five dukes three marquesses and thirtyseven earls theyre as transfixed by the guillotine as by the trollops we english are just curious about libertys relation to wickedness and the palais is the place to study william music floats lanterns glint and a man can lose himself amid roving minstrels angular acrobats bawdy plays amusing wagers brilliant fashion smart talk intoxicating spirits and swank bordellos i nodded to encourage him and this is officially tolerated winked at its been kept offlimits to the french police since philip of orleans and philippe egalite added the commercial arcades just before the revolution the place has since weathered revolt war terror inflation and the conservative instincts of napoleon with hardly a stammer threequarters of pariss newspapers have been shuttered by bonaparte but the palais plays on you seem to have made quite a study its the kind of history that interests me in truth i was out of date id been away from paris and back in my homeland of america for more than a year and a half and my frightful experiences there had made me more determined than ever to swear off women gambling drink and treasure hunting true id been only partly successful in these resolutions id used a grapesized glob of gold my only reward from my trials of job on the western frontier to get a stake in st louis card games there had been the distraction of a frontier barmaid or two and a hearty sampling of jeffersons wines when i finally reported back to the presidents house in washington there he heard my carefully edited description of frances louisiana territory and agreed to my idea of playing unofficial american envoy back in paris trying to get napoleon to sell the wasteland to the united states so i had a thimbleful of fame and a dram of respectability and decided i should finally live up to both admittedly i couldnt resist embroidering my military exploits when i was given transatlantic passage by an american naval squadron headed for europe to protect our shipping from the barbary pirates it was convenient to me that the bashaw of tripoli a pirate king named yussef karamanli had declared war on the united states the year before demanding to make peace and a year in tribute as so often happens in politics jeffersonwho had argued against a large militarywas using five frigates built by his predecessor adams to respond to this extortion with force even peace may be purchased at too high a price my old mentor benjamin franklin once said so when jefferson offered me a ride on his flotilla i accepted provided i was able to get off in gibraltar before any fighting could start i neednt have worried the squadron commander richard valentine morris managed to be at once unqualified timid and procrastinating he brought his wife and son along as if going on mediterranean vacation and was two months late setting sail but his congressman brother had helped jefferson win the presidency over aaron burr and even in young america political alliances trump inexperience the man was a connected idiot my own war stories during the voyage convinced half the officers i was a regular alexander and the other half that i was a habitual liar but i was trying you see youre some kind of diplomat smith tried to clarify my idea is that bonaparte sell louisiana to my own country its emptiness the french have no use for but napoleon wont negotiate until he learns if his french army in st domingue or haiti defeats the slaves and can be moved on to new orleans i have a connection to the general here leclerc i didnt add that my connection was that i had tupped leclercs wife pauline back in before shed joined her husband in the caribbean now while leclerc fought yellow fever as well as negroes my former loverwho was also napoleons sisterwas reportedly learning voodoo you can get an idea of her character from the debate in paris on whether it was she or napoleons wife josephine whom the marquis de sade used as inspiration for his latest depraved pamphlet zoloe and her two acolytes bonaparte resolved the issue by having the author thrown into prison for either possibility i read the book to monitor the debate and spark erotic memory so id made my way from gibraltar to paris living on a modest american government allowance and pledging to finally make something of myself once i figured out what that something should be the palais gomorrah of europe was as good a place to think as any i bet only when i could find an unskilled opponent consorted with courtesans only when need became truly imperative kept myself in physical trim with fencing lessonsi keep running into people with swordsand congratulated myself on selfdiscipline i was pondering whether my talents could best be harnessed for philosophy languages mathematics or theology when cuvier sought me out and suggested i take smith and fulton to the palais royal you can talk mammoths gage and show us the whores as well i was the link in our quartet i was deemed an expert on woolly elephants because id gone looking for them on the american frontier and there was more excitement in europe about animals that arent around anymore than those that are the elephants extinction may be more important than their former existence cuvier explained to me he was a pleasantlooking longfaced highdomed man of thirtythree with arched nose strong chin and pursed lower lip that gave him the appearance of constant deep thought this accident of nature helped his advancement as so often happens in life cuvier also had the fierce seriousness of a man whod risen by merit instead of odd luck like me and his organizational flair had put him in charge of the paris zoo and french education the latter task striking him as the more thankless in any system the bright shine and the dull yearn only to escape but politicians expect educators to repeal human nature every parent hopes their unexceptional child is the teachers fault i agreed cuvier thought that iwithout rank income or securitywas the enviable one dashing about on this mission or that for two or three governments at a time even i have trouble keeping it straight so wed become unlikely friends the fact that were finding skeletons of animals that no longer exist proves the earth is older than the biblical six thousand years the scientist liked to lecture im as christian as any man but some rocks have no fossils at all suggesting life is not as eternal as scripture suggests but i thought a bishop had calculated the day of creation rather exactly to october bc if i remember right claptrap ethan all of it why weve already cataloged twenty thousand species how could they all fit on the ark the world is far older than we know i keep running into treasure hunters who think the same thing georges but i must say their abundance of time makes them balmy they never know when they belong the nice thing about the palais is that theres never any yesterday and never any tomorrow not a clock in the place animals have little sense of time either it makes them content but we humans are doomed to know the past and looming future smith was a bone hunter too and theories were rife about what kinds of ancient calamities might have wiped out ancient animals flood or fire cold or heat cuvier was also intrigued by my mention of the word thira which id read on medieval gold foil unearthed during my north american adventure a particularly evil woman named aurora somerset had seemed to think the scroll had some importance and cuvier told me thira also known as santorini was a greek island of great interest to european mineralogists because it might be the remains of an ancient volcano so when strata smith came over from london anxious to talk rocks and see strumpets it was natural we all be introduced cuvier was excited because strata concurred with his own findings that fossil bones of a particular kind were found only in certain layers of rock and thus could be used to date when that rock was laid down im using the exposures in canals and road cuts to begin drawing a geologic map of great britain smith told me proudly i nodded as ive learned to do in the company of savants but couldnt help asking why knowing which rock was where seemed a trifle dull because it can be done seeing my doubt he added it could also be valuable to coal or mining companies he had that defensive impatient tone of the bright employee you mean youd have a map of where the seams of coal and metal are an indication of where they might be clever accordingly i agreed to organize our trip to the palais hoping that after a night of drinking smith might let slip a vein of copper here or pocket of iron there maybe i could hock word of it to stockjobbers or mineral speculators fulton thirtysix was my own contribution to our foursome id met him upon my return to paris when wed both waited fruitlessly for an audience with bonaparte and i rather liked that he seemed even less successful than i was hed been in france for five years trying to persuade the revolutionaries to adopt his inventions but his experiment at building a submarine or plunging boat had been rejected by the french navy i tell you gage the nautilus worked perfectly well off brest we were underwater three hours and could have stayed six fulton was goodlooking enough to be a useful companion when looking for ladies but he had the fretfulness of the frustrated dreamer robert you told the admirals that your invention could make surface navies obsolete you may be able to keep from drowning but youre the worst salesman in the world youre asking men to buy what would put them out of work but the submarine would be so fearsome as to end war entirely another point against you think man well ive a new idea for using watts steam engine to propel a riverboat he said doggedly and why would any man pay to fuel a boiler when the wind and oars are free savants are all very bright but it would be hard to find common sense in a regiment of them thats why they need me along fulton had been far more successful painting lurid circular panoramas for parisians on great city fires theyd pay a franc or two to stand in the middle rotating as if in the conflagration themselves and if anything is better testament to the peculiarity of human nature i cant name it unfortunately he wouldnt take my advice that the real money was not in steam engines that nobody really needed but rather in frightening pictures that made people think they were somewhere other than where they were my idea then was this wed have a lads nights out at the palais royal id pump the savants for information on lucrative veins of coal or why medieval knights with a taste for the mystical and occult might have jotted down thira on gold foil in the middle of north america and then wed see if any of us could come up with something that could be sold for actual money id also continue working on reformation of my character what i wasnt counting on was the need to bet my life and the french secret police chapter two horror we can habituate to defeat can be accommodated it is the unknown that causes fear and uncertainty that haunts us in the hollow of the night so my resolution to reform myself was weaker than i knew because the truth was that i hadnt sworn off women entirely after the agony and heartbreak id experienced on the american frontier i wanted to reestablish contact with astiza a woman id fallen in love with four years before during napoleons orient campaign shed left me in paris to return to egypt and after the heartbreak of my latest adventure i began writing her if shed declined to renew our relationship id have understood our time together had been more tumultuous than satisfying but instead i got no answer at all despite her promise that we might one day find ourselves together again of course egypt was still recovering from the british expulsion of the french the year before so communication was uncertain but had anything happened to my partner in adventure i did manage to contact my old friend ashraf who said hed seen astiza after her return to egypt shed been her usual mysterious self reclusive troubled and living in near seclusion then she abruptly vanished about the time i returned to europe i knew it would have been more surprising to hear shed settled into domesticity and certainly id little claim on her but to not know nagged at me which is how i led my companions into the wrong bordello it happened this way the palais royal is an enormous rectangle of pillared arcades its courtyard filled with gardens fountains and pathways we ate at an outdoor cafe and gawked at the trollops who costumed themselves as the most prominent socialites of the republic in between the trios tediously learned arguments on bone classification and the merits of screw propellers i showed them where bonaparte used to play chess for money as an artillery captain and the arcade where hed met the prostitute to whom hed lost his virginity as a young soldier yonder was the club where foreign minister talleyrand once spent francs in a single night and nearby was the shop where charlotte corday bought the knife with which she stabbed marat in his bath sodomites with plumage as elaborate as the whores walked the street of sighs arm in arm given that such love has been decriminalized by the revolution beggars mingled with millionaires prophets preached cardsharps prowled and the perversely pious sought out chambers where they could negotiate sexual whippings to the most precise calibration of penance and pain we descended into the cellar circus where couples danced amid nymphs posing in diaphanous clothing and pretended to study with an academics objectivity the complexs fortyfour statues of venus as we circulated cuvier was persuaded to try his hand at the new game of that napoleon had helped popularize smith sampled varieties of champagne with a pub crawlers endurance and fulton studied the acrobats use of leverage he had to be dragged away from a fireeater imagine if we could invent a dragon the french wouldnt buy that either i guessed this group was as happy looking at the prostitutes as hiring them given that half the palais amusements were technically illegalfrench kings had issued thirtytwo decrees against gambling since it was my full intention to keep us out of trouble then i heard while leading our little squad through a dim arcade of shops and descending stairways a female voice call my name i turned to see madame marguerite or as she preferred to be called isis queen of arabia she was a bordello manager of entrepreneurial ambition whom id encountered before i reformed monsieur gage you must introduce me to your friends marguerite operated one of the more ostentatious brothels in the palais a warren of vaulted caverns under a crowded gambling salon its decor was oriental and the courtesans filmy costumes were inspired by feverish european fantasies of the seraglios of istanbul by rumor you could sample hashish and opium there while imagining yourself master of a harem it was costly decadent illegal and thus quite irresistible it was also no place for esteemed savants my instinct was to hurry by but marguerite rushed out to block us my companions bunched up nervously behind as if we were at the entrance to the maze of the minotaur hello isis i said warily business going well brilliantly but how weve missed our ethan wed been told youd disappeared in america how heartbroken were my concubines they wept thinking of you at the mercy of red indians well i had spent money in the place im back my hair still attached but newly reformed i reported celibacy is good for character ive decided she laughed what an absurd idea surely your friends dont agree these are savants men of learning im just showing them about and there is much my girls can show collette sophie im afraid we cant stay is this the arabian place cuvier interrupted behind me craning to look ive heard of it it looks like an ottoman palace in there said smith squinting through the doorway the architecture is quite intricate do you really want to be seen entering i asked even as marguerite seized my arm with enthusiasm i am responsible for your reputation gentlemen and we in this house are mistresses of discretion our hostess assured esteemed savants at least experience my decori work so hard at it and its so fortuitous we meet ethan because my assistant inside was just asking about you was she now its a man actually he plays the role of osiris she winked im not of that taste no no he only wants to talk and wager with you hes heard of your gambling skills and says youll want to bet for the thing you most desperately wish to learn which is word of your egyptian friend that startled me given my puzzlement about astiza id never mentioned her to marguerite how could this osiris know that yes come in come in and hear his proposition her eyes gleamed her pupils huge and waxy bring your friends no one is looking share some claret and relax well it was against all my resolutions but why would a stranger know about my longlost love in egypt perhaps we should take a look i told my companions the scenery is worthy of the theater its a lesson in how the world works too and what lesson is that fulton asked as we descended into marguerites grotto that even looking costs money isis pulled us into the welcoming chamber of her seraglio and my savants gaped at the arabian beauties on parade for inspection since their costumes combined would be about enough to account for one good scarf this wont take a minute i went on go on to the rooms just to be polite fulton buy a girl a glass and explain steam power smith the auburnhaired one looks like shes got all kinds of topography to map cuvier consider the anatomy of the blond over there surely you can theorize about the hourglass morphology of the female form that would keep them occupied while i learned who this osiris was and whether he knew anything but rubbish the savants were so content to pretend it was all my idea that marguerite should have given me a commission unfortunately she was tighter with a franc than my old landlady madame durrell and which fancy would you care to tickle ethan the brothel keeper asked as the girls dragged the savants into a chamber tented with gauze curtains negro servants brought tall brass turkish pitchers candles and incense made a golden haze ive adopted rectitude i said be at war with your vices ben franklin used to tell me a regular bishop i am a bishop they were our best customers thank god bonaparte has brought the church back yes i heard they sang a te deum in notre dame at easter to celebrate the new concordat with rome it was delicious farce the kings of judah above the entrance are still headless ever since the revolutionary mobs mistook them for french kings and knocked their tops off its like a stone monument to the guillotine the church itself which the jacobins designated a temple of reason is in wretched disrepair the te deum was the first time the bells had rung in ten years and none of his generals could remember when to genuflect instead of kneeling the rabble presented arms when they elevated the host at consecration you could hardly hear the latin for all the snickering whispers and clatter of sabers and bayonets the common people are happier the church is back which was napoleons point yes the country is drifting to the old ways faith tyranny and war no wonder the mob has voted overwhelmingly to make him first consul for life fortunately my kind of business thrives in every political climate be they royalist or revolutionary cleric or marshal they all like to tumble she raised a flute of champagne to desire and discipline i took a swallow eyeing the girls wistfully the savants seemed to be chatting away as if this were the institutetrollops can pretend fascination with anything it seems even scienceand the air was heady with hashish and the aroma of spirits i tell you it feels good to abstain i continued doggedly im going to write a book nonsense every man needs vice ive sworn off gambling too but surely there is something you would wager for a male voice interrupted chapter three i turned a swarthy hawknosed man in the getup of a sultan had entered the antechamber his eyes were predatory and his lips thin as a lizards giving him the reptilian guise of an inquisitor or one of my creditors his turban was decorated with an ostrich feather of the kind the soldiers had collected in egypt by shooting the dimwitted beasts that ran wild there he didnt really look arab however but french we all like to pretend may i present osiris god of the underworld isismarguerite introduced hes a student of egypt like you the man bowed of course i havent found treasures like the famed ethan gage lost everything im afraid people always hope im rich in case i might share i disabuse them as quickly as i can and left egypt before the campaign was over did you not as did napoleon im american not french and i control my own life this wasnt quite true eitherwho does control his lifebut i didnt want it implied id scuttled and would you care to wager that life hardly ive been telling the queen of arabia here that ive reformed but every man can be tempted which is the lesson of the palais royal is it not all have something they long for none are completely guiltless which is why we congregate and never judge we may admire the righteous but we dont really like them or entirely trust them either the most pious are crucified if you want good friends be imperfect no my companions i realized had been led by their consorts out of sight the savants were either bolder or drunker than i thought which meant that i was suddenly quite alone nobodys more imperfect than me i said and just who are you osiris do you procure i assist and learn which is how i can offer a wager to tell you what you want to know and you dont have to bet a sou to win it what do you think i want to know where the priestess is of course astiza was a priestess of sorts a student of ancient religion i felt a jolt of memory she still touches your heart i think men call you vain and shallow ethan gage but theres spark and loyalty in there as well im guessing how do you know about astiza i was aware that with the absence of my companions two new men had materialized in the shadows bulky as armoires they now guarded the brothel door and where was marguerite its my fraternitys business to know what men wish to know and he drew from his robe that symbol id encountered before on the neck of my enemy in north america a golden pyramid entwined with the snakegod apophis hanging from a chain the crest of arms of sorts of my old nemesis the egyptian rite the last time i got entangled with this bunch it was for torture at an indian village and i automatically stiffened and wished for my longrifle which of course id left at home this osiris seemed snakelike himself and i felt dizzy in the smoky musk of the room it smelled of hashish youre part of the rite the egyptian rite was a renegade group of corrupt freemasonry founded a generation before by the charlatan cagliostro and which had been plaguing me since i won a medallion in a paris card game four years before id hoped i was done with them but they were persistent as taxes im part of a group of likeminded people pay no attention to rumor were reformers like you can i see the emblem he handed it to me this one was heavy perhaps solid gold try wearing it if you like i think it conveys a sense of power and confidence theres magic in what one puts on not my style i hefted it considering i respect your pledge against gambling monsieur gage how inspiring to encounter reform but please dont be alarmed by this symbol im offering alliance not enmity so i propose a simple riddle a childs puzzle if you answer it correctly i will take you to astiza but if you answer it incorrectly your life will be mine to do as i say what does that mean are you the devil come monsieur gage you have a reputation as a master of electricity a savant surely a childs game doesnt daunt you daunt me i was holding in my hand a symbol of what as far as i knew was a cabal of snake worshippers sorcerers perverts and conspirators and what do you risk the priceless information i hold after all youve staked no money nor have you so if you want to play riddles we both must play your purpose against my life osiris that should give him pause if i win my riddle and you lose mine you must not only send me to astiza but explain once and for all the business of your odd rite what are you eccentrics really after id remembered a puzzle franklin had told me once and decided to try it on him he considered and shrugged very well i never lose he held up a minute glass my blood was up start the sand then my riddle first two condemned men are at the bottom of a sheer pit that cant be climbed and are scheduled for execution at dawn if they could reach the lip of the pit they could escape but even with one standing on the others shoulders they cannot reach that high they have a shovel to tunnel but to dig far enough will take days not hours how can they escape he turned the timer i watched its hiss of grains and tried to think what would old ben have advised he was a font of aphorisms half of them annoying buy what you have no need of and soon you will have to sell your necessaries true enough but what fun is money if not to squander confinement they that can give up essential liberty to obtain temporary safety deserve neither that was no help either the sand was piling up at the bottom of the glass and osiris or whatever his name really was was regarding me with amusement we get old too soon and wise too late well that certainly applied to me sand sand draining down but that was it sand they tunnel i announced but only to obtain sand to pile on one side of the pit when it is high enough they stand on it to reach the wells lip my riddler slowly clapped his hands congratulations monsieur gage your reputation for a modicum of wit is not entirely undeserved it appears im to take you to astiza and explain the goal of your bloody rite as well perhaps you had your turn so now its mine you must make a statement if your statement is false i will take all your possessions if it is true i will require the truth of who you really are and what our game really is you are posing an unwinnable dilemma monsieur thats the challenge isnt it i turned the glass and the sand began hissing again osiris considered watching the seconds pour out as i had then he smiled a slit in a cruel face you will take all my possessions now it was my turn to nod in grudging acknowledgment well played i turned your dilemma on its head if you take all my possessions that makes my statement true but if it is true you cannot take my possessions which requires a false statement and yet without taking my possessions my statement is false so i dont owe you the truth either you must release me of either obligation you would make a franklin man and you an egyptian werent we the complimentary pair so will you take me to astiza as you promised even if you wont tell me all i want to know yes but shes not here in paris monsieur gage nor in egypt either im afraid but no matter as your riddle was doubleedged mine was as well had you lost your life would have been mine as you promised and though youve won your life is still minei will take you to astiza but i will have to take you in a roundabout way he nodded to his hulking companions your presence is imperative in thira you see where we will go en route to your lover theres a secret we need found i hope youre flattered we need your insight but if not i brought these companions to ensure youd come along im sorry ethan marguerite called from behind one of her spangled curtains these are not men to trifle with they threatened to hurt me i had no choice but to lure you down here it was you or me have i mentioned i have bad luck with women the door was blocked by ogres and behind me was a subterranean seraglio i tried to think of a plan one of the doormen lifted manacles then i have no choice either i once might have hesitated to use force given my naturally affable personality but ive learned the rascals of this world thrive on good mens indecision i whipped osiriss pyramidal medallion as hard as i could across his face making him curse and reel then i kicked the nearest of his troglodytes in the cockles bending the bastard like slamming the leaves of a book the other tried to charge but collided with the first two and so i had time to aim and hurl the damn trinket at a bank of candles the only plan id been able to come up with was to set us all on fire chapter four wax tapers went flying as the heavy gold ornament and chain sliced into the pretty array flame arcing like fire arrows osiris or whatever his real name was stumbled back against his trolls with a curse and a snarl blood flowing through the hand clutched to his cheek he reached for a hidden pistol with the other but as silk curtains ignited from the scythed candles i toppled ottoman lamps on the floor oil spilled and before he could draw and shoot i hopped back through a gush of flame smoke bloomed behind me as the fire flared and my wouldbe captors cried out and retreated madame marguerite was screaming in seconds id turned her little anteroom into a merry inferno and as i retreated deeper into the brothel smoke rolled against the ceiling the trollops behind me began shrieking as well so id set fire in front and had stone walls to my back not ideal and where the devil were my savants georges robert william here i heard fulton shout damn it gage what have you done now i found him coatless but otherwise presentable a halfdressed strumpet crawling away on her hands and knees my she had a fetching bottom i was just explaining the process of adding oxygen to my nautilus the inventor said coughing when all the shouting started cuvier and smith are insensible im afraid they drank from those turkish vessels and i think theres something in the wine he looked past me at the lurid light coming from the room from which id retreated the smoke orange in its glow by zeus and jupiter ethan have you been drinking too i believe youve started quite the alarming fire it was the only way i could prevent being manacled by the henchmen of that madman osiris i explained hastily hes of the egyptian rite a nasty bunch ive encountered before to emphasize the point shots sounded and bullets buzzed through the smoke to ping against the stone walls of the cellar i dropped yanking fulton down best to stay low most men shoot high and theres less smoke at the floor very informative gage unfortunately as near as i can tell the only door out is on the other side of your inferno its true i didnt have time to entirely think my plan through but the bonfire is rather like the panorama you painted dont you think there was a whoosh as more curtains caught settees sprouted flames as if they were logs on a christmas fire heat pulsed like a throbbing heart considerably hotter we retreated back another room to where cuvier and smith lay blearily drugged and hacking three other halfnaked male patrons and their prostitutes were crawling about all of them bawling in terror surely theres a back door i said trying not to join the panic i grabbed a trollop and shook her you which way out she bricked it up to control us well damnation i still didnt have a clue where astiza was either when i finally perfect my character im going to conduct a more placid life unless we can find a great deal of water it seems ive cooked us i conceded or we can recreate that door fulton said grimly where did they brick up the second entrance he asked the girl its two feet thick of heavy stone she wailed youd need a day to break it fulton looked at me with exasperation whats below us he asked me how the devil would i know smiths the rock man and above a gambling salon i think were in the cellar foundation of one wing of the palais then thats the solution to the tent we go for the keystone ethan i had no idea what he meant but followed his lead still deeper into the bordello thankful to get farther from my fire in another room was an erected tent of the arabian type piled with cushions and carpets to make a desert fantasy stout poles that reached nearly to the vaulted stone ceiling held the fabric up those are our battering rams the inventor said our only hope is to bring the ceiling down on top of us start a collapse are you mad would you rather cook if we can drop the floor of the gambling den we can crawl out i glanced upward but the stonework looks sturdy as a castle which you didnt consider before setting us ablaze did you however the ceiling will be thinner than the walls and every fortress has a weak point now wrap the tent and some of the pillows round that pole there like a giant torch smith cuvier he slapped them into some semblance of stuporlike action find water or at least wine no spirits that might ignite hurry if you dont want to roast ethan go stick this matchstick into your fire and set it aflame then what carry it back to me not having a better idea i advanced toward the inferno the gunshots had ended presumably because osiris and isis had the sense to flee out the main door my tenfootlong torch caught like a match and i retreated from the heat with the end of the tent pole blazing fulton helping me swing it up against the ceiling the keystone in this vault looked weakest he said panting letting the flames roar up against the central part of our roof there the vault met at a central stone the compression keeping the entire building steady we squinted as bits of flaming fabric rained down we need to imitate quarrymen and use heat and cold to crack it i can hardly breathe i wheezed then work faster the flare of silk and cotton burned out against the stone overhead just as cuvier and smith came dragging in a jar of liquid fulton grabbed it swung and hurled the water or winei was never sure whichagainst the heated ceiling cool liquid against hot stone there was a snap and cracks appeared bits of rock spitting out the keystone at the arched ceilings center was fractured now now the other tent pole hurry before we pass out i understood i took a second pole not yet burned and rammed it against the stone highest in the ceiling with all my might more rock rained down harder harder fulton shouted helping me bang against the ceiling blazes this is hard work i gasped wondering what we were supposed to do if the ceiling truly gave way on top of us get the whores to help as smoke swirled and the main fire licked toward us the girls joined our battering aided slightly by the woozy zoologist and drugged canal surveyor grunting we rammed like pistons driven by the energy that comes from fear and desperation finally there was another crack and the central stone suddenly plunged down hitting the brothel floor with a bang a girl shrieked and jumped aside there was a dark gap overhead the ceilings domed vault leaning in toward nothing more more before were consumed the fires heat kept rising we rammed like maniacal besiegers and more stones began to drop and bounce the women shouting warning as each came down we could hear yells of confusion from the gambling hall above finally there was a grumble of grinding stone and cracking wood building to a roar back back toward the fire we retreated out of the way as the ceiling suddenly caved the vault collapsing of its own weight its crash shot out a cloud of dust as it did so there was a crack of beams and the casino floor above parted and gave way as well a shaft of light broke in like a ray of heaven even as splintered wood gaming tables chips and playing cards plunged and fluttered into the new crater two or three stunned gamblers tumbled with it dropping into our little cook pot as we cheered as blessed air rushed in the fire behind bellowed up i gasped climb the beams before the fire consumes them we came out of the column of smoke like a hive of demons the naked women black as coal the stumbling savants drunk and punchy and the swallowed gamblers screeching from their little preview of hell fulton leaped clear like a devilking singed but triumphant wed broken free i crawled out on the casino floor eyes streaming as patrons stampeded this way and that despite the confusion i had the presence of mind to salvage a coin or two french fire wagons had pushed to the door of the bordello and salon and were beginning to pump water into the hole wed made beyond a bleeding osiris and half a dozen of his henchmen were crouched in the garden shadows in case by some miracle we might emerge what did he truly want what did he know about astiza i pointed to fulton there are our enemies what enemies he was hacking and wheezing i thought we came to be entertained im never entirely sure whats going on myself but we need a way out of the palais he meant to seize me one way or the other and drug you but how do we get out of his place we cant outrun them with cuvier and smith half sensible and a thousand people between us and the street can we fetch the police they dont come here if they did theyd arrest us with that other lot and sort it out later we might be strangled by our cellmates and any scandal wont help our causes with napoleon water began to spout from the leather fire hoses as the fire brigade pumped fiercely a chain of people were passing water in buckets from a palais fountain to the copper tub mounted on the back of the fire wagon it was a splendidly modern idea although it didnt seem to be making much progress against my fire id propose a larger fire wagon and a horsedriven pump the inventor observed or perhaps steam but at least the authorities are trying thats it well seize a fire wagon are you serious we wont be arrested well be shot and they need it for the fire theyve no weapons and madame marguerite deserves a few more flames for trying to entrap us look more engines are coming more than the fountains can feed and that one there is simply waiting in line well pretend were dashing to get more water once we get past the men who tried to manacle me well give the fire wagon back its hardly bigger than a chariot indeed the twowheel contraption was not much wider or longer than a field gun and hardly looked capable of putting out a campfire well have to squeeze and collaring the dazed cuvier and smith we charged fulton untwisted the hose loose from a wagons brass spigot while i heaved our two friends into a tub they didnt really fit into their displacement slopped water over the rim then i seized the reins and to cries of protest lashed the two engine ponies out into the park and tables of the palais diners scattered prostitutes ran and chess pieces went flying as we careened through the cafes then we were dashing pellmell down the palaces quartermile central courtyard smashing aside chairs and batting lanterns as we made for the main entrance which was an arched carriageway leading to the street beyond osiris saw our charge and ran to intercept us behind him still hunched in pain and waddling as he hurried was the man id kicked i rode them down id dealt with the rite before and theyd haunted my life like a recurring nightmare i didnt know what osiris wanted and didnt care i only wanted to break free of his breed once and for all so i balanced on the wagon and shook the reins as if flapping a blanket horses stampeding fulton roaring as he hung on cuvier and smith moaning the riddler fell under my team we bounced as we hit him swerved and skewed through the gate hub scraping i heard a shot and dared not look back we clattered out onto the broader rue sainthonore palais patrons protesting behind us pedestrians scattering ahead the immense louvre was a cliff in the dark paris is a mess of traffic at the best of times delivery wagons blocking lanes and horses backing and pissing so we came up against some trucks and carts our horses getting tangled in their harnesses giving up the reins i hauled our party from their perch now now run we had to hide and that was when a languid man with black cane stepped in front of us with an air of utter authority he held up his hand and said simply on the contrary i command you to stop monsieur gage stop im afraid youre all under arrest around us materialized a dozen gendarmes wed run from egyptian rite to the paris police by whose orders i tried to bluster by those of the first consul himself napoleon bonaparte chapter five arrest i had to think fast we were simply trying to escape some thugs who sought to trap us in a fire i glanced back to see if osiris was staggering after us but saw no sign of him and fetch water these men are esteemed savants fulton was gray with smoke and rock dust and cuvier and smith were drugged and swaying our clothes were torn and our dignity shredded monsieur gage it is not your escape youre being arrested for how did this policeman know me for what then for consorting with the english while on a french diplomatic mission for talleyrand in north america he said coolly you violated your instructions from the french governmentnot surprising perhaps given your service to the british against french forces in the holy land in to which we could add corruption of the morals of esteemed savants for conspiring in prostitution which does after all remain illegal for your colleagues illicit consumption of drugs imbibed in a brothel for arson for promotion of a riot for destruction of property for the running down of pedestrians for theft of a fire wagon and for the fouling of traffic i licked my lips i can explain all that unfortunately it is not me you are to explain to and you are ah he bowed minister of police joseph fouche at your service his eyes were sleepy but watchful his mouth set in an expression of skepticism and his posture light but alert like a fencer poised for a match he was the kind of man who seemed unlikely to believe anything i had to say which wasnt a bad place to start he was also extremely able and dangerous hed found the conspirators who tried and failed to blow up napoleon with a keg of gunpowder on christmas eve executing key royalists and using the excuse to send a hundred french anarchists to the seychelles islands fouche you bother with tourists like us monsieur i bother with everyone everywhere at all times including the murderer of a prostitute some four years ago i had nothing to do with that id once been unjustly accused and had some notoriety because of it but i thought napoleon had put that issue to rest i warn you that i know the first consul myself i drew myself up im a hero of the french victory at marengo and of the treaty of mortefontaine i also represent president jefferson of the united states yes i would prefer simply to imprison and guillotine you but napoleon still thinks you might be useful just how after nearly setting yourself on fire i cant imagine no hint of humor crossed his face i understand youve been attempting to see the first consul for some time your blundering has now won you that opportunity the meeting will not have the agenda you intended however the trio behind me was trying to follow all this with dazed bewilderment at least let my friends go i said this was all my doing your friends ethan are the only reason i am saving you he snapped an order lock them all up before they trample someone else this was not the way id intended meeting bonaparte given that i fancied myself as a diplomat he did have a habit of seeing people on his own time and at his own advantage as we were herded into a waiting prison wagon it occurred to me that it was highly coincidental that the french minister of police considered by many the most feared and powerful man in france after napoleon himself happened to be waiting at the gates of the palais royal just as id made a thorough fool of myself did the mysterious osiris or treacherous marguerite have some connection with the equally mysterious fouche ethan what the devil fulton asked as the door clanged shut we started with a lurch its all part of our visit i said vaguely were off to see bonaparte you did want an audience with him didnt you not as a criminal i told you we shouldnt have stolen the fire wagon you should feel complimented weve been arrested by fouche himself for what me mostly the other two savants were still drugged and groggy about our arrest and i knew id have to ask bonaparte for the favor of releasing them putting me in his debt in short the first consul had saved my appointment with him until i was dependent on his mercy i suppose such tactical maneuvering was the reason he was ruler of france and i was not our wagon with only tiny windows for air wound through the streets of paris in the darkest hour of the night by peering out the openings i could occasionally discern a landmark in what was still a sprawling medieval melange of a city in recovery from the revolution its population had dropped a hundred thousand to just over half a million thanks to the flight of royalists and an earlier economic depression only under napoleon was the economy reviving i guessed our destination from our westerly direction were going to his chateau of malmaison i predicted to the others thats good news no one you know will see us or see us disappear muttered cuvier who was beginning to regain his wits malmaison bad house smith translated a neighborhood name in memory of an old viking raid bill probably your ancestors bah they sacked england too and came from france the normans did paris as always was a hodgepodge of palaces crowded houses vegetable plots and muddy pasture the only people i saw at that predawn hour were some of the thousands of water carriers who laboriously carry buckets to homes from the citys inadequate fountains the average parisian makes do with a liter of water a day and one of the reasons bonaparte is popular is because hes beginning to remedy the shortage my companions finally dozed from pariss crowded center we passed into its greener periphery then through the farmersgeneral enclosing wall built by louis xvi to combat smuggling we crossed the bending seine and entered the sprawling suburbs of villages estates and hunting preserves somewhere off to the south was versailles i guessed finally an hour after dawn we came to the first consuls new home west of the city since seizing power just three years before napoleon had lived at the luxembourg palace the tuileries palace and was spending upward of million francs to ready the old chateau of saintcloud meanwhile he liked to get away from the city to this estate josephine had bought while he was in egypt hed been infuriated by her purchase at the time but had since warmed to malmaisons country charm we followed a high stone wall to an iron gate guarded by soldiers and after a word from fouche passed into a gravel lane between two rows of linden trees when we were finally let out stiff unkempt and hungover i saw evidence of josephines sweet taste if her husbands eye was for grandeurhow he loved a military reviewjosephines was for beauty malmaison is a pretty chateau in the french style with yellow stucco pale blue shutters and a slate roof its long rectangle is only a single room in width meaning that light floods through from windows on both sides of its public spaces ornamental trees are planted in trim green boxes and a riot of flowers grows up to the sills of the windows cut to fill countless vases inside we could hear birdcall from the park were here to see the first consul fouche announced to some potentate in braid sash and black patent slippers hes already out by the pond he never seems to sleep this way we stepped through a room with roman columns and peeked left and right the dining room had frescoes of pompeii dancers which made sense because josephine was an avid fan of the recent excavation of that ash heap roman antiquities filled the shelves on the other side of the entry was a billiard room and beyond it a rather opulent drawing room with expensive embroidered chairs the arms decorated with winged egyptian goddesses it was homage to bonapartes adventure at the pyramids two large and melodramatic paintings flanked the fireplace odysseus i guessed ossian fouche replied the first consuls favorite poem then into a grand music room with harp piano and portraits of constipatedlooking french ancestors the morning sunlight pouring on warm wood like honey the marble eyes of roman generals followed us with opaque gazes theres a meeting room upstairs draped with fabric as if the occupants are in an oriental campaign tent the policeman said the furniture is carved with egyptian deities and nubian princesses its all quite imaginative a little fevered with the furnishings isnt he bonaparte believes even a chair can sing his praises smith turned slowly about this isnt like a british prison at all he marveled blearily the french like to tidy up we left the home again by glass doors and followed a gravel path toward a pond fed by a small river butterflies flitted in josephines little paradise sheep cropped to keep the grass down and peacocks strutted we were nearing the decorative lake when a gun sounded napoleooon we heard a womans protest coming from a window high in the apartments behind us she was answered by another shot we passed through trees and came to a cluster of a dozen aides officers and groundsmen proof that the great are seldom alone one servant was reloading a fowling piece while napoleon hefted another squinting at some swans swimming and flapping at the opposite end of the water i purposely miss he told the others but i cant resist teasing josephine he aimed and fired the shot hitting the water well short of the birds the swans erupted again napoleooon please her wail came theres swan shit everywhere he explained she has too many of them fouche stepped forward its the american gage he announced hes made trouble as you predicted chapter six bonaparte turned again he exhibited that electrical presence that firmness of command which inspired and intimidated the shock of dark hair the bright gray eyes the oddly sallow skin for a soldier of corsican descent a slight yellow tint which i wondered might hint at some malady and the tense energy were all there as i remembered he was thicker than when id last seen him almost two years beforenot fat but the leanness of youth was gone napoleon had the mature muscle of a thirtytwoyearold soldier dining at too many state banquets his hair was combed forward in the roman style to cover a hairline already beginning to slightly recede as if he lived and aged faster than most men his gaze was calculating yet amused he pretended surprise to the french scientist you too cuvier first consul i dont even remember what happened we were following gage i lapsed into unconsciousness and awoke in catastrophe yes i quite understand ive met the american myself he shook his head and then glanced with slight distaste at fouche as if wishing he didnt need the policeman but of course he did if he wanted to stay in power savants with your abilities should think twice before enlisting ethan gage as a guide to depravity no man attracts more trouble or gets out of it so frequently now he looked directly at me the last time we met you crawled out of a pond at mortefontaine with your hair almost on fire i sent you on to america to get you away from my sister what did you learn there that is useful i blinked trying to summon coherent thought was i a prisoner or a diplomat louisiana is almost unimaginably large and unimaginably distant i said it is full of fierce indians and desired by the british unless you have an army to hold it its more liability than asset i suggest you sell it to the united states to keep it out of english hands i turned sorry smith the geologist blinked i really have no opinion its a long way from my canals i have an army in st domingue if leclerc doesnt lose it to disease and those damn blacks napoleon said what would your nation do with louisiana i shrugged jefferson thinks everyone should be a farmer if it can be farmed and can it eventually it is empty of trees like the steppes the weather is terrible i dont know he sighed at least you dont tell me what you think i might like to hear thats the only reason i didnt shoot you long ago gage and these savants are experts at bones and rocks yes first consul we went to the palais royal on a lark and were lured into a brothel we entered simply to study its interior decor and then a fire broke out which you set fouches report got here before he did i know more about what went on there than you do i asked about your friends gage not your stupidity fulton is yes yes i know all about his damn plunging boat he might have crept up on the british navy but could never catch it with additional money for improvements fulton began eagerly enough i said it was a military bark and fultons mouth snapped shut you gage were trying to learn something of an old lover am i correct fouche had clearly been spying on us if he hadnt arranged the entire affair himself to embarrass me i took a breath you remember astiza first consul you were going to shoot both of us outside the tuileries women he glanced back at the chateau josephine is mucking up our estate with her damned swans which i have threatened to shoot but she pleads and so i relent so there is more shit so then i take out my guns and eventually we reconcile he smiled a moment at a private memory women by natural order should be the property of men but the reality is that were slaves to them are we not i dont think even josephine would call you a slave first consul well you are indentured to me i gave you two hundred dollars and clear instructions and yet you spent much of your time in north america with the british just as you did in the holy land are you their spy gage what are you doing with this ditchdigging englishman smith what is it about smiths grasping nation of pirates and tinkerers that makes you find their company so appealing pirates and tinkerers smith protested it is paris i came back to first consul i interrupted i ended up fighting the english couple i met in america not allying with them they were part of the same perfidious egyptian rite i kept warning you about at the pyramids now ive encountered it in the palais royal as well i declare its a conspiracy you should fear and what the british taught me is that it would be easier for you to sell louisiana than to lose it hmph napoleon sighted at the swans again but didnt fire handing the gun back to a servant well i have a new mission for you now and if you help then maybe ill consider your arguments about a sale which should make jefferson happy he addressed my companions you were arrested gentlemen thanks to the impetuousness of ethan gage here the man is a brilliant imbecile but you are about to have an opportunity for clemency and a quiet expurgation of this incidence of whoring and drugtaking i want you to take ship for the greek island of thira and investigate a peculiar rumor thira cuvier exclaimed your presence as savants should help blind the ottomans to your true task which is to sound out greek patriots about the idea of revolt against the turks we have lost egypt and the ionian islands and the damnable british are refusing to evacuate malta as required by our new peace treaty yet greece as an ally would be a thorn to istanbul austria and the english and a rose to us all we need is a steady ally and i have one in mind a scholarly firebrand named ioannis kapodistrias youre to meet him under the guise of an archaeological mission and see if french help could instigate a revolt didnt you try that in ireland i reminded undiplomatically it will work this time and what archaeological mission if i sounded wary it was because i associated the trade with trick doors collapsing tunnels and near drowning pyramids and temples have a way of pinching in on you ive found fouche answered as minister of police its my responsibility to keep an eye on all factions that represent a possible threat to the state including the egyptian rite one of my investigators learned that youd been asking your scientific associates in paris about the island of thira at the same time these renegade freemasons were acquiring books and maps on it but all i know of thira is the name so you say yet what a remarkable coincidence that so much attention is being paid to an obscure rock on the aegean sea and you ethan gage return from america after association with the british and seek out the american inventor fulton the british surveyor smith and a french expert on ancient cataclysms how conspiratorial the idea of using a bordello as cover was really quite ingenious it was madame marguerite who lured us come gage we know each other too well for you to play the fool with me napoleon said this charade of bumbling confusion is all very amusing but you insert yourself in every mystery and conspiracy there is nor do i think your esteemed friends would associate with a rake and wastrel like yourself unless there was advantage to be gained you meet the rite in the bowels of the palais royal start a fire initiate a riot run down your competitors and pretend to ignorance all of us know you must be in pursuit of whats been long rumored first consul cuvier cried i swear i know nothing about his plotting of course not bonaparte said mildly gage is using you using all of you hes a devious rascal a master of intrigue and if he were french ive no doubt fouche would have recruited him to the police long ago is that not true minister even now i do not fully understand his motives and alliances fouche admitted i of course had not the slightest idea of what was going on and was trying to decide if i should be proud or insulted by this new description of me as brilliant devious and a master of intrigue all id seen was the word thira on a scrap of golden foil in the middle of the american wildernessa norse templar artifact according to my late companion magnus bloodhammerand nothing else still if the police were so smart maybe i could learn something from them im also looking for og i tried that was written on the foil too before aurora somerset made a mess of the whole thing she was the reason id sworn off women at that word fouche stiffened and looked at me warily cuvier too stared curiously but it was napoleon whod gone white what did you say the first consul asked og it sounded silly even to me the first consul glanced questioningly at my three companions and then addressed the others i think monsieur gage and i need a moment alone chapter seven we walked fifty paces from the group and stopped by the pond shore out of hearing from anyone else where did you hear that word napoleon asked sharply in america america how i sighed it was the first time id even tried to relate what really happened and i didnt expect anyone to believe me you may remember a norwegian named bloodhammer who visited mortefontaine when we celebrated the treaty between france and my own country i began he found a place in the louisiana territory far beyond the frontier which had norse artifacts i decided not to mention anything more about the bewildering site one was a gold metal sheet encased in a rotting shield which had writing that bore that word it stuck in my mind because it was so odd what else did it say bonaparte looked disturbed almost queasy the inscription was in latin which i cant read i could only make out a few words and then a fight broke out and the foil was destroyed it happened in a struggle with a british woman from the egyptian rite actuallyquite a long story no need to mention id been her lover just as i was telling you i was fighting the british not spying for them so you dont know what it means no do you he frowned looking out across the pond the cluster of aides and police were looking at us curiously from a distance envious of my sudden intimacy with their leader gage he finally asked quietly have you ever heard of the little red man at the mention of that curious french legend i had the odd feeling i was being watched from an attic window of the pretty chateau i turned but there was nothing to see of course its small rectangular dormer windows were dark and blank josephine had withdrawn inside as well ive heard rumor everyone has do you believe in the supernatural i cleared my throat ive seen odd things the little red man is a gnomelike creature dressed and concealed in a red hooded cloak his face is always in shadow but he is short and bent with long brown fingers sometimes you can see the gleam of eyes watchful eyes disturbing eyes that know far too much all france knows the tale but its only a story no he is real he first appeared to catherine demedici and by reputation lives most commonly in the attic of the tuileries palace that she built he appeared to french royalty on occasion usually in times of crisis to me it was just a fable as well the kind of myth to amuse children but then i saw him in egypt general he nodded lost in remembrance ive never been so frightened it was shortly before the battle of the pyramids he came into my field tent at the nights darkest hour when id exhausted all my aides and was the only one still awake id just heard of josephines infidelities and was beside myself with rage and sorrow and couldnt sleep i remembered in egypt when junot related to me his unhappy task of informing the general of his wifes unfaithfulness revealed by pilfered letters that had been sent from france a doctor would say it was hallucination of course but the creature spoke of the future in a deep sly voice with a tone ive never heard before or since he was not of our world gage but as real as your three savants standing by the pond over there and then he began to prophesy that day in egypt napoleon had seemed possessed later i had similar visions in the great pyramidyoull remember when i lay in the sarcophagus but troubling ones as well in any event the little red man promised me at least ten years of success to accomplish what i need to accomplish which is why i was so confused by my loss to you and that obstinate sidney smith at the siege of acre i was not supposed to lose but i didnt lose in the end because my defeat ultimately directed me back to paris to take charge here thanks to your rosetta key the little red man had known after all so was i some blind instrument of fate setting in motion events i didnt understand what has this got to do with og the creature said i should seek its ruins because a machine of great power was at stake if it fell into the wrong hands it could disrupt my destiny ruins where ive ordered research into just that question gog and magog it seems are referred to in the bible and are sometimes interpreted as lands at the ends of the earth og itself is a celtic reference to a distant powerful kingdom i wonder if there was some common root language magnus had believed in longago civilizations and forgotten powers this machine had something to do with og i was told the little red man said hed warned french leaders at critical times before and that i must remember that word because i would hear it again someday i remembered the sound of itogbecause it was so odd but i hadnt heard it spoken again until now he stared by you despite myself i felt a shiver i dont know any little red man but you do find ancient things and fate keeps bringing us together youre an agent of destiny ethan gage which is why ive remained intrigued by you ive told no one of og and very few of the little red man and yet you bear that word you the wayward american it was simply written down id no time to make sense of it sense sometimes i think im as lunatic as my brothers napoleons odd family was of course the source of endless gossip in paris the more he tried to elevate his relatives to positions of responsibility the sharper the public witticisms in cataloging their faults my elder brother joseph only wants to be rich and hes loyal enough bonaparte confided but lucien is venal and jealous and jerome is reportedly smitten by some shipowners daughter in baltimore baltimore he said it as if it were a barbarian fiefdom i forced louis to marry josephines daughter hortense this last january but louis doesnt really like women and hortense loves one of my aides she spent the night before her wedding weeping why he confessed all this to me i dont know but men sometimes tell me things because they figure me inconsequential of course the actual paris gossip was more malicious than that napoleons brother lucien had started a rumor that napoleon forced the marriage of hortense and louis because napoleon her stepfather had impregnated her himself in his desperation to father an heir hortenses marriage so the gossip went would legitimize a potential successor certainly hortense was heavy with child but who made it and when was open to speculation i was wise enough not to ask youre not a lunatic i said sympathetically to ingratiate myself i can be a shameless courtier you just bear the weight of rule yes yes ah gage you cannot imagine how carefree you are floating free of responsibility but im trying to influence the future of louisiana forget louisiana nothing is going to happen with louisiana until the situation in haiti is resolved the blacks fight on and on he scowled and now you bring back memory of the gnome he came into my tent past all my guards his cloak dragged on the sand making a track like a snakes his voice was hollow his eyes distant but we dont know where og was yes we do og is a word scholars associate with atlantis atlantis hadnt the gold foil borne that word as well and where is that exactly id heard of it of coursemagnus bloodhammer had talked of it in america savants had debated its geography and wed even speculated it was the source of mysterious copper mines in the wildernessbut i wasnt sure of the details atlantis is platos storya fabulous kingdom named for atlas that was destroyed in some upheaval legend has that it was advanced and sought to assert its influence over the entire world the common belief is that it was distant like og perhaps beyond gibraltar what the greeks called the pillars of hercules so what has og to do with thira perhaps because they are not far apart after all my geographers tell me theres a place on the coast of greece also referred to as the pillars of hercules in egypt my savants mentioned thira as the source of a cataclysm great enough to have spawned the atlantis story what if that island was the fabled kingdom or what if its destruction sank an atlantis nearby sank og which perhaps came from a language that might have been used by halfmythical beings i thought remembering my earlier adventures of godlike creatures named thoth or thor whose footsteps id followed again there was this speculation about our mysterious forebears remembered now as gods or legends where had we or our civilization really come from it is simply myth napoleon continued or is it what if this ogatlantis really existed and left something behind that evil seeks in recent decades there has been frantic research into the legends of the ancients driven by the popularity of freemasonry and new archaeological discoveries some artifacts have even been found he meant the book of thoth id pilfered i was sure so what else is out there why is this egyptian rite so persistent in its search i believe nothing and yet i cant afford not to believe these are things that might decide battles dynasties or wars and so once again i am facetoface with you i swallowed remembering thors hammer a myth that had almost fried me alive you want me to determine the truth of these rumors there are reports speculating that there are secrets to be found on thira an island of no political significance my colleagues think it has geologic significance which is why youre here instead of in jail come lets confer with the othersbut not a word about my red man if you speak of this day ill have you shot secrets are my specialty he glanced skeptically but what choice did he have we were two rascals in expedient partnership we walked back to rejoin the group napoleons hands clasped behind his back as if to control his own intensity my three scientific colleagues were regarding me with new respect after my quiet teteatete with the first consul we were discussing platos fiction of atlantis bonaparte explained to the others except some scholars believe it might have been real fouche amended he had the sleepy watchfulness of a cat his mind calculating truths and evasions like a warehouse full of ledger clerks and that it might have left something behind which however unlikely you are to investigate napoleon now told us briskly rubbing his hands together as if to shake a chill the rumor is that this object may have been left on this island yet if i send a military expedition to thira it will set off a war with the ottomans i dont need but a party of savants who cares what scientists do with luck you can slip in and out without being seen if not youre simply on a mission to explore an old volcano theyll think youre harmless eccentrics what object cuvier asked this will interest fulton fouche said the rumor is that a terrible weapon from ancient times may still exist or at least the knowledge of how to build it the nature of this weapon isnt clear but speculation is that the nation who gets it first will control the mediterranean and perhaps the world you mean its some kind of ancient war machine yes id like to see that fulton was as drawn to machines as i am to women when we learned the egyptian rite was seeking a meeting with ethan gage we knew we had to act its imperative that we learn the truth of these rumors before something monstrous falls into the wrong hands what english hands smith challenged im speaking of this cult which seems to have an agenda counter to all civilized nations while wed have preferred not to include you monsieur smith this is not a frenchenglish rivalryit is union in a greater cause besides gage gave us no choice after his expedition dragging you to the wicked palais now im afraid you must briefly cooperate with the french government in this hunt for knowledge we are at peace after all but my business is in britain my information is that youre quite unemployed not to the point of wanting to go to greece we are your new employer and if i refuse then well confine you as a spy until this matter is sorted out cooperate and you may advance your geologic career we know your work has been ignored by the royal society wait just a minute fulton said i may be interested in ancient machinery but ive no interest in this thira or og either you do if you want french interest in your peculiar idea for a steamboat napoleon said youve exhausted our patience and budget with your ridiculous nautilus but if you help us with this well give your new contraption a fair look oh and you cuvier will accompany these men as a french patriot to provide this quartet with gallic logic and purpose you will be the expeditions leader and purser unless you prefer disgrace dismissal from the institute and loss of the education ministry i wish only to reclaim my honor first consul we savants have a reputation even if gage does not i apologize for associating with riffraff but perhaps good can come of it and me i asked not happy that no one was objecting to the riffraff description according to madame marguerite who is secretly in our employ this osiris fellow you ran over promised to take you to your lost love astiza fouche said he wanted to take you to thira too the woman must be there or at least you might find a clue to her whereabouts do this errand for france and well send you on to the egyptian lady if not you can go back to the united states to explain that your efforts to persuade us about louisiana came to a complete failure and that our caribbean army will soon occupy new orleans you will be banned from france blamed for abject diplomatic failure in america and forced to find a real job i swallowed the prospect of actual work does daunt me so all we have to do is go to thira talk to this greek fellow and poke about for an ancient weapon find an ancient weapon or at least bring back word of it before ottoman soldiers foreign spies pirates rebels bandits or the egyptian rite get to it first consider it a holiday from normal duties gentlemen a boys adventure sleepless gritty sore and frightened we numbly assented what choice did we have but how are we to find this weapon cuvier asked fouche took out a small velvet bag before our troops were forced out of the ionian islands one of our officers made purchase of a relic a ring from a distressed noblewoman she said it was forged late in the fifteenth century it was oddly fortuitous the man said the duchess was quite beautiful and quite enigmatic some contend the ring was made by templars themselves when my agents heard about it i decided to acquire it i think youll see why the ring had a flattened section like a miniature seal and we saw immediately that it bore the word thira in the background was a domed building with part of the dome missing as if someone had taken a bite like a crescent moon in the foreground was what looked like a stone sarcophagus meant to bury the dead with its lid open a man in robes and a medieval cap appeared to be climbing into the coffin as if it were a bath or perhaps he was climbing out what does it mean no one knows the policeman said but it obviously refers to the island why would templars forge this of such an obscure place thira is little more than a cinder this greek patriot you will meet may find this useful in helping you perhaps thats where the weapon is i said studying the piece hes climbing in to get it compared with the medallion id carried in egypt this one seemed plain enough then youre to do the same look at its reverse i turned the ring to inspect the flattened part that would be against the skin there was another dome this one quite normal and inside it the letter a what does that mean we have no idea deciphering this object will keep you occupied on your trip to thira the essence gentlemen is speed go swiftly go silently and go ahead of any pursuit pursuit i always hate that cuvier rubbed his weary face at least we can study the volcano maybe we will be lucky enough to have it erupt wouldnt that be a treat i said drily good napoleon said nowwho wants a shot at my swans chapter eight napoleon promised we could accomplish our mission in a month or two and indeed with europe in peace and the roads mostly dry in high summer we made our way overland from paris to venice in a mere two weeks traveling south through france and then east across the new cisalpine republic that napoleon had created after his victory at marengo i saw no evidence we were being followed of course our enemies if they hadnt given up might guess exactly where we were going given that osiris marguerite and fouche all seemed more aware of what was going on than we were our quest was probably about as secret as a failure of contraception in the ninth month on the other hand perhaps wed discouraged the egyptian rite or fouche had delayed them and the entire trip would be a holiday lark while my companions were less than happy at being drafted and blamed me for bonapartes coercion they were also excited about traveling at french government expense cuvier had been entrusted with our allowance though like all pursers he was hard to persuade to spring for the nobler vintage of wine or choicer haunch of meat i have to account for your consumption at the end of all this hed grumble and im damned if i know how to explain to the ministry why this wheel of cheese was necessary over that onewhich is cheaper and a hundred grams heavier as well i thought you french put food above art or even love smith said but when it comes to expenditures our accountants have the taste of the english i didnt complain i was aware that i was riding in a coach with no assignment but to get somewhere when so many people were not wed pass long rows of peasants scything at dusk or stable boys mucking out horse stalls with sunburned shoulders or a maid parting a sea of chickens that closed up behind her as she left a trail of scattered grain i thought how different how safe and how dull to be tied to one place and have ones days dictated by the turn of the seasons id walk to stretch in the evenings eating a piece of fruit and if i came upon a boy who seemed smart or a mademoiselle who was pretty i might show them my longrifle and even help by shooting a crow out of a tree they treated such a diversion like magic and me like an exotic visitor from another world the savants were apprehensive but excited theyd see a geologically dramatic island at the edge of the ottoman empire dabble in political intrigue and maybe make an archaeological discovery or two certainly our mission was more thrilling than academic meetings the truth was that i still had some reputation as a hero and the scholars hoped a little of my dash might rub off i couldnt blame them we settled into roles i the notentirelytrustedyetredoubtable guide cuvier our paymaster and skeptical supervisor smith the makethebestofit dogged englishman always ready to shoulder more than his share of luggage or responsibility and fulton our tinkerer who proved fascinated by every waterwheel and canal lock the inventor helped pass the time by sketching out schemes to improve the suspension of our coach all of which the driver dismissed as impractical or too expensive we also discussed from boredom the need to rewrite the history of the world what we know is that rocks have been laid down and worn away over eons smith said but how by catastrophe like a volcano or great flood or the patient erosion of wind and rain and why all that fuss at all before we humans even appeared in creation what was gods point he picked up rocks at every way station marked their type on his map of francethe stones all looked the same to me but he told them apart like a drover picks out his cattleand then tossed them out the coach window we also know that there were many creatures alive on earth that no longer exist cuvier said many of them gigantic did creation start with more variety and greater grandeur that has since been thinned and shrunken by time that seems a peculiar kind of progress are we the pinnacle of creation or its shrunken fruit or have animals actually changed from one kind into another as suggested by sainthilaire i find his proposal ridiculous for any number of reasons not the least of which is that we have no idea how such a mutation could occur he told me that odd idea in egypt i put in cradling my longrifle between my legs it wasnt just nervous habit id been robbed on the stage before more interesting to me is the question of how civilization got started and whether marvelous things were once known and then forgotten after the fall of the roman empire some of my acquaintances have suggested that myths of the ancient gods actually refer to early beings who somehow taught mankind how to grow build and write and by doing so lifted us out of the mud the egyptian rite thinks the knowledge of such ancestors if relearned could provide terrible power ive seen some things to make me suspect they might be right what things cuvier asked hed brought a redleather notebook and pen to record our discoveries a tin officers field kit with scissors comb and toothbrush and a combination clock and compass in a copper case hed write down our remarks and mark our direction with every entry as if no one had ever mapped the highway before a book that caused nothing but trouble and a tool a hammer that was even worse and now were off to find an ancient weapon said fulton with bonaparte fouche and those lunatics in madame marguerites bordello curious about it too why napoleon is so anxious about forgotten weapons when he wont give a proper hearing to my modern ones is beyond me he was amusing himself by taking apart his own pocket watch for the pleasure of putting it back together but kept losing sprockets and springs when the coach went over bumps making us have to look for them on the vehicles dusty floor cuvier took care to keep his own compassclock out of the inventors reach its human nature to see the flaws in what you have and perfection in what you dont i said besides buying your submarine or steamboat means uncomfortable change robert sending us on a treasure hunt to conspire with a greek patriot risks nothing except us smith said its the man on the lip of the canal who wants it dug deeper not the man at the bottom the man at the lip will argue he can see farther and better measure the necessary depth cuvier said and the one at the bottom should reply that hes the one who can weigh the rock and soil and count the blisters at venice we ferried across a limpid lagoon to that fabled crumbling wedding cake of a city that was still buzzing from bonapartes brief occupation in french troops had torn down the gates of the jewish ghetto many jews had enlisted in napoleons army as a result and ended a thousand years of venetian independence with a flurry of decrees declaring republican ideals the revolution had been brief since the treaty of campo formio had given the city to austria a few months later but the ghetto hadnt been reestablished and the population was still debating the merits of the frightening freedoms the french had promised they discussed as well contrary warnings that french reform ultimately meant tyranny was napoleon promise or peril was he liberator or lord i was tempted to linger in the city by the decadent beauty of venice the mysterious twisting of its fetid canals the iceberg majesty of its sinking leaning houses the rhythmic song of its lyrical gondoliers its arched weatherstained marble bridges its baroque balconies pouring out cascades of flowers and its darkhaired beauties weaving through the pillars at the periphery of piazza san marco like duchesses at a dance their silks shimmering like butterfly wings the queen city of the adriatic rang with bell song lush opera and echoing church choir and smelled of perfume spice charcoal urine and water sunlight burned on the wavelets and candles beckoned when it was dark but id reformed i reminded myself and thus resisted the temptation to peek at pleasure indulgence and wickedness instead i begged my companions for just enough time to hunt down a fine venetian rapier in an armory shop given the reputation of italian cutlery a venetian sword was renowned for its slim and supple balance and elegant curved guard and yet it carried a shave more weight and sturdiness than its french counterpart all the best duelists have one i justified a naval cutlass would be more practical for alley fighting but the rapier was elegant to the feminine eye giving me a certain swagger i felt dashing when i buckled one on and studied myself in the stores cracked antique mirror deciding i looked quite the courtier so i spent twice the money i should have and learned when i tried to walk that the weapon banged so annoyingly on my thigh that i eventually took it off and tied it across my back like magnus bloodhammers old ax lest i tangle my own legs this was the new nineteenth century i reasoned and i assumed that in the unlikely event i actually needed a weapon as antique as a rapier id have warning enough to unstrap unsheathe give it a whet and a polish and get into some kind of proper stance besides i still carried my habitual tomahawk and longrifle the latter marred by an annoying crevice in the stock where cecil somerset had broken his sword in my last adventure the gun was so banged about that it retained little of its original elegance when forged in jerusalem still it shot well and i looked like a little arsenal with everything strapped on women eyed me with wary interest behind their splayed fans wondering just what kind of rogue i might be and men edged around me in narrow lanes as if i were balmy as a butcher venetians are used to all sorts of visitors but whispers began about ethan gage the frontier american that secretly pleased me given that we were adventuring into ottoman territory my companions tolerated my weapon shopping by doing their own we enjoyed the excuse to acquire manly accoutrements cuvier after a period of perplexity settled on a pair of brassandsilver dueling pistols in a rosewood box theyd be deadly enough within ten paces bluff and hearty smith went for something entirely more formidable a wicked blunderbussdutch for thunder gunwhich fired a spray of balls from a barrel just fifteen inches long the piece was short enough to be concealed under a coat or cloak when smith tried it out from the quay at the harbor its stunning report sent up clouds of pigeons at san marco two hundred yards away it kicks like a mule but bites like a bear he reported just the thing to make a boarding party think twice i expected fulton to pick out a similar firearm perhaps an even more complex and mechanicalminded one like a ninebarreled musketoon designed for fighting from a foretop and rarely used because it had the alarming habit of kicking so powerfully that it could knock its user out of the rigging that seemed the kind of design problem that would challenge the inventor and i pictured him fixing braces and pulleys to hold his torso against the recoil but no fulton became intrigued with the unlikeliest of instruments a scuffed and dusty scottish bagpipe he found in a market stall that will make our enemies run i said goodnaturedly ive heard the pipes and it sets dogs howling invaders stayed out of scotland for a thousand years because they couldnt stand the noise that fireeater in the palais gave me an idea fulton replied i cant play this but i can play with it what if it could spit fire something to tinker with as we sail south he pressed the bag and got a wail or entertain us im rather tolerant of lunatics which is why i know so many of them we paid for our purchases the inventor blowing a wheeze or two on his scottish pipes while we winced and then the savants said we must press on we hurry so science can find more time cuvier explained thira is a depository of time we need time to explain the mysteries of our planet because nothing makes sense without it time time time most people dont sensibly fill the time they have already ben franklin would say i said science the human mind is imprisoned by our brief concept of history ethan the globe becomes ever more complicated and all our explanations have to be crammed into a few thousand years like a sprouting boy with shoes three sizes too young but if the earth is older than we think then all kinds of new ideas become possible what kind of ideas that if the world wasnt always as it is then it mustnt always remain this way either smith put in perhaps were only a chapter in a longer tale that we men are not the reason for existence but just players in a bigger drama we dont understand people wont like that william we like to think history begins and stops with us then why did god leave us clues that it didnt the englishman said well surely if the rocks are that old weve time enough for supper on the piazza before getting to them eh fouche and napoleon told us to hurry the venetians are looking at us oddly looking at you oddly fouche and napoleon dont have blisters on their backsides from hurrying hundreds of miles to one of the loveliest spots on earth the thing to do when people look at you gentlemen is to look back particularly at the pretty girls it was also necessary to relax i continued because we hadnt yet found a venetian captain to take us where we needed to go venice had been at odds with the turks for the better part of three hundred years and ottoman waters swarmed with pirates the greeks were under the thumb of muslim masters who referred to their peasant subjects as rayah or cattle no venetians were anxious to go to such an unpromising dot on the sea as thira the captains wed talked to kept quoting fares more suitable for sailing to the moon so wed prowl the docks tomorrow i promised meanwhile finding a table in campo di san polo my companions as seduced by venice as i was finally assented stars came out and piazza musicians and jugs of wine as we toasted our progress so far my companions began to tipsily eye the parade of italian lovelies in the same hungry way i was like odysseus wed been sidetracked by sirensand my own miscalculation that any enemies must be behind or ahead we were well in our cups when who should sashay by but one particularly delectable and tawny beauty hair high as a tower dress cut to the outermost precipice of her bosom and skin as flawless as a flower petal i hoped for a wink or even a word of invitation but instead she reached tantalizingly to the hem of her dress gave us a glimpse of ankle and impishly plucked something from her skirts was it an apple she held the thing to our tavern torch for a moment and it sparkled like a pixies wand and then she rolled it in our direction with the sweetest of smiles is this italian custom smith said belching from drink as the object stopped between our chairs if so she bowls with the grace of aphrodite cuvier slurred what is it ethan fulton asked looking in curiosity at smoke drifting up from the smoldering sphere a festival invitation i bent to look under the table that my friends is a grenade chapter nine i dont know why beauty disappoints so regularly but i daresay women usually dont pitch bombs in my direction until weve been acquainted for an hour or two this one was galloping away before i could even say hello and her sole purpose seemed to be to shred our lowest and most vital extremities with the instinct that comes from being misunderstood so frequently in love i scooped up the smoking grenade looked wildly about and pitched it into the only depository i could spotour taverns brick oven the resulting explosion which coughed out a spray of brick bread dough charcoal and fragments of rotisserie duck could still have lacerated our top halves if i hadnt tackled my comrades into a heap our table toppling over as a shield we were enveloped in a cloud of brick dust but fortunately the oven had absorbed the worst of the blast and the patrons we shared the place with escaped with just a fright its the egyptian rite i cried my ears ringing and my brain addled by the explosion to the horses ethan were on an island cuvier said coughing we have no horses aye i shook my head and blurrily saw caped men entering the other side of the campo dressed in black and brandishing things that glinted in the dark one was waving his arm to direct the others to the gondolas then i dont think theyre giving us bloody time smith said we picked ourselves up grabbed our scattered weapons and bags and bunched to run as the strangers charged toward us people were screaming i realized as my hearing returned then there was a roar that made everyone in the piazza jump and smith slammed backward against the halfruined oven hed fired his blunderbuss packed with eight balls and three of the attackers went sprawling bullets ricocheted like fleas in a bottle the other scoundrels yelped ducked and broke toward cover by thunder englishman theres a naval broadside cuvier cried agreeing that our rock hound had set a good example i took up my longrifle and aimed for the man who seemed to be the leader i stilled my breath aimed to lead him as he sprinted for the shadows squeezed and fired he went down too skidding on the cobbles and i was rewarded with cries of dismay always load before dinner i said and with a blunderbuss it doesnt matter much how much you drink during it smith said and burped we retreated me halfheartedly clawing at the rapier strapped to my back and cursing that i hadnt bothered to carry it on my hip after all the good thing about swords is you dont have to load them with powder and ball the bad is you have to get damnably close to people trying to kill you now bullets came our way making a smacking sound as they chewed into wood and stucco we ran faster at the giuffa canal we didnt hesitate a gondola was sweeping by with a paying client its gondolier warbling a song and so we sprang like pirates crashed aboard and pitched the poor passenger overboard for your own safety i called as he splashed into the dirty water his hat drifting away like a little raft then i finally got my rapier clear and pointed at the gondoliers throat the grand canal dont worry theres a tip in it for you our helmsman looked goggleeyed at my blade should i sing signor save your breath for the stroke were rather in a hurry as he began powering us down the canal i turned to the others smith was already swabbing out his blunderbuss and pouring in fresh powder cuvier get out those pretty pistols of yours and shoot the rascals when they reach the canal fulton please dont play a song they put a hole in my bagpipes damn it then invent something else i tried to remember the citys confusing spaghetti of canals well go to san marco harbor and see if we can buy our way onto a ship out of here my god who was that woman smith asked his hand trembling slightly as he tamped down a fresh fusillade of shot killing is a jolt especially the first time not one to flirt i guess its a bet shes working for our enemies i think were in a race to the secret of thira which means that im afraid we shouldnt have tarried after all i expected better of venice especially after the price of our inn i see something following us cuvier said peering back into the dark there was a flash as his pistols went off blinding us to whatever he had aimed at i couldnt believe hed hit a thing with his popguns but we heard a wang of ricocheting lead and a yell by mastodon tusks they work he cried were quite the dangerous men we swept past a curve and back into darkness then squirted out of the small canal into the broad one that makes a sweeping s through the city its a canyon of grand mansions four and five stories high candles and lanterns gleaming behind tall windows to reveal aged munificence within the leftovers of glittering empire i saw centuriesold tapestries crystal chandeliers brocaded curtains and white moonlike faces peering out in curiosity at our noise we sculled under the rialto bridge lovers strolling its arched promenade and headed toward the citys main harbor and the anchored ships off the piazza san marco domes and towers loomed up against the stars and the sound of opera floated across dark water i think we discouraged them smith ventured looking back im afraid i must disagree monsieur smith cuvier replied pointing ahead with one of his pistols the ramrod jutting from its barrel because he was reloading our pursuers seem to have a lot of company a line of gondolas was sweeping down to intercept us from the canal ahead blocking our intended escape we spied enough gleaming metal to fill an armory there was a ripple of flashes and spouts of water kicked up around us as the reports of the shots echoed off the buildings chips of wood flew off our gondola and our helmsman froze ill skewer you if you try to jump i warned him my rapier aimed again at this throat steer into that side canal there before they get off another volley we turned into a small channel that cut across the island by a different path maybe we could lose our pursuers in the liquid labyrinth that was venice this narrow tributary was dark the houses seeming to lean in only the water gleamed a lantern appeared behind as the gondolas in pursuit followed us we could hear the furious thrashing of their oars i fired my rifle again at the lead boat and its light danced but didnt go out someone fell into the water and more guns fired back bullets pinged off the stonework and we involuntarily flinched wish i could see to aim for their gondolier i muttered as i reloaded please leave us out of this signor our own said with quavering voice realizing he was a logical target our gondolier was driving us with more ambition than customary dark buildings zipped by as if he were powered by fultons steam shutters were banging open as occupants leaned out to see what was going on but everything was in shadow what they observed was a parade of racing phantoms our nearest pursuer less than fifty yards behind the occasional twist or low bridge prevented either of us from getting a clear shot bells began ringing but no authorities came to our aid ive got an idea said fulton he was eyeing a gondola unwittingly coming the other way beginning to drift as its gondolier paused in confusion at the echo of shots and our own maddened pace as we passed them the inventor reached out and neatly snatched the scull from the confused boatman leaving him to drift into the path of our pursuers fulton clambered to the bow of our boat whats your plan wait for me on the far side of this bridge the bridge was a low arched stone one typical for the city as we came to it the american suddenly thrust the oar down planted it on the bottom of the shallow canal and vaulted himself onto the roadbed above we slid under him and i ordered the gondolier to halt on the bridges far side the boat skewed as we stopped and then slowly backed toward fulton meanwhile the inventor had jammed the pole of his captured oar into the stone railing he had just jumped over and was prying i wish i had a fulcrum then there was a grunt and a crack we heard curses in three languages as the lead gondola of our pursuers collided with the one wed left drifting there was a cry and another splash then our assailants came toward us again and smith cuvier and i readied to give a volley wait for my command whispered fulton who had hidden behind the balustrade the enemy boat was speeding for the bridge pistols and swords pointed at us in a bristling hedge that just caught the starlight then with a groan the stone railing gave way blocks as heavy as anvils were levered off the bridge lip by fulton and fell just as the gondola was passing underneath crashing into the vessel and snapping it to pieces the occupants tumbled into the water the inventor oar still in hand leaped from the other side of the bridge to a waterwashed porch and scrambled toward our boat fire at the next one he ordered i liked his cool head so when the second attacking gondola came out of the gloom slowing at the sight of comrades thrashing in the water we let loose a volley cuviers two pistols my rifle and smiths blunderbuss all went off at once there were screams more oaths and the second pursuing boat tipped as dead and wounded spilled into the canal now now go for the harbor fulton cried as he jumped aboard our gondolier sculled as if he were on fire nice work robert i congratulated its all in the leverage archimedes showed how it could be done give me a lever and a place to stand and i will move the earth the old greek said clever bastard wasnt he at the next bridge where the canal narrowed because of the structures abutments fulton had us stop while he wedged the extra oar at an angle widthwise across the canal behind us just at water level where it could catch a gondolas bow that will block the rest until they chop it away he said it may give us enough time then we hurried on our gondolier panting being with you is proving to be consistently dramatic monsieur gage cuvier said in order to say something he was getting quicker i noticed at reloading bloody exciting smith agreed who are those devils egyptian rite i assume or their hired mercenaries anxious persistent and hostile lucky they didnt cut us off finally we broke from the narrow canal and glided out into the broader lagoon the domes of the basilica were a geometric symphony against the sky and moored gondolas bobbed in the light chop but how to find a ship in the middle of the night then a lantern glowed in the stern of a xebec here here this is the one you want chapter ten our gondolier sculled briskly toward the turkish vessel anxious to get rid of us its muslim captain brown as leather and whipquick beckoned us closer his sleeveless vest revealed muscle worthy of a skilled topman and his dark eyes were lively as a rug merchants row to the other side of my vessel away from the city yes come to hamidou i heard shots and suspect you need quick passage my new friends we rounded the stern and drifted close to the other side half a dozen other sailors with closecropped beards lined the gunwale dressed in bloused trousers bright sashes and in some cases turbans gage these are muhammadans cuvier objected and we need to go to ottoman waters yes i will take you where you wish to go for half what these christians would charge you the entrepreneur promised no ship is swifter no passage cheaper than my mykonos but you have money my friends yes and we need to leave now then you need hamidou dragut is the best sailor on the adriatic and the aegean look at my little arrow here fifty feet long narrow and shallow able to slip anywhere my sails are black so we move like a phantom do you know the island of thira of course i was almost born there and for two hundred francs we leave at this moment for three hundred we leave an hour ago he laughed the christians will charge you three times that to go to turkish waters they are afraid of pirates but i have nothing but friends and why are you quite so cheap asked fulton with yankee skepticism because i go to the aegean anyway i take you to thira trade at nearby islands and then pick you up to bring you back he nodded i hamidou dragut vow it youre a turk i am greek i am a turk i am whatever you want me to be i sail with all faiths do not hesitate lookdo you see the gondolas they are looking i climbed the side of the hull and looked across the deck of his ship at venice craft had emerged from the same canal we had and were sculling toward the moored gondolas searching there are more of them than there are of you the captain said were hoping to slip in and out of thira before anyone much notices then hamidou is the man for you i am a ghost invisible a good smuggler not smuggle simply arrive and depart without official interference thira is a small island with small bureaucrats a word a coin and you will be secret enough i know everyone all are my friends his gaze flashed from one to the other of us looking for belief with the energy of a man who is used to doubt because he doesnt worry too much about truth or principle in other words i knew the type and recognized his usefulness this dragut looks like just the rascal we need i told the others trustworthy expedient we boarded coins were counted out and draguts men sprang to quietly raise anchor and sails the crew hauled on the lines in the dark with the surety that comes from long practice none objected to our sudden nighttime departure once they saw money even as the pursuing gondolas hunted along the shore we drifted from venice before first light blushed in the east not daring to set a lantern the water hissed under our keel a dawn breeze carrying the smell of the city and then the sails stretched as the wind freshened rigging creaking the boat leaned came alive and settled into rhythm the citys lamps began to fade behind us disappearing with the last of the stars we collapsed into sleep i awoke at midmorning and inspected the craft wed hired our xebec had two main masts and a mizzen lateen sails a dozen light cannon to ward off thieves and a high graceful poop we savants could relax on while the halfdozen muslims worked the ship there was a simple cabin below that hamidou said we could share with him but which was too low to stand in his crew slept on the open deck and below a maindeck grating was the hold for sails supplies and cargo long narrow and shallowdrafted it was ideal for poking in and out of the tight harbors of the mediterranean the city had disappeared and we were alone on the sparkling adriatic good morning hamidou greeted i will get you to thira two days faster than any captain in venice we ate a breakfast of couscous and lambthe crews leftovers from the night beforeand took stock the nice thing about a scrape with danger i decided was that we four savants had developed the fellowship of shared peril we had the exhilaration that comes from escape and the camaraderie that comes from relying on each other for our lives i with my rifle tomahawk and sword was considered the veteran id been in battles and this granted me an assumption of competence and courage its why men work hard to become dangerous smith cheerful at this opportunity to see more of the world than the bottom of a canal ditch took an avid interest in the working of the islamic ship and a dedication to cleaning his blunderbuss he fired it once for the sailors the kick punching him backward and its roar made them jump and cry in wonder and delight the bullets kicked up a spray on the sea fulton had sewn a patch on his wounded bag and was fitting metal tubes to extend the pipes half filling the bag with seawater and squirting it at cuvier in a spray he adjusted by tinkering with the nozzle youre constructing a fountain the frenchman asked im making a dragon i need to find some oil on thira cuvier when not recording expenses and compass readings in his journal proudly showed his new pistols to hamidou dragut the pair had a fine time with mock duels pacing the length of the xebec before turning and firing with clicks of hammers like boys these pistols are as pretty as a houri our captain exclaimed this is good because death should be elegant i would be kissed by weapons like these or the americans pretty sword and bleed happily you are gentlemen of taste and refinement the truth was that we felt cheerful theres thrill in cheating danger we were swashbucklers out for scientific fame bonapartes required journey was a diversion to a mediterranean where all colors are brighter all meals slower all evenings more languid all women more mysterious and all cities more ancient the wind was warm and the limoncello liqueur we bought was ambrosia from the islands sweet and sharp as honeyed ice for me the conversation with napoleon about his little red man had ignited a hundred memories and unanswered questions i remembered bonapartes bold stay alone in the granite sarcophagus of the great pyramid lying like a dead man and emerging from its dark chamber with hallucinatory visions id been embroiled in a deepening puzzle ever sincefirst the medallion and the pyramid and then the book of thoth in the tunnels of jerusalem and the city of ghosts magnus bloodhammer had dragged norse myth and north america into the tangle and all this musty legend pointed to some ancient beginnings forged by strange godmen with powerful knowledge long forgotten and only half rediscovered there were secrets that had been anxiously sought by conquerors from alexander to the crusaders and a weird dark history that interwove with our more conventional one each time i thought the mystery had finally slammed shut another door would open each time i thought the egyptian rite was out of my life it would unexpectedly reappear each time i thought id fought or tunneled my way to some final conclusion yet another quest became necessary it was dangerous as the devil and i grieved for the friends id lost along the way but it was also as intoxicating as a temptress or a chest of gold i was becoming the master i realized not of electricity as my mentor franklin might have hoped nor commerce as my father desired nor even war as napoleon might instruct but of a story with snakelike twists that hinted where wed come from it led back into the fog when time began while smith and cuvier looked to rocks for the answer i was the scientist of myth the investigator of the improbable fate had woven me a career out of fable dragut was curious of course why four european scholars i benefitted from their company by being lumped with them would want to coast round the peloponnese of greece and fetch up at a rocky island on the rim of the aegean thira had no city no commerce and no ancient ruins of any note they are poor and pious on an island the devil made he said it is one of those places in the mediterranean where nothing is we study the history of the earth smith told him thira is dramatic he shrugged i allow it is steep but what need of history men learn from the past men are slaves to the past always trying to correct old errors trust in allah my friend i trust you to sail this ship safely to where we want to go yes put your faith in hamidou too i will surprise you we caught a northwesterly maestro wind off the continent and surfed down the windy adriatic quickly passing the austrian possessions of dalmatia and then as the breeze fell coasting by croatia tiny montenegro and the western coast of greece that was controlled by the ottoman empire the wind gradually gentled the sea a saucer of sparkle castles crowned rocky headlands pastel villages lined aquamarine bays and bulbous church steeples served as navigation marks between reefs and islets the blue of sea and sky deepened as we sailed south clouds sweet as cream the seven greek islands of the new septinsular republic created when the russians and turks ejected french troops three years before slid by like high green jewels corfu kefalonia ithaca it was one of the leaders of this tiny experiment charismatic count ioannis kapodistrias whom we were to secretly meet on thira there was cloud at the summit of kefalonias mount ainos as we breezed by and i could smell the pine from its shore it beckoned like a green paradise but we had no time to tarry we were going to a place dry and largely treeless and more like creation when the world began chapter eleven thira that greek island that the venetians call santorini rises sheer from the blue aegean like a wall of jagged chocolate its volcanic cliffs topped by whitewashed villages that cling to the crest like frosting thira is actually an archipelago of half a dozen islands the broken remnants of an ancient crater we sailed into its caldera drunk from wind and the dazzling sunlight of the aegean all colors brighter all edges sharper the babble of our sailors foreign our mission misty and my scientific companions as anticipatory as if they were on holiday we were in legendary greece cradle of democracy edge of the ottoman empire in a place that looked as if it was created yesterday and could be remade by an explosion tomorrow our destination island was a crescent that enclosed a seemingly bottomless bay four miles wide by six long across this bay was the smaller island of thirassia that represented smith told me the opposite side of the old crater wall in the harbors center was a small low rumpled island as pocked as the moon it was smoking this is what the world looked like when it began cuvier said rock and water look at the strata of those cliffs georges smith exclaimed eruptions laid down like rows of bricks we can read them like a book what shelter this would be for a navy fulton added cliffs you could cuddle under or the worst lee shore dragut said there are days when the meltemi blows that you do not want to be in here my friend it can be an evil place evil i can see the blue domes of half a dozen churches from here christian churches are no shield against the devil when satan awakes and mosques no shelter from an earthquake bad things happen to all of the pious dragut the solution would be to use science to warn of disaster no worse things happen to nonbelievers like savants and french revolutionaries and no one can warn about the will of god i put my faith in allah cuvier i interrupted you described this as one of the oldest places in the world but im not sure what you meant by that i said oldest and newest the scientist said old in that its like our planets beginning raw and mostly treeless new in that when that isle in the center belches hot new rock comes out the island destroys and remakes itself it seems an odd place to hide anything you want to keep and a forbidding place if you want to keep treasure hunters away we made for a small harbor at the base of the islands cliff the little port cast in shadow this morning by an escarpment hundreds of meters high fishing boats bright as toys bobbed by the rubble quay their gay colors a contrast to the grim rust brown and gray striations towering above the shoreline was so steep that dragut could bring his xebec right to the short jetty we hired donkeys for a slow surefooted trek up a switchback trail etched into the face of the somber cliff the animals bristly ears twitching and their clop steady as we swayed the route had no railings and was slick with manure the donkeys blinking against the flies smith kept making us stop so he could peer at different clumps of ugly rock as if willing the soil to speak the cliff looked mute to me and the view out to the other side of the vast bay was across an unnerving gulf of air i was anxious to get off the precipitous trail at last we gained the top and had a better understanding of the geography of this peculiar island thiras western edge was a crescent of steep cliff its houses perched at the rim of the crater ridge like nests of birds to the east of this scimitar the island sloped more gently down to the sea in a broad fan there the ground was divided by stone fences into pasture vineyards and cropland all of them brown in midsummer it looked to me that little had changed since odysseus roamed around was homers winedark sea spotted by whitecaps the wind cooling us after the stillness beneath the cliffs imagine this slope of land continuing from the sea upward to a peak over what is now the central bay smith said using the sweep of his hand to fill the void it would be an immense mountain visible for a hundred miles a cone like etna and then a cataclysm even worse than the one that consumed pompeii and the peak disappears in its place is a volcanic crater hundreds or thousands of feet deep filled with the sea that crater is what we just sailed across but the bay is a league in extent fulton marveled what kind of force would turn an immense mountain into such a hole what indeed the geologist said while gage searches for ancient weapons cuvier and i are going to be exploring what really drives the world and what is that nature herself imagine if we could harness her more fully our arrival at such a small island could not go unnoticed but the ottoman constable seemed more confused than suspicious about it especially after dragut offered that we would pay any special immigration fees the portly turk might invent we had french documents with colorful stamps the man couldnt read and surveying instruments he didnt understand both helped make our mission seem official or at least important while at the same time so technical as to be incomprehensible we said we were making measurements for the french institutepossibly trueand that our findings were anticipated by the sublime porte in istanbul which was a cheerful lie the fat functionary took his coins and wandered off to make a report by slow mail to authorities on the mainland by the time it reached anyone with the rank to make a decision about us wed be gone dragut went down to his ship for what he said would be a quick trading run to a neighboring island i will come back to collect you i promise trust hamidou we meanwhile found lodging in a vintners house in the village of megalochori a rendezvous set up by fouches agents here we were to secretly meet the young doctor whom napoleon thought might someday lead the greeks to independence from turkey handsome charismatic count ioannis kapodistrias when russia and the turks set up the septinsular republic on the obstinately christian ionian islands the eloquent kapodistrias became one of the tiny republics two chief ministers he was only twentyfive but had the magnetism of a napoleon or nelson by force of personality alone hed persuaded rebels on kefalonia to stay within his tiny new nation and was reportedly guiding it to a constitution based on liberal principles now he was hoping to lead a wider revolt and chase the same rumors that we were while we waited for kapodistrias to make contact cuvier and smith began surveying the ancient caldera from the cliff rim trying to calculate the cataclysm required to make it fulton wandered off with his bagpipes saying he wanted to experiment with oils to fill the instrument and sketch the workings of the islands windmills i practiced my fencing against imaginary opponents worked on temperance by hiking to island vintners for what i told myself was only a judicious tasting and kept a celibate distance from island women who reminded me of my halfgreek astiza darkhaired and oliveskinned was i supposed to find some clue about her on this island it was a lazy idyll for one dazzling mediterranean day and then as i walked the trail on the cliff edge at the end of the second day congratulating myself again on selfdiscipline i saw two corsairs sailing into the vast bay at sunset their sails the color of dried blood they flew no flag or banner and made no sound but their decks were crammed with men was this ioannis kapodistrias bringing a small greek army with him or ottoman soldiers come to catch him or us or some other menace entirely their approach triggered every selfpreservation instinct i had i hurried back to where we were staying to announce we might not have time to wait for our rendezvous or dragut either we might have to hide fortunately our greek patriot was already there kapodistrias came cloaked and shielded with a broad hat slipping in quietly from wherever hed been sequestered here in turkish territory since he could be arrested for this trespass his entourage consisted of only two bodyguards and he carried no weapon but once he cast his cloak off with a whirl he impressed us immediately the minister was a lean and handsome doctor with cheekbones that could have been chiseled out of athenian marble he had a voice that would give credit to the ancient orator themistocles like many of the most able men he was also refreshingly modest im afraid i had no fleet to come with he said with a slight frown after i described the new ships no navy no army no diplomatic passport and no time are you sure it isnt a routine cargo or ferry to this island it looked like armed men to me did the turks get word youre here possibly but it might be pirates too in any event our meeting must be brief maybe its the gondola men smith said we seem to be drawing enemies wherever we go gondola men we were attacked in venice by a fleet of gondolas a beautiful woman threw a bomb at us and a muhammadan captain charged us two hundred francs to escape gage here says theres some kind of cult called the egyptian rite pursuing the same legends we are by the saints for a quartet of intellectuals you attract quite the excitement just ethan he finds trouble wherever he goes kapodistrias looked at me warily as if uneasy that hed been caught up with my dubious luck its imperative no one knows i was ever on this island you realize that if my people did not possibly need french help someday i wouldnt have come at all then help us with our mystery and well investigate while you depart cuvier said and tell napoleon how you helped us he can be a powerful ally a sensible suggestion from a famed naturalist kapodistrias said im honored to meet georges cuvier and have read of your important work organizing nature you must know however that i fear france as much as i admire it cuvier nodded reluctantly the french soldiers behaved poorly when they occupied our islands they were young men far from home and not well disciplined however the revolutionary ideals that the officers brought were like a bolt of lightning for the first time every greek dares dream of freedom from the turkish yoke of standing firm as we did at thermopylae and salamis we dont know if salvation will come from russia france or britain but our tiny republic in the ionian islands is just the start of our hope all of greece deserves to be free then were friends cuvier said bonaparte wants an independent greece as counterweight to turkey russia and england but the british have driven us from egypt the russians have driven us from your own islands and the english admirals dream of making the mediterranean their own little lake napoleon asked us to sound out greek sentiment for independence through you but also to get your help investigating rumors of a secret on thira that might benefit both of us the greeks look was cautious buried cities and ancient weapons is it true at all old stories im glad your englishman is enthralled by rocks because theres probably little else on this poor island its a shattered volcano home to a few poor fishermen and farmers but stories persist as stories tend to do theres a rumor that this island has a gate to hades hades i think that legend comes from literal truth you can burn your hand in the vents of steam on that island in the harbor this island was old and hot when pericles built athens it has venetian castles doric temples prehistoric tombs and stories of people who lived when religion and witchcraft were one pile up three thousand years of history and the web of legend prophecy superstition and lies becomes as thick as the weavings of the mythical arachne who knows whats true and what isnt in a place like this idols were their gods and fable their science sometimes the two intersect cuvier said quietly ive seen drawings from bavaria of an ancient reptile with wings like a bat it too is extinct i hope but it looks as if it could have flown from the gates of hell perhaps our medieval iconographers drew from nature and theres really a greek rumor that the ancients had some kind of powerful weapon fulton interrupted to clarify if true it could instruct modern inventors like me and ethan here is our expert on ancient mysteries and hidden powers is he now hidden powers i would like some of those there was a twinkle in the greeks eye count kapodistrias the french helped my own nation win independence i said greece will most likely need help as well napoleon can be a good friend or a deadly enemy if we carry back word that youre a friend to the ideals of the revolution it will open the way for possible partnershipnot conquestin the future in return is there anyone in thira who might help us with these old legends the rumors have reached as far as paris and our charge is to determine their truth before greedier and less scientific people come here instead he looked at me shrewdly yes a curious group you have the look of an opportunist your friend is a mechanic and then we have scholars of rocks and bones one frenchman two americans and an englishman why did napoleon send you out of hope the ottoman authorities would find us odd and inconsequential and why did you agree to go besides your rocks we have legal problems that monsieur gage caused in paris cuvier said this mission for bonaparte will erase them so were doing what we have to dothats the way the world works are you not obligated yourself to the russians and admiral ushakov it was ushakov whod thrown the french off corfu kapodistrias nodded all men are in debt all right then the missive i received from your agent said you have a clue for me that might help us find this secret i took out the ring with its picture of dome and grave with a man climbing out of the sarcophagus do you recognize that building a church perhaps there are two dozen on this island alone look at the dome its broken or half completed ah he looked carefully but of course agia theodosia the compromise of the cannon the what the church and a venetian fort rose in concert in the village of akrotiri faith through one gate and the state through another but then artillery evolved and as its guns were installed it became apparent that theodosias dome was blocking the field of fire the venetian officers said the church should move and the orthodox priests said the fort should give way to god it was proposed that the dome be lowered but the monks refused even thatopinions are held strongly in greece finally an impatient venetian catholic fired a cannon ball through the greek orthodox cupola and threatened to destroy the entire church instead the fathers reluctantly carved out a slice of the dome to allow the sighting of the gun toward enemies that in the end never came the original dome architecture has since been restored but the story of the bitten dome is well known theres no other church in thira this ring could refer to i imagined the dome with a scoop out of it one side concave and admired the compromise i think everyone should get along where is this church not fartwo kilometers perhaps but we had better hurry if ethan gage is correct about those approaching ships we may be in a race gentlemen for the gate of hades and in that case you will have to race alone what do you mean its too coincidental we have all arrived at the same time i will direct you to the church and wish you well but i must not be caught with you do you have a ship of your own gone to a neighboring island but promising to return then look to your weapons and your wits and hope your captain hurries chapter twelve the village of akrotiri on the southwestern arm of thiras crescent island looked like a scrabble of stucco dice stacked on a grassy slope it culminated in the modest ruins of a small venetian fortress half dismantled by the turks more than a century before what had once been some lordly fiefdom was now a ruin on a lonely island at the edge of a decaying empire next to the fort entrance was a greek orthodox church and it was here kapodistrias led us under a halfmoon akrotiri was still except for the bark of a dog or two and in the silvery light looked empty and timeless the peeling brown and white houses seeming to grow out of its geology like angular rocks we on the other hand made far too much noise our weaponry clanked our boots tramped in a hundred yards we gave away more evidence of our presence than a tribe of dakota would while galloping through saint peters fulton had insisted on bringing his bagpipes and every once in a while they would let out a wheeze low groan or odd sloshing please dont play i said ive a different kind of song inspired by our night at the palais royal this the french navy might actually buy if i can set things on fire i wondered if we were at the right place at all thira like all of greece is dotted with churches of plain whitewashed stucco topped by faded blue domes as ubiquitous as stables and not a great deal fancier the windows are tiny the doors stout planks of weathered wood and the interiors without pewsgreek worshippers stand before god was this nondescript place a door to a fabled weapon it was night the church locked and so kapodistriaswho seemed to be enjoying his moment of skulduggeryrousted the village priest from his cell next door and convinced him that greek patriotism required the opening of doors for us but why were looking for the gate of hades nikko and why would you seek such a thing are you devils were friends of greece but why are you at agia theodosia an old signet ring has told us to look here these men wont be but a moment they are men of science patros who want to understand the past the past is best left in the past thats what the past is for no greece will learn from them he reluctantly unlocked the door wait here he went ahead to light some candles and then came back youll see this is a poor church in a poor village theres nothing here the greek pulled him aside then let them see for themselves we passed through the anteroom or narthex and on into the main nave lighting more candles on their manoualia stands the structure was small and compared with a catholic or protestant church sparser of furniture and richer in decoration my stable analogy had been too hasty there was a primitive but grand picture of jesus in the dome overhead ready to uplift or condemn hanging below was an elaborate brass chandelier called a horos and beyond it was the most decorative part of the church a polished brass dividing wall consisting of a grilled gate flanked by enameled panels of angels and saints by custom only the priests passed up the steps and through the gate to the altar in the sanctuary beyond the succession of spaces reminded me of the ancient egyptian temples id seen a penetration to the holy the church seems rather small cuvier said what are we supposed to be looking for a sarcophagus i dont see one in the sanctuary perhaps asked fulton smith went up to the gate and tried it but it too was locked all i see is an altar wheres the priest we looked around kapodistrias is gone too cuvier said and indeed we realized the greeks had not followed us inside but instead closed the main door behind us leaving us alone if we were to discover the gate of hades it seemed we were on our own gage is this a trap fulton asked i tried the church door its been locked or braced from the outside maybe theyre trying to give us time to explore undisturbed or maybe kapodistrias doesnt trust the french after all cuvier said he just cant share the risk i think and endanger his republic but id feel better if hamidou was waiting for us i wasnt expecting those new ships with all those men what if ottomans are following us we should flee too fulton said this place isnt like fouches ring at all weve come more than a thousand miles lets at least see if anythings here theres a barlets lock the door from the inside too unfortunately except for the byzantine decoration typical of the greek religion the nave was barren it took about as long to search as my purse which is to say almost no time at all theres nothing here cuvier said rather obviously ethan i agree with robert we should retreat absolutely just as soon as we check the sanctuary but thats locked which is all the more reason to enter it gentlemen i have some experience in this kind of thing and ive found the more difficult it is to get into a place the more it pays to do so people are always sticking things in hidden cellars or sealed attics or armored armoires hoping the rest of us wont have energy enough to peek why keep anyone out unless theres something to find because its sacred smith ventured well that too i went to the grilled wall that separated the nave from the altar sanctuary three steps led up to it and painted icons were on either side of the gate jesus looked disapprovingly at me from one side and maryseeming as skeptical of me as some of the other women id dallied withfrowned at me from the other saints and angels stood guard too looking no friendlier i eyed the keyhole cuvier bring me one of your pistols for heavens sake fulton said appropriately he set his bagpipes down the instrument making a soft buzz as he did so and hopped up the steps beside me out came a set of wiry steel instruments theres no need for a gunshot which will only jam the lock i made a study of these mechanisms as a boy and found that patience can open most anything he began fiddling with the lock i dont make a habit of this but theres utility in being able to manipulate a keyhole of course theres nothing to see as you can tell by looking through the bars and if the village catches us doing this well be stoned as sacrilegious heretics or worse i just want to make sure this sanctuary isnt the front porch to hades do you smell any sulfur lets take that as a good sign and no lightning bolts for trespass yet either smith added the inventor had the gate open quick as a thief and we gingerly passed into the sanctuary feeling we were trespassing on divinity itself there was a wooden cabinet to one side with a chalice and other instruments of worship a censer to provide scented smoke hung nearby in the middle was the altar itself draped with a tapestry there was a cylindrical container and gospel on top and a processional cross and gilded fans behind whats the coffee urn then smith asked innocently a tabernacle you protestant heathen cuvier said its where they hold the sacraments ah could it have a clue then to get to heaven not hades i bent and walked the stone floor looking for a crack or pull indicating a way downward there was nothing i could see the coin and kapodistriass advice seemed a dead end outside dogs began barking again someone was coming i stood considering then remembering a temple in egypt i decided to take a closer look at the altar by lifting one corner of its cloth and peering underneath is that allowed smith asked were not even allowed on this island fulton replied aha the altar was not made from a wooden table but a stone box i saw i stepped back it was the length and width of a man theres our sarcophagus where cuvier asked its the altar they hide it by covering it their altar is a grave if you can believe that take the tabernacle off there and set it aside i will not id fry in hell i thought you french revolutionaries dont believe anymore didnt i went to the service at notre dame well ill do it then im damned anyway despite my reforms feeling oddly queasy i lifted the holy objects off the altar and placed them on the preparation table to one side surely god wouldnt mind for a moment or two smith helped me fold the altar clothwe tried to be carefuland we revealed a stone sarcophagus similar to the one cast into the signet ring the lid overlapped the box when i tugged it seemed cemented in place i think wed better pry i said you cant be serious cuvier wasnt used to treasure hunting which generally involves a fair amount of burglary desecration demolition and dust the coin shows a man going in or out i know it seems callous but if weve got the right church we need to peek inside if we hurry well have it boxed up and things back in place in time for services youd better i think theres a crowd forming outside we could hear barks voices and bumps on the church door but how are we going to get the lid off smith asked i looked at fulton robert youre the one who pried that railing off the bridge he swallowed i had an oar those iron candle stands look sturdy enough to me i took out my tomahawk and began chipping at the joint between lid and box heedless of the damage it was doing to the edge of my blade fetch one and well jam it in this crevice im making they hesitated quickly lads weve come this far probably nothing to see but bones and nothing wrong with that is there well all be fossils soon enough so we hammered a wedge point into the junction between box and lid and used a sacred manoualia the candle stand as a lever and one of the stiff choir chairs as a fulcrum i was sweating at the thought of what the locals would think if they stumbled in on us but in for a penny in for a pound someone started hammering on the church door smith take your blunderbuss into the narthex and discourage them i dont even know who im shooting at best not to ask ive found if theyre shooting at you thats identification enough i feel like a grave robber cuvier muttered in case you havent noticed gentlemen thats exactly what we are the other three of us threw our weight on our pry bar there was a cracking sound and the lid shifted slightly yes fulton said another heave just enough to look with a grind and thump we managed to shift the massive lid far enough to peer inside it was dark of course fetch a candle despite myself i always get excited when i delve i still mourned the lost treasure of the pyramid and secretly hoped i might find another outside there was a boom and crack as something crashed energetically against the church door so i bent and pushed the candle inside illuminating the interior of the sarcophagus it was vacant as a trollops wink and then smiths blunderbuss went off chapter thirteen they made a hole in the door and i had a look the englishman cried theres a crowd outside with scimitars and muskets he backed to reload a chunk of the door had been knocked loose by an ax seeking to chop an opening and smith had fired through that the chopping had stopped we heard shouts and yells outside and then muzzles were pushed through and shots fired blindly thankfully they thudded harmlessly into the stone the door was too thick to break easily and the church windows too high and small to easily climb into of course that made them hard to climb out of as well how many i asked more than in venice or paris who are they how the devil should i know i saw hoods helmets turbans and scarves you seem to make enemies with half the world ethan too many to fight for very long at least so whats in the sarcophagus not a blessed thing fulton said ah so were trapped in a greek church on a bleak island at the edge of the ottoman empire for absolutely no reason at all it appears so my inventor friend said maybe we just got the wrong sarcophagus i tried i wish id stayed in london my mother warned me about paris now a dull boom began to echo through the nave as whoever was outside began to slam some kind of ram against the door the wood bulged with each strike the bar beginning to crack maybe theres a back door i suggested i could see the reflection of torches through the high open windows if we go through it and outside well be cut to pieces cuvier said and you dont think that will happen when they get in here smith glanced up you cant reach the ceiling as you did at the palais either the dome peaked thirty feet above our heads i think gage has led us into a dead end we can make a fight of it i said sounding braver than i felt if its just peasants theyll back off i saw uniforms and enough cutlery for a palace kitchen ethan if you give me a hand i think i can delay them when they come through that door fulton hefted his bagpipe and again i heard the curious slosh its the dragon ive been working on it spits fire satans brew robert its a twist on greek fire the ancient combustible if it works theyll hesitate i thought frantically all right well start a conflagration and then well hide where cuvier unlock a back door or tie the altar cloth to a high window to make it look like weve fled then well secrete ourselves in the sarcophagus and once theyve run on by well escape by running the other way its quite brilliant really you want to get in a tomb and close the lid just for a moment to confuse them do you have a better idea there was a crash as the bar of the church door cracked through and splintered timbers heaved inward we could see a boiling mass of men some turbaned and some not the glint of steel and the flame of torches theres no time yes there is cried fulton ethan take up that candle stand there he was steady as a fireman as he aimed one of the pipes of his instrument at the disintegrating door and i noticed hed screwed on a tubular extension extending it three more feet even a wolf learns not to touch a hot stove there was a technical grimness about him a willingness to put deviltry to practical use if it were for a good causeor selfpreservation the bar finally burst entirely the doors flying wide hooded caped men like the crew wed encountered in venice pushed into the narthex of the church now fulton cried hold the candle flame near the tip of my tube he squeezed his bag and instead of song a jet of mist sprayed from his new nozzle when i held the candle stand to put a flame into the stream it ignited into a cone of fire that reached out like dragons breath there was a whoosh as the flame flared out licking at the broken door and igniting some of the egyptian rite minions pushing through men screamed capes catching fire fulton aimed his pipe like a fire hose and thats what i suppose i should call it since fire came from its tip instead of water the bag shot liquid fire thirty feet igniting the door its frame and several attackers the mob heaved back in terror and confusion and collapsed into a tangle companions beating at the flames a preview for the wicked i thought grimly the fiery door temporarily protected us with a shield of flame and smoke shots came through the murk bullets pinging back into the nave the inventor cried he carried the bag with him we retreated to the main room of the church and slammed that door piling psaltery chairs against it then we ran for the sanctuary cuvier had already sprung a side entrance as if wed fled that way and now we slammed shut the sanctuary gates shoved the heavy sarcophagus lid to make a wider opening and piled inside dragging our weapons with us what about air the french savant asked judging from my experience with my submarine we have at least half an hour fulton replied if theyre not gone well have to come out and surrender but ethans idiotic scheme is our only chance it was stuffed as a sausage inside but the tomb was far bigger than the one id found in the city of ghosts near the holy landmore the size of a horizontal closet than a coffin we wrestled the heavy lid back over us centering it as best we could and cast ourselves into complete darkness then we waited hoping theyd run by dim sounds through the stone a crashthe nave door being forced opened the faint sound of shouts and outrage a closer clang from the sanctuary gate forced open the pounding of boots on the floor and then a rush as the side door was found opened silence had it worked there could be more who are waiting i whispered lets give it several minutes so we lay half atop each other sweating our weapons clenched our breath hot and close i was ready to have a peek when we heard more sounds and froze there was talking that came to us as the faintest murmur and then an odd rattle sounds like chain cuvier whispered then a pounding like something being driven into the wall or floor more rattling and the squeal of something being ratcheted tight what the devil asked smith finally all was quiet again and i waited warily listening for the merest hint our enemies were standing by but no theyd gone we were nearing the end of fultons half hour i guessed and i didnt want us swooning from lack of air out we go then i whispered for better or worse lying on our backs for leverage we lifted arms and legs to push against the heavy stone lid to rotate it out of the way it wouldnt budge harder i hissed we grunted pushing with all our might all we heard was the clanking of metal link against metal link chain grinding against stone no hard this time it was as if the sarcophagus had been cemented shut bloody hell i think theyve chained the lid down said smith theyve got us trapped and sealed ethan theyre just waiting for us to suffocate they cant be that clever i pushed again but we couldnt get out well hang my plan had buried us alive apparently we didnt fool them i said unnecessarily speaking aloud now under the assumption that they knew theyd caught us like insects in a bottle apparently this is the most damn fool thing we could have done amended cuvier i thought we were in a race for some secret they simply want to smother us maybe they already knew the crypt was empty said fulton with a trace of admittedly understandable bitterness i think he was beginning to doubt my reputation as a gifted adventurer first you set our bordello on fire gage then you get us arrested then some paramour throws a grenade at the mere sight of you and now youve condemned us to suffocation can anyone remind me again why we chose him as a guide to the palais royal she wasnt my paramour i felt more than a little defensive he was supposed to be an expert on trollops too cuvier said maybe they just want to take the fight out of us said smith hullo he banged on the lid with the muzzle of his blunderbuss we surrender nothing so we all yelled and banged to no more effect it was as if theyd buried us and departed to have supper fultons liquid fire cruelly repaid what is worse burning or suffocation maybe we could shoot our way out smith suggested if you set that blunderbuss off in here the balls will bounce until they kill us all fulton replied well its empty anyway fearfully hard to load when were packed in like this try not to set off roberts bagpipes either cuvier said id rather not roast as well and im getting a cramp aye ethan can you shift asked smith we might as well die comfortable whats it like to smother anyway georges youre the zoologist i assure you i havent tried it i think its more insidious than painful fulton theorized as our breath grows short our brains will fogthat was my experience in tests aboard my submarine eventually well lapse into unconsciousness and die not much different from falling asleep not such a bad way to go i said trying to see the bright side then hold your breath first idiot so the rest of us have a few moments more cuvier muttered i dont know if he was tiring of me just then or was simply annoyed at the idea of him and me lying together for all eternity do you really think they know the box is empty of any secrets or treasure smith asked im guessing their plan is simply to kill us by waiting and then open it up again to look for themselves i said rather efficient really i mean were already buried too they dont have to do any work at all im full of admiration wed better stop talking to conserve our breath while i think i proposed and when is that phenomenon to commence exactly cuvier inquired then he began kicking at the stone lid and yelling things like help and parley that did no good either and at last exhausted he lapsed into silence we lay crammed in the dark blind helpless and doomed i wish i could report i had some kind of profound insight while buried alive but frankly nothing philosophical occurred except that as the others had concluded i was a damn fool i was just glad my companions hadnt thought to strangle me and so we waited and waited and waited silence it felt lonely gentlemen are you dead i finally ventured for gods sake gage smith groaned but im not dead either isnt that a curious phenomenon cuvier maybe we are dead fulton said maybe this is what death is like especially after youve killed men in bitter violence maybe this is hell no theres air coming in here i insisted has to be not light but air what are you saying smith asked that theres some leak in this box feel with your hands to see if you can find it maybe theres more to this sarcophagus than we initially realized we scrabbled with our fingers but could find nothing i looked in vain for a crack of light but since there was none the air if it really was coming in had to be from the unlit below i think theres a hollow under this box i insisted put your noses down and sniff for better air gage wait said cuvier it does seem fresher here at this end maybe we can dig smith said ethan do you have your silly sword its a rather elegant rapier lets try scraping and prying with the thing getting it clear of its scabbard wasnt easy given our tight packing then we had to twist it around to get the point to the head of the sarcophagus where cuvier was breathing ow sorry if you angle it this way which way i cant see a damn thing dont poke my bagpipes just hold still a moment there we go steadyaw careful georges here comes the tip i began scraping the weapon at the joint between the sides of the sarcophagus and the floor feeling above it with my fingers wait was there a mark i felt a diamond shape inscribed in the stone small and shallow but eerily recognizable a diamond or was it an overlapping compass and square ancient symbol of freemasonry my that fraternity got around i stabbed at the stone beneath it looking for an opening suddenly there was a click and then before i could cry warning we were plunging into a void of utter blackness chapter fourteen it was a miracle none of us were impaled by my sword we hit a slope and slid in the dark hardly knowing which way was up weapons clattering and fultons theory about us having descended into hell seemed all too terrifyingly true yet at last we sword blunderbuss longrifle and bagpipes rolled to some kind of bottomjust how deep i never knew there was air dusty but breathable and it was hot just like an entryway to hades georges william robert it just gets worse and worse one of them groaned is everyone still alive how do we tell well were here i think so the ring showed something after all the sarcophagus wasnt the treasure it was only the trapdoor to it all we have to do is keep our wits about us discover whatever secrets are down here and find a way back out our wits we cant see a thing i think it was cuvier ethan we fell several seconds straight down before hitting that slope fulton said i doubt we can climb back up to that tomb and what good would it do us if we did when our enemies open it theyll see which way weve gone smith added perhaps or perhaps my sword tip triggered a spring i said the bottom opens but then springs back they may open the sarcophagus to find us and instead of our corpses it will be empty once more theyll think it a miracle or more likely that we were never in there in the first place and gave them the slip quite ingenious on our part really why should they care asked fulton were doomed anyway weve gone from one grave to a bigger one no i run around in these underground places all the time i said with more confidence than i felt theres something down here maybe something that hasnt been seen since medieval times i think there was a freemason mark where i triggered the collapse of the trapdoor this may be a templar tunnel my friends templars smith groaned what are you talking about apparently that group of crusader knights was on the trail of some ancient mysteries and succeeded for a time in finding some i discovered one in the near east in a lost city and another in the american wilderness they seem to have been systematically reassembling the past after the saracens drove the christians from the holy land the knights set up strongholds in places like cyprus and malta perhaps they came here too and built that hidden door for later generations who never came we may not be in peril but in luck were on the cusp of rediscovering what napoleon and fouche really sent us to find some ancient weapon of a lost civilization maybe well win a prize there was a long silence in the dark then the frenchman spoke again slowly carefully you realize that we are all completely insane if so then napoleon is too think about it hes heard rumors of a weapon connected with og and atlantis and takes a chance by sending us here i didnt much believe the legends myself when we saw the poverty and rawness of this island but a tomb with a trap with a masonic engraving come my friends there has to be a reason weve tumbled into a pit its true but perhaps a pit with a reason for being i know were bruised bloody without food or water and lost in pitch blackness without a clue where to go but fortune may actually be smiling on us i grinned in the dark im quite excited actually silence again i hoped they hadnt crept away before we can find buried treasure i continued briskly we have to decide which way to go my hope is the slope we just tumbled down leads to a tunnel we can follow without any junctions caverns or drops we can hold hands taking turns groping through the dark groans im not holding your hand fulton said well light a candle candle i kept one when we ignited my fire hose you had a taper cuvier asked why didnt you light it in the sarcophagus there was hardly a point there was nowhere to go and the flame would use up the oxygen all americans are lunatics the zoologist muttered not just gage well i can make a flash in the pan of my longrifle i said cheerfully lets gather some lint to have something to better catch the wick so we did and some priming from my powder horn and a pull of the trigger produced what was in the darkness a blinding flash which ignited a ball of lint we in turn used to light fultons candle with no holder we stuck the wax shaft temporarily in the barrel of smiths blunderbuss then we inspected ourselves for damage we were filthy torn and raw from scrapes in our tumbles but surprisingly intact the very tip of my rapier was bent slightly and our weapons knocked about but nothingincluding our bonesseemed to be seriously broken the candle illuminated a steep dirt slope down which wed tumbled the sarcophagus was far out of sight above in the other direction was a narrow tunnel just high enough to stoop in that twisted through lava rock the tube led downward toward hades chapter fifteen our underground way twisted like a worm at times the ceiling was high enough to stand freely and at other times we had to crawl always fearing wed come to a dead end the walls bulged in and out irregularly casting doubt that medieval knights had carved it they apparently used natures casting cuvier said its probably a lava tube volcanoes will sometimes have pipes through which molten rock flows when this island was a volcano this may have been a conduit from the central peak to the sea the island is still a volcano smith corrected does that mean lava could flow through here now fulton asked worriedly only if there were an eruption smith said but if there were wed be suffocated by gas or cooked by heat long before any lava came i see or earthquakes could collapse the tunnel on top of us added cuvier heated water could boil us alive suggested smith or scald us to death with steam agreed cuvier at mount etna onlookers have been killed by flying rock at vesuvius theyve found corpses petrified by the ash the two savants seemed to be enjoying themselves i love science dont you robert i asked fulton its much more sensible to work with things you can control like machines and so we explored bunched up behind our little candle it not only provided light but gave us assurance by burning that there was still breathable air if were alive there has to be an outlet drawing air somewhere eh i asked the others yes said cuvier perhaps the size of a door or the size of your finger well yes twice we slid down rubble chutes seeming to creep closer and closer to some kind of hell i was hot but how much was my imagination i wiped my sweat and noticed how dry my throat was then we crawled over a sill and our horizontal path momentarily ended we had come to a vertical shaft that led both up and down smooth and round like a well i looked up but the top was dark and presumably sealed there was no easy way to climb up there i ripped a scrap from my shirt lit it with the candle and dropped it down there was a dirt floor twenty feet below and the tunnel led on from that the shaft isnt wide i said if we jam ourselves across we can inch our way down ill go first and when i get partway you can pass the blunderbuss and candle the wax had already burned halfway somewhat awkwardly we made our way to the bottom of this well and came upon a surprising discovery the tunnel that continued on from the shaft was braced with timbers it appeared to be an excavated mine instead of a natural passage the wood looked very old dry and cracked but protected from rot by the dryness of the warm passageway there was a pile of excavated sand and crude rusted tools somebodys been down here before us i said and not thousands of years ago either i think this shaft used to be an alternate entrance from the surface i looked up too bad theres no ladder perhaps this foolishness is not altogether pointless cuvier admitted the bracing hardly looks strong enough to hold up tent fabric let alone the earth fulton warned this is crude engineering very old and weak but im guessing its been here since medieval times i said why would it fall down today after hundreds of years because were here causing vibration and noise cuvier said so lets whisper and not brush anything and so we went cautiously on and came upon the street it was not a normal street of coursewe were somewhere under the surface of thiraand yet it was some kind of minersmedieval knights was my guess probably templarshad dug down to the flat sandalworn flagstones of an ancient thoroughfare the mine ceiling was overhead and our light was pitiful until cuvier took the gray paperdry wooden handle of a medieval shovel wrapped our handkerchiefs on the end and lit them with the candle giving us the flare of a torch with this new light we could see that a slope of volcanic ash and rubble made up one side of the street still covering part of whatever city had been buried thousands of years ago when the island exploded on the streets other side however was the excavated stone wall of an ancient building with a door and room beyond straight ahead our flagstone lane deadended at a slope of sand and rubble that almost entirely plugged the tunnel except for a small crevice at its top cool air blew through that crack the men who uncovered this probably used the well shaft to lift the dirt they dug out smith theorized then they lidded it and to hide any hint of the location used that lava tube to connect this place to a very distant one the church perhaps there was no church then and the holy place was built around the entrance with the sarcophagusturnedaltar constructed to disguise it it looks as if they were planning to come back but didnt another eruption drove them away perhaps cuvier suggested or some kind of attack or war the templars were crushed and scattered in i said friday the thirteenth and this buried roomprobably a buried citywas lost and forgotten smith speculated until this race between you and the egyptian rite to uncover these old secrets said fulton this was not a race of my choosing id been dragged into this mess by winning a medallion in a paris card game more than four years before and my life has been uncomfortably tumultuous and annoyingly unprofitable ever since yet i also felt swept up in something historical the knights templar had been annihilated by a king and a pope desperate to learn the secret of their power and their discoveries were scattered now interest in the past had been revived we lived in an age of revolution and reason and yet legend and the occult are a respite from the headlong scientific rush of the modern world was changing so fast and was there really something down here that could tip the balance of power in the mediterranean from experience id say it best that we now poke around i announced treasure tends to be found that way so we stepped through a doorway into one of the excavated rooms and encountered not at all what i expected there were no machines here and indeed no furniture of any kind but instead of the austere whiteness i might expect of greek architecture we encountered a garden of blazing color the walls were covered with murals and murals of an ethereal beauty that seemed like a memory of a paradise long forgotten the vines of flowers wound sensuously toward an implied sun the petals glowing in gold red and purple antelopes and birds were drawn with sinuous lines as perfect as the fall of a river prancing and flying across ocher meadows monkeys leaped from twisting trees galleys as graceful as racing shells were hung with garlands a naked youth posed with a bundle of fish caught from a pristine sea a graceful maiden lovely as a cameo serene as a dove and with a waterfall of dark hair gestured delicately while clad in a complex layered dress of lovely colors how different from the dramatic stern stiffness of murals in egyptian temples or even the angular white grandeur in pictures id seen of the ruins of the acropolis in athens in egypt warriors had marched and trod enemies underfoot but these people were not just peaceful they displayed a peace that suggested theyd never known war at all it reminded me of magnus bloodhammers dreams of an eden not yet poisoned by the apple and the fall if were looking for ancient war machines i think weve got the wrong address i murmured this looks like a pacifist arcadia gorgeous arent they cuvier said the life in these murals how many modern painters could capture that our portraits are darker smith agreed northern europeans overdressed and overfed with moody skies and harnessed horses what a little heaven these people must have had in contrast before the volcano blew is this atlantis then asked fulton its something very old and very different from greece or egypt i said i have no idea what it is they dont just look happy they look confident but they dont look warlike at all why would the egyptian rite expect to find a weapon down here we still dont know were in the right place but that tomb that trapdoor that tunnel its all very deliberate maybe whatever we hoped to find has already been moved i dont think so im not sure anyone has been down here since medieval times there are more doorways lets keep looking the building seemed mazelike as illogical in its organization as it was beautiful in its decor room opened to room with no organizing hallway or unifying atrium it was hivelike we passed painted ships with oars splayed like the legs of water bugs papyrus reeds clumped in the sun athletes boxing and girls running and we were going in our little cone of flickering light from one room to another when suddenly fulton called wait we stopped i think i saw something peculiar in the last room we went back the inventor pointed to a frieze near the ceiling it was a horizontal scrolling picture of a flotilla of ships not very different from others wed seen before it suggested that whoever built this nowburied place had been sailors which was logical for island dwellers had they been able to sail away when the volcano blew had they founded new civilizations elsewhere even in america theres something odd up there fulton said pointing there was a shape like a crescent moon painted to one side of the gliding ships and beams of sunlight or moonlight emanating from its concave side to illuminate the little navy its the moon dont you think i proposed the inventor shook his head look its attached to an elegant curved frame of some kind as graceful as their murals of flowers but attended by small figures this isnt a celestial object gentlemen its some kind of machine his finger traced the rays emanating from the crescent and followed them to one of the ships there was a blossom of color above the vessel that id assumed was a representation of a dyed sail but fulton perhaps mindful of his peculiar use of his bagpipes had discerned something else i think its setting these ships on fire i felt a chill then as if id seen the snake undergirding eden people had lived here in peace yes but perhaps their peace was sustained behind the shield of some kind of weapon so terrible that it could ignite any enemy vessel that approached too close but this idea has been attributed to the great archimedes fulton said surely this is much too early for the burning mirrors the burning mirrors what are you talking about robert there are accounts from ancient history originally written by lucian two centuries after christ and later relayed to us by medieval writers lucian wrote that during the roman siege of syracuse in bc the greek mathematician archimedes constructed a mirror or lens that could focus the suns heat on enemy ships the greek was a mechanical genius who also devised a giant pincer that could crush roman ships like a monstrous claw in the end the romans prevailed and burst into the city and archimedes was killed by an ignorant soldier while he drew his mathematical figures in the sand his genius was lost but the legend of a heat ray persisted some called it poseidons spear or neptunes trident i startled such words had also been inscribed in the gold foil id found in north america many have dismissed it as fable fulton went on and nobody has attributed it to earlier times than archimedes but what if the brilliant greek got the idea for his mirror from a place like this from atlantis perhaps could it work said smith who knows but if it did and if you could find it today it might have the ability to ignite modern ships that are even more vulnerable thanks to their dependence on sails and gunpowder theyd light like a torch and blow up like a magazine here is a weapon that never needs to be reloaded and is tireless as the sun i barely escaped the french flagship lorient when she blew up at the battle of the nile i recounted the blast was so titanic that it actually halted the battle for a quarter of an hour it was the most terrible thing ive experienced well one of them anyway id accumulated a lot of memories the past few years so this could tip the domination of the mediterranean if it existed fulton said but a mirror would have to be huge to have the power to burn a ship theres nothing like that in this hole no room big enough and no way to get it out if there were so what is down here smith asked we proceeded to look there were eight rooms in all dirt cascading into the two at each end of the complex as indication this old city had been only partially excavated each was emptier than a cell except for the murals there was nothing the floor was hardpacked dirt and search as we might we could find no more traps or hidden tunnels the ceiling was earth braced by mining timbers when we poked at it all we got for our trouble was grit in our eyes the street stopped at that slope of dirt to go that way wed have to be like worms and i didnt fancy getting wedged into some wormhole wondering about hidden treasure as i slowly withered to a husk yet there was no way to retreat either unless we could levitate up the shaft as my companions had complained it appeared that id succeeded only in trapping us in a slightly bigger grave as barren as the sarcophagus above its already been robbed cuvier theorized i suspect were centuries too late these knights or whoever they were got the mirror first then why is there no record of its being used fulton asked and why are so many people after us are we all chasing a myth that picture is of the burning mirror gentlemen and that is an ancient weapon there has to be something to it our light kept burning lower i tried to think always a difficult task why the church sarcophagus trap tunnel excavation and persistent pursuit if there was nothing down here then it occurred to me the fourth room i proposed i led them back to it and we shone our ebbing candle on the mural in there at first glance it seemed no different from the othersflowers birds and brilliant colorexcept i realized the color was slightly too bright the lines of the mural were less sinuous somehow less assured as if the artist whod copied them had not shared the gaiety that comes from living in a sunny place of perpetual peace behind a death ray that warded off all enemies a talented but sweating knight templar perhaps pressed into service to hide a critical clue in plain view i thought of the stone tablet and rotting shield in the dakota territory of north america that bore enigmatic references to this og or the misleading signal in the city of ghosts or mathematician monges dismissal of my sacred medallion at the great pyramid always there was a distraction i took my tomahawk and swung at the mural a crack appeared gage no cuvier cried this artwork is priceless on the contrary georges this mural has no value at all its a medieval facade a fakery and i swung again and again making a spiders web of cracks and then chipped at the edges to pry the stucco off the underlying stone its a ruse what do you mean i dont think this was painted by the ancient people who built this place i think medieval knights or someone else put it here to cover something up i hoped i was right because all i was uncovering was roughlooking stone but then i spied the edge of something leathery there was a sheet of parchment sealed between stucco and rock i fingered its edge and peeled it as much as i could then we heard a murmur of sound distant clanks and grunts and fulton darted out to listen from the buried street someones coming there was latin writing on the parchment behind the mural chapter sixteen smith buy me time to get this parchment pried loose the englishman darted away with his blunderbuss again the old document was surprisingly pliable but the sheepskin had bonded to wall and mural like glue it could only be peeled off a little at a time cuvier used my rapier to scrape from the other side the false painting flaking away i heard the roar of smiths gun shouts and answering shots hurry the french scientist muttered unnecessarily then we heard a whoosh and crackling i sniffed something was burning again smith rushed back in fulton is as mad as you are gage hes set the mines shoring on fire with his bagpipes theres so much smoke we cant see a damn thing neither can our enemies i suppose cuvier slid the rapier behind the parchment like a razor and at last the document about eighteen inches square came free id no idea what it said given that it was in latin and there was no time for us to translate in any event i slid it inside my shirt and nodded what happens when the timber burns through the earth will collapse on all this beauty cuvier said and on us smith amended we hurried out to the main street fulton had backed down it coughing flames seemed to be racing along the network of dried supports as if theyd been soaked in oil and there was a merry popping and crackling as our roof burned i could hear shouts of consternation from the other side of the smoke who followed us down here i asked we didnt get a clear look at them fulton said william let them have it with his blunderbuss and then i used the last oil from my pipes id hoped it might collapse just a section to buy us time but it appears the whole lot of it is catching fire i think im going to bring the entire cave down on us ethan and i dont have a gambling salon above to help us escape this time im not the only idiot i said with more than a little sincerity for the timber to burn vigorously like this means its being fed by air my savants cuvier put in holding a handkerchief over his nose and mouth we still havent found the vent that kept us from suffocating in the sarcophagus so theres hope we backed away from the flames to the end of the ancient street where there was that small crevice at the top of a slope of rock and sand when i put my face to it i got some grit from wind being sucked by the fire the breeze was rushing through as the fire sucked pushing the worst of the smoke toward our enemies help me dig maybe theres still a way out we threw sand like terriers the crevice widened more air pouring through as behind the fire ate timbers that hadnt seen a drop of rain for seven centuries this new hole was another lava tube i saw or perhaps a continuation of the one wed already negotiated this time just wide enough to crawl into ahead was complete blackness with no clue if the geologic pipe would continue as a pathway or shrink to something we couldnt squeeze through i took stock our stub of candle had blown out and our torches were too long for such a confined crawl the only light we had was coming from fultons fire ive no idea if we can get through here then there was a roar and the ceiling back toward our attackers came down with a crash and an eruption of dust thousands of tons of dirt snuffing out much of the fire and burying many of the rooms wed just been in they were lost forever unless someone figured a way to dig down from above the tunnel and the shaft that led toward the surface were plugged separating us from any pursuit had it buried our enemies its not like we have a choice said cuvier lead the way ethan in the dark what about the candle then ill hold it in my teeth until we get to the place we most desperately need it dont leave your weapons ive got a feeling we might need them too given our luck so far i wouldnt be surprised so we crawled the tunnel was rough basalt just wide enough for our shoulders i took the lead the others coming as best they could i shifted the parchment and rapier onto my back to protect them as much as possible from scraping while using my longrifle to probe ahead for obstacles and falls i hated the clang and clack that i knew was scuffing my armaments even more no fine lady would be impressed the only encouragement was the breeze that blew around us coming from somewhere ahead and blowing toward the fire behind the discouragement was how warm the tunnel was getting from the surrounding rock there were more crashes to our rear as timbers burned through and the last of the light winked out as the earth slumped we were in blackness as profound as death itself i could hear the quiet curses of the others as they crawled behind me and the rattle of the weapons we doggedly kept at least fulton had let go of his empty bagpipes i detest underground places i havent found a burrow yet that doesnt involve dirt sweat the occasional swim and precious little treasure if i ever have a proper house i think im going to put it on stilts to get as far from the earth as possible or maybe ill live in a boat in a tubsized pond too small to have any waves even in the dark i could feel the rock seeming to press on us as i thought about the caveins behind suddenly the floor disappeared and i reached down with my arm in the dark tensing in case i somehow touched something that could touch back but i felt only air i reached ahead and the tunnel floor we were on seemed to continue across a gap of only two feet my vision seemed pink and i blinked a moment there was the faintest of glows far far below i realized the merest murmur of hell heat wafted up from the hole i shouted back to the others that i was going to wriggle across the gap and continue on and warned them to be ready for it then i dragged myself across the void stomach clenching and went on the tunnel kept getting narrower however squeezing down toward my head i scraped several times and could feel the trickle of blood from my crown it was getting hard to breathe the air stale and finally my shoulders wedged and i could go no farther utterly dark no hope ahead and as i patted with my hands i could feel nothing but enclosing rock i probed with my rifle which only confirmed the passage constricted still more far too small to wriggle through cuvier bumped up against the soles of my boots and grunted whats wrong ethan im stuck i couldnt get the room to even go backward this isnt the way out theres no air we have to go back to that little chasm we crawled over and go down go down merde im longing to go up we dont have a choice collapsed behind and too narrow ahead the only way out is descent i think the others groaned but what choice did we have cuvier had to drag me back a couple of feet by my ankles to free my shoulders enough to wriggle backward and then we all inched laboriously the way wed come sweating and panting our weapons occasionally catching and jamming us fultons feet were now leading im going down the demon hole the inventor finally announced at least i feel a current of air hot as a bellows and so we followed one by one my own legs slipping into the unknown chasm and my body following once again by bracing my back on one side of the shaft and my feet on the other i could descend now i smell sulfur fulton called the mouth of hades maybe we did suffocate in that sarcophagus no this is worse than the real hell i think there wed have the devil to guide us down i went groping for a grip worried that id slip and fall on my companions my sword and rifle were a constant trial but i refused to leave them then the shaft began to pitch at an angle and we felt a floor of sorts sloping steeply downward we slipped down it blind bracing with our feet this time with me in the rear its getting hotter fulton reported look smith said excitedly is that light we did see a glow in a normal night we wouldnt have even noticed its feebleness but after what seemed an eternity in complete darkness it shone like a reddish beacon yet when we came to the source we cringed there was a crevice giving a view far below and from it came the reflected glow of something red we were very hot now and realized we were in a venous system tied to the heart of this ancient volcano hells front door cuvier muttered were peering into the bowels of the earth were seeing what few men have ever seen smith added pray we just see it and not feel it as well we need to light the candle to take a look fulton said theres more than one way to go here so we balled up more lint struck sparksa mighty flash to our lightstarved eyesand got it burning long enough to reignite the wick of our stub how hope flooded back from even that tendril of feeble light we were in a junction of sorts one crevice leading down to that eerie glow and two tunnels going on one level and one aimed up for gods sake lets climb said smith wearily cuvier sniffed no this middle one has the breeze of air we must take it he blew out the wick on our precious candle put it in his mouth once more and this time took the lead by crawling on how long we spent in hades i cant really say it seemed like forever though was probably only hours my hands were raw my mouth cotton and my clothes in shreds on and on we crawled blind mice hope kept alive only by the whisper of air almost imperceptibly however the tunnel began rising again in places we squeezed through like corks in a bottle and in others our arms thrashed out into voids we couldnt tell the extent of our fear was that we might pitch headlong into some new chasm but that didnt happen either and at length we finally heard noise ahead like wind blowing through trees is that a machine fulton asked the sea said cuvier were coming to a sea cave i think i see a glow if i havent gone crazy im not a good swimmer warned smith at this point drowning is preferable for the last two hundred meters we could hear the echo of rolling waves and a slow blue light grew like a turquoise dawn and then at last the tunnel opened up and we came into a high domed cave illuminated from below by the glow of water and from above by a crevice in the ceiling it was from there that the air wed been breathing since the sarcophagus presumably came a pale dawn glowed through the crack its opening was unobtainable however thirty feet overhead in a vaulted roof we had no way of climbing beneath it was a pool from the sea the water breathing in and out like a sleeping giant we splashed in the salty coolness but it was only momentary relief we were all very thirsty how can we get up there i asked we could shout for help said smith shout theyre as apt to shoot us as send a rope down weve come all this way to be stuck in a pot its too bright in here for that crack of light alone i said lookyou can see more light at the far side of this pool the open mediterranean is just beyond this grotto lads and all weve got to do is swim through the underwater part and pop out the other side how far is it asked smith well i dont know maybe we should just shout for help he tried again no lookdawn is coming its getting brighter we need to be out and hidden before our pursuers see us ill swim first if i dont come back ill either have succeeded or drowned well theres reassurance drown there or die of thirst and hunger here i said and shrugged id faced this dilemma before lets go while we have strength left to die swiftly and so i dove it was probably a dunking of only about fifteen or twenty meters but it seems twice that when you dont know my rifle was an anchor the sea dark and the wave surge pushed me backward but i held my breath swam with all my might and finally saw the surface silver from the sky beyond i broke clean in a wavechurned inlet at the base of red lava cliffs air i grasped a rock floating and gasping and at length cuvier and fulton popped up too smiths hesitant doesnt like the water much for an englishman here hold my rifle im rested now so i swam back through the cave to the grotto the distance seeming a fraction of what it had been before and took his blunderbuss from him its just like being born i coaxed the whole world is on the other side i led the awkward geologist to the edge of the grotto taught him to take deep breaths and then we dunked and swam through me leading him by the arm and coming up just as the sky was pinking to our left which must be east smith blew like a whale and coughed i glanced around from the direction of the sunrise wed come out somewhere on thiras southern coast now what asked fulton we cant even climb up we go home cuvier said lookisnt that our ship chapter seventeen draguts xebec appeared to be anchored in a most unlikely place off the steep unprotected stretch of thiras southern shore had our luck finally turned the vessel was quiet the sun just breaking the rim of the sea and no one spotted us as we swam the hundred meters to its bobbing hull fulton cupped his mouth to shout but i instinctively cautioned him i wanted to get on board first with our weapons i caught the anchor line wrapped my feet and hands around it and pulled myself up to the bow the crew was curled amidships asleep and the lone watchman our helmsman was focused primarily on getting seeds out of a pomegranate at a signal my companions followed me up i handed fulton my soaked longrifle pulled out my nicked and blunted rapier and whispered to smith and cuvier to brandish their weapons i trusted no one at this point then we lightly ran for the wheel the helmsman turning just in time to find the tip of my weapon at his eye the other muhammadans came awake when we stood over them dragut instinctively reached for a pistol as my sword dipped to stay his hand he stopped looking at us in confusion we stood like a cluster of halfdrowned rats dripping filthy torn and menacing fulton holding my rifle smith his blunderbuss and cuvier his dueling pistols the fact that none of our wet guns would fire did not immediately register you come out of the sea our captain managed aye i said its been a long night and were in a bit of a hurry but i dont understand wasnt i to pick you up back at the quay on the other side of the island why are you here with weapons drawn i looked about heres a better question why are you anchored here in the open sea away from any sheltered harbor dragut looked to the shore as if an answer might be found there the weather was calm so we anchored for the night to wait for the mornings breeze he finally said if you were a sailor you would understand he blinked but where did you come from weve been poking about we need to get back to venice as soon as possible can you take us there ah then you have found what you were looking for he sat up eagerly his eyes flicking from one to the other of us looking for some sign of treasure the man was a mercenary like me we hope now he seemed to gain more certainty then of course abdul constantine up up come you lazy dogs let us raise the anchor for our passengers he glanced to the shore again there is no time to lose he looked back to me but why do you hold your sword on your friend hamidou greece makes me nervous you are under draguts protection now come come take your ease have some dates and wine get out of your sodden clothes you look exhausted you can sleep in the sun therere some ships on the other side of the island we should avoid i think and no one is swifter and more elusive than hamidou come put your weapons away get some rest and then you can tell me your adventures out of the sea ha i had my sodden shirt half off before i remembered the parchment pasted by seawater onto my back i hesitated about showing it but there was no privacy aboard and if i was to salvage anything i had to dry my artifact out cuvier peeled it off my skin and we examined the old document the writing had smeared but was still legible dragut glanced our way as we uncurled it but made no comment the anchor came up the sails filled and we began to move our captain had turned to watch the cliffs of the island what are you looking for i asked shepherds who might betray our direction for a coin he snapped an order and a long redandgreen pennant was raised unfurling and flapping in the wind whats that a flag of the barbary pirates it will confuse anyone ashore about our purpose and indeed now i did see men waving or shaking their fists as we gathered headway they will be confused by my cleverness no captain is smarter than hamidou dragut none swifter or more quiet yes you are lucky that you are paying me i watched uneasily are those the men pursuing us who knows now they will report to their superiors perhaps but report the wrong thing no i didnt trust dragut or anyone else but the idea of getting away from thira seemed a good one his crew certainly seemed cheered by the idea so we staked our prize on the deck to dry determined to keep an eye on it i had some food famished enough to gobble and resolved to stand sentry while the others slept when i woke it was dark again id slept the entire day away a moon was up lighting the sea and the tops of the waves were silver it was still warm pleasantly so and the rigging creaked as the xebec cut through the sea i looked at the horizon but land had fallen away in all directions i felt for the parchment to my relief it was where id left it so i rolled it into my ragged jacket then i drank to slake my thirst and crawled over my companions to find dragut our captain was standing by the bowsprit studying the stars im a poor celestial navigator and admire people who can make sense of the spangle where are we i asked quietly he turned the whites of his eyes the most visible thing in his dark face on our way home he said lookthe sea is as soft as a mother this night the sail is billowed like a breast and the moon is milk a good sign i think of what that we are all finding what were looking for youre a man who is always searching no it seems so and others always seem to be searching for me yes in venice and the island why is that i shook my head i know nothing worth knowing now a flash of teeth yet you have things worth knowing perhaps yes i have seen your parchment and noticed your urgency of escape what is so important about it i dont know i havent read it i dont even know if i can read it which is why you swim to my ship and climb aboard sword unsheathed guns displayed wet and bloody well i am a simple sailor grateful for a calm night go get more rest american and tell me someday if our little adventure was worth it cuvier helped me decipher the parchment the next day it was medieval latin as might be expected from a templar document and badly aged and smudged hamidou gave us paper and pen to write down our translation i feared the seawater had ruined it but we made out just enough to come to a disappointing conclusion this has nothing to do with atlantis ancient weapons or archimedes the french savant murmured it in fact appeared to be an account of a roman catholic monks pilgrimage to the holy land as well as a series of standard prayers from the roman church there was nothing about secrets knights templar or underground tunnels perhaps its a code i suggested i seem to stumble across them all the time hail mary is a code cuvier replied im afraid ethan gage that you led us through the gate of hades for a book of prayer he gave me back the parchment of interest to historians and theologians perhaps but no more remarkable than a hymnal i turned the parchment sideways and upside down inspected the back and held it up to the sun nothing but why would they seal this in plaster i asked in frustration that portion of the wall was newer im certain of it perhaps to reinforce their mud there may have been something of real value down there they had removed and were patching it was an interesting rumor but weve investigated it and found nothing fini thats how science worksthe experiments that do not succeed are often as important as those that do weve discharged our obligation to napoleon and escaped with our lives which itself is a miracle now we go home emptyhanded again by the beard of the dwarf i hate underground places people dig them to squirrel away things all the time but i rarely seem to emerge with anything valuable nor had i discovered anything on thira that provided a clue to the fate of astiza which id been hoping for given osiriss wager in paris the entire expedition had proved pointless all four of us were disappointed fulton grew bored when cuvier started translating the apostles creed and instead stood at the stern looking about at the sea and then curiously at the sun what time do you think it is he finally asked us midmorning and the sun rises in the east does it not im hardly certain of anything anymore but ill hazard that i said and so our solar orb should be on our starboard side as we sail north should it not to our right aye which by my reckoning means we are sailing due south directly away from venice instead of toward it we leaped up what i think our doughty captain is going entirely the wrong way hamidou i called to the bow which way are we going home i told you he called cheerfully whose home youve got us pointed south you idiot dont you have a compass dragut looked at the sky in amazement and then shouted at one of his crewmen an argument broke out finally with a push the man was driven to scamper up the mast like a monkey bare feet climbing on the rings that held the sail to scan the horizon as if looking for an alternate sun no new course was set he released a cord and a narrow white banner unfurled to wave in the breeze what was that for at last the man pointed excitedly and began shouting in arabic then a chorus of shouts went up from all the crew and they stood on the gunwales to peer at the horizon whats going on smith asked dragut pointed off our bow and stern pirates and indeed we now noticed dark sails cresting the horizon many men i think very dangerous what where the devil have you brought us wait i put about he snapped orders and the helmsman turned but then another crewman shouted and the wheel spun back an argument broke out the bow slid into the teeth of the breeze and sails began to luff and we coasted to a stop wallowing in the waves now the crew was shouting at each other even more while breaking out guns swords and pikes meanwhile we drifted rigging creaking and banging my companions and i looked at each other hope evaporating like dew look to your guns i said resignedly enemy sail were bearing down on us like boulders accelerating downhill our own weapons had been dried and cleaned that morning and so we loaded even as our crew seemed impossibly clumsy at swinging the booms and turning the rudder to get out of irons at the time we needed them most theyd panicked into incompetence i thought you were the best sailor in the mediterranean it seems i am cursed by an incompetent crew dragut muttered i thought you had fooled them with your barbary banner he looked aloft maybe we still can do you think thats the bunch that was after us at thira fulton asked how would they know to chase us here smith said my friends i think it is wisest if we surrender dragut suddenly counseled they are drawing within artillery range and we have no longrange guns to reply my ship is swift and light but it is small and cant stand up to a pounding i thought you could outsail any ship out here not a barbary corsair were a muslim crew perhaps they will have mercy but were not muslim were christian well be enslaved true but we can save your lives thus does hamidou look after his passengers smoke bloomed from the hull of one of the corsairs there was a shriek of shot and a waterspout erupted where a cannon ball dropped just fifty yards off our stern my heart began to hammer the trouble with sea fights is that theres nowhere to hide no cuvier declared looking more like a determined grenadier than a zoologist were going to fight beasts of prey look for easy victims so do bullies but scratch the lion and hell back off looking for easier meat lets crouch beneath the bulwark wait until they draw near and then give a broadside with your light guns and our arms it will throw them into confusion if we can cut up their rigging maybe we can escape youre willing to risk your life dragut asked id rather sell it here than in a slave market you are mad christians but very brave too all right he snapped orders to his crewmen you europeans take your place just by the bulwark there where the protection is best we will ready behind you with matches for the cannon ill watch for the precise moment and we will rise as one and fire every shot must hit to throw them into disorder then you must help us with the lines to draw off and escape ever notice how organizers put followers in the front rank and them behind but it didnt seem the time to argue choreography the pirate corsairs were coming on fast lateensailed vessels larger than the xebec but just as swiftly built and crammed with men as we crouched i could peek through a hawser hole at the mob of them stripped to the waist except for earrings and armlets of gold some were bearded and turbaned others were shaved bald muscles bulging painted with tattoos or decorated with great mustaches all of them were roaring and clashing steel for our maximum demoralization were these the ships id seen at thira the animal smell of them came across the water plus oil and spices the smell of africa hold your fire until the last moment dragut counseled remember we get only one volley we must wait until they are close as possible damnation smith muttered i felt less confined in a canal ditch your blunderbuss will give them pause i encouraged georges fire both your pistols at once fulton youve lost your pipes do you need a gun ive got an ax to cut their boarding lines he said and maybe we can swing the boom to knock some of them back a pendulum can accumulate tremendous power just what archimedes would advise i turned back to hamidou ready when you are he nodded encouragingly and laid his cutlass on the flat of his hand the nearest corsair loomed to fill all my view its sails almost black its crew balanced on the railing twitchy as colts steady i murmured id already picked a target for my longrifle a big brute of a pirate who looked to be their captain then because of the time it took to reload id slash at any boarders with my rapier wed sting like a scorpion when you give the word dragut i tensed ready to rise and fire it was then that i felt the annoyingly familiar press of a gun barrel at the nape of my neck and the word is surrender ethan gage he said cheerfully i realized id never told him my whole name and yet he knew it the devious bastard take your finger from your trigger please and lower your longrifle to the deck so that i do not have to shatter your spine i glanced sideways my companions also had guns to their heads held by our own crewmen wed been betrayed from beginning to end had the venetian gondoliers simply been herding us to this treacherous vessel from the start our arms thumped on the deck then there was a crash of wood as the two ships mated and a shout as a rank of halfnaked unwashed pirates poured across their bare feet lighting like cats in seconds we were yanked backward our arms wrenched and our feet bound dragut looked at me with amazement you didnt get off even a single shot i expected more from the hero of acre and mortefontaine when i finally do ill aim at you alas i think the time for that is past what base treachery is this cried smith i believe gentlemen that we have once more been led into a trap by our esteemed guide ethan gage said cuvier but why not just seize us yourselves back at thira i asked our captain it was you who had the rapier to my eye not vice versa we didnt really expect you to escape from the island and because i wanted the pleasure of seizing you myself cried a new voice a lithe new pirate swung on a line from the enemy poop and lightly landed on ours this one beardless and dressed in sea boots greatcoat and bloused trousers that were a century back in style as braided and gaudy as a caribbean buccaneers the newcomer wore a magnificent broadbrimmed plumed hat and held a jeweled sword in a finefingered hand a broken ominously broken second sword was tucked in a wide leather belt along with twin pistols as the buccaneer hopped down to the xebecs main deck some of the other scoundrels flinched as they made room and we soon saw why with a leap a black hound cleared the gap between the two vessels and followed his master onto our deck landing with a heavy thump with feet skittering for new purchase this muscular beast was a shorthaired thicksnouted mastiff ugly with slobber and hanging jowls a dog that bristled at the sight of us and growled with the purr of hells cerberus its eyes were yellow its flanks scarred its tail chewed and the whole package was uglier than the fleas that inhabited it the owner plucked off the feathered headgear and gave a sweeping bow a torrent of auburn ringlets cascaded down around our captors shouldersa womanand she gave a seductive smile i remembered all too well even as my heart fell like a barometer in a hurricane i told you we werent through ethan i gaped in shock revulsion and fear frozen by that stillbeautiful face that athletically graceful figure those long white fingers holding a blade that sparkled silver how vividly did i now remember the broken sword tucked in her belt which her brother had shattered on my longrifle she was as bewitching as i remembered too the high cheekbones the feline gaze the wicked dance of her eyes it was aurora somerset the english aristocrat who had tupped and tormented me on the north american frontier aurora was all i could manage stupidly my companions looked at us curiously ive joined the barbary pirates she said as if that werent obvious enough i thought it would bring us together part two chapter eighteen aurora somerset was one of the loveliest women id ever met she was also one of the most dangerous the most perverted and the most insane a murderess who killed my indian lover namida tried to slay my voyageur friend pierre and left me alive in the north american wilderness only because she wanted to follow me to new secrets as threatened here she was fully recovered from her trauma and apparently in charge of an illtempered dog and several shiploads of feral pirates most of them pledged to a religion that dictated women stay subservient and out of sight well nobody is consistent my companions were merely dumbfounded i knew enough to be terrified id met aurora on my journey west to seek norse artifacts with the late magnus bloodhammer i was predictably blinded by her beauty and made a fool of myself as men are wont to do the upshot was my capture near torture escape into the wild and final showdown in which i killed the man who was both auroras half brother and her lover lord cecil somerset she and i did our best to kill each other too but in the end i was wounded and she was insane and the only solace i had from that nightmare was the likelihood that the wilderness would swallow her up and id never see her again time and distance had let me believe that now as inexorably persistent as the rite itself she was back one might expect trauma to rob her of her prettiness and harden her features instead she was as physically alluring as ever an ocean goddess of tumbling hair green eyes pursed lips and a cleanliness out of all proportion to her environment venus emerging from the sea had she been primping before she swung aboard there was an eerie changelessness about her that made me suspect some pact with the devil so perfect was her skin so athletic her grace as she whirled on deck so bright her maniacal eyes she was immortal i feared an antaeus who only grew stronger with every defeat aurora somerset was the reason id reformed i thought youd tired of me i managed shed had nearly a year to dream up fresh torments and lord knows the girl had a better imagination than i did i felt sick at what this reunion would lead to she walked to me cutlass lifted like a serpents silver tongue to hover under my chin as the ship rolled in the waves her lips curled in a twist of faint contempt her eyes intense as a jaguars while her dog eyed me for breakfast youre a hard man to forget ethan gage so durable so ruthless so careless so stupid ive been following you anticipating you marveling at you and got that signet ring i discovered into the hands of the french and fouche with the expectation they would turn to the wayward american to determine what it means you are ever so predictable well you can give the ring back and now youve brought company her eyes danced with calculation as she eyed my savants and i didnt know if she was dreaming of bedding them or torturing them probably both you read something in north america that brought you to thira and now youve found something im betting that i and my allies are looking for allies you have friends id managed to annoy her more than you know you must mean the lunatic egyptian rite that and the tripoli corsairs our newest comrades their bashaw saw the advantage of ancient secrets long before bonaparte and fouche she nodded to the assembly of pirates as motley a bunch of thieves and miscreants as can be found outside a parliament they had the hygiene of sewer rats and the disposition of a wounded bull but then im used to bad company she turned to dragut what did they find a manuscript my lady so our captain had been in her employ from the beginning ready to pluck us from pursuit in venice and from caves at thira this rendezvous had been planned for months why get dirty when ethan gage will crawl through the mouth of hades for you a manuscript what does it say i wouldnt presume to read it before you he pointed the american has it where is it she demanded of me give it up your manners havent improved since our last time together or your impudence come turn it over the ring too her monster of a dog started barking with the volume of a wolf pack and i flinched despite myself why do people insist on bringing along their pets i considered trying to hurl the parchment into the sea but given what it said what was the harm here what youve followed me for seven thousand miles for it might improve you there is something to be said for the upbringing of the high bred she was it seemed literate in latin apparently young ladies of the english nobility learn more than just shooting and sadism she read for a moment her pirates shuffling like a restless classroom and then looked at me in disbelief are you trying to make me a fool thats all we found aurora dig down yourself if you dont believe me but the ancient rooms under akrotiri were as empty as a beggars stomach except for this i hoped it was a treasure toothis is hardly what i came forbut i could have saved myself the trouble by simply buying a preachers pamphlet outside the palais royal if there was ever anything of value down there i suspect knights templar took it centuries ago were both chasing ghosts she stood a moment debating whether to believe me finally she threw the parchment at my feet i picked it up it was i supposed a souvenir of thira she kept the ring very well and yes a wasted trip for you and your friends but not necessarily for me she turned to her shipmates well sell them as slaves to that they gave a hearty cheer which meant they got a share from hocking us everybody loves a profit wheres his gun she then asked there was some discomfort among draguts men as my longriflethe same one that had killed cecil somersetwas brought out that weapon is mine she snapped you can have the others its scuffed and nicked but a fine piece one of the pirates objected its ours to take not yours under barbary law it slew my brother give it over the sailor with the scars of more than a few fights wasnt about to buckle easily to this womans whim he turned to his captain hamidou we captured them she has no right dragut was shaking his head and as the poor sailor turned back in anger debating just how truculent to be auroras monster dog sprang it was a blur of black snarling like a lion and the man was down yelling as the dog bit his hands and face pinning him with furious weight the rifle skittered away but no one dared touch it the other pirates instinctively jumped back the poor victim writhed his thrashing arm trying to get to his knife while the other hand clawed at the dogs face but then the hound got past his guard and plunged his snout at the poor devils throat its big black head thrashed as if it had been given a rag doll and blood from a severed artery made a jet that shot three feet in the air men were at once shouting pleading betting and laughing illbred ruffians that they were the pirate twitched and jerked a final time and died a red pool spread like a blot sokar heel the mastiff backed off jaws foamy with blood and saliva it was growling looking at me with its yellow eyes trembling slightly dragut stooped to pick up my rifle and gave it to the demented woman his weapon my lady she hefted it with the same air of possessive ownership i remembered from america ignoring the baleful looks of the dead mans friends we set course for tripoli she told dragut and then back to me well talk again after youve time to ponder your situation while locked in the hold and if you dont renew our partnership then omar the dungeon master will make sure that this time now that i truly own you youll not hold anything back omar the what hes one whose name is best not spoken aloud dragut said and shoved me toward the xebecs shallow hold or ever experienced he turned to the others the blunderbuss and dueling pistols are mine i and my three companions were hurled from our pampered position in the stern down into the sail and water locker amidships our bed became hemp sails and our furniture the water casks lashed atop the greasy bilge the only light checkered down from the wooden grating overhead our momentarily helpless xebec swiftly got under way the lean and the rush of water announcing we were on the way to tripoli the afternoon sun soon turned our cell into a stuffy oven wed gone from seeming triumph to certain doom piracy and slavery might seem an odd base for an economy but in fact have worked so well for the barbary states sonamed for the barbarians who occupied north africa after the fall of the roman empire that theyve had little incentive to develop anything else why work when you can steal with impunity by raiding the weakest fringes of the mediterranean basin the barbary corsairs keep citystates like tripoli supplied with cheap male labor and pretty harem women their richest captives can be ransomed off to buy whatever else is needed the ships and towns of the most powerful nations such as britain france and spain are avoided out of wary fear in the english admiral norborough had burned tripolis fleet as a warning weaker nations however find it more costeffective to pay tribute than to try to catch the swift corsairs or assault their heavily fortified african cities that tribute is not just money but ships cannon and powder that turn north african ports into bristling hedgehogs of defiance cuvier might hope for ransom from the french government that had elevated him but smith fulton and i had neither rich families nor high rank that meant we were almost certain to die manacled overworked underfed and rotten with disease i explained all this as gently as i could what if we defy them fulton sought to clarify their favorite discipline is the bastinado where they tie the ankles hoist up the feet and flail them with two hundred strokes some slaves are crippled for life if the beating is severe enough to render a man useless hes suspended from hooks on the city walls to die of exposure then the pirates sail out to capture more theres no mercy sometimes you can gain better treatment by conversion to islam a cultural surrender called taking the turban then give me a koran to swear to unfortunately you have to prove your submission through circumcision fulton studied me to see if i was joking which i was not every time i think you cant make things any worse your leadership becomes even more incompetent he finally said all is not entirely lost i was i suppose our morale officer what do you mean we have the american navy on our side i crawled to the grating and stood as upright as i could in our cramped chamber my face checkered by the light shining down hamidou i must give you warning i called the captain came over to stand on the grate casting a shadow silence slave before i cut off your tongue and more besides he was not at all the jolly skipper whod sailed us down the adriatic and once again i remembered that i needed to modify my habitually optimistic appraisal of people i noticed hed tucked cuviers dueling pistols in his belt and no doubt was polishing smiths blunderbuss as well the united states has sent a naval squadron in response to yussef karamanlis declaration of war i warned robert and i are american citizens if youre caught with us aboard it could mean the gallows or worse im only trying to warn you he laughed so you think i should let you go it might be best for you as well as us we could put in a good word he pretended to consider no if an american frigate could catch me which it cant i will throw you americans to the sharks cut out the tongues of the two other infidels and swear that yankees were never aboard this is more satisfying i think hamidou we put our trust in you yes better to trust in me than your own navy your ships draw too much water to get close to the shoals of tripoli and we slip in and out of your blockade like laces through a corset accordingly the new commander morris has abandoned the attempt and is hiding behind britains skirts in malta your squadron is already a failure gage and all of barbary is laughing at the united statesand soon they will laugh at you as well allah rewards the faithful and punishes the coward as you can now see do not waste your time threatening me try to think of something useful to say to lessen your torment from omar the dungeon master he translated our conversation for his crew with enough editing to provide hearty comedy why the prospect of my torture arouses such amusement ive never understood but it seems a universal reaction among my enemies i am as ive said affableexcept when i have to shoot particularly horrid peopleand dont in my opinion deserve the rejoicing that always seems to accompany my capture that didnt seem to work i reported to the others unnecessarily since theyd heard every word we werent exactly counting on you assured smith i took out the parchment id kept after aurora threw it back this book of prayer hasnt reformed these muhammadans in the slightest i held it under the grating to look at its latin script again still puzzled why anyone would conceal it in the wall of buried ruins a hundred feet underground had i missed some kind of code of the kind wed deciphered amid the dakota indians in distant north america the dimness of the hold and pocks of light forced me to peer even more intently at what seemed a worthless old scrap of animal skin it was then that i detected the faintest of curved lines like a whisper beneath the latin script moving the parchment beneath the grating i began to notice other tracings almost invisible if you blinked cuvier could you take a look at this i think theres something more to this parchment the french savant sighed heaved himself up from where he had slumped between the barrels and crouchwalked to join me under the grating following my finger he squinted at the script bored at first but then more intent he took the scrap in his own hands and held it this way and that under the light finally he pulled me away and whispered in the shadows i think its a palimpsest thank god for that a what in the middle ages writing material was in short supply and parchment durable to reuse it theyd scrape off the old writing and copy some new text over it perhaps what the knights meant to leave was not this list of prayers but whatever was first under them i began to have a glimmer of hope knowledge is power and wed need all the power we could muster against aurora and her pirates i scratched with my nail at the parchment smearing some ink then how can we get the new writing off cuvier stayed my hand let me think for a moment he exhibited that look of pursed concentration that made him look so smart then he turned to the others gentlemen biology teaches that we must breach a water cask so we can drink all we can hold why asked smith because we have to do our very best to urinate on ethans discovery slave masters arent in the habit of letting their captives drink their fill of anything so we had to take matters into our own hands or feet we had no way to open the cask bungs given that wed been robbed of tools but fulton felt in the gloom until he found a water keg wet from slight leakage he had us quietly shift its companions until we could bring the barrel out if three of us stand on top and push off the deck beams above we might be able to compress the staves to the point that they leak the fourth can catch the flow catch it with what i asked i suggest our boots said smith i had to bail a leaky canal boat once and found my footwear quite adequate for the purpose i can hardly bear to put my feet in my shoes let alone drink from them then we can forgo the experiment and spend the rest of our short lives in slavery and torture you have a point bottoms up we balanced on the barrel pressed down forced a leak collected the overflow in each of our bootswe werent friends enough to share trust meand drank as much as we could it was satisfying to steal from dragut even if it was only water we drank until we were bloated and could make our own water a timeconsuming task in the heat whose shoe should catch the piss fulton asked ethans of course smith replied wait i objected why not yours because i didnt concoct this expedition besides youre the one who found a palimpsest i did persuade them to take a vote but it went unanimously against me so our production of urine was collected in my footwear my companions taking great satisfaction in draining their bladders there then we began to scrub the parchment with urine slowly sloughing the medieval ink away to reveal whatever was underneath it was a map i saw with a crosshatching of lines and symbols atop a chart that looked like the outline of a coast a bay with a narrow neck was shown and an arcing line like a fence or boundary crossed the interior the templars or whoever had plastered that wall had left not a book of prayer but a guide to something or somewhere just possibly it had something to do with this ancient weaponthis heat ray of archimedesthat wed seen painted unfortunately there were no words on the map giving no indication what it depicted id produced a urinesoaked treasure map of a place we couldnt identify why are there no words fulton asked its for men who already know where theyre going said cuvier smith studied it in the dim light it looks familiar somehow youre our map man smith id say volcanic terrain by the look of the coastline but that bay could be anywhere not thira said cuvier there are no bays like that i think youve actually found something gage fulton said decipher it man im fairly certain those lines and numbers mean something yes unfortunately im quite poor at puzzles i really shouldnt be a treasure hunter at all and then a shadow fell on the grating gage aurora will see you now chapter nineteen ive been known to positively scamper to the side of an inviting woman but i left our dank hold in dread at the thought of conversing with lady somerset beauty she might be but i still bore the calf scar where shed stabbed me with an indian spear her new pet looked ready to chew on my other shank and i was in no mood for witty repartee about our past nonetheless her flagship was tacking to pick me up and apparently i was expected to leap aboard with lusty panache but dragut took one whiff of me and yanked me back to wash by allah did you miss the bucket or piss yourself in fear i just smell like a pirate hamidou i was stripped and doused with bracing seawater then i pulled my tired clothing back on combed my hair with fingers as best i could balanced on the rail while the two ships drew abreast of each other and seized a line swung from a boom on auroras vessel i did feel some pirate dash and saw how the trade had its attractions but then i looked about the flagship auroras vessel isis was bigger than draguts with heavier artillery and a larger crew but exhibited the housekeeping of an ohio flatboat lines were uncoiled brass had curdled green canvas and crates were lashed haphazardly and bits of food and empty bottles rolled in the corners offduty pirates snored next to gun tackle chickens pecked at grain scattered under a lashed longboat an american frigate would turn this to matchwood in minutes i decided too bad there wasnt one about i know its not your habit to eat pork but have you thought of keeping pigs i addressed my captors youve already built a marvelous sty silence slave i got lashed across the shoulders for my wit and then a pockfaced bosun shoved me to the door of the stern cabin guarded by flanking blacks with the muscled bulk of buffaloes the sentries were haughty as mamelukes and regarded me with disdain bordering on disbelief they must have thought their mistress could attract better didnt have time to dress they wrinkled their noses checked me for weapons and shoved me through ill tell you what shes like i called back to her goblins the corsairs cabin high enough to stand upright in was pleasantly cool the stern window glass was open and a breeze filtered through grilled wooden shutters a persian carpet covered the deck and more carpets and pillows were piled in the peripheries to provide some oriental opulence aurora herself lay like cleopatra in a hammock that swung to the rhythm of the waves shed shed her fighting clothes for a linen shift that did little to conceal the voluptuousness of her figure an emerald necklace of spanish design draped her fine neck and the matching earrings picked up the color of her eyes her fingers were bright with rings and enough bracelets armbands and anklets hung on her limbs to make her a candidate for an anchor should we have an emergency despite my knowledge that she was a hateful harridan her seductive allure persisted her lips pursed as she sipped from a golden goblet damnation i felt aroused but aurora also held a pistol and was as different from astiza as a cobra from a nightingale it didnt help that her mastiff watched me suspiciously from one corner its growl distant thunder sokar be quiet aurora ordered sokar if i recalled was another egyptian god of the underworld this waisthigh monster fit the part of nether demon the hold i threw you into is a preview of one way our new relationship can continue she began without preamble always the brisk dominatrix when the veil slipped i can assure you the dungeons of tripoli are far worse and the life expectancy of a karamanli slave is shorter than that of a fleet sailor during a yellow jack plague you never have enough food or water as a slave its impossible to keep clean and your weakened body breaks out into hideous boils and pustules whips and canes raise welts that grow red and leak pus and your hair falls out in clumps your joints ache your teeth rot your tongue swells and your vision goes milky sounds like the clap after a night in bed with you her goblet jerked hand whitening and i could tell she wasnt accustomed to candor any pirates who challenged her were probably at the bottom of the mediterranean and i suppose i risked that too yet in some strange way i fascinated her i had no idea why or we can rule the world she finally managed aurora youve done well for yourself since our last meetingi believed you entirely mad and likely to die in the north american wilderness and yet here you are a regular admiralbut i dont think youre on the brink of ruling the world capturing me is not on the same level as outdueling nelson or napoleon but capturing you is a step toward finding the mirror of archimedes thats what this is all about the mythical toy of an eccentric old greek that toymaker invented an early form of calculus almost two thousand years before newton calculated the value of pi closer than the pharaohs he was so excited when he discovered the principle of displacement in his bath that he cried eureka and ran naked through the streets most famous people have a flair for publicity im too modest to ever succeed his mirror if harnessed again could incinerate any battle fleet sent against it it would beam its death ray endlessly never needing to be reloaded we could pillage the merchant fleets of any nation and theyd be helpless to retaliate against us in time we could mount the devices on ships and burn any port or fort we went against batteries of guns would explode ammunition wagons would be torn apart sailors and soldiers could be flung screaming and burning into the sea such imagination aurora but all that was two millennia ago ancient history eh unless the mirror was saved and eventually stored by someone like the templars in a place like thira it wasnt i checked maybe you didnt look long enough or maybe you know more than you admit come lie beside me ethan she wiggled its a broad hammock actually ive sworn off women i think youll understand why better than anyone you begged for it once that was before you killed all my friends and i did shoot your cousin i believe i mean brother or half brotherby the end i wasnt quite sure what to believe about cecil all in all we havent had an easy time of it those people would be alive if youd shared your mission as i asked at the beginning wed be partners making the world a better place with the wisdom of the egyptian rite have you noticed ethan that every time you try to do the right thing it accomplishes the wrong thing you have no love no money no home yet i can offer all that and more tell us what you know and join a cause bigger than yourself make something of your life sokar rumbled again just to remind me what the choice really was then he went back to gnawing and cracking a bone probably from the last sailor who turned aurora down i walked to a small sea desk piled with books and scrolls about ancient history alchemy and magic say what you will about the egyptian rite they were certainly readers aurora im as useless as i always was you saw what we discovered on thira a medieval prayer guide we found old ruins as vacant as versailles and managed to cave in the ceiling youre entirely right im a complete failure and youd save yourself time and trouble by chasing someone more successful for once yet youre the one always one step ahead of usin the pyramid in jerusalem in the american frontier and now on thira you want to know as fiercely as we do ethan and just who is this we how do you get membership in such a cabal of lunatics and scoundrels anyway do you have to apply is it a question of genealogy we are serious seekers of the past who by possession of ancient wisdom deserve to rule we choose to defy convention and elect to follow occult knowledge anywhere it might lead we trade ordinary conformity for wisdom perfect harmony will be achieved by having everyone in the world answer to us to you and me ethan there was something odd here why would aurora somerset english aristocrat and renegade explorer want anything more than to pick up on the tortures where shed left off if i honestly possessed some useful knowledge i could see her pretending temporary interest until she got whatever she needed and could safely slit my throat but why suggest we had a chance of partnership i couldnt stand the girl and certainly she had no warmer feelings for me shed already seen my parchment of prayers and didnt know yet that it might contain something of value no there was something else going on some wickedness afoot i couldnt even guess at if theres one thing im poor at its harmony she was becoming impatient her recline in the hammock no longer languorous her eyes eclipsing from the seductive to the dangerous youd rather rot as a slave let my friends go then maybe ill try to help with this mirror of yours my crew has to be paid ethan your friends are a type to ransom but you can save yourself think of yourself escape by yourself it was annoying she thought so little of my character that she assumed such a course would appeal to meand even more annoying that she was half right here i was single rootless an expatriate from my own country in the employ of another caught up in the web of my old lover and peeing on grubby sheepskin in hopes the latest sojourn underground wasnt entirely worthless what did i ever do but think of myself and yet it sounded hollow and ashen to hear it come from aurora somerset the kind of craven selfpreservation that came from men not yet grown up the rare times id shown character and backbone i felt better for it so maybe it was time to make it a habit not just to reform outwardly but to start a construction project on my soul lord knows im good at resolutions if not always quite as fine in carrying them out but im not by myself am i ive got three good friends captive on draguts ship and theyre imperiled solely because of my unfortunate history with you no aurora i think ill choose their company in that stifling hold over yours in the hammock and enjoy it better too the fact is youve captured impoverished savants not merchant captains and we arent worth the trouble of a ransom note then youll die as slaves shed rolled out of her horizontal throne now and stood trembling with frustration her eyes green fire and by venus the form she cast in her linen shift would tempt a pope i dont know how those who vow celibacy do it frankly the translucent gauze seemed to make her even more naked than if she wore nothing at all and i wanted that flesh despite myself yet she was a devils temptress a fire i dared not touch youll never get archimedes mirror it would be like giving a keg of gunpowder to a pyromaniac you wont get your weapon you wont get me and you wont get whatever twisted goal youre after youll get this cabin a crew of muslim cutthroats biscuit bilgewater and a lonely life seeking the peace you threw away you know nothing her dog jumped up and barked making me jump again and i longed for my tomahawk to play fetch with the mastiff exactly i managed so sell me drown me or jail me but please just let me be a wish that neither of us could keep as it turned out chapter twenty from the sea tripoli looked inviting as a lions mouth dragut brought us up to the deck to watch our approach so that we could fully understand the futility of rescue the heat of north africa clawed as we neared land the sky yellow above the desert and milk blue over the gardens and date palms that surrounded the citys walls the forts and towers of the strongest pirate lair in the mediterranean wavered in the heat like a bad dream the lions jaws were the reefs that girded the city as we approached emerald and gold amid the darker blue of the mediterranean and the teeth were the cannon that jutted from embrasures in the ramparts hundreds and hundreds of cannon it seemed beneath their protection the corsairs xebecs and feluccas of the barbary pirates bobbed placidly huddled like cubs id hoped to see the proud black frigates of my own navy by now given that id sailed back to europe with the powerful american squadron but any blockade was nowhere to be seen and draguts taunt that the united states flotilla was hiding at malta seemed dismayingly true if tripoli was truly at war with my own infant nation it was hard to see any sign of it see said dragut as if reading my mind your ships draw too much water to even come close midday heat and sun were dazzling adding to the hallucinatory effect of what napoleons savants had labeled mirage the land scent was of sand and spices excrement and oranges the wool of piled carpets and stink of drying fish tripoli is on a green plain that gives way to desert waste and in the shimmering light its flatroofed houses are whitewashed ice blocks that gleam like snow this glacier is crevassed with winding streets so narrow and confused that they seem more like natural channels than planned thoroughfares the citys flatness is punctuated by the bulbous domes of mosques and upright stalks of minarets topped by conical green roofs like witches hats at the citys southeastern edge near the harbor is the squat massive crenellated castle of the bashaw yussef karamanli beyond is a rocky outcrop with a fort that commands both city and sea a fine place for a mirror karamanli dragut told us with pride was as ruthless a prince as attila the hun he came to power seven years ago when he drove out the pirate ali bourghal before that he murdered his brother hassan in the palace harem shooting off his mothers fingers when she raised her arm to try to protect her eldest son yussef dragged hassans pregnant wife off the dying body of her husband by her hair then he cut off hassans privates and threw them to his dogs no wonder you joined up with him and yet he is also a pious manhe wears scripture from the koran written in strips wound into his turban now theres a commitment when yussef took the city from the pirate bourghal his other brother hamet agreed to exile in alexandria however hamets wife and children remain as hostages yussef views hamet with contempt and controls him by terrorizing his family yussef himself has two wives a fairskinned turk and an ebony black the white madonna and the black i thought remembering my adventures beneath jerusalem with miriam and my teachings from astiza plus a harem of concubines yussef is a stallion he also has a pet leopard an italian band to serenade him with music and jewels the size of robins eggs i still cant see him winning an election he doesnt have to he is loved and feared because his rule is allahs will we muslims are content with our lot because as the prophet said it is written christians are tormented because they dont really believe in fate and are always trying to change things we faithful are happy with oppression if it is gods will tripoli is tranquil in tyranny so you put up with a lunatic who murders his brother wounds his mother and drags his pregnant sisterinlaw by the hair all the world pays tribute to yussef karamanli by god england and france dont smith put in this is as it should be the english and french keep other navies weak did not nelson just destroy the danish fleet at copenhagen we cannot fight their battleships nor can they close in with our shallow coast so we leave their flag alone and they leave ours alone while allowing us to prey on the merchant ships of their commercial rivals shippers learn there is safety paying extra to sail under the english or french flag here again we see the wisdom of god with each nation assigned to its rightful place the only people who do not see reason are the americans but lookdo you see their frigates they bluster but hide it was yussef who declared war on us because your baby nation doesnt understand the way of the world and pay rightful tribute the united states should give us what we demand it will be far cheaper than senseless defiance youll see i cant say we have faith in your advice dragut given that youve lied betrayed and enslaved us ah you are lucky that hamidou dragut is the one who captured you and not a truly hard man like murad reis the traitor scot smith asked he took the turban but is dour and gloomy like his homeland i will put in a word for you but he is not merciful like me hamidou murad chose valor under the crescent over slavery under the cross now he is captain of all our corsairs renowned for his courage cleverness and cruelty every slave has that opportunity in your backward nations slavery is a lifes torment the work of negroes you despise in our enlightened nation it is but a step to wealth and even freedom for those who convert to islam our christian slaves live the life of the damned but muslim slaves can rise as high as their masters such is the wisdom of allah not one of us will ever become a mussulman cuvier vowed even we savants who question scripture then you must be ransomed to bankrupt your families or sentenced to the quarries or given over to omar the dungeon master are you savants not men of reason listen to me well only reason can save you now cannon fired salutes as we neared the city auroras flotilla answered in turn each puff of smoke from the forts followed a second or two later by one from us the bangs echoing across the lovely turquoise water swarms of dockworkers slavers soldiers and veiled wives assembled on the quay as we glided between the reefs horns blew from the city walls and drums beat out a tattoo our ship tied up and great rattling chains each set as heavy as two pails of water were dragged aboard by starvedlooking slaves and manacled around our ankles and wrists the weight holding our arms down and our hands cupped as if we were trying to cover our privates this forced pose was not entirely inappropriate because our clothes were ragged after the caves of thira dirty unshaven and thin we looked like the wretched slaves wed become my scientist companions gloomily surveyed the churning mob waiting to escort us to the slave markets reason we had one card left but didnt dare play it we thought we knew the place to which the palimpsest map referred it was smith with his love for geography whod figured it out he told me when id been returned to the hold of draguts ship after meeting aurora we had it backward ethan he explained in a whisper as we made for the african coast this inlet here isnt a bay its a peninsula as if the map is drawn in a mirror and once i realized that everything else became plain i know of one harbor in this part of the world with that shaped protrusion and it is syracuse on sicily where archimedes did his calculations and wielded his mirror this curved line here is not drawn on land but on the sea fulton suggested what that detail might represent i think thats the limit of the mirrors effectiveness the inventor said within that line the mirrors rays were strong enough to set attacking roman galleys on fire the symbols may refer to places on land the makers of this map wanted to record smith went on the hiding place perhaps of the mirror of archimedes caves forts a church i looked there was a cross on the peninsula and a castlelike symbol a good distance from town a line was drawn from cross to castle but it angled at a horseshoeshaped mark where the line bent there was a wavy line like a symbol for a river nearby was an oval little humps that could mark huts or caves and arrows with odd symbols and meaningless numbers i think the templars drew this after they rediscovered the mirror smith whispered and hid it on thira in a place only they knew some underground catacombs perhaps so we have something to bargain with i exclaimed absolutely not cuvier countered are you going to help turn a terrible weapon over to pirate fanatics not turn it over just use what we know to get out of this fix somehow id rather be enslaved than give the barbarians a clue that might result in the destruction of the french navy my friend vowed aye and the british navy too said smith come ethan your own nation is at war with these devils we cant tell them where this death ray is where is it i peered at the map we dont know exactly but sooner or later they would figure that out just pinpointing the city makes discovery far easier your frigates would become infernos and your countrymen would fry we cant trade that for freedom death before dishonor eh of course i swallowed still a little hint might not hurt fulton shook his head any modern inventor could probably improve on the greek design we dare not even tempt them by the whiskers of zeus id fallen in with honorable men thats always a risky thingnot to mention novel but theyll take the palimpsest from us and maybe come to the same conclusion i tried im not craven just practical the only thing to do cuvier said is memorize this scrap to the closest detail and then destroy it then the key will be in our brains not an underground tunnel or a piece of animal skin destroy it how we cant throw it into the sea from down here no and we cant bring the obscuring prayers back either the only thing i can think of my friends is to eat it after weve washed it in piss to see the design nothing wrong with a little urine ethan the scientist assured less toxic than bad well water maidens used it to wash their hair besides the palimpsest is long dried now seasoned you might say eat a palimpsest i looked with dismay how a little at a time i suspect its not like we have salt and pepper and so we did and by the end i had a sore jaw from chewing and a knotted gut from too much parchment and not enough vegetables why cant i find normal treasure like gold doubloons or a queens tiara our morose chewing of this cud did put us in a philosophical mood and when men ponder the mysteries of the universe the first thing that comes to mind is women id explained my unsuccessful audience with aurora somerset and given hints of our unhappy history which seemed to surprise no one females we agreed were more bewitching than a treasure map and explosive as a keg of gunpowder its odd how dangerous they are given that men are so clearly superior smith said with honest puzzlement in strength in courage and in intelligence the evidence of our genders advantage is indisputable not entirely fulton cautioned i know many a man whod quail at the prospect of childbirth certainly women have strengths of their own the englishman allowed beauty to cite the most obvious my point is that despite our own male brilliance the hens seem to get the upper hand over the peacock quite baffling really upper wing i corrected if the metaphor is peacock its really a product of natural history cuvier opined now the male it is true has the instinct to be unfaithful while monogamy is advantageous for the survival of children in terms of procreation its in a bucks best interest to mount as many damsels as possible here here i said so that should keep men in a position of superiority smith said if his heart is broken by one mate he simply transfers his energies to the next look at gage there a perfect example of serial infatuation faithlessness and poor judgment i opened my mouth to clarify but fulton cut me off fighting stags risk dying in combat but the winner gains a harem the inventor agreed the bull rules the pasture and the ram his ewes male superiority gentlemen is the rule of the barnyard and it should be the rule of the salon and yet it is not cuvier cautioned ethan for example is the kind of man who has endless problems with women given his flealike frenzy inability to plan for the future rank opportunism and hapless disloyalty in his case the advantage is to the fair sex when does one hunt a stag in the rutting season when the animals brain is positively addled by lust and he cant get anything right ethan again fulton agreed the woman in contrast has a far weightier task than simple copulation cuvier went on while a loose bull like gage might charge around the pasture wearing out over this skirt and that the female has but one chance to get it right just a single man will impregnate her and so her choice of the stud is crucial to her own wellbeing and that of her child as a result she approaches relationships with the acumen of an alexander and the strategy of frederick the great her brilliance at this dance is honed from earliest childhood and faced with her ruthless strategy and judicious selection we men are but helpless pawns it is she who controls our success or failure she who maneuvers to bring the right mate to her boudoir she who calculates not just physical attractiveness but money intelligence and power and sets in place a bewildering set of flanking maneuvers and ambushes that turn the hapless male to befuddled acquiescence at the same time she must convince the male that the entire affair is his idea we are no match smith agreed with a sigh we are rabbits to their fox or at least hapless romantics like ethan are said cuvier they weigh our inheritance our reputation our prospects and our hygiene fulton confirmed its little wonder gage here has such trouble with his astiza and this somerset to just begin the list its a hopeless mismatch i am hardly a victim gentlemen my pride was being stung perhaps not said cuvier but the farther you stay from women ethan gage the safer all of us will be chapter twentyone so here i was on a stone quay at the edge of africa in the hot midday sun dragging an anchors worth of iron appalled at the idea of trying to rekindle passion with aurora somerset and facing the fate they whisper about in mediterranean taverns our captivity was muslim payback for their expulsion from spain the blood of the crusades and their whipping at lepanto and vienna a couple of centuries back every war breeds the next one the four of us might be the despair of any parish prelate given our rather liberal views on religion and scripture but to the pirates we were christian dogs about to get a preview of the hell wed earned by not converting to islam someday i was going to learn not to go on errands for napoleon bonaparte what is our plan again whispered fulton well i was going to ransom us with what we know but an outbreak of moral rectitude among the four of us put an end to that scheme i see only two ways out one is to run like the very devil when we have the chance fulton looked down at his manacles i think theyve anticipated that the other is to appeal to reason i dont trust our pirate queen for a moment lads and so we need to see the king of this place one yussef karamanli and convince him just how important we really are isnt he the one who shot one brother and exiled another on his way to the throne the one whos declared war on our own united states the one whose grandfather had his janissary guards strangled one by one as they came in the door of a thankyou banquet hes no george washington i allowed in the end however pirates are always businessmen you savants represent the brightest minds in europe well figure out some harmless task to impress him earn his gratitude put him in our debt and then be sent on our way with presents perhaps your optimism is ludicrous smith said if we prove truly useful hell never let us go cuvier added maybe napoleon will rescue us then napoleon has no idea where we are then look for any chance of escape gentlemen punishable by excruciating death ive read smith warned we really dont have a chance if i recall well i said doggedly ill think of something they sighed with that and the crack of whips we shuffled forward bunched with a second group of captives pushed off another ship some of these were sobbing women our vine of chain was locked together and we were pushed stumbling past hogsheads of sugar pipes of wine and casks of nails into the city proper passing from blinding sunlight to the canyonlike shadows of a street of africa awnings casting them in shade we were lashed through crowds of jostling soldiers shouting merchants shrouded women braying donkeys and snorting camels we shuffled with bare feet on the manurespotted sand of the street to the blare of horns and beat of drums high overhead the red green and white banners of tripoli floated to taunt anyone dreaming of freedom from the alcoves the poorest muslim beggars made sure to strike and spit to ensure that our mood was even worse than theirs we were jeered until we shrank into ourselves like the intimidated spirits we were our weapons were gone our boots stoleni made sure dragut himself took my urinesoaked shoeand half our buttons plucked off we were thirsty starved sunburned and whipped and as pitiable a lot as youll see this side of a cannibal campfire i kept looking for opportunity and finding none tripoli did bring back memories of alexandria and cairo here were the coffee shops the old men squatting at the entrance to puff at sixfoot hookah pipes as we stumbled by the air heavy with hashish and incense there were taverns too run by freed christians and patronized by muslims who sat in dark shadows to imbibe forbidden alcohol the turkish and arab women we passed were veiled their robes shapeless so that only the beauty of their almond eyes hinted at the charms within tripoli also had a large colony of jews whod been expelled from spain in columbuss day by decree the jews were dressed in black and forced to go barefoot if they crossed in front of a mosque most of the beggars were missing hands or arms their extremities having been chopped off and the stumps dipped in pitch after conviction of some crime street urchins ran with us too yelling taunts and laughing at our shackled misery high above the eyes of more women peered down at us from the grilled windows of harems and apartments i preferred philadelphia theres a hierarchy in tripoli you would do well to memorize said hamidou as his sailors jabbed us forward the rulers and janissary soldiers are turks answerable to the sublime porte in istanbul they are the ones allowed to wear the red fez wrapped with muslin below them are arab merchants the descendants of the desert warriors who conquered north africa more than a thousand years ago beneath the arabs are the moors the muslims driven from spain by the christian knights then the levantines the greeks and lebanese who do menial jobs the jews are also refugees from spanish intolerance and they are our lenders and finally at the bottom you slaves make up a fifth of our population the government language is turkish and arabic and the street talk is the lingua franca of the mediterranean a mix of all the dialects from around that sea we clanked by a market there were ranks of silvery fish mounds of bright spices carpets cloaks leather silks figs raisins olives grain and oil there was brass and iron cookware finely tooled saddles sweetly curving daggers oranges pomegranates grapes onions anchovies and dates everything was for sale including me how much am i worth exactly i asked as a slave that is he considered half the price of a pretty woman but you cant just mean to auction us off like common sailors i reasoned were learned men youre christian dogs until you convert the slave market of tripoli was a stone platform under the wall of yussefs central citadel and perhaps his entertainment was the lamentation that rose from the hopeless we queued next to its steps while a mob of bidders inspected us since we represented a potentially shrewd investment our sale price would go to our pirate captors but there was a chance a buyer might turn a profit not just from our labor but from ransoming us to higherbidding relatives in christendom the bashaws own representatives were resplendent in jeweled turbans and upturned slippers they were there to take the prettiest for the harem and the most able for whatever household duties needed filling after the last purchase had finally expired of overwork and disease other buyers included swarthy berber chieftains from the hinterlands military overseers needing brute labor to complete battery work galley masters looking to replenish their banks of oars carpet makers who needed quick fingers and fresh eyes and dyers water carriers wheat growers tanners drovers and masons all with whips and manacles of their own the system was built entirely on coercion instead of free enterprise and id announce in a second that it couldnt work except that the barbary kingdoms had been defying the navies of europe for three hundred years my own united states depended on slavery in its south and by all reports its most enthusiastic practitioners were quite wealthy the captives ahead were auctioned like cattle muscles were ordered tightened to judge strength mouths forced open with wedges of stick bellies prodded feet lifted and clothes rudely ripped to hunt for boils rashes or other signs of disease we were all forced to prove by prancing that we didnt suffer from gout in some cases trousers were tugged down to judge the size of the genitals as if the poor captive was to be put to stud one sardinian sailor reacted to this indignity with such shock that he shoved an auctioneer and kicked out at a soldier his chains clanking at this outburst the crowd roiled and churned like an ant nest poked with a stick i braced for the beating and indeed guards leaped forward to rain blows on the poor man until he was curled like a baby on the auction platform sobbing in italian for mercy the savagery seemed disproportionate and wildly unrestrained and yet this was but a preview of his real punishment there was a stir behind us and i turned a man had appeared on a snowwhite horse surrounded by a troop of janissaries he was in his thirties i judged handsome and fit and dusty from some pleasure hunt that morning retainers had raptors hooded and tied to poles when he halted negro slaves ran up to fan him with longhandled plumes behind on another horse her auburn ringlets cascading nakedly down in a display some muslims would consider obscene was aurora somerset her lips slightly parted in excitement she was watching the beating quietly thrilled its karamanli cuvier whispered look at that emerald on his turban big enough to pick him out in a crowd i admitted and give him a headache he likes order in his markets dragut said this sardinian will be made an example the bashaw said something sharp to one of his officers and the message was relayed to the auction overseer this man winced at the thought of lost profit but then issued orders of his own in an instant the groaning bloody sailor was unlocked from his chains hauled semiconscious to the edge of the platform and then held by both arms while a huge iron hook swung down from the shadows above fortunately the victim was too dazed to know what was about to happen to him we gasped jerking the victim to attention and then the implement was jammed through his back and shoved out through his belly like a gigantic fishhook its point obscenely dripping blood he howled thenscreeched as if in the very grip of demons and then he was hoisted flapping frantically blood sluicing down his nakedness while his eyes rolled back in their sockets from the unbelievable pain for the love of god my companions were sobbing twenty feet above the auction platform his ascent stopped the sailor thrashed and squirmed eyes bulging as he regarded the hook jutting from his guts bloody droplets spattering the stones finally the convulsions slowed and he fainted and then i noticed that he was not alone in hanging in the shadows above other cadavers half rotted and dried hung from similar hooks to warn what would happen if we resisted certainly my own will collapsed escape i could barely breathe i turned to look back at aurora and yussef the woman licked her lips the ruler of tripoli nodded with grim satisfaction and then kicked his steed toward his castle gate the pirate queen and his retinue following now catch his eye i croaked desperately but my companions were in no mood to court this monsters notice and in any event we were too ragged and anonymous to gain his appreciation anyway he passed into the shadows of his fortress without a glance aurora ignoring us as well then we were left helpless and humiliated and yet our shame at being exhibited like animals was nothing compared with the infamy visited on the women if old and shapeless they were bustled off to the laundries or bakeries with cursory bidding and swift transaction but if young and at all lovely they were stripped naked to a roar of approval from the throng of sweating men then they were turned like a piece of glassware propriety forgotten if bidding lagged the auctioneer would lift a breast or bring a cane up between the thighs while the assembly roared and the shouted numbers went higher it made no difference how much the damsels wept or shuddered one even wetting herself in fear and mortification they were lasciviously inspected before being bundled off to the buyers harem to be cleaned for his rape and enjoyment we burned to avenge them but what chance did we have and if some of the women wailed at their fate some of the captive men wept at an even worse future knowing their existence would not be the dull luxury of the harem but a monotony of dry bread senseless beating and crushing labor until death became sweet release we were dizzy from heat and angry excitement swaying from thirst and hopelessness and blinking against flies that swarmed to drink our last sweat finally our quartet of savants was shoved and whipped up the steps and onto the platform the remaining buyers groaning and hooting at our lack of fitness we did not appear to have half the endurance of a normal seaman who wants a scientist as a slave the auctioneer began with a sigh of determination barking and singsonging to the assembly they shouted insults and mockery hoping to drive our price down the betting was that wed go to the quarries and expire in weeks were finally in hell cuvier said eyes closed against the mob not thira but here no said fulton hell is coming i looked where he was staring the crowds noise abruptly hushed as a giant breasted the bidders with the heavy swaying gait of an elephant his shoulders were wide as a door his bald head gleamed and his torso was a crosshatch of tattoos and scar tissue there was an odd paleness to him like a cave being who rarely sees the sun his eyes were tiny in his brutal and rumpled face but they had the look of dull cunning the vicious sometimes muster his hands and wrists looked capable of bending steel his nose mashed his lips heavy like a groupers and his muscles swollen as if pumped full of bile there was a muttering of fear as the crowd hastily parted and then it was quiet enough to hear the creak of chain as the impaled sailor still dripping blood made his last instinctual twitching above this ghastly scene its omar i heard the pirates breathe the dungeon master too ugly for a mother to love i whispered too ugly to have been born at all cuvier amended he emerged im guessing like maggots from the dung the giant pointed at us with a finger thick as a small pistol and we realized wed been noticed after all yussef karamanli says the little ones are for me chapter twentytwo if the hold of draguts ship had been claustrophobic and the slave market of tripoli wretched omars dungeon was infinitely worse its tunnels had been hewn by carthaginians romans visigothic barbarians arab jihadists and turkish overlords over a score of centuries a labyrinth of sorrow gnawed by generations of jailers and prisoners like termites into wood each tyranny had added a descending level so each sin and cruelty could be hidden farther from the light we were not marched but dragged to this hive in the bowels beneath yussefs palace and were not thrust into a cell but pitched into a pit a rock well slimed with dripping spring water that made its sides too slippery to climb the bottom was ankledeep in mud and sewage we mostly felt this instead of saw it because there was no light except the reflection of torches somewhere far overhead the pits smell was peculiar an odor of carrion and reptile stale and prehistoric so perhaps animals were sometimes kept there no creature was in the pit now which is just as well because we probably would have eaten it killing the beast barehanded and chewing it raw the sweat from the rock was our only drinking waterwe had to lap it like dogsand our first food did not come for two days we finally heard the shuffle of a troglodyte guard above and saw something tumble down in the dimness we had the wit to catch what was a stale weevilinfested loaf of bread enough for two or three mouthfuls for each of us the worms represented more nourishment than the rancid flour theyd fed on we wolfed down our share without tasting our quartet barely said a word in our despair so the primary sound was the screaming and begging of yussefs enemies being tortured somewhere above omar himself had been immensely strong and immensely silent flinging us into our misery without a word of explanation hed seemed not so much cruel as indifferent as if the suffering he oversaw never registered on the animal lobe of his brain all of us were sick humans cannot live long in a wet stinking pit without inhaling from its vapors all kinds of pestilence as any doctor will tell you our occasional shouts to summon help or explanation were ignored and we wondered at times if wed been entirely forgotten when the future is uncertain the present is misery and time creeps like a slug even had we wanted to betray our navies there was no opportunity to do so in any event the four of us pledged again not to betray the secret of the mirror as a way of fortifying our spirits better this pit than dishonor cuvier said heavily no englishman would imperil his navy smith added nor an american betray his nations cause said fulton well said i confirmed though a little negotiation wouldnt hurt if we could get out of this slime hole and properly pay them back they didnt respond to this given that they hadnt much use for my ideas anymore we did try standing on each others shoulders to reach the lip but even with a precarious pyramid that had cuvier the lightest of us reaching for the top we were still too short there was no shovel to pile sand and no sand to pile in any event there was in short no possibility of escape and no communication didnt they want ransom had they given up trying to corrupt us to betray the secret of archimedes and then they did break my will but in an entirely unexpected way time had disappeared and existence in the hole had become synonymous with eternity then without warning a chain rattled down rusty and thick omar shouted in a deep voice gage alone whats this cuvier asked with just a hint of suspicion perhaps im the first to be shot i could think of worse things like staying where i was i read they decapitate smith said oh its very quick ah maybe they want to torture you cuvier speculated remember our pledge ethan fulton warned we dare not help them you remember it too when you hear my screams and with that i grasped the chain wrapped my legs around its links and shouted omar hauled me up the slimy walls of our well with me rotating so i was thoroughly smeared with filth i was weak by now from lack of proper food and water and had a hard time even holding on my companions feared for me but also followed my ascent with envy as if id been given leave to levitate to someplace that wasnt just an endless hopeless now i knew better the dungeon master seemed to fill the pits tight chamber his teeth yellow his breath stinking and the skin of his palms thick and hard as boot leather he clamped his paws on the back of my neck as if it were the scruff of a kitten half lifting and paralyzing me and id no doubt that should i not go where he pushed my head would be snapped from its stalk he began shoving me up a rock passageway torture doesnt work with me i tried in arabic he used his other hand to cuff me with the power of a bear the blow leaving my ears ringing silence pretty one time enough for noise i saw no advantage in following his advice i have powerful friends omar with money to buy not only the escape of us savants but a life for you too if you go with us now he stopped holding me at arms length and regarding me with squinted disbelief look at me where else could i possibly be and then he slammed me back against the tunnel wall my poor head bouncing and dragged me even more roughly than before i told you not to talk it makes it worse i was taken past horrid iron machines stained dark with blood and heavy doors with small barred windows from which insane gibbering escaped how can people invent such places let alone administer them then we turned into a side rat hole and he pushed me ahead down a tight spiral to a new chamber lit by a tiny slit far far above the single ray of light just emphasized the grottos darkness its vaulted ceiling stained black by the smoke of two millennia of torches there was a rude wooden table in the chambers center with manacles at each of its corners to one side was the glow of a forge on which sat a bubbling pot giving off noxious fumes iron implements were thrust into the coals my courage never all that vast to begin with was starting to shrivel i was slammed down on the table and chained helplessly in place my throat and belly and privates exposed to whatever deviltry this dim monster could invent never had i felt so helpless the tiny window made things worse reminding me there was a different world beyond from a beam overhead swung metal implements designed to pierce pinch and cut i wanted to scream already and nothing had yet been done soon you will talk more than you believed possible omar clinical as a doctor pumped air into the coals with a bellows sparks dancing he slipped on a heavy leather glove and lifted out an iron bar like a fireplace poker and brought it over to where i helplessly waited he held it above my eyes letting me see its glow each time i do this i learn ways to prolong the pain victims can live for days yes omar is not as clumsy as he once was the hulking brute nodded by the time ive had the last of your friends i will make it last a very long time indeed so long that i will become bored before they finally die we wouldnt want that i managed my throat was dry as dust my muscles cracking from tension finish us quickly is my advice you are lucky you are first while i am still learning we will experiment with pain and a handsome man like you needs a mirror so i will bring one after my branding so that you can weep at the ruin i make of your face my goal is to make you even more hideous than me you will blister and infect but i keep maggots to eat the corruption it makes you last longer thank goodness for maggots it was a wheeze i am told you pride yourself with women so i have tools to mutilate those parts as well the groin is a locus of agony and always elicits the greatest screaming i was near to fainting cant you just kill me beheading smith read there was a hiss and i jumped the poker thrust into a pail of water and then reinserted in the coals why would they need the skill of a dungeon master to do that anyone can hack off a head with a sword it is torture that is an art the shame of mutilation the peeling of flesh omar please ill pay anything he was rummaging about clanging and clattering his tools of torment i squeezed my eyes shut i could hear the scrape of coals and smell the fumes something hissed like acid then there was a long silence i tensed to wait for the first excruciating assault of course omar said as if the idea had just occurred to him there is one other way my eyes opened what what perhaps you would once more speak to the mistress mistress the pirate queen lady somerset i was sweating yes yes to her and yussef were the kind of men who should be ransomed not tortured omar let me see them please ill explain it is all a misunderstanding we are really quite valuable i think they will find you as annoying as i do and give you back to me to do as i wish unless you please them very much but thats exactly what i do i please people while you talk with them i will think of new ways to hurt your friends in case you cant come to agreement i would like to hurt your friends very much he grinned like a maniac no dont hurt my friends let me talk to aurora by thunder id tup the girl sideways and upside down clenching my teeth while i did it if thats what it took to get off this torture table no need to talk about ancient mirrors when i could just rely on my charm suddenly janissaries entered and the manacles were unlocked from my shaking limbs i felt utterly depleted even though not a scratch had been inflicted omar lumbered off to attend to some other wretch while the tripolitan guards hauled me upright with looks of disgust i was shuddering none of them called me pretty strip off your rags american they ordered my hands were shaking so badly that they ripped my garments for me then they sluiced me with buckets of water again the same rude bath id had on draguts pirate ship filth streamed off until i finally stood abject and naked shivering ashamed at my weakness and terrified of what might come next put these on i was dressed in moorish bloused trousers and a sleeveless vest my chest bare and given sandals for my raw feet maybe id have to turn muslim after all then four of the soldiers formed a little box around me and we went up a flight of stairs realizing it must lead to the castle i began to take note of where we were my escorts didnt speak the passage grew less gloomy as we climbed arrow slits giving light and i couldnt help but have my hopes soar even as trepidation grew what was the point of seeing aurora again what could i agree to without betraying my country why had i been hauled out of the pit instead of someone more famous and reputable like cuvier because i was the weakest but i had a reputation as a hero of acre none of it made sense i blinked against the growing light realizing just how dark and trolllike our lives had become i felt confused exhausted and desperate a door opened small enough that we had to squeeze through two soldiers filed before me two behind this corridor wasnt much broader than my shoulders and again had no light except from an oil lamp was this a secret passageway we came to an iron grill at the end that my escorts unlocked and then locked behind then we climbed a winding set of stone stairs yet another door was unbolted this one wood and at first i thought beyond was more darkness but no it was simply a tapestry covering the door the cloth was swept aside and i was pushed through into some kind of reception room this one brilliant to my eyes even though the sunlight was filtered through woodgrilled windows i blinked there was blue sea and sky beyond and my heart quickened even as i tensed for a sudden blade or shot were my captors simply giving me a last cruel glimpse of this sweet earth before sending me off it not yet aurora wasnt there instead i was facetoface with hamidou dragut our traitorous sea captain he lounged on a cushion in what i realized was the richly decorated throne room picking from a bowl of figs my stomach growled at the sight of them the rooms floor was strewn with thick persian carpets and its marble walls were decorated with incised arabic script that quoted the koran there was a gilded throne chair the cerulean silk of its cushion embroidered with gold and its legs and arms studded with jewels in one corner of the chamber was a leopard lying on the cool floor and held to a pillar by a golden chain behind was its brass cage the cat looked bored id come from hell to an odd little heaven dragut looked me up and down she will be very disappointed the pit has not improved you i worked to keep any quaver from my voice aurora somerset is always disappointed its her nature dont let your tongue betray your last remaining chance american sometimes i cant help myself and my grit was slowly coming back i was jealous he had figs and i was starving to be a slave to that woman like you he darkened i am no slave and would die before becoming one i took breath tripoli is a nation of slaves i could tell that much just marching from the harbor endless castes each man quailing before the other and your women bagged and hidden as if they carried the plague youve never tasted freedom in your life dragut on the contrary monsieur gage it was a new voice and i swung around a door to the throne room opened and in strode the man id seen in the slave market on his white horse bashaw yussef karamanli himself he was as ive said fit and handsome a dagger in his sash and a sword at his side and carried with him that confidence that comes from being born to royalty two powerful guards one blond and one black flanked him his sword belt was studded with diamonds and his turban had that jewel the size of a robins eggemerald enough i guessed to put me in high style the rest of my life if i could ever find a way to snatch it he also had the ruthless look that is inevitable to men who cling to power in dangerous places he plopped onto the european throne chair while a janissary gave a blow to the back of my legs forcing me to my knees before him my head was wrenched down in obeisance in this country each man enjoys the freedom of knowing his place and role unlike the chaos of democracy yussef went on with a scholarly air and our women have a freedom yours cant imagine yes they are covered but that means they can go anywhere in the city without being recognized meaning they are free from malicious gossip and disapproving eyes behind the veil they have a liberty no american or french woman enjoys they are mistresses of their houses and in the cool of the evening they emerge on the screened roofs to talk and sing in a world free of harassment from men no woman can keep secrets more readily than a muslim woman no woman is happier and no woman is better protected by her husband you will see if you take the turban we have a harmony a serenity unknown in europe my head came up ive experienced auroras serenity ah lady somerset isunique and no muslim and she has nothing to say to you at least not yet dragut said that will await some sudden birth of reason on the part of yourself and your companions no i brought you up to confer first with someone quite different to see if we cannot be partners we have nothing you want to know from four savants im skeptical of that and if we did it will die with us i insisted on honor im inclined to exaggerate if nobody is around to correct me did you he licked his fingers of the stickiness of the figs and suddenly sprang up he wore i saw cuviers two pistols in his sash the guards were similarly armed and looked ready to spring everyone had weapons enough to rob a mail coach meaning i was not exactly trusted i appreciate men of honor dragut said he rapped on the door yussef had come through they can be trusted to do the right thing there was the sound of a lock being turned a creak and the heavy door swung open a pale corpulent hairless slavea eunuch i guessed the gelded men allowed to attend a haremmarched into our meeting place with pretentious authority as if his rank exceeded that of the pirate captain and soldiers before him but he fell before yussef his forehead touching the floor and then another figure came through to slip around the eunuch and stand in a shaft of dazzling sunlight like the apparition of an angel all sense left me then and i heard a roaring in my ears my knees went weak it was astiza my lost love from egypt as beautiful as ever with her dressed like a little sultan was a boy of just over two years he looked at me with bright cautious curiosity hello ethan astiza said this is your son horus chapter twentythree astiza was as striking as i remembered shes a mediterranean beauty greek and egyptian her hair silk and piled for this reunion held in place with a golden pin she has eyes to drown in dark and deep and they shone with a bright intelligence that might frighten some men but captivated me she was not as conventionally beautiful as aurora somerset but had a thousand times more character the set of her lip or the waiting question of her eyes hinting at a depth of emotion the english noblewoman had no knowledge of there was bright steel in astiza but vulnerability too and while she always seemed ready to slip away that independence she once had need of me as well as baffled by her attraction to me as i was by my longing for her we had electricity we understood each others hopes in an unspoken way id never shared with another woman slim poised draped in arabian finery her sandals silver and her jewelry braided gold she seemed a dream after the ghastliness of omar and the horror of his dungeons yet my appraisal was done hurriedly because my stunned stare necessarily went to the wee creature beside her this was a lad not much beyond the nursery shorter i guessed than napoleons little red man with a shock of unruly hair that mimicked my own in a way both enchanting and disturbing my son i wasnt aware i had one he had astizas hypnotic eyes and upright stance and my own cheekiness he didnt shy behind my old lovers skirts but looked at me with that optimistic wariness children use with strange but promising adults i might have a presentor i might be of no use whatsoever and damn if the tykes face didnt look a bit like mine too a point i registered with both apprehension and pride my son it came out as a croak i suspected pregnancy when we were in temple prison in paris you didnt share this rather momentous information i didnt want it to dissuade you from bringing me to help stop alessandro silano and his egyptian rite treachery and later when napoleon spared usyoure a man whos destined to go his own way ethan i knew wed have a reunion i just didnt expect it to be like this what are you doing in tripoli my questions were thick my mind reeling my purpose confused i was a father by thors thunder was i supposed to marry the girl and was i supposed to be pleased or disturbed i couldnt remember old ben franklin having anything to say about this i was captured like you what kind of a name is horus she hadnt conferred on that either a quite noble name of an egyptian god you know that i just always imagined having a jack or a tom or something i was rambling while i tried to take it all in you werent around to consult her tone was cool and tarnation if i didnt feel guilty about the entire situation but i hadnt planned this or wanted it i just wanted her and i still did didnt i of course i did i wanted to leap the gap between us but a child gave new gravity to the situation new purpose to every glance and word what was my duty here dragut and karamanli were looking at me with amusement how were you captured kidnapped in egypt id returned to dendara for my studies of the past when bedouin raiders took us ethan all this from the beginningwith silano and the medallion the book of thoth your mission in north americahas been an attempt by our enemies to reconstruct the power discovered in the middle ages by the knights templar they are reassembling the lost powers of a very ancient world a world that preceded the one we know and that started our own civilization secrets lost for millennia are being bent toward evil thats not true dragut said the more i studied in egypt the more i understood the vastness of their design and i hoped the hieroglyphs of dendara would reveal how all this secret history came about but before i could work horus and i were kidnapped we were ridden into the desert by bedouin and i thought wed be ransomed from there but instead we were sold in a slave market to men who wore medallions of a pyramid entwined with a snake it was apophis all over again they took us to the coast threatening to harm horus if i tried any witchcraft then we were chained to a corsair and sailed here where i was brought to karamanlis harem my god are you a concubine she shook her head i wasnt captured for him i was captured for you for me i was more confused than ever to persuade you if you failed to cooperate all this has been planned for many months ethan by some pirate captain who has some scheme i dont understand a devil in league with hamidou dragut here a deviless i corrected heavily the pirate is a woman a woman we have some history her look was less than happy i see in an instant many things had become clear to her such as why she was in this predicament at all i swallowed perfectly horrid i assure you the plague inquisition and reign of terror were holidays compared with aurora somerset i was asking about you in paris astiza really i wasi wrote ashraf about you toowhich is how my friends and i got into this mess i came to find you and now to meet you here withhorus i blinked at the boy im more than a little astounded who that the boy piped up its your papa i told you he come stay his voice lifted at the end of each question and he seemed quite the proficient talker for his age which i was swiftly calculating must be just over two i couldnt help but have some satisfaction at the precocious little prodigy id spawned as well as new alarm at the question he raised i loved astiza yes but a family and domesticity everything was happening too fast no my sweet hes going to save us by going away go where where other people tell him to go now what are you talking about i interrupted as weve explained we need your help and partnership ethan gage dragut said we could let omar the dungeon master explore what you know but one is never certain if the information elicited through torture is entirely honest much better for all we think is your voluntary help in achieving our mutual ends mutual ends ethan this was not my idea astiza said im as helpless as you but these cultists these fanatics are as ruthless as the pirates they employ you have two choices monsieur gage dragut explained you can return to the dungeon and let omar have his way he at least will enjoy it perhaps well learn something useful and while by the end youll be broken and insane aurora and i can investigate whatever clues he has wrung out of you should you make this choice to end your life in hideous pain astiza will become a concubine to the highest bidder and your son will be sold into a harem of a different sort there are beys who run to that taste and are always looking for young boys to initiate we will put horus there where mama hush baby mother and son will both be concubines until her master tires of his latest toy and turns astiza out to more menial slavery i think somerset intends that it be the worst kind of crippling labor and so your little family ends you in a torture chamber she as a scullery slave and horus perhaps as eunuch after his service to pederasts your courage if you want to call it that will have destroyed everyone around you what about my friends below my tone was hollow they will never emerge from the pit since bonaparte sent them we dare not risk his wrath by trying for ransom we take care not to capture people from nations with powerful navies better that they simply disappear presumably lost at sea unfortunate casualties of a doomed treasure quest with the unreliable ethan gage they were last seen fleeing venice and poof they are gone you bastard you will fry in hell at that a guard sprang forward and lashed at me with a whip which stung like the very devil worse the crack of the lash terrified poor little horus who now did duck behind his mothers skirts whimpering my own eyes watered from the pain but i was damned if i was going to cry in front of my son family has a way of giving spine to a man the other choice dragut went on smoothly as if nothing had happened is to do what our federation has suggested from the beginning there was something on that sheepskin you collected because it had disappeared by the time we took you out of the hold you found a clue gage and then destroyed it admit it no more than a city which you could guess anyway syracuse i nodded as if didnt matter where archimedes lived but then why destroy the parchment and how did you do it we ate it he smiled which means it held more than a city take us to the mirror of archimedes gage and save both yourself and your family astiza and your son will be released to go back to egypt if they wish never to be molested by us again and my companions they will be released and put on a ship back to france before todays sunset you will not have to meet them and they will have no idea what bargain you made their nightmare will become an adventure they will recount at the supper table for the rest of their lives napoleon will probably reward them for having tried and praise yussef karamanli for his mercy and me you will make your own choice and it will be a real choice not coerced if the mirror works you can join an alliance that is seeking to recreate the magic and power of the knights templar and dominate the world for good i assure you the egyptian rite could run our planet far better than the grasping princes and warlords that rule it now mark my words men like bonaparte will wreak havoc the mirror will make tripoli impregnable to naval attack by even the greatest of powers and behind it we will build a new utopia like the murals of akrotiri i murmured what nothing something i saw once or you can throw away the opportunity to remake the world and go back to your old corruption where you will be regarded as traitor to your country and all civilized nations you will be despised and friendless the best you might hope for is impoverished exile in egypt with astiza once we have the mirror what you choose is of no moment to me by the beard of solomon wasnt this a fix condemn the son i hadnt known i had to slavery and rape snuff out not only my own life but that of astiza and my three savantsor betray my nation when it was at war with tripoli i couldnt remember old ben offering any advice on this kind of dilemma either except his comment about patriots hanging separately if they didnt hang together it was as if yussef read my thoughts do not flatter yourself that you hold the key to victory or defeat monsieur gage the bashaw spoke up we will find what we seek one way or anotherthe rite assures me of that you simply speed things along and by doing so spare your family if your nation really has a chance in its war with me why are its ships hiding in malta why indeed where in hell was that incompetent commodore richard valentine morris its not treason to embrace the idealism of the egyptian rite dragut added auroras odd patience with me at sea was now explained it had been planned from the beginning for me to turn traitor to the united states in order to save my young son the slave market the pit the torture chamberall were to soften me up for this unholy bargain they sensed i knew more than id admitted and had given me the one choice i couldnt refuse it didnt help that i felt guilty for putting the woman i loved and our child in utmost peril if i had the fidelity of a flea i never would have gotten entangled with aurora somerset in the first place and she wouldnt be plaguing us now there would have been no kidnapping of astiza and no devils bargain beauty and folly are old companions ben franklin said well the pirates were a long way from having a death ray and the only possible plan was play along if i said no we were doomed but if yes maybe my luck would turn im a gambler after all i began to fantasize about turning this death ray on them all i have are rather vague clues im not very good at puzzles but you could help no yes what do i have to do find the mirror for us and astiza and horus they will be released unharmed as promised but not until the weapon is in tripoli until then astiza remains in the harem as a prisoner how do i know youll keep your word if i help youll watch from a palace window when your savants are taken from the dungeon and put on an outbound ship this very evening well fulfill the first part of our promise before youve had to do yours we of the rite are honorable loath though you may be to believe it and horus will be kept safe i hope so but that is up to you ethan gage your son is going on our treasure hunt with you to ensure your good behavior horus with me but i know nothing of children astiza her eyes had lowered i dread this even more than you i dont want my son taken away and i dont trust his care to his father not yet not when your relationship with this woman started this tragedy but i have no choice we have no choice not exactly a ringing endorsement but how could i blame her and now aurora somerset stepped into the room in sea boots and greatcoat a cutlass on her waist theres no need for concern because i will be a mother to that boy she announced her great black dog sokar padded in with her yelloweyed and slobbering the leopard hissed at the sight of the beast and aurora smiled infuriatingly at astiza oddly it was auroras sneer that stiffened me it was just the arrogance to remind me exactly where duty lay and to which woman i owed every ounce of my loyalty i recognized the desperate trust astiza was extending to a lover whod done little to deserve it by isis i loved the mother of my son loved her with a depth that sent all the old emotions flooding back and it was time to save her or die trying the hell you will i told aurora somerset his mother is here and im the boys father astiza ill take care of our son i promise astiza nodded as afraid of this moment as any episode in her life she picked up the lad and stepped over to me little horus clinging like a squirrel he looked at all of us with anxious suspicion which was another confirmation of his uncommon intelligence i caught the scent of my old lover as she leaned close acacia and lotus and felt the electricity of her hair i reached out she put horus in my arms all is destiny ethan she whispered destiny and determination the boy was straining away leaning toward his mother as frightened of me as i was of him im having a hard time with horus though maybe i could call him little harry you wouldnt mind would you love him as you love me and as astiza was pulled by the eunuch through the door to the confinement of the harem my new son burst into tears chapter twentyfour ive been terrified many times in my life ive been trapped in the great pyramid hung upside down over a snake pit at jaffa tied to a stake in a fireworks display and forced to run an indian gauntlet on the edge of lake superior few experiences however have unnerved me as much as setting sail as guardian of a twoyearold son i didnt know i had quite unintentionally i had fathered responsibility while i was aware that conception was theoretically possible when i dove for the bed somehow the eventual likelihood always slipped my mind in the heat of the moment i hadnt the faintest idea what one does with a child worse i had fathered a bastard and unless i somehow rectified the mess id made hed live his life with the stain of illegitimacythat is if he managed to escape slavery and rape indeed thanks to me the boy was in the clutches of a clan of halfmad barbary pirates out to trump my own navy with a devils device that dated back more than two thousand years the only good news is that id watched as cuvier smith and fulton had indeed been set free no doubt wondering what odious deal id struck to get them hauled out of the pit they sailed the same night id met with astiza then dragut aurora young horus and i set to sea the next morning while his mother wept and the boy wailed id hoped to get some time alone with my egyptian love but once id made my devils bargain our audience was over it occurred to me after we were separated that i might have said something more eloquent than dazed questions but id been too discombobulated by astizas reappearance with a son to do much more than stutter even a simple i love you would have been gallant but how often do we waste our lives saying things of no importance at all only to neglect the eloquence that lifes surprises demand i knew astiza was unenthusiastic about our bargain given that i had no training as a father but she knew the alternative was worse at least i didnt mean to harm the boy that couldnt be said of everyone and everything when we boarded auroras ship the isis some of the crew muttered my tyke was bad luck and then there was the hulking black mass of sokar auroras mastiff who rumbled a growl as if inspecting us for dinner and thenas my son shrank against my leggiving a loud annoying bark horus jumped and cried damnation do we have to take your dog it will give him nightmares sokar only kills when i tell him to your whelp will be all right oh yes aurora somerset had quite the mothering instincts i realized then that she was above all a bully who used growling mastiffs pirate goons or her own rapacious sexuality to intimidate and torment like all bullies she looked for the weak or helpless like an innocent twoyearold oryes i had to admit ithis occasionally hapless father id played victim to her sexual charms giving her a taste of dominance that id been paying for ever since she wanted to rule me again coming from a perverse aristocratic father and an utterly corrupt brother aurora had lost at an early age any capacity to love or even to enjoy a normal relationship and assuaged her own wounds by picking at the vulnerabilities of others that didnt make me feel any more charitable about it ive also brought horus a guardian for when were busy she added in her best airy manner as if we were conversing from saddleback in hyde park there was a clump on the deck and at first i thought the man who peglegged out from her cabin was simply another mediterranean pirate strapping shaved bald with a scar that cut across cheek and mouth and the usual murderous look i get from landlords creditors or jilted mistresses but there was something familiar about the set of those broad shoulders and the penetrating glint of those dark eyes what unholy reunion was this i finally groaned in recognition osiris yes it was my riddle master from madame marguerites palais royal brothel looking considerably more tanned now that he was in the mediterranean but none the happier for it i glanced down to his foot which was missing the thump of his peg was coming from the leg id run over with the fire wagon his facial scar i realized was where id slashed him with that medallion of pyramid and snake i thought it gave him character but doubted hed agree i told you wed go on this journey together gage but you hurried off i thought it was that you couldnt keep upsay did you have an accident with a fire wagon accidents happen to us all he prophesied just to add to his demented ugliness it appeared hed filed his front teeth into something resembling points i should have checked the passenger registry not that id ever discourage partnership but i dont know if our relationship is entirely working osiris just to look at your face and leg and all and no man has the devils luck forever ethan gage youre one of us now to do with what we will so is your boy unwilling hostages you mean i suspect youre susceptible to surrendering to the ecstatic revelations of my order the egyptian rite dont you mean its corruption and degeneracy we could have killed you many times over but mercy stayed our hand now your life is about to change profoundly and should you refuse this opportunity well he smiled with all the charm of a bloodsucking bat theres always the boy to initiate if the father fails to accept rebirth im having trouble enough with this first life actually i dont know if im up for being born into another its all a lot of bother dont you think dont disappoint us again when the saw took off my mangled foot i had all kinds of visions of what i might do to you best not to tempt me and you stay away from horus or youre going to be sawing the other ankle bold words for a man with no weapons and no friends maybe my friends are closer than you think that was hogwash given that my three companions were halfway to france by now and the american navy might as well be in china but my instinctual reaction to arrogant people is to be cocky its usually a mistake i dont see them and someday when you arent necessary anymore well discuss our business once again and he sneered and limped off which did little to reinforce his menace i did wish for my rapier or longrifle however and wondered if they were locked in auroras cabin not surprisingly horus spoke arabic with a smattering of english words that astiza had taught him while i worked to expand the tykes vocabulary i wondered if his mother had said anything much about distant dad had she simply pretended i never existed where mama he asked as we worked our way out of tripolis reefs and set sail for syracuse on the island of sicily well harry she said i could take you on a boat trip well get to know each other and then all go back to egypt together i want mama well see her soon enough it might be fun to be a pirate you know mama and thus began our relationship when he began wailing dragut threatened to throw us in the hold if i didnt shut my bastard up so i took him to the bow and managed to calm him down by pointing out light ropes he could play with he was soon absorbed wrapping loops around my arms and legs and in a short time had me pretty well trussed being perfectly content with this mischief as we played the ship pitching in the waves i noticed aurora silently watching us from the door of her stern cabin and felt a familiar chill even if this ancient weapon still existed or had ever existedand i doubted bothi had a feeling the agreement i made would not be as simple as dragut had promised she had yet to add her own amendments the more i tried to escape these egyptian rite rascals the more deeply entwined with them i seemed to get the more i dreaded aurora somerset the more determined she seemed to make me her partner we had becomeas id concluded in america after i wounded her brothermarried in hate as baffled as i was at the prospect of taking care of a child i found that harry had practicality i admired he was in predictable order hungry sleepy or bored addressing these issues came to be my primary responsibility he was in the habit of one nap per day but also subject to awakening in the night and crawling into my hammock for comfort at first i found this startling and then after a while oddly natural and even reassuring certainly he slept better than i did accepting his immediate environment with a childs equanimity even though he did keep asking about his mother on food he stated his likes and dislikes plainly the bread dates and fruit i fetched him were fine but he had no use for olives chickpeas or pickled fish fortunately he was both weaned and trained to the toilet though it took some persuasion to accustom him to the ships bucket we used as his boysized head with cheerful curiosity hed follow pirates to the vessels real head under the bowsprit watching them do their business above the pitching waves with a scientists concentration bodily functions had unending fascination for him and i gave long and learned lectures about the relative merits of privies latrines necessary houses heads buckets bushes and the tavern wall he took enormous pride in mastering his own bucket and i daresay its a more useful skill than most of what we give medals for keeping him entertained and out of mischief was my biggest challenge since i had to warn him off the gunwales ratlines and guns and away from swinging booms and fingerpinching halyards the dog he avoided on his own fortunately some of the pirates after their initial apprehension adopted him as a kind of pet they amused themselves by teaching him quick games i found he could be kept occupied for an hour or two with a few musket balls and a belaying pin to knock them about i created a simple dice game he took a liking tothe point was to jump the joints in the ships decking to the count of the dice and i always let him win i was oddly proud and worried that hed inherited my gaming instincts where you live he asked a lot of places actually where mama it was his favorite subject i met your mother in egypt i told him she was helping a man take a shot at me but then i claimed her as a slave of sorts and it all worked out in the end shes very clever mama say you brave did she now i couldnt have been more flattered if id been inducted in napoleons new legion of honor even if harry wasnt entirely certain what brave even meant i think id say resourceful and occasionally determined the real grit is in being a mama harry its a real commitment being a mama and papa well yes i suppose i should have been here or there had i known about you but my original home is across the ocean in america so i visited there i was looking for woolly elephants i was have you ever seen an elephant i mimicked the beast using my arm for a trunk from castle it hurt a man my goodness was it an accident mama wouldnt let me see well that shows we have to be careful dont we if we get in a scrape ill take you down to the hold and tuck you among the spare sails you absolutely must stay there you hear when its safe again ill come get you whats a scrape oh just some unpleasantness i dont think well have any am i pirate i think you are harry a boy pirate anyway if youre on a pirate ship who pretty lady he pointed to aurora why shes a pirate too and not one you want to get close to shes not a nice lady like your mama she gave me sugar did she now that little bit of favoritism annoyed me i didnt want aurora making friends with my son if you get hungry you come to your papa dog bad and bad man walks funny rememberfind a hiding place in the sails chapter twentyfive id half hoped we might run into an american frigate on our way to syracuse given that malta was on the way but i didnt see our flag anywhere if morris was fighting a war he had an odd way of doing it we breezed past the british outpost as if in a regatta and pointed for syracuse that ancient city on sicilys eastern shore that had been fought over by the athenians romans vandals goths byzantines arabs normans germans spanish and just about anyone else who happened by it was founded more than seven centuries before christ about the same time as rome and was presently ruled from naples by the bourbon king ferdinand under the protection of the british navy syracuse in short was a place so thoroughly besieged shelled occupied surrendered and liberated that i had a hard time believing there was anything left to find there but recycled rubble with luck wed poke about realize the whole thing was a myth and aurora would goodnaturedly grant us all our freedom i knew better of course the old city of syracuse is on an oblong island that is connected by bridges to the mainland theres a fort called castello maniace at the citys outer tip its guns commanding any ship trying to enter or leave the harbors this island called ortygia is what wed initially mistaken for a narrow bay on the palimpsest map theres a large harbor on the southern side and a smaller one to the north and then the new town and villas run uphill on the mainland occupying a pieshaped wedge of land that culminates at the epipoli plateau its a perfect centrally located place for a city and the ancient greeks had built eighteen miles of walls long since dismantled and stolen by farmers and contractors to enclose all its suburbs and estates now in the buildings of ortygia are threeand fourstory houses of honeycolored limestone with red tile roofs the old town dominated by the spires and domes of its primary cathedral the duomo there is more gay color in syracuse than in muslim tripoli more whimsy and more charm bright blue fishing boats bob at its quays painted stucco has hues of yellow and pink and the homes have wooden shutters of ivory green blue and lavender wroughtiron balconies allow the citys damsels to step out to water fringes of flowers and pose above the chaos of cart donkey prancing cavalier farm wagon and fancy coach i saw all this playing the english tourist sir ethan gage in the company of my cousin the lady aurora somerset both of us kept in european costume from clothes the pirates had pillaged and stored in barbary that this brought back memories of auroras incestuous relationship with cecil somerset is an understatement and the charade made me queasy aurora treated it as a grand joke we pretended this pairing because our pirate corsair couldnt very well tie to the town quay so instead we were rowed ashore at a bay down the coast dragut took pirates to do some preliminary scouting at an old greek fort called euryalus and came back reporting he found no mirror but that it was a ruin perfect for the necessary rendezvous what rendezvous i asked if we find the mirror we need help getting it and reassembling it the captain said but first we have to find it somewhere in or around this city correct as best as i could tell for your sons sake i hope youre right assuming we find it how are we going to take it without having half of sicily at our heels castello maniace will blow your corsair out of the water if it comes to fetch the mirror an interesting problem you should apply your mind to if you want to save your sons life remember ethan our fate is your own aurora hired a carriage that took us to syracuse in style all of us pretending to be on holiday during the european peace harry came along as my son with me widowed should anyone ask osiris was our servant a limping ogre vowing quietly to hurt horus should i voice a wrong opinion or fail to endorse their latest skulduggery dragut was auroras manservant and bodyguard lest i be tempted to try to strangle the girl fortunately our tight little contingent of domestic bliss was able to leave her slobbering mastiff behind i hoped sokar choked on a sailors femur by the time we got back we were to search the city for clues and then rendezvous with more of the pirates in that ruined ancient fort of euryalus greek for nail head this castle reputedly designed by archimedes himself had nonetheless fallen to the romans in record time which made me wonder again if the mirror was simple myth but how to explain the peculiar mural at akrotiri on thira the new italian city of syracuse had long since buried the ancient greek one and there was little sign on ortygia that archimedes had ever walked there one clue of continuity however was built into the citys cathedral on the central piazza the duomo had a baroque facade erected after one of the periodic earthquakes that ravaged sicily but its sidewalls incorporated the pillars of an ancient greek temple to athena it was a pragmatic recycling of faith and architecture that reminded me how new beliefs entwine with old its said that the gold of her statue would catch the morning sun and serve as a beacon to sailors when they were miles out to sea a waiter told us on the piazza as i kept trying to keep horus in his chair instead of crawling around on the pavement i dont know how mothers keep track of their scamps while our duomo is closed in the greek temple was open to the air maybe thats where archimedes got his idea for his mirrors i theorized what mirror papa the brightest mirror in the world thats what were looking for his little face beamed with delight aurora looked bored her halfhearted attempts at acting matronly reminding me of a folktale witch whod just as soon pop a child into the oven to be playing the english squire with aurora dragut and osiris was more than a little bizarre i supped with a woman i loathed she was absolutely imperturbable to my hostility and gloom acting as if ours was the most natural reunion in the world she knew this annoyed me and enjoyed the annoyance hamidou searched me periodically to ensure i carried no weapon and made certain i was aware of cuviers dueling weapons in his own belt lest i try something rash osiris loomed over harry cain and abel had a cheerier partnership at least propriety required that aurora and i have separate rooms given that we didnt pretend to be married otherwise i was forced to fake fond union there was no question of escape your sons fate rests with our success or failure aurora said quietly over glasses of port in the evening after little harry had been packed off to bed in my room osiris standing guard like a golem in a nightmare find the mirror or condemn your family all we had is an old map showing the city it proves nothing then think where would the greeks or romans hide it where would the templars find it how has it been hidden for two thousand years i sighed well archimedes got the idea from the atlanteans perhaps or whoever it was that lived behind the mirrors protection on thira maybe the greeks even found a mirror already ancient ten thousand years old and brought it to syracuse who knows but the romans adopted every military idea they could find and would have taken that one if it had workedunless archimedes hid it away the roman commander claimed the scholars death was an accident dragut said an impulse by a common soldier who didnt recognize the famous greek but maybe the mathematician really died for not telling them where the mirror was it could have been melted down or thrown into the sea not destroyed aurora insisted or the templars would never have been interested think like archimedes ethan you know more than youre telling us the romans had an army to find it what did they miss how the devil should i know because your sons life depends on it you think it helps when you keep threatening my innocent child youre the obstinate one not me ive asked for partnership since our beginning i sighed and now you have your wish she smiled cold as an iceberg exactly i actually had an idea above the city were the old greek theater and the roman arena half buried now i remembered a horseshoe shape on the map could that refer to the old amphitheater and then there was that angled line from the old greek fort to a cross on the island of ortygia this meant something to the men whod drawn it there were also stone quarries from which the ancient city had been built we hired a schoolteacher for information and were told that invading athenians had been imprisoned there many dying a ghastly death from hunger exposure and thirst these limestone cliffs above the city were also riddled with caves it was no place for a twoyearold so i reluctantly agreed that osiris could keep my lad occupied playing with the ducks at the fountain of arethusa a freshwater spring that emerged near the edge of the sea in ortygia the ancient pool had been abandoned as a watering hole and recolonized by birds that harry squealed at every time we passed the ducks made up for his instinctual distrust of osiris the rest of us purchased lanterns and explored the quarries as if enthralled by ancient atrocities theres something ghoulish about tourism the grottoes were pleasant escape from the heat of summer the quarry pits shady from orange groves and musical from the trilling of birds i kept my eye out for obvious burial places or hiding spots but it seemed to me this was the first place any invader would look we separated to make the task go faster dragut satisfied by now that i intended to cooperate to safeguard harry i explored one quarry cave after another each as empty as those rooms on thira there were no murals either by midday id wearied of the task and took a break i was trying an orange in the high grass under the cliff walls wondering where the mirror might really be when a sound crept into my depressed consciousness music like songbirds i realized but this was human an ethereal melody that seemed to be floating off the cliffs a woman was singing with a voice of angels and the sweetness shook me out of my lethargy here was grace embodied by sound sweet deliverance from my depressing captivity and this ancient quarry prison i had to discover who the source of such loveliness was i made my way toward a towering cave in white cliffs shaped like a gigantic pointed ear its opening a good hundred feet high this was the entrance to a deep cavern with a flat sandy floor and it was from there that the haunting aria came from the sound was amplified by the walls giving it a depth like a heavenly choir the song was italian a strain from an opera i walked in my eyes adjusting to the dimness what magic in a womans voice given the right place yes there she was in the rear of this excavation lost in reverie her voice lifted like an offering who could it be and so i stealthily advanced she turned and it was aurora i stopped confused the idea such music could come from my archenemy had somehow never occurred to me nor the notion that shed ever sung in her entire twisted life yet there she was a little flushed lips parted eyes alight and i was suddenly jolted with memory of my initial attraction to her on the canadian frontier she had an overpowering bewitching beauty a sexual power that swamped the senses and blinded the mind i still hated and feared her but i still wanted her tooand silently cursed myself for it there was a moment of silence then i dont often sing but the acoustics were irresistible you surprise me again aurora we dont know each other ethan not really everything went badly too quickly in america but we could you killed my lover namida you killed my brother people die ethan for all kinds of causes but the quest for knowledge is eternal thats what we have in common why do you want to pretend that why do you resist it its no different from your attraction to astiza when you wanted me on lake superior you couldnt have me now that you can you repudiate me which of us is confused how lovely she was and how dangerous i shivered and hoped she didnt see it i did want her but i also wanted to kill her and would do so in an instant if horus and astiza werent at risk why hadnt i insisted on staying with astiza in the first place three years before then none of this would have happened aurora stepped close her scent a mix of perfume and sweat from the days exertions i could learn to be a mother too do you think ive never wanted children do you think i dont have feelings like you she grasped my arm i could be like other women ethan i could and for just a moment i glimpsed the desperation beneath her steel i shook free aurora the last thing youre like is other women harry has the good sense and instinct to be afraid of you hell feel different when i make him a prince the stubborn yearning was pathetic the determination unnerving you both dont know me not all of me i knew enough and looked away we should find hamidou and decide what to do next i said for lack of anything better to say the mirror is here somewhere i can feel it she said some great bronze thing as bright as the sun bringing fire like prometheus and remaking the world somewhere were going to find it ethan and possess it together chapter twentysix draguts appearance saved me from having to continue that disturbing conversation we gave up on the echoing cave its walls too smooth and featureless to hide anything outside we climbed through tall grass and the hum of insects to the crest of the white quarries and looked back at the city below the mediterranean was dotted with sails and i tried to imagine some mirror harnessing the suns power to set them all afire if this ancient invention worked why did syracuse lose i asked all weapons have vulnerabilities dragut said perhaps the romans came at night when there was no sun perhaps it didnt work in the rain and perhaps there was treachery aurora said there is always someone willing to bargain away a city to save his own life she gave a glance as she said it which annoyed me or bargain for the life of his innocent family i replied did even my captors hold me in contempt for helping them but for medieval knights to be interested the mirror must have somehow survived aurora went on somehow archimedes knew the city must fall and he hid his machine there is no record of the romans capturing it he secreted the mirror and either the templars never found it or they did so and hid it again you saw the map ethan youre the key she smiled again as if that might forestall any mutiny but the map didnt show anything obvious not even a picture of the mirror itself these pirates were chasing a pipe dream of opiates and legend i tried to remember the parchment we ate its taste all too vivid well theres the cathedral i pointed downhill toward ortygia and the towers and domes of the duomo there was a cross on the map at that point i believe we could have found that landmark without your help dragut said drily there was also a castle or fort on the map probably this euryalus the one that archimedes supposedly designed where is that this way dragut led us up a ridgeline past a tall blocky mill to a plateau above the quarries he pointed to a ridge in the distance its up there i saw a ramble of broken stone with farms on the hill below there were also the ruins of an old aqueduct that appeared to lead toward the mountains i considered a moment and then held my arms out with my thumbs pointed skyward one was aimed at the fort the other at the cathedral several miles away that line from one to the other should be the roughly angled line id seen drawn on the old map i walked to the lip of a low cliff and looked down below were the ruins of a greek theater built into the limestone hillside this was the horseshoe on the map i figured the nearby caves might be the humps drawn on the old parchment numbers might be measurements but where was the squiggle that was the river this was dry country what is it youre seeing aurora asked what are you looking for i ignored her listen i said to dragut do you hear water it sounds almost under our feet we climbed back down to an earthen platform that formed the top rim of the greek amphitheater at its rear was a limestone cliff about forty feet high again pocked with caves the largest of these was directly behind the center of the theater a halfmoon with a stream issuing from a dark tunnel in the back the water fell into a pool contained by a stone wall the rock behind the little waterfall was bright green with slime explain this hamidou a spring he guessed perhaps thats why they built the theater here the citizens would make their hot climb for a performance and at the top have fresh water to drink they didnt bring the theater to the spring aurora said they brought the spring to the theater this is below that aqueduct we saw it feeds a tunnel that leads to this pool she pointed the water probably goes on to power that mill there and then flows downhill to the citys fountains clever water power is just the kind of thing that would have fascinated archimedes yes dragut said he invented a screw to lift water into irrigation canals so perhaps he engineered this which means he might have known this aqueduct and tunnel intimately i studied the cave mouth the water was pouring out of not big enough to hide a shipburning mirror however the other two watched me ponder not sure if i was onto something or deliberately misleading them i wasnt sure myself but i enjoyed that they were forced to trust me as much as i distrusted them well there was a line on the map that angled at this stream i dont have the slightest idea what it meant but i think it might be worthwhile to take a look inside the very fact that roman soldiers would most likely not look inside a giant water pipe intrigues me youre going to climb in that hole yes hand me a lantern when i get up to the entrance how do we know you arent going to try to run away through the tunnel aurora asked because your henchman holds my son my dear your perfidy your greed your cruelty and your ruthlessness are all keeping me perfectly in place i smiled sweetly and hopped over the low wall to splash across the thighdeep pool to the little waterfall as i expected it was slippery but by working up one side i was able to pull myself the ten feet up to the tunnel mouth black as a nuns habit i squatted water running past my boots and called back to the others now a lantern i dont like underground places but i do have a certain expertise theres pride in having a skill besides cards women and wine dragut handed me up a lamp and i began duckwalking into a passageway four feet high water splashed to my knees the tunnel seemed wholly unremarkable carved for the sole purpose of delivering what i was wading through i was exploring because i didnt know what else to do i left daylight behind the others shouted but i ignored them squatting and thinking in the dark it was good to be by myself for a moment but this cave crawl seemed pointlessuntil i saw a sign in the lantern light and my heart jumped a fat templar cross etched into the stone no archimedes did that two and a half centuries before christ was even born some medieval knight had crawled in here too for what now i went more slowly looking carefully the limestone was slick cool and featureless finally i saw a glow ahead was the aqueduct ending already no there was a shaft of light from above i awkwardly made my way to it thighs aching and looked up there was a carved crevice in the rock about one foot wide extending across the ceiling of the tunnel it rose a vertical pocket like the sheath of a sword toward the surface of the plateau wed stood on earlier at the top stones had been placed to close most of this shaft so that the opening to the sky was only a foot square too small for people to fall into or climb out of so why make the pocket so big there was nothing in it i crawled on and in a hundred feet there was another slit same as the first carved upward in the ceiling and another and another i counted six before finally stopping the shafts served i assumed to equalize air pressure and encourage water flow in a channel that barely sloped they also let in light for maintenance yet each one had been hollowed to enormous size and then closed back up at the top it made no sense unless it did to archimedes i reversed course and crawled back out the tunnel skidding down the waterfall and landing in its pool with a splash i climbed out soaking dirty and puzzled you took a long time its a long tunnel i poured water out of my boots there are manmade crevices in there that might have hidden something i drew a circle in the sand and lines across it suppose you divided the mirror into sections like a pie perhaps you even cut each section into two or three lengths not cut said aurora they were hinged to catch and focus the sun the result would be narrow slices there are air shafts in the tunnel in which the pieces of a dismantled mirror might have been hidden might dragut asked theres nothing there now i did see a templar cross chiseled into rock this medieval order you want to emulate got here ahead of us i think we may be too late no aurora said then why hide a map in such a secret place on thira and make a signet ring marking it the knights found the mirror but had to conceal it again until their investigations were completed perhaps they didnt know yet how to reassemble it or were waiting for a military base to deploy it from perhaps they decided it was such a terrible invention it ought never be deployed she ignored me if the mirror had been reassembled and used there would be a medieval record of it if it was destroyed there is no need to draw a hidden map if it was shipped away to another city they would not have drawn syracuse its here i can feel it here not at euryalus the abandoned greek fort we searched there said dragut no some place more accessible than that from which the mirror might be more easily shipped yet somewhere it would never be disturbed somewhere sacred somewhere sacrosanct somewhere unsuspected she walked to the edge of the ancient theater and looked at the city below somewhere like a temple to athena the greek version of egypts isis built in bc after the greek victory over the carthaginians at himera the continuity of temple into cathedral would appeal to the templars why else mark its location with a cross on the map she turned to me ethan i think our weapon is hidden in the citys cathedral its duomo where i dont know how will you ever get it or get it out of town i told you to ponder how we might slip by castello maniace dragut said how can our ship get safely away i shrugged any lateenrigged corsair is going to be a primary target you need a decoy noyou need a second ship a sicilian ship with your own as a false target youve got to allow the sicilians to sink the isis so you can escape with the other he considered and nodded sly see we are becoming partners ethan gage chapter twentyseven the piazza in front of the syracuse cathedral is one of the loveliest in europe elongated and artfully irregular its slope following the natural contours of ortygia its border is fine threestory stoneandstucco buildings that provide a harmony of grand entrances high windows and iron balconies the facade of the duomo itself is a baroque confectionery of pillars statues arches scrolls angels eagles and enough additional architectural frosting to decorate a wedding cake the cathedrals side is much plainer a largely blank wall interrupted by the old greek pillars of what had been in turn a pagan temple christian basilica arab mosque and everevolving cathedral inside the hodgepodge continued greek columns norman arches and baroque side chapels a circular window with a thicklimbed cross reminiscent of the muscular signature of the crusading knights that i saw in the aqueduct cave shone in the sturdy wall above the vestibule i had a feeling most any prayer would work in here thick as the place was with the ghosts of intertwined faiths what this place papa harry and osiris had rejoined us a sanctuary i hoped it really was whats a sanry where bad people go to be better and good people go to be safe are we bad not you harry youre a good boy he nodded solemnly and safe a few old women sat in the pews waiting for the confessional and the one person the priest who had to listen to them an old man desultorily swept dust with a stick broom from one corner to another and then back again except for its mix of architecture the duomo seemed grand but unexceptional the mirror must be long gone aurora without even thinking about it i whispered then your little family will be destroyed crossing herself with holy wateran act of blasphemy given her character that i half expected would be answered with a bolt from heavenshe played the english tourist again slowly circuiting the side aisles while counting pillars and arches she sauntered as if a cathedral was her most logical environment in the world and smirked at me as she did it every intimacy had become an act of reprisal but even she had respectfully murmured i noticed light filtered in through small stainedglass windows its dim glow supplemented by votive candles burning as offerings to the saints the place had that church smell of old wood wax dust incense and water used to mop down the flagstones there is no crypt i asked the priest she whispered as we followed along we can see the roof beams ourselves eliminating an attic the walls are as thick and plain as a fortress but this sacred site is what the templars would have chosen im certain of it the spirit of a dozen religions is here the knights would applaud the continuity of faith but where ethan where youre the one with the knack for finding old relics my only knack is for getting into awkward situations like this one but i didnt say that i wandered about with harry looking for who knows what struck by how the norman plainness contrasted with a central white altar that seemed spun out of sugar the three other chapels were jewel boxes of marble and gold castles and cathedrals are where men put their energy ive found war and the afterlife but i saw no hiding places for mirrors just angels saints and miracles on the ceiling everyone up there floating about in flowing robes and pointing portentously if only real life were so weightless i was tired of old legends and would give this one up in a moment except for harry he toddled along holding my finger awed by a place so big and shadowy so i looked counting the old greek columnsten on one side nine on the otherand marveled at the craftsmanship of the artisans one chapel had steps of rose granite a silver altar that glowed like the moon and velvet tapestries like the raiment of apollo high above painted on the ceiling were cherubs and bearded patriarchs half of them looking like archimedes it was all quite grand and meaningless i recognized no particular christian story my eye was about to skip on when i noticed the central oval in the design highlighted by a small ocular window that let in a cone of light cherubs floated there four baby heads looking down on three more fullbodied angels the trio looked as uncorrupted as little harry their naked bodies strategically draped with red ribbon id seen the same in a hundred churches and would have paid no more attention except for what they were holding there was a sun in this painting beaming down with yellow rays and it was being caught by what looked to be a hand mirror or magnifying glass a mirror radiating its own rays i remembered the ring fouche had shown us with a second dome on the inside and the letter a angelus angels i squinted upward trying to make sense of the scene a whitebearded notable of some sort was pointing with a staff toward a wall or was he pointing beyond it i looked down on the rococo marble masterworks that made up the walls i suddenly realized was a most peculiar inlaid piece of art a dagger was crossed with a palm leaf represented by different shades of stone above was what looked to be a chalice but a chalice with two eyes of the greek kindthe solemn almondtype they painted on their shipslooking across in the same direction looking at what i saw nothing in this chapel to hide a mirror but then i remembered the chapel next door where the old man was pointing i walked to it unlike the first alcove this one had a dome like an upsidedown saucer painted not with cherubs but adult angels smoky from centuries of soot a dome like any other except it had the diameter and depth of a parabola reminiscent of the shape cuvier had guessed archimedes mirror might take i looked up a dome to hide a fearsome weapon could it be i beckoned to aurora imagine i whispered if the templars built the mirror into the ceiling to hide it until the time was right for retrieval the ceiling encased up there bowlside down look again at the signet ring i showed her the cherubs and staff and eyes her face brightened as she paced rapidly from the one chapel to the other and then back again ethan i think you have it she hissed too bad the templars were clever enough to hide it in a place from which it could never really be taken built right into the skin of a sacred church in the middle of syracuse hidden in plain sight they must have done it after an earthquake when the duomo was being repaired they put the entire power of the church to work protecting their discovery aurora quite brilliant really impossible to steal sandwiched in a false ceiling she murmured yes well weve done our best its too bad im sure the weapon is all very interesting but the knights have always been a step ahead havent they since its safely sealed away can harry and i go free now young horus she smiled but hes going to help get this for us the baroque chapel with silver altar and red tapestries had two low and narrow doors at the back casting a quick eye about for any priest aurora darted to one shielded herself with the rich fabric and tried its latch it was locked so dragut brutishly forced it the pretty wood splintering in a wound that would have made gabriel weep a narrow passageway behind the main wall led sideways toward the rear of the church that would do us no good the other hurry the pirate snapped that latch free too and this time there was a spiral staircase going upward aurora reached for harry but he shrank against my leg frowning she then beckoned to me i hesitated hoping we might be discovered and rescued by a mob of angry monks but wed deliberately chosen a time in the somnolent afternoon when no masses were scheduled i picked up my son and quickly crossed to the broken door and the stone stairs where we go papa up ill hold you he thrashed his way down out of my arms no walk and he led us all happy as a monkey just behind him the votive candles that dragut aurora and osiris had snatched threw a wavering light we came to a crude attic above the chapels we were at the edge of the adjacent dome with room only to crouch where a roof eave came down it was a cats cradle of old beams and buttresses dusty cobwebbed and spooky i wondered again how long before a priest or prelate discovered our trespass and roused all of syracuse against us it was creepy enough that harry lifted his arms to be held again i knew wed need your whelp aurora said peering into the dark crevice between interior dome and exterior roof give me the boy certainly not hurry or do you want to spend all day up here waiting for a prelate to discover that broken door she pried my son from my grasp and set him on the floor taking out a stick of sugar now horus do you like candy he nodded solemnly i think you should have some but theres something clever i want you to do to earn it only you can do it because youre small enough to wiggle where big people cant i want you to crawl up the space here and scratch what you find with this little knife she held out a penknife then bring the knife back to me and you can have your candy hell cut himself not if the urchin does what hes told her voice gentled to speak to the child only big boys are allowed to handle knives but i think youre very big for your age i want you to carefully crawl up this little slope on top of the ceiling here and when you can go no farther then rub this knife on whatever is blocking you dark my child said perfectly reasonably he was as confused as i was you wont have to squeeze far and ill hold the candle to light your way it will only take a moment aurora are you insane think ethan if the mirror is hidden in the dome it must be sandwiched between ceiling and roof but before i start taking this cathedral apart i want to make sure its actually there and i cant squeeze into the sandwich to see horus can its not unreasonable for your bastard to be useful for once what if he gets stuck then well jam you in there to pull him out stop complaining and help me i sighed and squatted harry this edge is sharp i showed him the knife you have to be careful hold it like this i formed his fingers around the handle rub the blade against whatever stops you and then crawl backward to papa can you be brave will i get candy yes will dog bite me i sighed no he smiled rather excited by the importance of his task he took the knife held it ahead like a probe and wriggled up the narrow space between the ceiling of the dome and the rafters of its tile roof overhead i could still see the soles of his shoes when he called it stops what can you see dark it was almost a whimper rub the blade and come back for your candy aurora called nothing happened and she swore it has to be there osiris said with more hope than proof we have to be sure eyes it was a yelp and harrys little feet kicked i roared and reached in to grab his ankles but dragut gripped me and then there was an animal squeak and my boy was still again harry remember rub the blade on the dark part for your candy aurora called after a moments hesitation we heard a raspy scraping and then he was wriggling backward dragut let go of me and i caught his ankles and helped pull him out harry held up the knife proudly its edge gleamed yellow with scratched flakes of bronze or gold its here aurora exulted her eyes a glaze of greed wait theres something more i said the blade had hairs on it horus he beamed then and pulled from his shirt where he had tucked it the dead body of a slain mouse he had stabbed the little monster to death by thunder my son was an achilles candy i handed it to him hands shaking my boy had the makings of a fine treasure hunter i realizedthe worst curse i could think of get the rite aurora told dragut and then ready the ships as ethan suggested thanks to him and his bastard were going to blow this ceiling apart chapter twentyeight the crumbled ancient greek fortress of euryalus sits at the crest of the epipoli plateau at the apex of the old north and south walls its battlements pointed west like the prow of a ship we rode rented horses to the forgotten ruin after dark aurora having changed from traveling dress to riding clothes well get help and then youll save your son as if i could believe anything she said the ruins seemed deserted when we approached warm wind blew off the mountains to the west bending the tall grass and dogs barked from farmyards far below in the distance we could see lamps from the city and anchored ships six miles away bats flew against the last glow of twilight and the first stars were faint in the evening haze i wondered where one would make a secret camp here when suddenly the ground opened like a mouth this is the old moat one of three that fronted the fortress dragut said theres a ramp over here we were swallowed as we rode cautiously down passing through a short tunnel to the bottom of the old greek excavation fires reflected from a tier of arches on the side of the moat and i realized that my captors confederates were waiting here in the forts underground chambers out of sight of any sicilian peasants above we stopped the tails of our horses flicking and then a hooded man came from one of the caves and grasped auroras bridle greetings to our astarte our ishtar our freya lady of moon and womb the risen eastern star our dove and our lioness well that was a little much greetings dionysus i bring the fool as prophesied and his pup has indeed played a role as foretold all is happening as it should and soon well begin to inherit the true powers of the ancients i startled at the introduction because a gypsy fortuneteller had once called me the fool who sought the fool the primitive wisdom of enoch and the longlost god thoth here the label was again like that longago tarot card may the gods grant us the courage to grasp such power the will to wield it and the ruthlessness of true conviction isis and osiris are listening to our prayers even now dionysus she swung down from her saddle as dozens of other hooded figures crowded the mouths of the fortress tunnels to greet us pagans again and if i tripped over many more of them in these bizarre adventures of mine it would be enough to take holy orders this bunch was lunatic to a man and woman i guessed but none the less dangerous for that dragut took me into the arcadelike tunnel that ran the length of the moat and gave access to caverns behind tunnels led deeper into the ancient fortress and torches flickered back there in ancient times i guessed these passages allowed soldiers to move from one part of the fort to another out of sight or catapult shot now they served as a dandy warren for bandit clans like ours there were at least a hundred of auroras confederates gathered a few of them muslim pirates but many more european these newcomers wore black gray and white robes over the more conventional dress of their nations harry clung tight as a limpet who these people papa the local asylum a hundred candles illuminated the grotto with smoky light animalheaded gods had been placed in niches and pentagrams were drawn in the sand there were muskets pikes cutlasses and axes stacked in corners and pipes and rams horns for music great coils of rope were stacked along with kegs of gunpowder and twists of fuse the cloaks and hoods gave a sinister anonymity to the gathering as if nobody wanted to be recognized as part of such foolery where did these people come from aurora you told osiris in paris that you were curious about the egyptian rite she replied here we are drawn at my summons from the lodges and temples of europe this is a rebirth of templar and pythagorean wisdom ethan of babylonian astrology and cabbalistic mysticism these men and women are some of the finest minds in europe and unlike other scholars we are open to new ideas and experiences we have dukes and duchesses savants and theologians merchants and sea traders highborn ladies and brilliant courtesans they are here by merit we induct tradesmen as readily as aristocrats if they have proven themselves in the study of hermetic lore and the willingness to undergo ceremonial trials there are english french german italian and spanish united by their thirst for knowledge and reform what kind of reform the kind that comes from establishing our own rule were a superior order as far above the common man today as judges among the apes it is our privilege and our burden to reform this planet and to exterminate as many of the unilluminated as necessary unilluminated ancient truth is there to be rediscovered but some turn their back on it or refuse to recognize what must be changed the obstinate will be disposed of the rite will initiate a pure society where everyone agrees on truth by eliminating anyone who doesnt thats a basic principle of governing one achieves harmony by unanimity there is nothing more chaotic or inefficient than people who question their rulers doubters by definition are not part of the exalted race those commoners who survive will serve as slaves to our priesthood i see and am i exalted that remains to be seen and youre going to achieve this consensus by burning all the worlds navies the world will be better without any navies except ours a pirate navy a navy of entrepreneurs mystics and seekers of the light and what are all these fanatics doing here aurora they are not fanatics they are the holiest of the holy the ones who adhere most faithfully to our cause they are patriots ethan patriots who want to rediscover the secret powers of the civilization that came before our own and bring back a lost golden age we want to walk as the gods walked with their powers and sensuous freedoms we will do whatever we wish with whomever we choose and our slaves will rejoice that our tyranny is a thousand times sweeter than any liberty in todays myopic world when we finish our investigations we of the rite are going to be incapable of wrong and will rule with perfect understanding well have visions through our opiates and enlightenment through our ecstasies we will be gods ourselves perfect beings and you can still join us you and young horus and astiza i had to put a brake to auroras fantasies her lips narrowed if you still want her after having seen the light here it was then bored aristocrats passedover scientists shunned deviants bankrupt merchants indebted gamblers poxed libertines the eccentric and the wicked all had finally found family in this monstrous perversion of freemasonry founded by the charlatan cagliostro more than a generation before this bunch wanted magic and technology yes but even more they wanted to persecute every man and woman who had ever snubbed them how sublime to be convinced that everyone who disagreed with you was your inferior how satisfying to deem yourself a chosen race without need for the scruples of lesser men it was audacious and ludicrous and yet what if we did find some death ray from old archimedes what if my own nations small navy was about to burst into flame because i ethan gage was helping this menagerie of megalomaniacs along i dare not do it except that little harry was clinging to my neck eyes instinctively wide at these robed conspirators and then there was the dark snuffing shape of the attack dog sokar padding in the shadows how could i get us safely away by playing along until chance offered escape were going to return to syracuse aurora said dionysus will lead a parade of penitents our own egyptian rite army into the city to aid us theyll pose as pilgrims coming to celebrate the feast of the assumption when mary rose into heaven hamidou will have the new ships ready and bring them to the city at the precise moment well break the mirror loose even if we have to bring the entire duomo down to do so youre going to blow up a church during a catholic holiday just part of it as quietly as possible this is balmy aurora give it up even if its there you cant get at it or youll be sunk if you do well get at it you already suggested a way to get past the castles guns so that your child is not stung with flying splinters you can plot the details with hamidou while we conduct the ceremony of baal here then youre going to help me steal the fire of barbary her eyes gleamed well erect it in tripoli ethan on karamanlis ramparts and when it is ignited by the sun well have taken the first step toward world harmony she turned from me to start readying some ageold occult ritual the muslim pirates eyeing this blasphemy with disquiet harry whispered in my ear i want mama so do i son so do i chapter twentynine once more i was breaking into a church in the middle of the night committing so many sins on this quest that i feared id find the mouth of hades in the most literal and unpleasant way in addition to common sacrilege i was assisting pirates and fanatics i had dragged my son into the worst kind of danger i was betraying the interests of my country and i had gone back on my pledge to my three friends to keep our map secret and this was my record when trying to do the right thing if i ever consciously turn to infamy my soul will be so threadbare that it wont fill in a gale we used a bar to break in through a side door of the duomo from the via minerva auroras monstrous dog coming with us this time on an iron chain other rite members passed through the citys dark streets like a procession of pilgrims and then hid in the shadows of the duomos vestibule crouching to wait by its twisted pillars entwined with carved grapevines inside the church nave seemed even higher and plainer in the midnight gloom while the silver altar of saint lucia glowed like ice in starlight every footstep seemed like a transgression every footstep a heresy the dogs huffing wheeze was like an invasion of older beasts from demon times we crossed to the chapel and the door that had led us upward its lock was still shattered but a wooden bar had been nailed to close it dragut took out a pry bar and pulled the nails a shriek in the night suddenly there was a shout by the grace of god stop an elderly priest was hurrying toward us from the shadows of the main altar half dressed and agitated one arm was lifted either in supplication or anger and his shouts echoed in the vast space what are you doing blasphemers aurora froze for only a moment then sokar strike the dogs chain was dropped and the animal whipped away running silently at the frantic holy man dashing toward us its metal tether skipping on the floor i tried to cry warning but draguts hand clamped over my mouth the dog leaped a blur in the dark and then the priest yelled and went down sliding backward on the stone floor as the animals momentum carried them toward the sacristy there was a savage snarling muffled screams and the sounds of bones snapping under powerful jaws the priest thrashed wildly his agony muffled by the animals gnawing of his head and then the poor man was still the dog trotted back with a selfsatisfied growl its jaws bloody little harry clung terrified thats not a dog its a monster my voice was shaking youre damned for all eternity all of you sokar protects an older finer religion it is men like that who will be labeled sacrilegious and eliminated thats it sokar was snuffling as osiris patted his head i quit ill have nothing to do with this i resign before we all go to hell you cant resign or ill sic my dog on your son you know you cant quit not now and not ever youre one of us and the sooner you help us the sooner we can leave syracuse so nobody else has to die aurora please i groaned someday youll see the beauty of our desecration there was a click as dragut held one of cuviers pistols to my head to reinforce the point and a growl as sokar shook his massive head blood and spittle flying were all partners now the pirate reiterated for a band of sybarites perverts addled mystics and amateur magicians the egyptian rite proved frighteningly efficient at rigging the demolition of a sacred chapel with the priest dead dragut opened a main door and auroras confederates swept in like a silent tide pulling ropes gunpowder and wrecking tools from under their robes directly beneath the dome was a small shelf running around its circumference high above the chapel the heretic monks daringly crawled out on this oblivious to the thirtyfoot drop to string ropes and place charges of gunpowder a web of stout line was tied horizontally to form a net to catch whatever was blown free this was no attempt at delicate surgery it was a quick snatch and run before the good citizens of syracuse realized we were sabotaging their principal place of worship banks of votive candles were lit to provide lurid illumination the work was done in choreographed silence there was a last scramble up fuses were unreeled to the chapel floor and the hooded men waited for her order each holding a candle aurora walked to the middle of the chapel looked upward at the placed gunpowder and pirouetted beneath the dome and its dark angels arms outstretched as if to catch the mirror herself now the fuses were lit sparking and smoking and the rite members backed into the main nave aurora was the last to come points of fire danced upward toward the chapel dome and a low hum rose up from those assembled a hivelike chant what if you destroy the mirror as well our readings say its sturdy as a shield besides theres no other way we dont have the men to seize and hold this city while we chip it out this wont just wake the town it will wake the dead then they can wave goodbye to a relic they didnt even know they possessed the light from the fuses disappeared and there was a moment of suspense while we waited then a staccato roar as the circle of charges went off even sokar jumped plaster and stone erupted downward destroying the grimy angels in the ceiling and a stinking cloud of smoke and dust rolled out from the chapel into the main church then with a screech something clanged and fell we ran through the choking fog and peered upward through the haze a disk vast and round was lying on the net of ropes that had been strung across the chapel it was bronze twenty feet in diameter and bright where its metal had scraped as the mirror came loose my heart hammered two thousand years after archimedes was slain by a roman sword his most terrifying inventionor was it a copy of an even earlier inventionhad suddenly been rediscovered hurry lower it aurora shouted every moment counts bells began ringing in the city some of the rites monks pulled pistols and muskets from their robes and crouched by the main cathedral entry looking out at the dark piazza beyond others clambered up to the mirror ropes were cut and slowly the makeshift hammock and its burden were lowered to a marble floor covered with debris high above the joists of the domed ceiling jutted like broken branches the prize was about half an inch thick and shaped like a shallow upsidedown bowl nestled inside this bowl were more bronze panels hinged inward from the rim so that the mirror looked like an upsidedown folded flower the rites henchmen lashed a hawser cable around the rim to make a crude tire then more ropes to pull the mirror upright onto its edge some of the monks were dancing with excitement and their chants rose in volume the brass weighed a ton at least it trembled a giant wheel men on both sides helping balance it like a wobbly plate it was rolled out the duomo doorsjust fittingand down the steps to the piazza a dozen of the rites hooded monks had to corral the mirror just to keep it from careening away while attention was fixed on the rolling mirror i crouched in the ruined chapel and hastily scratched a word on the dusty floor tripoli i straightened before osiris noticed picked up harry and followed the crowd outside torches appeared where the via santo landolina debouched into the square and we heard shouts to stop the citys constabulary guard was coming and no wonder we might as well have brought an orchestra for all the noise we were making wed desecrated the citys duomo had a dog eat one of the local priests and were trying to steal something too big to fit on a hay wagon shutters were banging open all over syracuse the rites monks halted for a moment hesitant guns half raised looking to aurora for an order then there was thunder grapeshot rattled down the length of the piazza and into the advancing italians a number fell torches winking out dragut had hauled a cannon from one of the ships and fired it down the length of the landolina come do you think youre a frozen sculpture he shouted to the robed pilgrims roll the mirror roll it he was waving smiths blunderbuss the muzzle of which was smoking as well give me a weapon i told aurora i need my rifle back youll get it when you prove yourself we retreated as the monks did the rites members pushing the giant disk so that it began to wheel downhill toward the eastern end of the piazza that street led to the fountain of arethusa the natural spring where horus had played with his ducks there was a quay adjacent two ships waiting there dragut turned to me now well see if your plan works gage there were more shouts behind and gunfire began to chase us bullets pinging and passing by with that peculiar hot buzz the breath of their passage makes survival exhilarating one rite member yelped and went down others pausing to help him leave him aurora shouted the mirror the mirror its anthony she pointed a pistol at her wounded follower and fired the man jerking and then lying still none can be left alive to betray our plans the others began pushing the mirror even faster i sprinted ahead holding young harry sokars baying had started dogs barking all over the city and the child clung to me in confusion bewildered by the excitement but intrigued too yes there the new ship was just as id suggested and dragut had promised i bounded aboard a squarerigged brig the barbary ruffians had captured its crew set adrift in its boats zephyr its name was and as id proposed auroras isis was in tow behind for sacrifice i looked back and heard the pirate cannon go off again keeping pursuers at bay like some vast coin the great bronze mirror came rolling down the street chased by the monks as if it were a childs hoop its weight and bulk made a grinding noise as it turned just beyond us at the castello maniace fort at the tip of syracuse torches were flaring as that garrison came awake it would be their guns wed have to slip past to clear the harbor if i wanted to keep my son from drowning my trick had to succeed i stood by the stern rail as the mirror was wheeled across a wooden gangplank and maneuvered between main and mizzen a dozen men gently lowered it to lie on the deck the platter so big that its rim extended over the gunwales on either side once the rite members and their pirate allies piled on board dragut had the gangplank rotated and lashed to make a bridge between main deck and poop so sailors could get across the top of the mirror lines were cast off sails blossomed and oars crabbed the merchant vessel away from the dock fortunately there was a night breeze and the canvas bellied even as carabinieri soldiers and outraged priests charged the quay where wed been moored two cannons went off from the corsair being towed scattering our pursuers again our ship broke out the flag of the kingdom of the two sicilies while the pirate craft unfurled the banner of the tripolitan pirates it was a ruse i prayed would work long enough in the dark to keep my boy from harm harry remember when i told you to go hide in the sails in a scrape now is the time no watch he was spellbound too dangerous more sugar if youre a good boy and go below it was a few hundred paces down the seawall of syracuse to the fortress we must get past and i could see more and more torches flaring there men ran back and forth on the ramparts as the great land guns were run out they were pounders capable of ripping the bowels out of our tubby ship and its ancient cargo as we gathered speed sliding past the shallows at a brisk walking pace i turned to dragut now if you hope to fool them he waved behind us auroras corsair connected by a towrope that was invisible in the dark unfurled its own sail a bow gun loaded with nothing more lethal than old rags gave a sharp report as if shooting at us and we fired with equal pretense from light stern guns both of us banging away as if the pirate corsair were chasing the zephyr bits of burning rag flew in the air the monks and pirates whod jammed aboard the merchant vessel sank behind the gunwales to make us look lightly manned while behind us the scarecrows id suggested for the corsair were propped up by the handful of brave pirates left aboard the isis in the dark the impression was of a preying craft crammed with eager buccaneers the scheme was to make our ship look like a desperate fleeing merchantman and to concentrate the sicilian fire on the nearly empty corsair i looked anxiously at the fort the excited shouts within the castello died down as officers applied discipline door after door of the fortress gun ports banged opened we heard the groan of tackle as each behemoth cannon was hauled out its muzzle pointing at our vulnerable hull we tensed waiting for a barrage of fire that would gut us but none came now the corsair was coming abreast of the forts guns its tiny crew slipped into a cutter on the side of the ship and pushed off with oars in the dark finally there was a cry of command and a ripple of cannon fire thundered from the fortress metal screamed and punched through the towed pirate vessel as though it were paper heeling the decoy aurora swung her cutlass and chopped the towrope away even as dragut winced at the pummeling of the graceful flagship its rudder had been lashed and it began ghosting on a course of its own fuoco sparare the excited commands to fire and shoot could be heard from the fort more cannon balls crashed into the pirate crafts hull sending up showers of wood splinters the sail was slashed to ribbons ending the ships motive power and then the entire rigging cracked and crashed down spilling tackle and shredded canvas over the side the corsair began to drift and wallow cheers began in the fort not a shot had come our way another command and another roar of fortress artillery pieces of auroras old ship erupted a barrel of gunpowder went off and the vessel began to burn the flames made it an even easier target and more shot struck it solidly amidships a mob had formed on the citys shoreline and a fusillade of musket shots came from there too the crowd peppering the empty vessel and its scarecrows with bullets the corsairs stern began to settle wed slipped by the tip of the fort and were gaining speed on our way to safety aurora looked from the isis to the mirror a fair trade she murmured you destroyed my vessel ethan and i salute you for it thats the kind of ruthless wisdom well bring to all affairs perhaps they expected our merchant vessel to stop fleeing and turn around upon our apparent rescue from the destructive pirates perhaps they expected us to slow or dip our flag in acknowledgment or light a lantern or give a cheer to our saviors instead a score of pirates and monks clambered silently up our rigging to unfurl yet more sail faster and faster we slid into the dark the mirror of archimedes rocking where it balanced the brightest light was the burning corsair and it drew the eyes of fort and town ever more hypnotically as we faded into the night by the time the sicilians put out in small boats and realized theyd battered an empty target the skeleton pirate crew that had abandoned the corsair had hoisted their own cutter sail to race to catch up with us we hoisted them aboard and were out the harbor mouth reaching down the coast of sicily without so much as a bullet in our hull the islands greatest prize was ours to be resurrected in tripoli if the gods didnt want this why would it be so easy aurora told her followers they laughed now the barbary pirates could set the worlds navies on fire chapter thirty we sailed south across the gulf of noto apparently having confused any pursuit once we cleared syracuse i went below and found harry in the sail locker just as the sun was coming up both of us curled into the folds of canvas the little lad cradled in my arms but despite my exhaustion sleep eluded me having performed my part of the bargain by finding the mirror would astiza horus and i be allowed the freedom to try to find peace while the rite reassembled its diabolical machine my only hope was that i could warn the world in time to make up for the bargain id struck yet aurora dragut and osiris seemed more convinced than ever that wed become partners i eventually dozed fitfully i got up by late morning to see that despite their tumultuous night the monks couldnt keep away from the mirror they were inspecting it more closely and speculating how it might work the crew rigged an awning over the weapon as the sun climbed because even covered in dust and tarnish it was blindingly bright the pirates feared it might accidentally set their own rigging aflame we anchored that evening off sicilys southeastern tip at a small flat island called capo passero as the sun descended behind the sicilian hills to the west the rite members worked to better secure the mirror and prepare a celebration in the hold below oddly i found myself a pirate hero thanks to my idea to sacrifice auroras corsair to enable our escape even my young son cheerful after his sleep was celebrated as a swashbuckler in the making the attention pleased harry because they gave him a hat there was no pursuit from syracuse chances were that the citys ministers and priests were uncertain just what it was wed even taken so we risked some lanterns as the mirror was lashed more securely carpenters cut out a section of each gunwale so it could sit firmly on the deck while members of the rite began to sketch and measure the ancient contraption it was more complex than we initially imagined the main surface was shaped like a huge shallow bowl but it had been forged or hammered with a complex system of hexagonal facets like the pattern of a honeycomb a thousand small mirrors linked into one then there were hinged sections that folded like a closed flower over the main mirror if unfolded they would double its diameter they pivoted as well there was also some kind of engraving on the back dragut announced after crawling underneath it showed a complex scaffolding to support and turn the device with lines suggesting how to orient the mirror and its petals in relation to the sun its as simple as a magnifying glass and as complex as a watch he said the rites savants will have a challenge mounting this properly there are more ropes than on an opera stage hard to operate easy to sabotage i thought but didnt say that osiris will figure it out aurora said looking exultant shed finally slept too and emerged radiant her egyptian rite lieutenant limped around the circumference of the mirror to calculate and draw osiris and ethan together masterminds of a new age not the most natural of partnerships given that i crippled your engineer i commented a wound of battle no different from the one i gave you in america she said cheerfully wounds heal minds forgive right osiris well see what your electrician has to contribute yes my electrician your helper your sycophant your lover your slave im not any of those things i told him i and my family are free now that ive done my part of the bargain right and whats your real name when youre not made up like a eunuch in an emirate is it dunbottom lord lackpurse prince preposterous youre not entirely free aurora interrupted come you said if i helped you find the mirror youd let horus and astiza go there the bronze platter is to incinerate whom you wish now keep your part of the bargain oh young horus will not be sold into slavery and your egyptian wench can wander wherever she wishes but there is one thing more you and i must complete before we give her final leave from yussefs harem theres still unfinished business between you and me as i told you in america what ive done exactly what you asked ive decided that were going to be married ethan married i was as dumbfounded as when presented with my son i thought she would break into laughter at her joke but she looked quite businesslike marriage will give horus a proper mother and legitimacy i will raise him as an acolyte of the rite and when he comes of age hell be a prince ready to inherit the world but we hate each other thats a crude simplistic way of explaining our relationship she fingered the edge of the mirror we repel and yet we attract we extinguish and yet we ignite we loathe and yet i will make you a little king yourself because i know how much youd dread such responsibility even as you long for me dont deny your longing i saw it in that cave of echoes in syracuse i saw it in my cabin on the isis were bound ethan and the success of this quest only proves it were chained by destiny im going to marry you and weld you to me forever and if youre unhappy with that as you watch me indoctrinate your sonwell so much the better her eyes flashed you will marry me so you must serve me all good humor had disappeared you will marry me so you can never escape again no wonder ive never galloped to the altar im a poor bet as a husband if you dont marry me tonight on this ship horus and astiza will be sold into the worst kind of slavery you can imagine and youll be given back to omar the dungeon master to break but if you do marry me and help us erect and operate the mirror youll rule by my side and your son will inherit powers that not even bonaparte has ever dreamed of king george and jefferson will be his minions and the emperors of austria and russia will prostrate themselves that makes no sense from one weapon this is but the beginning of the ancient secrets we are working to relearn and just the first mirror of a millionif we need them we will set nations on fire like your norwegians ragnarok his end of the world and you and i ethan will be freed of all law all hypocritical rules all morals all restraint well do anything we want with anyone we want to because we will have acquired the magic of gods who once walked this earth we will be perfect beings because it will be us who define perfection i knew she was balmy but not to the extent of this megalomaniac ranting she was a cult courtesan on a merchant tub of pagans and cutthroats and yet boasted like she was queen of sheba i wasnt on a pirate ship i was in a house of the addled i closed my eyes in frustration i wont marry you aurora youre not the mother of my son you will marry me this midnight or i will give your son to draguts moors this very night to begin to use as they will you will marry me or hear his screams and then youll explain what youve done to your egyptian slut of a harem whore before yussef sells her away to the worst kind of degradation this wasnt our bargain you never asked what the full terms of the bargain were and i couldnt tell you because youre too stupid to grasp the chance to be a king so ill force it on you and force you into my bed and in time youll worship me as i deserve she certainly had a high opinion of herself which is a problem with lovely women admittedly im sometimes guilty of the same vice i stared out at the sea thinking furiously no union consecrated by this rabble would be recognized anywhere as either holy or legal should i go along with this sham until i could finally get astiza and harry away from this treacherous bitch she wanted to marry me to torment me to keep me close enough to make every day a misery of regret for what id done to her brother climb into a bridal bed with a woman whod slain my friends i couldnt even pretend to function and yet what choice did i have with little harry still a hostage i was surrounded by a hundred hostile fanatics and fantasists and my former friends probably believed id betrayed my own country i will make it as hateful for you as it will be for me i dont think so ethan no i dont think there is any chance of that and she turned to osiris the ritual at midnight bring the boy so he can see she smiled back at me im ever so certain i can corrupt you both chapter thirtyone the moon rose orange over the desolate island as big as the captured mirror itself and then as it climbed and brightened the sea and ship turned silver the egyptian rite contingent had commandeered the hold below the main deck and its hatch glowed orange as well the pirates drew uneasily toward the bow and muttered to each other about serving under the shadow of satan pagans and christian blasphemers cutthroats they might be but aurora and the egyptian rite unnerved them these selfstyled exalted ones seemed more ruthless than any buccaneers and the moors were nervous i wasnt about to reassure these men and women are the disciples of hell dragut i told my captor youre dooming your own souls to consort with them silence american no man is more confused about good and evil than you do you think theyll use their mirror solely on christian enemies aurora wants to control the world and the ottoman turks are closer than europe youre equipping a diabolical monster who will prey on your own people i have no people i hamidou dragut rely on myself nonsense youve sold your manhood to powermad pagans as you are about to sell yours i have no choice my god to use my son to blackmail me into marrying her so she can play harridan the rest of my life wheres the sense in that those people obey a different law theres nothing we can do when were in their world and down that hatch is their world like all of us you made the bargain you must aurora promises she can give tripoli victory perhaps as they said it is written i dont think its written for a bundle of blasphemers to turn the planet on its head tripoli is going to infuriate england and france into a war against it dragut this woman youve allied yourself to is going to pull all of you down with her no she promises well be rich you cant see a future even when its a temptress i see the future and its all on fire and then osiris appeared stumping across the deck with that limp that continued to give me some satisfaction maybe i could chop away at other body parts too he looked at me with distaste its time american im to take you on a trip through the underworld to judge you worthy as dictated by the egyptian book of the dead underworld when the british cornered blackbeard in the carolinas he forced his crew into the hold and lit matches so the smoke and stink would give them a preview of hell he wanted his sailors to fear the afterlife so much that theyd never surrender to the gallows the inferno caused them to fight like demons out of terror we of the rite have a different kind of journey to purify and inform it will prepare you for aurora what im to be a vestal virgin now he gestured toward the hatch with its lurid light virginity i presume is out of reach what we weigh is your courage and your soul weigh my soul your own is a lump of coal this is about you and aurora sometimes the only thing to do is play along and look for the odd chance so i went over to the opening considered the haze of incense and smoke drifting from the hatch and decided to take a stroll in hades after all with osiris behind me i descended to the deck below hot and smoky from a hundred flickering candles what i encountered was a dreamworld populated by creatures from a pharaohs nightmare the rites membersi assumed thats what they werehad donned the heads of a witchs bestiary their robes were white black and scarlet and their heads were of jackals hawks serpents dogs and lions the eye sockets were blank cutouts utterly unrevealing and their cloaks so shapeless as to leave me uncertain if the wearer was man or woman beaks and white teeth gleamed in the haze of this hell and fingers decorated with long artificial talons clacked and tapped as they reached out for me pulling me down and in i coughed eyes streaming while they turned me in dizzying circles odd music pagan and primitive came from their pipes and drums some potion was pushed upon me and i drank increasing my disorientation finally i was pushed to stumble deeper into their gathering the manbeasts pulling at my sleeves a gypsy crone loomed and whether a noble lady in costume or some witch from the carpathians i know not she held a tiny brass scale shall we weigh your sins on one pan and a feather on the other pilgrim she asked with a glassy gleam to her eyes she laid a fluff of down the crocodile consumes those whose good deeds dont tip the scale in their favor i did my best she laughed shrill and disbelieving and then a dragon lurched out of the throng and grunted brought up short by a bright yellow leash not a dragon exactly but the biggest and ugliest lizard id ever seen it was some kind of primeval monster a good eight feet long with darting forked tongue and bright pink mouth lined with bloody teeth he was terrifying as a crocodile the beast lunged at my crotch nostrils flared and as i fell backward the assembly shrieked with delight this was a real animal its feet armed with wicked claws but nothing like id ever seen or imagined its skin was made up of glittery scales as dry and hard as chain armor and the monster smelled of rotted meat the beast was medieval nightmare come to life its tail swishing on the deck the dark forests of the world have all kinds of creatures that men have half dreamed of osiris whispered in my ear we brought this one from the jungles of the spice islands where the boundary between world and underworld is not as firm as we think nor is the barrier to heaven as absolute as established religions would have us believe strange beings watch us and sometimes can be summoned demons can give power i thought of napoleons little red man and shivered despite myself the animalheaded denizens of this hazy hold were murmuring at my hesitation and i was determined not to give them the satisfaction of seeing me retreat its just a damned lizard give your soul to us ethan and well erase the boundary between hell and heaven youll live in an eternal now of endless power over all men and all women and worship magic and depravity fiends and angels will be your slaves nothing will be forbidden and no whim denied evil will be indistinguishable from good and justice will be what you decide it to be isis and osiris the bizarre throng cried come with me past the dragon to a new kind of light we pushed toward the stern of the ship the great lizard regarding me with pitiless gaze as it yanked against its tether its tongue testing the air for carrion the animal was something from those depths of time that cuvier longed to discover i think the bestial past should sleep now filling my dazed sight were the costumes of ravens bears toads blind moles sharptoothed wolverines and horned bulls nostrils wide hands pawed me people chanted my name hands horny and scaled slid over the torsos of other costumed animals and snouts sucked on pipes of pungent smoke monsters caressed and turned in little dances and then i was being pushed up another companionway still choking on the swirling mist and into the ships stern cabin aurora somerset waited here another hundred candles blazed the cabin dancing with light hot and close shimmering silks had been hung to turn it into a persian pavilion the deck paved with the arabesques of intricate carpets corners were stuffed with pillows and bright scarves there were figurines of longforgotten gods watching from the shadows a jackalheaded anubis a hawklike horus a hideous gaping thing i guessed might be baal and of course a sculpted snake with gold and green scales that must be my old friend apophis serpent of the underworld and counterpart to the dragon nidhogg of scandinavia aurora stood erect draped with a blue velvet robe trimmed in gold the tumble of her red hair aflame in the candlelight her throat and ears and fingers were arrayed with egyptian jewelry and her eyes lined with kohl and her lips with vermilion she was regal as a queen and disturbingly exotic like some false copy of astiza i realized there was a half circle of men in the cabin who had formed behind me naked to the waist and wearing counterfeit masonic aprons below that they shuffled to push me forward osiris directly at my back and then i saw a small overdressed child to auroras left who stood in recognition as i came into the light and gave a halfhopeful halffearful smile and squeak papa harry was dressed like some kind of midget potentate with silly turban baggy pants and jeweled vest the absurdity broke my heart we were props in a play tools of an occult fantasy and i knew all this must end very badly thank the ghost of george washington that astiza wasnt here to see all this or old ben franklin either who had little use for mysticism or folderol although he did like a good party come over here harry i tried swaying from my disorientation no aurora said in a tone of imperious command stay my son the boy hesitated your father must come to us so forward i went as osiris slipped around to stand behind aurora and take the cloak off her shoulders with his own jeweled fingers the intake of breath by the men in the room was audible for the diaphanous shift of egyptian linen she wore cinched at the waist by a linked belt of solid gold left nothing to the imagination aurora was as beautiful as ever ripe as a peach and some trick of the light seemed to give her whitegauze body an odd glow as if she were supernatural she smiled triumphantly her look possessive behold isis and athena osiris cried the black madonna and the white goddess of the earth queen of the sea bringer of the light we elevate her to replace the fallen and consecrate to her a new husband and new son so that she might take her place as leader of the egyptian rite and founder of a sublime tyranny all princes shall someday bow before her and all knights of the rite shall be glorified as she is glorified and rule in her name she is mother she is harlot she is priestess she is seer and her mate shall be her servant for all eternity well the harlot part i could agree with but i was damned if aurora somerset was going to go around without proper underwear pretending to be harry gages mother or my master i was snapping more awake this entire ceremony was not just illusionary it was ridiculous it didnt surprise me that draguts barbary pirates were nowhere to be seen they knew blasphemy when they saw it and my guess was they were perched on the bowsprit waiting fearfully for allah to put a quick end to this ludicrous affair except no divine lightning bolts sang down and no false idols toppled i was stuck in a nightmare for which there seemed no awakening with a pack of enthusiasts who seemed several thousand years out of sync now a woman who first spurned me and then speared me was proposing permanent matrimony so long as it was certain that id be utterly miserable till death do us part shall we unite the sacredosiris pointed at auroraand the profane you can guess where he pointed next and i was none too flattered by it it is prophesied the men in the crowded cabin shouted shall we unite the wisdom and the fool it is prophesied earth mother do you take this seed the baldheaded bastard pointed at me i do i waited politely for the question to be put to me so i could spit back and waited but i was of no consequence you see which was auroras point then i pronounce this union made when it is consummated on the altar of apophis below and witnessed by the heir of unity here he gestured at harry now just a damn minute i began not at all amused at the notion i was supposed to perform with this witch in front of one hundred of her closest friends not to mention my toddler son even barristers make more sense than that but then a wooden bit was slapped in my mouth before i could object further and its leather thongs twisted tight against the back of my head a wedding custom different from most id wager aurora stepped near gorgeous as the moon repulsive as a serpents fangs and whispered her particular brand of venom in my ear this is the start of your eternal degradation my dear you will copulate with me before our assembly and our dragon to seal our marriage on an idolatrous altar if you dont i will hurt our son theres a way to put you in the mood youll see she continued im going to make you love me and then she passed by to begin to descend to the hold id come from and where people seemed to be losing clothing of their own in a heretics idea of mass and matrimony i was doomed to some kind of new humiliating captivity just marginally better than omars and then a voice called warning from the deck outside american ship chapter thirtytwo my wouldbe bride and her assortment of satanists and miscreants momentarily froze giving me time to duck past the oriental draperies and glance out the stern windows there my savior was under the moon black hull white ports gently pulling sails and a glorious fifteenstriped fifteenstarred united states flag bigger than a bedsheet that glowed with luminescent glory somehow the warship must have been near syracuse and gotten my dusty clue that tripoli to the south was our destination now here she came after us guns run out and i couldnt help but silently rejoice at the prospect of this whole lot being blown to flinders that would end my marriage then i remembered innocent little horus my boy and i had to get off this pirate tub and fast i began wheezing and mumbling past my wooden gag and at auroras sharp irritated command someone pulled the bit free i coughed taking breath above bare feet were hammering on the deck as the barbary pirates ran to loosen lines drop sails and raise anchor our few guns were run out but all knew our captured merchant vessel was no match for even this small american schooner youve got to let harry and me go i said the boy has no part in this her response was to snatch up my child hes in this by your blood and his deed youd better think how we can escape that schooner ethan because our sons life depends on it my son i told you in america we are nowhere near the end her smile was a grimace clenching my child to her with the determined greed of a child clutching a doll he squirmed against her body and its thin shift tired at last of the silly clothes shed dressed him up in but her grip was like iron outside there was a splash of a cannon ball and an instant later the report of the american gun that fired it they were seeking the range so i charged her i rammed aurora as if she were a stout oaken door my head deliberately butting into hers and poor harry screaming as we collided and went down silks ripping down with us the idols of longforgotten gods toppled and rolled on the deck flames ignited as some of the fabric caught from the candles and men began yelling and beating at the sparks i grabbed harry and tried to pull him away from the squirming woman beneath me but she clung like a cat ready to bite and scratch hissing hatred id bloodied her nose which gave me immense satisfaction then someone was lifting me off her and hurling me across the cabin i hit the bulkhead with a grunt and went down it was osiris looking murderous he wanted to hurt me for running over his leg and finally had his excuse i could feel our own ship beginning to move hoping to get distance from the american schooner dragut appeared in the companionway well lure them on the reef another splash and thud of a ranging cannon ball and then the roar of one of our own guns where was harry aurora had picked herself up and retreated into a corner to hold him like a shield looking hateful it was the only honest glance shed given me all evening suddenly i realized that the collapse of the silk trappings had revealed a rack of arms including my confiscated rapier i snatched it up smiling at its remembered balance maybe my fencing lessons would do some good after all osiris grinned as well evilly and stepped back to fetch from behind a settee his own sword a thicker cutlass it was shorter and more efficient in the tight killing ground of a ships cabin id given him an excuse to gut me and he intended to take full advantage by the same token i needed to get through him to save my son we sprang and fenced the blades rang and i let mine slide off to keep it from breaking against the heavier sword sidestepping in the narrow space and trying to remember what id been taught in paris it was more formal there the spacing neatly defined rules spelled out and without low ceiling swinging lanterns and little fires burning in the corners i stumbled over a statue of bastet the cat goddess and tried a strike at my opponents thighs but he parried then osiris came in after me trying to box me in a corner so his cutlass could do its work he chopped back and forth driving me backward but i was quicker than he and got in a jab toward his eyes that made him recoil as he arched backward i squeezed away trying to catch aurora shed picked up a silver knife to hold near my sons throat just give me the boy only wound him she instructed osiris i want to make it last papa harry was screeching barely weaned and he was in a duel and a naval gunfight what kind of father was i our waltz continued only the speed of my fencing keeping the bigger osiris and his heavier sword at bay he was beginning to pant and sweat i feinted again and again to force him to swing he was frustrated but no less dangerous for that so i stooped and threw baal at him it banged off the cabin wall near aurora as he ducked there was an opening to pink his sword arm he cursed spitting and hopped back on his good foot blood running down to the hilt of his cutlass now he looked frustrated the two of us circling while overhead the pirate crew was attempting to claw out of the anchorage he was tiringcutlasses are heavyso he came at me thrusting hard wanting to end it the heavier weapon took a moment more to swing however so i checked and parried getting more confident as aurora began calling for help finally i exaggerated his parry of my sword letting it slip sideways farther than i needed to and the riddle master whod taunted me in paris risked raising up his cutlass for a final blow it was just enough exposure as his blade started down i whipped mine back got underneath his stroke and took him through the heart he was a dead man before his cutlass sang past my ear and sank uselessly into the deck i leaped over his toppling form with my bloody rapier and rushed aurora just give me my son the cabin door burst open and dragut was there with what i realized was smiths blunderbuss i lurched backward and fell flat on the carpets as the big gun went off with a roar kicking the pirate backward a ball or more hit my blade and yanked the hilt from my hands while more bullets shattered the stern windows glass spraying out over the water i was stunned by the wind of the shot blowing over me the bloody heap of osiris beneath now i was weaponless aurora lifted a naval pistol and cocked she wanted me alive she aimed for my head at first and then shifted to my splayed middle aiming at that tender spot men prefer to protect at all costs then thinking better of itwell the girl had experienced me in bedshifted yet lower to blow off one of my knees and merely leave me shankless her mouth a cruel curl and then she shrieked and danced little harry had stuck her foot with her own silver knife the pistol went off its ball embedding itself in a bulkhead and even as she snatched my son by the hair in howling rage ready to do who knows what i leaped up with osiriss cutlass in hand id run the harridan through then there was a black blur a snarl and leap and sokar the dog from hell was crashing against me to bite even while a cannon ball blasted through the sidelights and screamed between aurora and me crashing into the opposite wall in a spray of splinters the dog was spun away from the wind of its passage and i was kicked by the concussion out the shattered stern windows to fall end over end before i understood what had happened i plunged into the sea harry it was a thought because i was underwater and couldnt scream i came thrashing up desperate to get back aboard to learn the fate of my son but the zephyr was already going sails full gathering momentum the savage dog up there barking madly at me from the broken stern windows the american bow chasers were throwing up spouts where the ship had just been my son if he was still alive was sailing away from me id lost the mirror lost my family and probably lost what little reputation i had by consorting with a witches brew of barbary pirates and cultists and then there was a crunch i could hear from five hundred yards off i turned sickened to watch the pursuing schooner lurch as it slammed into the reef where dragut had led it the collision was so hard that men pitched out of the rigging the foremast snapped at the top and came down in a tangle there were shouts curses and howls of frustration the americans had grounded and aurora and her acolytes were drawing off into the night headed for tripoli i hadnt stopped them from getting the mirror and i hadnt saved my own son i treaded water ashamed by my own impotence and then with no other choice began slowly swimming for the grounded schooner it took me a full hour to work my way there but it hardly mattered since the ship wasnt going anywhere until it worked off in the morning the wind had died and the flag that so excited me hung limply as if in defeat i came close enough to shout the ship had already lowered longboats to sound the reef so men hauled me aboard a cutter you a pirate i escaped them they let me clamber up the ships ladder to the deck there i came facetoface with lieutenant andrew sterett whom id heard about on the atlantic crossing as commander of this ship enterprise he had scored the only unambiguous victory of the war the year before by capturing the corsair tripoli killing or wounding sixty of its crew the enterprise had returned to baltimore last winter so the exploit could be trumpeted now here he was back in the mediterranean lieutenant sterett i gasped i trust you remember me we met in america and i sailed for europe with commodore morris ethan gage the american envoy he looked me up and down in amazement and distaste i dripped water like a dunked cat and my skin was spotted with cuts and splinters where the devil did you come from i was blown off the pirate ship its imperative we catch them and how am i to do that caught on a bloody rock i looked over the side wait for tide and wind of which there is very little another voice suddenly came from the dark that i recognized with a start thats the one it shouted hes the one i told you about and robert fulton inventor and fellow adventurer rushed up to see me robert youve saved me hes the one ethan gage the traitor who needs to hang part three chapter thirtythree my admiration for the military discipline of my nations small navy was dampened by the crews efficiency in rigging a hemp noose the sailors frustrated by their grounding on the reef seized with enthusiasm the idea of throttling at least one passenger of the escaping pirate ship sterett i remembered had become famous for running one of his own crewmen through with a saber as a response to cowardice during a battle between the constellation he served on and the frigate linsurgente this was an episode in the undeclared naval war with france that id helped put a stop to republican newspapers had clamored for steretts punishment but hed coolly replied we put men to death for even looking pale on this ship of course the navy liked that so much they gave him a promotion now he was to be my nemesis as well fulton explain to them who i am i already have hes a scoundrel american who threw in with the barbary rogues like another benedict arnold i dont care how badly omar tortured you ethanhow could you go back on your pledge to keep the mirror secret are you coward or traitor likely both sterett said sizing me up dammit man who do you think got you sprung free from that tripoli hellhole by a devils bargain didnt you just aid yonder pirates in stealing an infernal machine from syracuse when we expressly promised each other not to i did it to save your life death before dishonor ethan that was our pledge its your bad luck i volunteered to help these brave americans intercept your mission and my bad luck we were a few hours late he turned to sterett hanging may be too good for him he has very few principles at all then the devil will finish the job for us i struggled against the sailors holding me im stuffed full of principle i just fall in with the wrong kind of women and spend a little too much time looking for treasure since i dont have what youd call a proper career i drink i gamble i scheme but i do know something of electricity and firearms and i mean well it seemed a feeble defense even to me do you deny youre a turncoat to the united states of america and every man on this ship sterett had his sword out and looked like a farmer who has cornered vermin in a larder excitable people should never be armed on the contrary im trying to be a hero by throwing in with pirates cried fulton the rope cinched against my throat by trying to save my son that stopped them my boy who i didnt even know i had until a few days ago is still aboard that pirate ship and in the clutches of the weirdest bunch of cultists fanatics magicians mesmerists and megalomaniacs this side of the house of representatives his mother is captive in yussefs harem and if i hadnt played along theyd both be sold into the worst kind of slavery and you cuvier and smith would already be dead while you were running for the reef i just killed one of the more annoying of the bunch that osiris i met in marguerites palais royal brothel i gave aurora somerset a bloody nose and was plotting how to sink their whole scheme when one of your cannon balls knocked me overboard you and i and the fiery lieutenant here are the only ones who can fix things now but only if you stop pulling on this damned noose it was getting hard to talk you and us how by using your genius and my pluck robert to slip back into the heart of tripoli and destroy that mirror once and for all i nodded eagerly as if going back to that den of slavers and extortionists was the brightest idea id ever had the crew was grumpy about having no one to hang but a length i got fulton and sterett settled down enough to hear me out by the time we kedged off the reef there was no chance of catching aurora and dragut anyway and the ambitious lieutenant was interested in any proposition to erase the ignominy of running aground which is a mortal sin for any captain the navy reasons that with so much ocean it shouldnt be that hard to avoid the shallow parts how are you going to get into tripoli sterett asked skeptically commodore morris wont risk our squadron in those reefstrewn waters for the exact reason weve seen tonight its time we harnessed the ingenuity of our new nineteenth century i said my clothes stiff with salt as they dried ive been thinking about how to defeat this peril for a long time but its really robert here who offers the solution actually id only been thinking since they put the noose around my neck but the prospect of execution does focus concentration what solution fulton asked i addressed sterett my scientific colleague here has invented a vessel so revolutionary that it threatens to make all other ships obsolete i began you said thats not the way to sell the thing i ignored fulton its called a submarine or plunging boat it sinks deliberately like bushnells turtle during our american revolution and could deliver a crew of intrepid saboteurs directly into tripoli harbor the turtle failed to sink any british vessels sterett pointed out but fulton has advanced the technology a full generation why he told me he stayed underwater off brest a full three hours this submarine really exists its called the nautilus and is so remarkable that it may someday end war entirely sterett looked skeptical and fulton bewildered that i had stolen his sales pitch or make wars more terrible than ever i added suddenly fulton saw his opportunity ethan this is the way to prove myself to napoleon yes i remember you told me the french want to break the nautilus up but you couldnt bear to and sent the pieces to toulon to test in the quieter mediterranean heres your chance thanks to me i could still feel the abrasion on my throat where the rope had cut but i dont hold grudges except against true villains we pack the nautilus down to tripoli sneak into the harbor beneath yussefs palace and rescue astiza and little harry i nodded all we have to find is a set of adventurers willing to risk their lives in a metal sausage and cut their way through an army a thousand times their number sterett was looking at me with new respect that at least is no problem at all fulton said you have some volunteers in mind cuvier and smith of course theyre reconditioning my plunging boat they decided to wait in toulon in hopes of hearing news of your hanging before daring to face napoleon again ah its good to be remembered and me gentlemen sterett said youre not going to romp among the pirates without my ship in support my bully lads will say the same we may have to have a lottery i predicted just how many can we squeeze into this craft of yours robert three if we want room aboard to get your wife and son out of course some of us will most likely be cut to ribbons when we venture ashore so we might want four or five to start but then we need room for explosives too explosives i massaged my throat to blow up the mirror and the navy of tripoli maybe that damned dungeon too five against the janissaries and cutthroats of the bashaw of tripoli sterett said perfect odds by god gentlemen i am heartily tired of lurking at malta with commodore morris and positively thirsting for action gage id heard you were quite the hero but didnt quite believe it until now i have a hard time believing it myself my plan had been to sneak quietly about but sterett and fulton apparently wanted a noisier demonstration of american might well a battle tomorrow was better than hanging today if you dont mind ill get my family out of the line of fire first it is fire that will save your family mr gage the lieutenant said well so light up tripoli with hell and pandemonium that youll be able to rescue half a harem if you want to that didnt sound bad at all but no i had astiza hang it and no more business with harems except to get her out of one by the devil its complicated to be a father and suddenly responsible oddest thing in the world really but not entirely bad to have someone to rescue chapter thirtyfour im not sure what i expected of fultons beloved nautilus but the copper coffin he unveiled in a toulon warehouse did not inspire confidence it looked like a patchwork of green plating odd bits of dried seaweed and conspicuous holes where the leakiest of the iron bolts had been removed for replacement the contraption was twentyone feet long six wide and in cross section was the shape of a u with a short keel a propeller projected from the rear of the craft and a folding mast with booms and odd fanlike sails was lashed to the flat deck on top a round turret three feet high with thick glass windows jutted from the top its roof was a hatch allowing entry from inside the vessel came an unholy banging ive no doubt your invention will sink as planned robert i said the question is whether it will rise back again as prayed for it worked splendidly on the channel coast we might have torpedoed a british frigate or two if they hadnt slunk away he glanced at smith sorry william no offense taken the englishman replied cheerfully our nations are at peace now and here we are united against infamy and extortion and the day a british ship waits around to be sunk by a contraption like this is the day we might as well start speaking french our quartet had been reunited when sterett not waiting for orders from his unaggressive commodore rushed us to toulon to pick up fultons secret weapon cuvier and smith began as suspicious of me as fulton but eventually i persuaded them that id been faced with an impossible choice now we were cautious allies again it was destiny perhaps which left fulton unsuccessful at brest so he had the chance to prove himself at tripoli cuvier said optimistically and perhaps bonaparte had the foresight to predict we four would make an effective fellowship i thought it more likely napoleon had been happy to get rid of four eccentrics on a mission with slim chance of success but opportunity has a way of turning into inevitability your vessel does look a little worse for wear i judged are you sure its going to be ready ive got a clever little fellow working on it said fulton said he was something of an expert on all things nautical he even mentioned that he knew you gage me i knew no submarine mechanics and tend to stay away from people capable of honest work lest they make me feel inferior he probably heard you say id gone over to the pirate side and figured he could claim anything he liked since youd never see me again lets catch the look on his face when he pops up and spies me in the flesh cuvier stepped over and banged on the hull foreman your old friend has shown up after all the hammering stopped and there was a long silence then a shuffling inside and finally a head with dark wiry hair raised above the lip of the little tower like a mole donkey he inspected me critically they told me youd turned pirate or were dead it was i who was thunderstruck not this mechanic in fact i was so shocked that i took a step backward as if seeing a ghost pierre first astiza then a son i hadnt known i had and now this but why am i surprised the little frenchman said here i am readying a cylindrical death trap a perfectly absurd excuse for a boat and i have been asking myself who would be crazy enough to set out in an anchor like this and i thought well americans because i have met americans on my journeys to the wilderness and not encountered a snuff of sense in any of them and which american do i know who is the craziest of all beyond fulton there who is already the laughingstock of paris and of course such an imbecile would be my old companion ethan gage who conjures calamity wherever he goes yes a metal boat designed to sink it sounds absolutely like something donkey would be involved in this is no mechanic i sputtered more of one than you this is a french voyageur from montreals north west company i last saw him in st louis on the mississippi river hes a canoe man he doesnt know any technology more complicated than birch bark and beaver tail and what do you know besides thunderbolts you cant control and sorcery you cant perform plus the worst taste in women imaginable so we held each others stare and then began to grin and finally at last we laughed and he sprang from the submarine so that the two of us could lock arms in the kind of dance the north west companys scots do over crossed claymore swords chortling over our mutual resurrection wed survived and were together this was a good omen cuvier cleared his throat this confirms then that you have met before on the american frontier pierre was my companion when i searched for norse artifacts and explored the west hes the only man i know impervious to bullets well one bullet a ball from aurora somersets gun had been stopped by an egyptian rite medallion that pierre radisson had stolen from her sadistic brother cecil hed seemed to have risen from the dead then but later disappeared from our room in st louis id assumed hed gone back to the wilderness but here he was thousands of miles from where id left him i may have used up my luck he said but ive not used mine given that i meet you again what are you doing in toulon by poseidons spear this is sweet chance beyond anything i expected you made me curious about the world donkey it was too late in the season to catch the fur brigades so i decided to paddle home to montreal then there was a ship that needed a hand even though depending on sail is a womans way so i found myself in europe peace gave me the chance to get to france and by the time i learned where youd gone youd already gone there ah i thought but donkey has a way of drawing attention i decided that if i got to the mediterranean coast id hear of you soon enough and indeed a barbary ship deposits three exslaves in the middle of toulon cursing a mixedup american and i think to myself this sounds like the donkey so i go to work for that sorcerer therehe pointed to cuvierand suspect youll be along too by and by and here you are why does he call you donkey cuvier asked because gage cant properly paddle although the great pierre was beginning to teach him youre a donkey too all men who cant paddle a north canoe are donkeys and this craft mon dieu only sorcerer donkeys would come up with an idea as lunatic as going underwater and hire a french voyageur to reassemble it i said if this boat wasnt a sarcophagus before it certainly is now no ive been plugging the holes that the rust has left and using brass and copper instead of silly iron even better would be birch wood if we had proper trees yes pierre and his donkeys out to revolutionize warfare it makes perfect sense fulton was walking around his craft actually his work is not entirely awful we can finish making it seaworthy on the deck of your enterprise sterett were in a hurry then asked pierre i have a woman in danger i said he raised his eyebrows of course and a son not yet three years old i told you to think about what you were doing and weve got to stop an ancient machine that could give aurora somerset power over all the worlds navies aurora somerset that harridan is here too is this another grand portage rendezvous she followed me like you i am oddly popular and how long do we have to rescue this new woman and son of yours from that witch once we draw close only before the sun rises i suspect for when it does they can set the enterprise on fire chapter thirtyfive by the time we repaired and loaded the nautilus on the american schooner and approached tripoli it had been more than a month since aurora had escaped sterett in sicily taking little harry with her time enough in other words for the mirror to have been erected and tested could something two thousand years old possibly inspired by atlantean designs thousands of years older yet actually work we didnt want to be surprised by a beam sweeping out to sea confirmation came a different way as we approached the african coast we spied a wisp of smoke in the distance and cautiously closed realizing that some ship had been burning what we saw was a small brig low in the water her rigging gone and her masts blackened like trees from a forest fire the smoke drifted from a charred hull fire can start from a hundred reasons cuvier said uneasily and be put out in a hundred ways sterett said unless the entire ship ignites at once we lowered a boat and rowed across confirming what we suspected there was an awful smell of ash putrefaction and roasted flesh emanating from the vessel with burned bodies on the deck the name blanca suggested spanish origin although jack and staff had been incinerated on the starboard side was a circular hole three feet in diameter where the fire had eaten entirely through the wooden hull and caught the inner decks and timbers nothing stirred inside or out so its true then cuvier finally said by lucifer the mirror cuts like a cannon ball fulton added rather than test their infernal machine on a derelict they aimed it at an innocent merchantman crew still aboard i guessed it must have gone up like a torch and then drifted out to sea look at the helmsman there welded to the wheel he died where he stood this is utterly barbaric smith said theres nothing more painful than to die by fire so our timing will be critical fulton said we must sail my submarine in under cover of darkness dive propel ourselves into the harbor make the rescue and then retreat underwater to steretts schooner offshore if the sun rises and we havent destroyed the mirror of archimedes the enterprise will ignite like this ship and well all burn drown or be enslaved again gentlemen we must assault the most impregnable harbor in the mediterranean slip by a cabal of determined fanatics disable their most closely guarded weapon rescue a woman and child from the central harem of the rulers palace and slip out like a fish jolly good said smith infused with that mad english enthusiasm that has given them an empire im for paying that dungeon master back i am or we can just sneak about doing our best i amended im all for valor but cautious about suicide my experience is its easier not to shake the nest when going for the honey ive had the sailors help in making us some makeshift muslim garb for disguise youre a clever sort arent you ethan but a regular lion of acre if it comes down to a fight correct certainly i blinked wishing i still had my longrifle our small numbers must be our advantage smith went on the barbary scum wont be expecting an attack from a handful of men emerging out of nowhere little pierre here may be able to slip into places or unlock gates the rest of us couldnt hope to who are you calling little monsieur beefeater it is the littlest men who have the greatest hearts look at david versus goliath look at the little corporal now first consul of france we are each blessed in our own way and must use our skills to advantage well put cuvier said ethan with his head for women can head for the harem his voyageur friend can help free helpless prisoners smith with his blasting expertise can make a sortie toward the mirror fulton will steer and ill crank to create chaos in the harbor surprise confusion and darkness will be our allies and revenge and disruption our goal he seemed quite the bloodthirsty buccaneer for a biologist but then the french do have elan you agree we have a chance then i clarified if i was going to lead my friends on a rescue mission of my old paramour and illegitimate son i wanted success to at least be possible oh no but patriotism love and your own folly ethan dictate that we must try we hoisted nautilus off the american schooners deck with block and tackle and lowered it over the side it rocked in the waves like an ungainly copper log banging against the wooden hull the vessel seemed about as seaworthy as the bearskin coracle wed fashioned on the american frontier and three times less buoyant but it didnt immediately sink and fulton was brisk as a bunny as he organized our war party the voyageur will man the rudder because its tightest in the rear he said then gage to keep him company and crank the propeller when its time smith and cuvier will counterbalance in the bow ill stand in the tower to con the boat and shout directions to pierre well sail to the harbor mouth dive and creep now do any of you have a problem with claustrophobia in a dark metal cylinder heaving up and down in a restless sea we all raised our hands well bring along some cards then gage to a new way of warfare we all took a slug of grog the only way to get up the courage to drop into the contraption and then climbed down to the submarines flat slippery deck we pushed up the mast and fitted its boom extended the bowsprit and turned our metal coffin into a little sailboat the mainsail was peculiar a rigid fanshape like the arm of a windmill its color like that of the jib was brown the narrow shape is more easily lashed down when we dive fulton explained ill sail in close tomorrow morning to pick you up sterett called as we cast off you must destroy their weapon you saw what happened to the spanish ship if you dont find us said fulton as he waved goodbye then save yourself and off we went to tripoli sighting the gray coast of africa just as the sun went down i was pleasantly surprised that not only didnt we founder but that the submarine actually sailed on the surface like a smart little fishing smack more buoyant than i expected its tubelike shape gave it a tendency to roll but it had a fine bow for going into the seas and a rudder sufficient to set our direction the problem was that we were confined to the stovepipe that made up the interior of the craft while it had a flat floor it was still like voyaging in a sewer pipe the only daylight came from the open hatch and thick glass windows in the little tower where fulton perched to navigate the boat corkscrewed in the waves and the motion soon had smith vomiting the smell of which added to our own nausea for a brit he seemed to have an aversion to all things watery and nautical pierre considered our situation and as always offered his opinion while i am happy to go along with you because you are a complete idiot without the great pierre he announced it seems you have made the usual ill choices donkey im just trying my best first ive pointed out to the crazy american inventor there that metal does not float yes we are somehow bobbing but i hope this craft does not leak like a canoe because there is no pine pitch to repair it and it will plummet to the bottom in a very short time it might be better for morale not to speculate on such a possibility i said second you have thrown in with savants whom i told you in canada have very little practical use i have noticed these here seem to carry a great deal of useless information about rocks and extinct animals but very little expertise in assaulting a fortified pirate city a learned blockhead is a greater blockhead than an ignorant one ben franklin used to say just to give you the point pierre if it will shut you up third i see no cannon or rockets aboard or even your old rifle and tomahawk ive been reduced to borrowing american naval boarding arms a pistol and cutlass and we have some of fultons mines or what he calls torpedoes fourth you are to proceed if i understand the plan correctly to a guarded harem to rescue a female friend who happens to be the mother of your child suggesting not a lot of foresight into that matter either harems i am informed are full of women and there is no group more difficult to govern or direct cattle you can corral and buffalo you can stampede but women it is like making a file of cats and he sat back his argument at last made but it seems i said agreeably that ive rectified my bad planning by enlisting my old friend pierre radisson not only can he point out my faults but im certain hell find solutions for all the difficulties he just listed no one knows better than pierre the evil character of the enemies were up against and no one is happier riding in a copper sarcophagus to seek revenge against the very woman aurora somerset who shot him in the back he considered and nodded all this is true so i will put my mind to keeping you out of trouble donkey and doing so before the sun rises too high i do have a question for monsieur fulton however yes monsieur radisson locked as we are in a cramped chamber and unable to emerge without drowning just how do you propose to sink an enemy vessel ah it is quite clever if i do say so myself on board are three copper bombs each containing one hundred pounds of black powder and a gun lock to set them off protruding from my turret is a spear like a narwhals horn its butt end coming inside through a stuffing box as you can see oakum packing around the shaft keeps leakage to a few drips now we creep under the bottom of an enemy ship and twist the shaft by hand to drill it into the enemys bottom near its pointed end is an eye threaded with a lanyard that also comes back to the tower here after the horn is screwed into the victims hull we back off pulling the lanyard at the ropes other end is tied a copper mine as the lanyard threads through the eye of the narwhal horn the mine or torpedo is pulled with it until it is jammed fast against the enemy ship then a jerk of the lanyard sets off the gun lock and the explosion by that time we have backed sufficiently away to survive the concussion pierre looked dubious and if the torpedo goes off prematurely or the horn doesnt stick or the enemy hears us fumbling about underwater then we are probably sunk ourselves the inventor said it is fearfully important to get things right im sure we can all muster the proper intensity certainly we have motive for doing so the frenchman agreed fulton turned back to look out his tower i see the evening lights of tripoli a little to starboard frenchman do you think they might see us cuvier called up our sails are small and dark and our hull barely above the water fulton said we can tack close before submerging so we neared the port while tripoli is on africas northern coast its bay faces northeast formed by a protective spit islands and reefs the westernmost entrance is a gap in the reef just two hundred yards wide we sailed close enough that we could hear the breakers and fulton could judge our position by their creamy white then the inventor had pierre rudder us into the wind while he popped up through the hatch to swiftly drop and lash the sails and mast then he came down closed and locked the hatch and turned a handle there was a hiss and gurgle as buoyancy tanks filled archimedes himself discovered the principle of displacement that suggests how a boat may be made to sink or rise fulton said fish use the same principle in their swim bladders cuvier said and humans sleep in a feather bed i put in it grew even darker so we lit a candle we are now below the surface gentlemen and about to make history with an undersea naval attack without being able to see where were going pierre amended yes we are somewhat blind my compass is illuminated with bioluminescent fox fire an innovation first suggested by franklin for the american revolutions turtle so once again we benefit from the wisdom of ethans mentor from here well navigate by compass and then rise just enough to peer through the tower windows ethan and pierre start cranking our screw propeller cuvier and smith look to our guns and powder it was humid and close inside the submarine pierre and i were soon sweating as we cranked away how long can we stay down without any air the voyageur asked panting with this crowding three hours fulton said but i brought a copper container from toulon pumped full of two hundred atmospheres which was suggested to me by the chemist berthollet if released it should give us oxygen for three hours more if the candle begins to gutter well know we need more air there was no sensation of progress occasionally fulton peering at his compass would call a slight course correction once we heard a scraping on the starboard side as we grazed a harbor reef and we steered away finally the inventor told us to rest and he began pumping a lever that emptied water from the ballast tanks the faintest glow came from the tower windows as they cleared the surface of the water he waited a moment for the water to sheet away and then turned in all directions looking about then he dropped down to grin excited as a boy gentlemen were in the middle of tripoli harbor and no alarm has been raised he nodded to pierre good job helmsman and then he clapped his hands once with a pop now what do we want to blow up first the castle then the harbor i said smith can carry one of your explosive torpedoes and you can time your submarine assault for dawn blow up at least one corsair to create confusion with a final torpedo in reserve cuvier to crank and you to navigate robert but it is america that is at war with these rascals and we are americans are we not im afraid that as hopeless as this assault is ethan i must insist that i join you smith can crank and cuvier can steer the submarine ill carry a mine ashore because im the one who built it and know how to fuse it youre willing to give over command of the nautilus he smiled if i let the french play captain for a while maybe theyll buy her youll put in a good word for me with napoleon wont you cuvier and why does the englishman have to crank for the frenchman smith interrupted youre stronger with more endurance than our biologist you know as well as i do william that it is almost impossible to get a frenchman to do anything he doesnt want to do while an englishman will volunteer for almost anything particularly if it is arduous and disagreeable we must all recognize our national traits and whats the american trait to get into quite unnecessary trouble through idealism pride and the need to rescue helpless women right gage astiza is anything but helpless at any rate you two savants are the best to figure out how to attack enemy shipping in this harbor pierre has worked with ethan before and im a yankee as well our nation has declared war and now were going to execute it or die trying he swallowed and by god i liked him eccentric inventor or no i always admire a judicious man who masters his fear more than an enthusiast with stupid courage ill pick you up when you have the woman and the boy and you can put in a good word with napoleon yourself cuvier promised we leave nobody behind and can england and france cooperate i asked smith let this be a new beginning under the peace of amiens the englishman said im betting that bonaparte never goes to war with my country again perhaps france and england will even be allies cuvier said dont speculate too ludicrously but at least we can man this casket together to peace pierre said except for this little war here dawn is when our work must be done i reminded lest the mirror be used against us when the sea lightens surface slightly and listen when chaos begins ashore try to strike in the harbor if everything is timed perfectly we might have the slimmest chance nothing goes perfectly in battle you know that we were all quiet a moment but not for the other side either i finally said in gambling you dont have to be perfect just good enough to win the game lets put on our arab robes chapter thirtysix we maneuvered to the outermost boat in a line of docked feluccas and fulton pierre and i crawled out onto the fishing vessel clambering from one to another until we were on the stone platform of the harbor the nautilus sank out of sight yussefs palace was ugly as a chopping block and everywhere there were ramparts with the black snouts of artillery poking toward the sea up on a fortified platform just north of the castle facing the harbor was a shrouded round disk that was a deeper black against the stars that would be the mirror i guessed and very likely a thousand pirates and janissaries were between it and us pierre looked at the looming walls we have to climb these perhaps you are not a donkey but a spider i propose that we drink our way into the dungeons instead and make our way upward from our old home by the stairs do you remember the taverns robert aye the ones run by the christian slaves and prisoners for muslims forbidden to sell alcohol on their own i thought muhammadans werent supposed to drink either said pierre and cardinals arent supposed to have mistresses fulton said and yet half could give lessons to casanova all men are pious but find a way around their strictures have they repealed human nature in canada we men of the woods have limited experience but not that limited so were to become pious drunkards to get ourselves in the door i said he looked up a cleverer idea than scaling this fortress like all cities in all cultures tripoli had made accommodation between what men were supposed to do and what they want to do islam frowned on usury so the jews exiled from spain had become the bankers alcohol was forbidden so christian slaves could make an extra living by quietly providing it the practice had spread to the prisons themselves where entrepreneurs also provided the chance for the devout to obtain a prostitute pawn booty hidden from taxation or buy literature more stimulating than the koran the muhammadan town might be more orderly than a christian city but sin could be found among the jailers and janissaries as easily as at the palais royal accordingly we crept along to the courtyard that abutted yussefs prison and slipped into one of the grog shops on its periphery i ordered in arabic while scouting for our chance to get beyond the dungeon gates two guards in a corner were very quietly becoming inebriated and once i was sure theyd become sufficiently muddled i approached to refill their cups and propose a sale of opium drugs go with prisons like hand to glove with the cottage industries of the inmates devoted mostly to paying for the narcotics needed to make hopelessness tolerable a dishonest jailer can make more money selling to thieves than a thief can ever get stealing and guarding the miserable bagnios of north africa was a sinecure as valuable as being bookkeeper in a treasury these guards didnt trust me of course but they sensed opportunity and were greedy enough to beckon me to a locked door when passing through i jammed the keyhole with a nail to prevent the latch from closing and when the jailers bent to inspect my narcoticflour and ground tea id brought from steretts schoonermy companions crept in and clouted the drunken fools with socks wed filled with sand from the streets we hesitated then silently debating what to do with the two unconscious guards until i reluctantly drew my naval cutlass from under my robes and thrust it through both their bodies finishing them fulton gave a little groan we are at war gentlemen with fanatics who are holding hostage my innocent son and who hope to declare war on all civilization i said steel yourselves its going to be a long night they wont show us mercy either pierre said certainly they havent yet lets get on with it then said fulton swallowing as he looked at the dead apparently practicing war closeup was not the same as designing its machines and the deadly consequences of his genius were just occurring to him i wondered if archimedes had discovered that too had the old greek ordered the dismantling of his mirror to not just keep it from the romans but from mankind itself could his own king have killed him in frustration but first we take their pistols said pierre with the mood ethans in i have a feeling were going to need them and their keys i added help me drag the bodies out of sight i felt nauseated as we crept back into the labyrinth of dungeon tunnels under yussefs castle the smell of earth sewage and lightless corruption came back like a slap triggering old fear and we could hear moaning and the occasional insane scream then i reminded myself of astiza and little harry captive somewhere in the harem far above and resolved to blow this mouth of hades permanently shut by bringing yussefs fortress down on top of it let slip the dogs of war we passed several iron corridor gates locking them again to discourage interference or pursuit then a flight of stairs upward that i recognized as the way id been taken to yussefs palace to meet astiza i think our army of three needs to divide at this point i said robert somehow weve got to get your torpedo or mine to where the mirror is and set it off archimedes might have used a catapult he said perhaps something similar will occur to me how do i get within view if we can get you to the roof of yussefs storage rooms you may be able to look across follow this tunnel and hunt for stairs if you dont meet a sentry he drew his own cutlass or kill one if i do what is your assignment donkey pierre asked go to the harem where the women are of course thats where harry and astiza should be ill slip in find them and bring them down to go out the way we came and brave pierre who never seems to be given the job of rescuing harems of young nubile enticingly captive women brave pierre has the most important job of all take these keys and release as many prisoners as you can when we retreat their escape will create confusion while we make for the plunging boat beware pierre an ogre lives in these tunnels hes a brute known as omar the dungeon master and we want to avoid him a presumptuous title is he big and ugly like you bigger and uglier i dare say even homelier than our late giant friend magnus bloodhammer then i shall be david to this behemoths goliath i am the great pierre radisson north man and voyageur who can stroke twenty hours in a single day and travel a hundred miles before sleeping none can portage more weight than i or drink more or dance more splendidly or jump higher or run faster or more quickly charm a woman i can find my way from montreal to athabasca with my eyes closed id heard all this several times before then youll do fine in the darkness down here quickly pierre and quietly and run like a deer if omar hears you we need you in our submarine to remind us again of your prowess of course you need me those two savants you left there while they have undoubtedly concocted eight new harebrained theories of the history of the earth have probably by now lost all sense of direction if they havent sunk already well pierre will do all the real work as usual and meet you at the gates that lead out of this dung hole then we will work on your reform and so i turned to climb the castle steps and rescue my son and the woman i realized with a jolt that i had unconsciously come to think of her this way who was for all practical purposes my wife the climb was familiar taking me up to the reception hall where id met astiza i passed with disquiet a side tunnel that i remembered led to omars torture chamber then i opened the wooden door pushed aside the concealing tapestry and entered the throne room this i guessed was close to the harem the royal chair and pillows were as i remembered them shadowy in the darkness even the african cat was there locked for the night in its brass cage i could see the fire of its eyes as i quickly passed through and the beast made a rumbling purr i wondered if draguts dragon was lurking about too a lizard with the appetite of a polar bear in the rear of the cage a third eye gleamed and i realized a smaller cage held yussefs turban and emerald ably protected by his cat even the leopard earned his keep at the far end i slipped out into a quiet hallway hung with old brass medieval shields there was a forbidding stillness to the castle as if the building was waiting and i puzzled that i hadnt encountered more guards it was midnight yes but was i really this lucky where was everyone up a flight of marble stairsi must be at the top of the palace nowand there a eunuch doorman conveniently asleep in the depth of night there was a flask nearby and if he was caught in this dereliction hed no doubt be bastinadoed on the soles of his feet or hung from a hook on the castle wall i hesitated thinking of killing him but couldnt do it to a man already cruelly castrated instead i tore a drapery and jumped clouted his head gagged him and tied him tight another sharp clout put a stop to his squirming then i went to the wood and brass harem door and listened no trill of female laughter the harem was asleep i was ready to smash its lock with a pistol ball if need be but instead this door opened too clearly yussef was either not expecting an imminent american attackor had faith in his eunuch guards i slipped inside cautiously not wanting to risk a riot by startling the girls could i find the duo i was looking for if we could just creep away i hardly cared about the mirror it couldnt really work after all this time could it but it had burning that spanish ship as it could burn ours the harem was empty too i passed through an antechamber and entered the lovely harem court far more opulent than the merchants attic id once broken into in cairo this room had a central pool and a domed roof pierced by inserts of colored glass in daytime a rainbow of colors would filter down pillars ran around the chambers periphery to form an arcade beneath and balcony above and doorways opened to what i presumed were the separate bedrooms and kitchen of the women who lived here flowers filled a score of vases and lotus petals floated in the pool the place smelled of perfume and incense what would it be like when the concubines lounged and laughed the beauties of a dozen nationalities just lightly clothed limbs dangling in the pool breasts casually exposed gossiping as they brushed each others glossy hair smooth shoulders sweet hips their great almond eyes lined with kohl their lips picked out with focus ethan youre worrying about just one woman now and suddenly i had company there was the light tread of a slipper behind me to which i might have turned but at the same instant there was a growl ahead the bass rumble of a heavy muzzle flecked with saliva and blood sokar the grip on my pistol was suddenly slick as i realized why the castle was so quiet id walked into a trap ethan ethan so predictable auroras voice came from the shadows where the dog regarded me with its pissyellow eyes weve been waiting for weeks and there emerged the wolflike bulk of her brutish mastiff head lowered shoulders bunched we were going to let you turn the mirror on your own navy another voice said behind me dragut you could have proved yourself to us gage but now well just try it on you his tone was anticipatory as a gun muzzle as wide as a dogs mouth nudged my back please dont move because im holding your friends blunderbuss if my finger slips the blast will cut you in two hell of a mess in this pretty pool weve slaves enough to lick it clean if necessary chapter thirtyseven aurora stepped into better light holding my longrifle in a hand that also grasped sokars leash in her other fist was a second leash this one tied to two figures coming miserably into view the line led to a leather collar around the neck of astiza whose eyes were flickering to search for a means to fight back and then from her to little horus who was walking with a limp and looked tearstained and traumatized he brightened a little as he recognized me across the pool papa dog bit me i wanted to shoot the damned beast right then but if i did the blunderbuss would go off and astiza and harry would be finished my naval pistol was damned inaccurate at that distance anyway and the one id taken from the dead guards no better i might shoot and miss serves you right for stabbing my foot you wretched cretin aurora snapped her foot still bore a bandage i saw and i couldnt help but smile the apple didnt fall so far from the tree did it less than three and harry already made me puff with pride first hed stabbed a little mouse and then a bigger rat that dog wont frighten you much longer i called no it wont aurora said because youve doomed your bastard to the most hideous kind of slavery this slut who spawned him is going to be roasted by the reflected rays of the sun you can watch her catch on fire ethan just before we test the mirror on you thats what you get for killing osiris then well let whatever boat dropped you here come in close to rescue your blackened husk and set them ablaze as well bright as a bonfire you really should have been a dramatist a month ago i offered you the world and myself and now we only had to wait for you to come omar sent word that he had intruders that eunuch you trussed was playacting janissary guards let you stupidly slip by any friends foolish enough to accompany you should already be dead everything you touch turns to disaster and every person you befriend comes to grief you do not control the lightning but are lightning yourself a bolt of misery everywhere you alight which explains why im more than a little baffled by your attraction to me of course youre not exactly a saint nick yourself oh i will be revered never doubt winners are always honored by posterity the most powerful become gods and goddesses its the ruthless who are worshipped brave words when you sic a mongrel on a near infant and have me outnumbered a hundred to one youve never been anything but a bully aurora too much the tart to ever win a real man a dabbler in the wilderness dependent on her brother a female with the mothering skills of a gorgon and a sportsman with the shooting expertise of an english fop she stiffened her habit when hearing the truth you saw me shoot this gun in canada and she held up my own beloved rifle it had traveled perhaps fifteen thousand miles since its forging in jerusalem and my heart quickened when i saw it i can outshoot any man in this fortress you cant outshoot me remember what i did to your brother twice she flushed the one shot at cecil was lucky and the other almost pointblank astiza had gone still as deep water during this exchange waiting for me to make a miracle i saw one or at least a tiny chance im still better than you its my rifle now ethan let me prove it youve never shot against me you propose a competition im just saying its easy to boast when your opponent has a blunderbuss in his back and a hundred soldiers stalking him but at anything like fair terms youd never win especially in a shooting match she laughed and sokar barked pick a target aurora weve no time for this nonsense dragut protested now that we have him we have all the time in the world pick a target i looked and pointed upward that glass pane in the dome no bigger than a hand ill hit it before you and when i doyou have to give us a minute head start thats so absurd given your situation that id spit on it and you if i wasnt so certain im the better marksman lets make it interesting instead ill bet the head of your son no leave harry out of this but i secretly knew this monstrous idea of hers that id triggered was our only hope yes she said almost speaking to herself his terror from your absurdity hamidou keep your gun on gage because hes full of tricks ethan were going to put a glass flute on your little monsters head and aim for its stem ill go first and i guarantee i will completely miss the boy and clip the stem if his mother holds him still enough then you can have a turn and if by a miracle you break the glass more times than i do without blowing off the head of your child ill give you your little race with sokar in pursuit it will be amusing to watch him run you all down and hear the screams since i had to hear my brothers i like a girl with enthusiasms she tied my familys tether around a pillar with the assuredness of a sailor testing its tightness whore crouch and hold your child like a statue she ordered astiza if he twitches an inch one or the other of us might miss trembling her expression toward aurora exhibiting the purest hate id ever seen the woman i loved kneeled noose at her neck and took our twoyearold darling into her arms horus she whispered you must be very very still mama will hold you to be safe my boy was crying again completely confused by what was going on aurora put the goblet upon his head which wobbled as he snuffled and walked around the bathing pool to where i waited bringing my rifle she brushed my cheek with a kissit was like the lick of that reptile in her satanic ships holdand took my pistols from my belt tossing them into the pool with a plonk they sank out of reach then she turned and raised my gun with the assurance of the trained marksman the muzzle of my weapon was steady as a rock as she aimed i held my breath terrified that harry would bolt into the path of the bullet there was a flash roar and a high ping as the glass stem was clipped in two by the ball the cup of the goblet fell and shattered while poor harry screamed and wept astiza clung to him even tighter whispering in his ear there were shrieks and cries from the harems concubines no doubt jammed into the back of this complex by their anxious eunuchs the bullet had ricocheted above them the woman id once lusted after slammed the butt of my rifle onto the marble floor took out a cartridge of powder and shot and reloaded with the efficiency of a deadly huntress then she handed my weapon back to me first drawing her own pistol to aim at my head put the next glass on his head she called to astiza then she turned to me i warn you if that rifle barrel strays even minutely away from your wretched offspring well kill you in an instant and turn the two of them over to the slavers whats the matter aurora afraid i might equal you and that you cant get lucky a second time just shoot and miss and then beg for my mercy astiza and harry had absolutely frozen mother murmuring into her sons ear the glass flute was bright as a diamond remember if you do miss the game is over aurora said i aimed as carefully as i ever had drawing breath holding and then letting a slow hiss escape as i pulled the trigger the gun aimed at a target i could barely see in the gloom i fired the flash and bang cacophonous in the marble chamber the harem women screamed and the leash of my loved ones snapped cut in two by the ball as i intended the end of their collar flapped loose in the harem air our ears rang with the report of the gun for the briefest fraction of time everyone was frozen surprised at my shot then i popped the stock atop my shoulder and rammed my rifle backward catching dragut full in the face with its butt he reeled his blunderbuss swinging away i twisted to grab it and deliberately fell to the floor as auroras pistol went off the ball singing over my head i then swung my own piece like a scythe to try to break her ankles she jumped and fell both our guns empty now i scrambled up wrenching the blunderbuss from the stunned dragut run i cried i longed to use the gun on our tormentors but guessed id need it on the stairway outside the blunderbuss in one hand and the longrifle in the other i waited for my lover and son astiza tucked harry frozen and mute under one arm and dashed past us the end of her tether flapping then i was up and after her before dragut or aurora could recover their wits my longrifle felt as if a lost limb had been restored even if the weapon was empty in my left hand was smiths loaded thunder gun we burst out the harem door slammed it shut and hurdled the tied eunuch janissaries sprang up from where theyd waited in ambush on the marble stairs and i cut loose with the blunderbuss the gun bucked there was a spray of bullets and the gang of them parted like the red sea men screaming as they somersaulted down the stairs i swung my rifle for good measure knocking aside a couple of obstinate ones like tenpins then we were plunging down the stairs past them to the royal reception room below even as all the eunuchs began screaming behind us came auroras sharp command sokar kill and then to dragut get to your ship idiot and cut off whatever boat they have to escape i could hear the baying of the mastiff and the skitter of its nails on the marble flooring as it chased after us i slammed the throne room door threw its light latch and watched the wood stretch like canvas as the big dog slammed against the other side howling and slavering id little time to reload but i could buy a few seconds save our boy past that tapestry is a stair to the dungeon a companion waits there i had just time to pour powder but not yet ram patch and ball then there was a gunshot the edge of the door exploded into splinters and the frenzied dog burst through howling for blood my longrifle club met the dog midleap the animal grunted as i knocked it to one side of the room and i prayed id cracked a rib aurora burst through the doorway after her pet hair flying mouth wide as a banshees a pistol smoking and draguts sword held high ill kill you all but astiza instead of fleeing had thrust horus in one corner now she grabbed the edge of one of the carpets and yanked lady somerset fell cursing like a sailor and astiza pounced wrestling for the sword the women rolled bit and scratched they were a blur of struggling limbs and tangled hair fighting at a pitch of wild fury the dog came at me again as i fished for a bullet and this time it leaped to catch my rifle in its teeth chewing and growling i was knocked backward landing on the pillows and the beast was astride me one hundred pounds of quivering malevolence breath hot flecks of foam flying its growls primeval i tried to use the weapon to twist his head away from mine but its neck was as strong as my arms mama it was poor harry crying amid the chaos i could hear a frenzied snarling and realized that yussefs leopard was banging against its own cage frantic at the sight of the black mastiff that had invaded its domain aurora used the hilt of her sword to clout my woman stunning her and then tried to pry her wrists free of astizas desperate hands so she could run her through with the ferocious protective instincts of motherhood astiza twisted back and with a cry from both women the sword suddenly flew free ringing as it fell on marble tiles then the real havoc happened a blur of animal reflexes with a yowl the spotted leopard suddenly shot free of its cage and the dog launched itself off me to meet it the mastiff was as big as the cat and probably expected it to bolt but instead the leopard twisted and the two collided at the apex of their leaps spinning in the air if the dog was powerful the leopard was swift they writhed dueling with their jaws then the mastiff yelped suddenly terrified as the leopard caught at its throat the two animals tumbled over each other on the persian carpets the leopard hissing and tearing the dog frantically pawed the air its legs no match for the cats lethal claws sokar aurora screamed and heaved astiza to one side my lovers head striking a marble pillar harrys mother slumped dazed your bastard let the leopard out aurora crawled for her sword and then turned toward little harry her eyes completely mad as the boy shrank in the corner i finally fed a bullet in the muzzle and began ramming the shot but squeezing the lead down the tight barrel takes an eternity aurora rose like a crazed valkyrie wild with frustration as she aimed to stab my son and now i was scrambling to stop her trying to think of a distraction save your dog at my cry aurora twisted confused her purpose momentarily incoherent and then suddenly stepped toward the fighting animals presumably to kill the cat it was the only sacrificial thing i ever saw her do so the leopard sprang ten feet through the air in a perfect gyration of predation and flew past her sword arm to land against her body claws gripping flesh and jaws splayed wide to close over her face aurora didnt even have time to scream there was a sickening crack of bone as the leopard bit and her head disappeared under the animals behind them the ugly dog was in ruins its throat and flanks pumping blood aurora thrashed frantically on the floor yussefs pet leopard on top of her and pinning her down the beauty that had transfixed me in america was being clawed to ribbons each swipe leaving parallel red streaks and ribbons of flayed flesh her feet slid frantically on the rugs and marble heels making streaks of blood then the cat was at her throat her face had already caved her eyes gone i finally reloaded but there was no need to waste a precious shot as leopard and victim twisted her head flopped loose her neck bitten half through finally she went limp the big cat batting at her and growling and then there was a bustle at the door as eunuchs and janissaries crowded to see they halted abruptly at the sight of the freed leopard frozen by the bloody tableau i shot the biggest one a great goon of a mulatto guard and then the angry animal leaped again there was a shout as the guards surged backward in terror and the cat disappeared through the door we heard a fusillade of shots punctuated by snarls i picked up the dazed astiza to shove her toward the rear tapestry and escape but she staggered away from me and nonsensically grabbed an antique shield from the wall it was a carved and filigreed thing of polished bronze and probably quite valuable but the last kind of anchor we needed at a time like this had the blow to her head left her daft but then i saw my own souveniryussefs headdress from the back of the leopard cage i grabbed picked up little harry pulled astiza again and finally we staggered past the tapestry and through the hidden dungeon door i slammed home its locking bar before tumbling down these narrower stairs with my longrifle and blunderbuss shaken by the wild fierceness of what id seen astizas chest was heaving with exertion and shock papa i let lion out harry confessed good boy you saved your mama and me will it eat us its dead and so is aurora i told astiza whod finally set the shield down she was shaking with exhaustion and excitement above we could hear guards pounding on the door id barred and then shots as they fired through it it would hold until they fetched axes or gunpowder astiza closed her eyes and took little horus to hug even tighter by thunder the boy had pluck he was a clever little tyke too given to my rather improvised luck id just have to keep an eye out that he didnt copy the side of me im trying to reform i could hear her face breaking inside its jaws astiza said she shivered she was the wickedest woman ive ever met the old demons possessed her ethan the ones i thought had been banished to the deepest part of the earth the egyptian rite summoned the succubus back and they took over her soul and her mind bad animals papa theres wildness in fierce animals no human can come close to i said but unlike people they kill without sin she hugged me the three of us a tight cluster ethan i wasnt sure youd come back to have horus return and not you and leave my family i grinned im a papa now i didnt know what you were aiming at with that shot i didnt know what id do if i missed the tether if horus had been hurt i didnt want to live he hasnt had an easy time of it since he met me has he which is why id like a little more payback before we leave theres a mirror astiza big as a courtyard and theyre planning to turn it against the american navy have you heard about it in the harem all of tripoli has heard of it yussef is beside himself with pride weve watched its erection from the harem windows we have to destroy it before we go or it will burn the schooner coming to rescue us its reach is longer than a cannon shot is there a way to get inside the fort where it is i untied the collar from around her neck and cast it aside no theres a warren of streets between palace and fort and hundreds of soldiers and somersets fanatics please ethan for horuss sake lets go how much more can a child take we cant go the suns almost up and theyll set us afire we have to fight it through ive got a companion below who can help look after you and harry and another with a bomb to destroy the mirror robert fulton is eccentric but hes smarter than lucifer if we can get close enough well blow it to flinders she bit her lip i dont know if a bomb will do but i have a different idea its why i took this shield if light can be focused by one disk why not reflected by two maybe we can block the ray and then what turn it against them you carry the shield ill carry horus lets find these friends of yours and give the egyptian rite a taste of their own terror chapter thirtyeight i feared we might have provoked uproar in the tunnels below given the shooting and tumult above but the prison corridors were eerily quiet pierre had managed to release hundreds of men sharing keys with those captives fit enough to unlock still more comrades as the prisoners were freed they overpowered the guards not blocked off by the gates wed closed now they crouched silently in their oppressive hive trembling from anticipation waiting for the right moment to rush the entrance this pierre had instructed them must be just before we attempted to destroy the deadly mirror and escape ourselves for the harbor the chaos all of us hoped would shield each others flight true criminals were usually executed or trimmed of hands or feet so these men were mostly captured christians awaiting ransom or auction we didnt know if we were giving them a chance of freedom or hopeless riot we simply knew we had to do all we could against tripoli some of the prisoners were too weak and tortured to move but even these were carried into the passageways by their fellows the wretches blinking and disheveled their cellmates would not leave them behind the crippled looked at us with wan hope and their mere presence was inspiring in the only way we had we were striking back at slavery theres a deep pit in the dungeons deepest level where i and the savants were kept i told pierre is it empty of victims ive been rather busy with these others if you would care to count im going to see ill not leave anyone in that hellhole we dont have time astiza said its like being buried alive come pierre lets finish emptying hades i had no idea hades was so big donkey this is what happens when no one fights the devil i reloaded my weapons giving pierre the blunderbuss to astiza i loaned pierres pistol to watch over harry then pierre and i descended farther finding a few more cells and sending saved souls stumbling past us toward the light have you encountered the dungeon master i asked i picked up a rock in case we meet your goliath but at some point the surviving guards thought better of it and withdrew i think even your troll doesnt want to face a hundred men he tortured we reached the small cavern at the prisons lowest level and its rancid pit its stench making me want to vomit had i really survived down here i heard a clank of chain and leaned cautiously over the edge to see it was dark of course and i saw only an odd unblinking eye looking up at me hello no answer pierre i need a torch then there was a sudden agitation in the pit below mute but frenzied and suddenly a leap up the side i got a glimpse of scale and lizard claw and then a chain yanked tight as the monster fell again into the blackness i lurched backward it was the nightmare from the ships hold wed found the dragon again then my companion yelled mon dieu even homelier than you the lizard your jailer i spun around it was omar filling the doorway to this chamber like a swollen bull and holding my friend with a forearm the thickness of a log locked around pierres chest and arms the frenchman was purpling a heavy steel chain hung from omars other fist his bulk making its links look almost delicate i wait for you the dungeon master rumbled i woke because the weeping stopped something is very different in my lair i sense he sniffed the rancid air with his brutish broken nose as if freedom had a smell so i think maybe the one they wouldnt let me have has foolishly come back as they promised do you remember my table pretty one were not as helpless this time omar i said as i raised my rifle let my companion go all right he hurled pierre at me to spoil my aim the voyageur sprawling at the edge of the dungeon pit and then quicker than a cobra strikeunbelievable speed for such a large manthe chain lashed out and caught my rifle muzzle i fired but my bullet just seared his shoulder the chain wrapped my barrel and yanked the weapon from my hands slamming it against the dungeon wall and snapping its neck my precious longrifle fell into dust the butt hanging like a broken hinge held at the trigger by a single screw you monster omar laughed picking up the broken longrifle you miss little man little man pierre cried in indignation he tossed my gun past us down into the pit and i winced as i heard it scrape and clatter it was the gun id labored on for long days in jerusalem with jericho and miriam the weapon that had carried me through acre and egypt the rifle that had defended us during the relentless chase of the ojibway and dakota on the american frontier it made a greasy splash at the bottom you can share with dragon then he laid his chain on his shoulders and picked up pierres fallen blunderbuss the torturer loomed like a titan tendons inflated his eyes a squint of hatred and triumph his mouth a pitiless smirk as he stepped toward us this gun can hit both a bellow came from that damned monstrous lizard no doubt waiting for dinner yussef karamanli had assembled a satanic zoo the agitated animal bounced off the pit walls trying to process in its primitive brain why the shattered rifle had fallen from our struggles above you can jump into the pit and try your luck against the dragon omar said or you can let this shotgun knock you in let us go omar i tried or there are two hundred prisoners that will take vengeance on you if they know youve harmed us what will they know you will be in the lizards belly besides the christian dogs will be running the other way to escape yes omar has long planned this i am not stupid like people think he gestured impatiently with his head jump he fingered the links on his neck i do not like guns because they are too quick if you dont jump maybe i will drive you in with my chain dont give the bastard the satisfaction ethan said pierre his eyes bright and watchful make him shoot that gun will kill us instantly exactly a mercy pierres eyes scanned the floor of the chamber and he picked up a chunk of stone you think us little men giant he hefted the rock this is what a little man can do goliath and he threw with perfect aim the missile bouncing off the dungeon masters forehead omar actually stepped back his eyes squinting in pain and confusion then another rock and another how many little men have you bullied in your lifetime ogre pierre challenged another rock this one on omars cheek and i saw the white spark of a piece of tooth flying there were roars below as the lizard thrashed and spun how many have you never given a chance to fight back omar howled and lifted his fat gun blood was running from his forehead as he squinted at pierre the mouth of the blunderbuss looked wide as a cannon and i tensed for the spray of balls pierre seized me turn away there was a boom flash and crackand the blunderbuss blew up pieces flew in all directions and omar shrieked hands to his blinded face staggering in shock now seize his chain wed been stung with fragments from the explosion but not seriously wounded each of us desperately seized the end of the chain draped on the dungeon masters shoulders and threw a turn around his neck and pulled he lurched and stumbled past us blind bleeding and crying the other end of the chain rattled down into the pit the lizard enraged leaped to take the metal in its jaws and fall back the weight jerked omar over the lip of the chasm the ogre fell yelling there was a thud and muddy splash as the dungeon master struck the bottom of his well and then cries like the ones he elicited from his victims as the bizarre beast ravenously hungry went at him omar howled and the two thrashed and snarled in the darkness below chain rattling as they wrestled it would have been easier for him if hed died from the backfire the frenchman said peering over my god did you know the blunderbuss was going to explode of course i didnt have a sling to deal with goliath but when he seized me i jammed a rock tight in the barrel then more rocks to throw to annoy him enough to fire couldnt you have confided i just aged ten years youre terrible at keeping a secret i staggered to fetch a torch cautiously crept to the lip again and looked over omar was sprawled on his back eyes wide and sightless face shredded his mouth making faint mewing noises as the dragon fed on his torso his hands had seized the barrel of my longrifle for a club but only bent it in agony ive lost my gun again and i do not care to fetch it back for you pierre added i watched the lizard tail thrashing back and forth as it gorged the animal may eat his fill before the real monster expires the voyageur predicted with the harsh experience of the wilderness traveler hell chew out the soft parts first the ones that kill slowly so the other meat stays fresh the ogre will die in hours or days but if not the muck will seep into his wounds and give him sepsis that would be a more fitting end for a torturer i think you dont seem to like our dungeon master he should not have called a north man little pierre watched the lizard feed they have truly ugly animals here in africa i think it came from the east indies and a leopard chewed a dog upstairs probably a giraffe in a tower and a warthog in an antechamber too bad your zoologist friend cuvier did not come ashore to catalog it all i was recovering my breath and wits by the sling of david how did you learn to throw like that a rock in the forest can save powder and gain dinner too indians learn to throw i was going to teach you had you ever learned to paddle properly but i cannot instruct everything at once you know it remains amazing donkey how many unpleasant enemies you seem to accumulate im equally astounded i try to be friends with everybody yes we are people of good will you and i but i suspect that by now there are hundreds more here in tripoli hoping to kill us if only everyone could be like pierre radisson well come we have many more things to destroy before we can make good our escape chapter thirtynine it was almost morning we told the prisoners to make their break hoping the exodus would distract the janissaries as the alarm was raised as those released stormed and staggered out the tavern gate and soldiers began to shout and fire pierre showed us the side tunnel that fulton had taken to try to get closer to the mirror we followed astiza confirming we were going in the right direction little harry had sensibly fallen into exhausted sleep in her arms i felt naked again without my rifle or any other weapon but carried astizas shield there was a greek gorgon embossed on its surface her hideous grimace and hair of snakes enough to turn any enemy into stone the hero perseus had used a mirrored shield so he didnt have to look directly at the monster cutting off her head and ultimately giving the trophy to athena for use on the goddesss armor this piece inspired by the story might predate arab manufacture and stem back to archimedes time or before we emerged on a terrace that faced away from the towns harbor and the coming sun yussefs blocky castle loomed high behind us the sky was aglow with approaching dawn the last pink flushing away across a gap of flatroofed houses was that smaller fort on a rocky knob that gave a clear view in all directions atop it was the mirror its edge crisp as a planet men hurriedly pulling tarps from its glittering surface the weapon had been shined to a little sun itself and its petallike extensions were being unfolded it was a bronze flower set to embrace and reflect the coming morning ah my necessary counterweights fulton greeted just in time counterweights a way to prove useful the inventor had lashed together a tall trestle frame from pole lumber being used to repair a roof and across this at right angles was a beam some twenty feet long it was lashed in the middle so each end could bob up or down like a childs seesaw or a scale one end was pointed skyward aimed at the mirror the other end down on the ground was being fussed over by the inventor it would be most appropriate to build a catapult of archimedes to combat the ancient greeks own mirror fulton said but a true torsion device of the kind the mathematician most likely built against roman ships would take far more time tools and craftsmanship than we can muster on this exposed balcony there was a flash and the sun cleared the eastern horizon even lit from the side the mirror across from us began to shimmer as you can see to reach the fort where the mirror is wed have to leave yussefs complex find our way through the winding streets of an aroused city and somehow break into another fortress defended by hundreds of men the only alternative i can think of is to hurl my torpedo through the air and have it fall at the base of the mirror fortunately there seems to have been some tumult in the palace behind me and the sentries watching this terrace disappeared he raised a questioning eyebrow in my direction if we time the fuse correctly it will explode shortly after landing and if in exactly the right place will damage the mirror beyond repair were working with ethan gage pierre warned do not expect precision no he improvises but thats good too i see you have fetched your woman and child gage and by the sound of it have woken half of tripoli doing it and maybe the dead as well perhaps the distraction will give us enough time we emptied their prison how helpful now ive constructed a small version of a simple medieval war machine the french called the trebuchet i attach the bomb to this end of my pivoting beam here tie that end to the terrace floor and weight the other end of the beam when i cut the rope holding the lower end the counterweight comes plunging down the missile end goes flying up and our mine with its fuse flies over these houses we destroy the mirror run to the harbor and make our escape he counted us i thought by now that one or two of you would be dead its going to be very crowded in my submarine my son doesnt take much room well id include him before you in any eventand your pretty woman too he grinned but well squeeze in ethan gage as well now the sun is climbing are you ready they havent spied us yet ready for what notice that the opposite end of the trebuchet has no counterweight nothing came readily to hand then i realized three adults represent a good five hundred pounds so what you must do is climb up to grasp the very end of my makeshift catapult when i cut the rope from this other end you will crash down the bomb will fly up and my experiment will be completed crash down think of it as fun sunlight was flooding the rooftops of tripoli what about horus astiza asked ill hold him fulton said im good with children she looked from one of us to the other absolutely not not one of you men has been good for him yet and this is just the kind of stupid device boys would invent you three climb up there and ill cut the rope ive already had to leave my son with his father and hes had so much misadventure it will be a miracle if he doesnt grow up as disturbed and incorrigible as ethan im not incorrigible just improvisational im heavier anyway fulton conceded its as you say gage your wife is smarter than any of us here let me cut the fuse to length she glanced at me did you call me your wife to your friends i swallowed and grinned possibly had i i couldnt remember without informing me just as you neglected to tell me i was a father she considered our mutual miscommunication her expression inscrutable my grin was growing anxious i worried that id annoyed heror the opposite pleased her both seemed risky even calamitous its easier for women i thought jealously in our world they need a provider and protector so a man provides giving up a variety of quim for one and getswhat love help constancy and a sum greater than its parts a family he gets a son and a lifetime of pride worry and responsibility he gets the half of him thats missing not such a terrible bargain i swallowed as afraid of astiza as a janissary regiment so i turned to look at the mirror of archimedes it was dazzling a beautiful golden sun in itself a sight that must have terrified the roman galleys by its brilliant sheen alone i realized that if lieutenant sterett was returning for us as planned the schooner enterprise would already be in sight the mirror would look like a glowing lighthouse would he dare come close how will we ignite the fuse pierre asked the inventor stopped i hadnt thought of that he peered eastward does anyone have a glass we can focus in the sun for the sake of apollo this is the nineteenth century i said were also in the shade pierre prime the pan of your pistol that will give flash enough to light the fuse of course said fulton such a modern man you are ethan all right up we go gage youre biggest out to the end yes yes well hug each other no time for squeamishness i clung like a monkey to the end of the beam pierre wrapped around me and fulton half dragged himself on top of both of us while looking backward astiza light the fuse and then use my cutlass to cut the rope youre certain of your aim ive spent the night in calculations then im ready she carefully cradled our snoozing harry on one shoulder and picked up pierres gun with her free hand hold the pan of the pistol next to the fuse and pull to let the hammer fall there was a flash but no sizzle it didnt catch try it again the sun was climbing higher across at the fort men were starting to yell and point at the spectacle we made knotted at the end of a beam like an octopus more figures appeared in long robes egyptian rite how would they react when they learned their intended queen was dead her body mangled astiza poured more powder on the pan of the pistol and pulled the trigger again another flash and this time the fuse caught the burning cord was very short just enough for a quick flight through the air now now cut the rope holding the trebuchet arm hurry before we blow up she swung and the sword bounced only chopping partway through saw it theres a hundred pounds of powder there she began desperately slicing the strands we tensed now more men at the fort were yelling and gun smoke blossomed bullets thudded into the stucco around us the fuse let off a bright hiss and wink of sparks please fulton shouted we make a perfect target finally the rope snapped we plunged and the other arm of the fulcrum jerked up the bomb shot skyward leaving a thin trail of smoke men began shouting warning and running from the mirror the mine plunged down a lovely parabola and fell just short of the mirrors parapet landing on a lower ledge fifteen feet below we waited there was no explosion we could see the bomb sitting impotently damn fulton hissed the fuse went out mon dieu pierre groaned picking himself up off the ground where wed fallen why do i get involved in the schemes of the donkey i might also point out that you missed the mirror completely monsieur inventor just what calculations did you make all night long if the beam were two feet longer ethan use your rifle astiza said maybe we can set it off with a bullet my piece was smashed in the dungeon and roberts pistol wont hit anything at that range even if a bullet could by a miracle detonate the charge wed better retreat fulton said theyll signal the other janissaries to trap us here wait astiza said look theyre turning the mirror and indeed the egyptian rites robed warriors had run back to the contraption and were beginning to swing it toward the climbing sun and coincidentally toward us where before it had seemed to gleam now it positively blazed the petallike arms beginning to twist and bend as they were hauled on tackle to help focus the power of the rays they were going to aim archimedes death ray at our little party retreat i had my family no this is our chance astiza seized the sword and began hacking at the cords holding the beam to the trestle what are you doing fulton cried we need to hammer that shield onto the beam and catch the heat ray when it comes this way she said if we hold the shield itself well be burned but we can use the beam as its handle ancient records in memphis and dendara suggest just such a countermeasure you want to reflect their beam back at them yes until they scatter then i want to aim it at your bomb ah cried pierre it is the pretty woman who is the sorcerer not you donkey well im the one who found her and i remembered just how much i was in love we fetched an iron nail and used the butt of pierres pistol to pound it through the shield onto the beam crouching below the parapet i glanced over ropes gears and pulleys were sharpening the mirrors focus that would be necessary i realized to hit a moving target like an enemy ship the egyptian rite savants had figured out the old design of archimedes and perhaps improved it stand let them aim at us said astiza and risk burning so we can burn them there was a flash and a ray of light pulsed across the rooftops and hit our terrace the heat was instantaneous and terrifying astiza twisted away to shield harry with her back wincing my son waking with a start now now pick up the beam and use the shield grunting we lifted our crude reflector into the path of the death ray the head of the gorgon flaming in the light immediately there was another flare of illumination a counterbeam bouncing back as we struggled to aim and then we tilted the shield just enough to run the reflection across the egyptian rite technicians at the mirror they screamed two robes burst into flames men began running from the controls now now the mine fulton ordered carefully tilting we deflected the mirrors ray onto the torpedo wed hurled in seconds it began to smoke again flame curled we waited praying and at last a roar the mine and its hundred pounds of gunpowder blew up in a great gout of fire smoke and stone the wall just beneath the mirror blown to pieces the platform the wall had supported tilted and sagged and the mirror lost focus and abruptly dimmed as if there were an eclipse of the sun several soldiers and technicians on the opposite side had been knocked down by the blast and one or two controlling ropes snapped but that was it the mirror was tilted not destroyed hurled chunks of rock clattered down on the citys rooftops the smoke blew away and our failure was plain there was a gaping hole in the wall beneath the mirror and small fires burning inside the fort but no serious damage i should have brought a second torpedo fulton groaned no i said its enough to keep them from roasting us and the enterprise while we escape if we go quickly enough lets run and maybe we still have a chance a fulcrum of archimedes can prop up that damaged rooftop in seconds the inventor insisted look theyre already running to fix it not only are we doomed but so is sterett ill go down fighting before i go into that pit with that lizard pierre muttered as will i before i lose my wife and son to slavery i vowed realizing id said wife again without thinking by the eye patch of odin was i making a commitment ethan gage rootless adventurer tireless womanizer who thought too often only of me ethan astiza asked women do like to know yet what could we say when there was so much unsaid because we hadnt had time to say anything yet and then there was a truly titanic explosion a thunderclap that knocked us over and sent mirror rite and the top half of yussefs fort skyward in a monstrous fountain of fire and smoke glittering golden shards of an ancient weapon flew apart as if a rock had been hurled into a glass mirror and they glinted like stars as they radiated bits of rock and metal and human beings flew in all directions raining down on tripoli there was a rattle as bronze fell like hail our ears ached from the punch of air fulton swayed to his feet looking in stupefaction at the smoking stump of ruins where the mirror had been they stockpiled powder and guns to protect it he said dazedly our fires reached the magazine and it went off he looked at our shield bent by the heat medusa turned them to rubble chapter forty we escaped through chaos the dungeon was empty gates hanging wide and in the streets escaped slaves and prisoners had fanned out in a frantic riot to try to break free of tripoli before janissaries caught them again a huge pillar of smoke was roiling up from where the mirror had been and secondary explosions were still going off as kegs of gunpowder ignited we ran in our arab robes through confused milling crowds without drawing fire there were sharpshooters boiling on the roof of yussefs palace and i thought i saw karamanli himself head bare of his jeweled turban as he shook his arms and furiously shouted orders but he didnt spy us or recognize yet what i must be carrying away in my pocket just as we dashed through a water gate onto the harbor quay there was another roar and a docked pirate corsair blew up a geyser of water shot up from the vessels bow and then it began to sink at its moorings its rigging and that of pirate craft nearby caught fire sailors spilled off the boats in fear and confusion not knowing where the attack was coming from as they did so some of the escaped prisoners began stealing smaller feluccas splendid pierre said marveling at the havoc donkey youve done it again we spied a ripple and shadow in the water as cuvier and smith steered the nautilus away from the ship theyd stalked for a moment i feared they were steering straight for sea leaving us but then the shadow slowed and fultons little windowed tower broke the surface the submariners paused no doubt peering out and then the hatch popped open and fell back and cuvier appeared he waved cheerfully dont call attention to yourself i warned and indeed muskets began to crack and bullets began to kick up spouts near the submarine cuvier ducked back down and the vessel turned hard to starboard and made for where we were standing i longed for a rifle to answer back but my piece belonged to a wellfed dragon i felt naked harry whose moods flickered with each calamity was looking around the harbor with bright interest apparently he was getting used to cacophony people were running in all directions smoke roiled up and cannon balls were making splashes in the water fire papa bad men i said youll never play with fire will you harry can you play with it the idea intrigued him certainly not said his mother fire hot he held up his little fingers very hot i said very dangerous no danger he said he thought bad big dog the big dog is dead good you give every indication that you are brighter than your father pierre observed must be your mothers side and then with a bang and a clunk the nautilus was at the quay astiza handed a squirming harry to cuvier to drop inside and then we four adults followed filling the little craft to bursting harry began crying again at this confinement quite reasonably and the palace gunfire coming our way was increasing a couple of musket balls pinged off the tower well have to go underwater until we get out of range cuvier said how far will the mirror reach we destroyed it fulton said it was astiza who figured it out he seemed as impressed with her as hed been dissatisfied with me and was goodlooking enough that his compliment made me feel a little jealous my congratulations madame cuvier said and allow me to apologize for the discomfort our american inventor here seems to have forgotten any amenities escape will be amenity enough she looked uncertainly about the metal tube sweating with moisture and stinking of confined men but smiled bravely im sure this is just the first draft of his experiments and the next few minutes will determine if it is to be his very last cuvier winked i have a new design that will hold twenty men lets finish with this one first we submerged and pierre and i took over from the winded smith to crank the propeller all too clearly we could hear the eerie whoosh of cannon balls as they plunged into the sea nearby the garrison of tripoli seemed to be firing at everything and nothing have you seen sterett and the enterprise cuvier asked not yet i replied we have to get clear of these reefs and surface we had no way to gauge our progress except by studying the compass and counting minutes which fulton was doing under his breath with so many people and the hard exertion of the crankers the air was quickly getting stale horus has solved the problem by nodding off to sleep again and we all looked at him with envy how about some of your compressed air robert im saving that for an emergency seven people crammed into an underwater craft designed for three and being bombarded with cannon balls is not an emergency i think were already out of range the plonk of the falling cannon balls had ceased lets come up to reconnoiter and crack the hatch gage ill spell you on the propeller take a look when the tower breaks free of the water we squeezed past each other while cuvier pumped some of the water out of our buoyancy tanks our chamber lightened as we neared the surface illumination glowing as the thick windows broke above the waves i looked behind us through the glass a haze of smoke hung over tripoli and several xebecs and feluccas had caught fire the quay and walls were boiling with men but the gunfire had stopped we were either too far away or theyd lost sight of our shadow passing underwater fultons submarine had promise after all so could we see the enterprise i turned around to look toward open sea and almost yelped a barbary ship was bearing down on us sails bellied spray dancing at the bow and hamidou dragut balanced on the bowsprit face bloody pointing frantically at our form pointing precisely at me he was directing his ship to ram us a bow cannon was being run out to say hello with another cannon ball and sailors were aiming muskets as well down down down i cried its dragut heading straight for us and trying to ride over the top of us fulton and cuvier slammed levers and spun cranks and our tanks began to fill the windows filmed with water as we dove but now the brighter light of the surface was agony suggesting we werent descending fast enough a shadow loomed the barbary pirate ship casting darkness like a thundercloud and then we could hear the hiss as it sailed over us there was a screech as it briefly scraped our conning tower with its keel pushing us down then we kept sinking on our own gaining acceleration as the light dimmed and with a bump struck the harbor bottom forty feet deep harry woke up where mama safe her voice trembled a hiss of thin water streamed from one of the bolt holes wet yes she said coolly it is her eyes were wide can we wait hamidou out cuvier asked looking upward hell luff and drift over us i predicted were running out of air smith warned not if we uncork the container i brought said fulton i told you we should wait for a real emergency now it should buy us an hour at least he worked the stopper partly free and a new hiss joined that of the leaks fulton worked a pump a few times to keep the water streaming into the hull from deepening too quickly then he lit another candle we could use some cheer our rendezvous was to have been at dawn i said sterett will see the smoke and know weve done something but how long dare he wait lets use the screw to try to finish our journey out of the harbor how far did we have to go gage i didnt have time to judge the reef so well have to try it blind we pumped and lifted off the bottom then there was a splash overhead a few seconds silence and then a clunk is dragut anchoring maybe hes dropping cannon balls on us blind there was a boom and the nautilus lurched as if kicked from behind we were all thrown forward and our candles went out and then water began gushing through the packing around the propeller shaft as well a cold jet that soaked us all harry began whimpering climbing up his mothers bosom the pirates dropped a fused keg of powder on the bottom fulton guessed man all the pumps weve got to surface before we sink i knew i should have stuck to a canoe pierre muttered did god make us fish to go about underwater no he said stay where you can breathe adam georges and william do we still have that last mine fulton asked aye but its not rigged can we turn the propeller i asked its bent but it turns a little the inventor reported water was swirling around our ankles i think were going to have to swim for it fulton said he glanced around his little cylinder looking stricken i dont think nautilus will make it back to enterprise the pirates will simply pick us off if we leave this boat smith said or pick us up for prison not if we destroy them first i said weve got that mine at the bow even if its not ready how do you set it off the usual plan is to screw the charge into the ships wooden bottom back off with a long line and trigger the torpedo with a lanyard fulton reminded what if we just nuzzle up and blow it will sink both ships and whoever is in them then thats what im going to do after your companions are off the nautilus and swimming for safety im tired of this son of a bitch dragut ethan astiza cried you cant kill yourself now quite right smith put in youre a father man with a boy im not putting back into slavery look i got us into this mess none of this would have happened if i hadnt been caught up with the egyptian rite aurora somerset and napoleon bonaparte ive escorted all of you into hades because youve had the pluck and ill fortune to come with me now id like to buy you some time by committing suicide the englishman protested robert i asked fulton if i tied a line to the mines lanyard and led it through the hatch could i set it off in here where id have your metal hull between me and the bomb well yes but the nose of the nautilus is going to be crushed like a snuff tin my plunging boat is going to sink like a rock maybe i can hold my breath and then swim free ethan no astiza pleaded horus needs a father he needs to live first which requires the sinking of draguts ship this is what i get for not finishing that pirate off in the harem every time i fail to kill people i regret it nowi addressed them all like a lieutenant briefing a sortiewhen we get to the surface you have to get out before the pirates have time to see us and start shooting swim and scatter dive when you can to make it harder for them to hit you meanwhile ill drive the submarine under their hull trigger the mine and swim away after the explosion make for the reefs and maybe you can stand on the shallowest ledges and signal sterett for rescue thats no chance at all cuvier said which is just how the donkey likes it said pierre you forgot one thing monsieur lunatichow are you going to both drive the submarine and ready your bomb i pierre radisson can crank harder and swim better and jump higher than any man and so i will help in your scheme i am after all in the habit of aiding you in all things ridiculous i bowed i take that as a compliment voyageur its getting light fulton warned were nearing the surface astiza and harry first then the savants for world knowledge men might read about your work someday not the most bloodthirsty of cries but it was honest sentiment if we had to choose between a geologist and a gambler or a zoologist and a fur paddler the ranking seemed obvious to me i didnt think theyd get far but by then id be dead and not have to worry about it ethan not when were finally together again astiza moaned ill catch up i said with absolutely no conviction and i dont like to swim smith groaned consider the alternative surface fulton banged back the hatch sprang out on a deck awash and reached down to haul up harry the child mute again from all the adult anxiety around him astiza scrambled out took her boy and jumped into the water sidestroking away as best she could go go so i have a chance i shouted to the other men help astiza cuvier and smith hauled themselves out too the englishman shaking ill help you william cuvier encouraged pulling him by the hand as they left pierre began cranking the halfjammed mechanism to get the submarine moving its hard donkey but the loss of weight makes us less sluggish fulton dropped back inside im going to help no the whole secret of this will go down if you do im not leaving my ship come on gage tie on your lanyard were the americans at war with yussef karamanli the inventor certainly had grit which meant i had to muster it too i pulled myself up on deck hard right so we come under her stern i hissed shes stopped to hunt for us and just drifting no ones looking behind as we ponderously turned and gathered headway i untied one of the sailing lines and used a simple square knot to tie it onto the final mines lanyard the explosive was stored in a basket at the bow slowly we crept toward draguts ship the morning sun making its planking glow as if lacquered i could read the name of this vessel wed used to escape venice mykonos quietly our deck awash now pirates spotted our low form and began shouting men ran to the stern muskets went off and i heard the rumble of cannon wheels as they tried to swing one around and depress its barrel enough to hit us a bullet pinged off the hatch all right straight i shouted down crank crank crank now a swivel gun was aimed my way and i hastily backed away and fell back down the hatch water was kneedeep in the submarine the swivel gun went off with a bang and there was a rattle of grapeshot topside one fragment singing through the hatch and bouncing inside ow merde donkey close the hatch i cant and pull the rope besides were going to need a way out well most likely be blown to jelly fulton said mildly but if by some miracle we survive the bow will be gone in any event so we wont need the hatch but yes dont jam the lanyard rope ethan he seemed resigned as calm as if pondering blueprints i looked up our hatch was drifting under the xebecs overhanging stern there were bangs and thuds as the pirates dropped uncomfortably heavy things on us making big splashes then there was a softer bump as we nosed to nest against the rudder and hull i could hear cries of alarm in arabic i said goodbye to my little family yanked the rope and lanyard and tensed a roar and concussion knocked all three of us hard into the stern of the submarine there was a flash as the bow of our vessel cracked and gave way and then a wall of cool seawater gushed in like the bursting of a dam to ram us even harder into the stern and shut off all light our air snuffed out and then we were plummeting my ears pained all the way to the harbor bottom again the stern of the nautilus hit hard on the gray sand the bow completely gone it was the jolt that made me realize that i was in fact still alive enough to feel and that because of it i and my companions might possibly be saved something floated past and i grabbed it fultons kettle of air it was now lighter than the water and floating like a buoy bubbles streaming out i seized the arab robe of somebody with the other hand and kicked out from the destroyed front half of the submarine aiming for the silver surface so far above we shot upward and burst like porpoises shrieking and coughing i had hold of pierre i realized and hed dragged up fulton in his own grasp both men appeared at least half alive dazed and spitting water as we drifted in a line with the kettle i looked wildly about draguts xebec was nowhere to be seen there was a fan of shattered timbers broken pirate bodies and floating spars with scraps of canvas we must have set off the ships magazine i let loose of the air kettle and struck out for one of the spars pulling pierre and fulton with me we reached what i realized was the bowsprit of the mykonos and saw there was another man clinging at the opposite end a pirate survivor as dazed as we were we floated blinking and i peered blearily at the villain we were sharing with it was dragut his face bruised and bloody where id slammed him with my rifle stock his clothes were half gone from the explosion of his boat that kicked him off the bow and his arms and shoulders were peppered with splinters and little burns he returned my look with baleful eyes making a calculation i groaned did i have to fight him again i was as spent as a paupers purse weaponless frantic to find my wifeyes id thought of her again as thatand child but instead of attacking he finally gave me a limp salute so you have won after all american blown me off my own ship he shook his head what kind of devil craft have you christians made now i couldnt understand aurora somersets fascination with you but its clearer now you are indeed a sorcerer i told you not to go to war with the united states i looked for something i could club him with here he threw me something and i caught it one of cuviers dueling pistols hed been tossed from his ship with the pair in his sash and now he drew the other and pointed we aimed at each other the length of the bowsprit the hammers clicked on wet powder the pistols harmless and he gave a wry smile you havent beaten us yet he dropped his gun in the mediterranean and i let mine go too all the weapons wed acquired in venice were gone i will avenge my ship but not today it seems he pointed your navy is closer than my cowardly own i looked and there to my joy was the enterprise luffed just outside tripolis reefs and banging away toward the harbor with her light guns the flag was rippling sprightly in the morning breeze a spray of splinters went up from a felucca that had put out to join the fight it and others were turning back turn and fight you cretins dragut shouted to his own comrades but they couldnt hear him and wouldnt listen if they could for just a morning it seems we do have an american blockade i said dragut shook his head goodbye ethan gage i dont think i will offer you passage on my ships again and with that he let go of the spar and began wearily swimming the last of his crew for tripoli and its retreating boats i was happy enough to let him go he may have been auroras tool but he was not aurora well robert it seems i have sunk your submarine just as pierre predicted i said i should have warned you at the beginning the frenchman explained to fulton ethan gage is a walking calamity i had to watch donkey so he didnt put his clumsy foot through my birch canoes or add green wood to a fire or wet rocks to a fire ring or flub a gutting job or poison himself with berries i can imagine the inventor said every once in a while however he would perform sorcery like this nautilus worked ethan fulton said with tired pride i can go back to paris and tell bonaparte it succeeded we sank two ships no you cant napoleon wont let you implicate france in an attack on tripoli and jeopardize safe passage of its shipping he has troubles enough besides the submarine is gone you dont have anything to prove it with i have you as eyewitness i will say what i saw but how likely is he to believe me ethan gage the inventor looked crestfallen come lets kick after the others and swim out to enterprise i see theyre lowering boats as we slowly swam toward rescue fulton began to cheer up displaying the dogged persistence of all successful inventors my steamboat idea hell like better he said as he kicked im sure hell be won over by the next demonstration and someday there will be fleets and fleets of submarines stick to your panoramic pictures robert people like to be somewhere other than where they are chapter fortyone the pirates had had enough for the day and did not try to pursue us nor did we have the naval firepower to duel tripolis batteries sterett set course for malta and the american squadron from there my companions could catch ships to whatever destination they chose it turned out that fulton was cheerier about my necessary destruction of his nautilus than i expected once he thought about it he had every hope this first experiment would allow him to construct a second and was already drawing sketches imagine a dozen men cranking or even better a steam engine that operates underwater imagine living under the sea wasnt it rather dark and wet imagine floating over the canyons of the deep and swimming with giant fishes i smiled indulgently will anyone believe robert that five menonly two of them americansuccessfully attacked tripoli of course they will believe it i will tell them we can show we have he looked about as if proof of his exploit was at hand not a weapon not a prize not a prisoner i said just be aware that men like bonaparte hear many tales from men seeking favor and learn to be skeptical youll back me up gage well be partners earning huge bounties from sinking ships of war the world is at peace robert look at the englishman smith and frenchman cuvier over there getting on like old friends as they talk about rocks and bones why would napoleon ever go to war with britain again my steamboat then you have to help me in that convincing way you have ethan i told madame marguerite in paris that i was going to write a book then write one about our adventure maybe i shall and mostly tell the truth i visited with cuvier and whats next for you georges extinct animals instead of live pirates it is a fine adventure exploring the mediterranean but i think ive had enough holiday for now and prefer quiet bones im also a bookish man and supposed to reform education then there are all these interesting ideas about the origins of life we found time at thira ethan depths and depths of time and those pretty rooms down that tunnel was that atlantis or an arm of it who first invented the mirror was the idea bequeathed by mysterious ancestors like your thoth and thor ill have to sift the records of antiquity youve given me a hobby for the next several years my pleasure and you william i think ive seen enough of the human world too and will return to england to continue my geologic mapping rocks dont shoot back such work could help others think about the mysteries of the earth scientific luminaries have ignored me ethan but this little adventure of ours has given me confidenceconfidence and persistence when i see that even ethan gage can win at the end of things i think that i might too dont let the snobs discourage you william they know youre smarter than they are and are afraid of you im going to win them over he vowed im going to map the earth and they are going to invite me into their society pierre said he missed canada there are too few trees in africa and too many people in france ive decided i want to see more of the north country before i grow old ethan i want to paddle all the way to the pacific i met a man named clark who had the idea to do the same thing and he was friends with lewis the secretary jefferson wants to send that way well maybe i will go with them and i there was still the sale of louisiana to persuade napoleon on beyond that there was the little matter of a woman i loved a boy i wanted to raise and a life i still hadnt entirely worked out so as we sailed for malta i sought out my love in the bow of the enterprise and we settled against a cannon watching the dancing waves did you know that i was almost forced to marry aurora somerset on a pirate ship i told astiza almost we were interrupted by cannon balls from sterett as it turns out it wouldnt have mattered because id be a widower by now aurora dead you alive and little harry out of nowhere its amazing how life works out horus and hes not out of nowhere ethan we made him didnt we it was a little presumptuous of me to share equal credit but by the soul of patrick henry i couldnt help but be proud i rather liked being a father given the spunk of my son he might be the cleverest thing id ever done i think i want to settle down astiza i want to find a place where nothing ever happens and live there with you nothing how long would that last ethan you can teach harry about the stars and the goddesses and ill get a new rifle made and show him how to shoot well live on an island perhaps and let the world have at it while we watch from the beach wouldnt that be the thing ill weave us hammocks and write down this story for harry and never get mixed up with napoleon again will you stay with me now i won the slightest of smiles it appears thats what destiny intends together forever and not a ripple in our lives she sounded skeptical but women usually do when i announce my plans yes so i kissed her my first chance in nearly three years and i was relieved we hadnt forgotten how then i leaned back feeling breeze and sun as we danced across the mediterranean to think im to be a gentleman farmer or course i know nothing about farming nor do i like grubbing in the dirt so ill be a philosopher perhaps or maybe well hear of a treasure that is a little less exasperating and i suppose i havent given my son the easiest time of it yet so i need to learn to play with him as well as teach of course ive a lot of wisdom to pass on i pity the boy already and how are you going to support us for these dreams ah i almost forgot while you were sensibly seizing a shield from yussefs throne room i went for something a little more frivolous kept locked away in the leopards cage i fished in my pocket and pulled out my prize it was the emerald from karamanlis turban this will get us started and send our child to school someday to boot ethan you finally saved something ive got a family to save it for now and where is horus by the way why hes righti thought he was with you didnt you put him down and i thought hed gone to find you we looked at each other with consternation gunfire explosions vicious animals desperate fights sinking submarineswe were terrible parents now we couldnt even keep track of our only child on an eightyfoot ship harry we began searching the deck increasingly frantic what if the tot had gone overboard we blast our way out of tripoli pioneer a whole new way of warfare and misplace the lad on our own navys schooner where sense is wanting everything is wanting old ben used to warn always looking at me with particular intensity and finally i remembered something and took my love by the arm in case i forget remind me to have sterett marry us i told her hes captain of the vessel after all that is if youll have me my heart was hammering franklin said to have your eyes wide open before marriage and half shut after of course ill marry you i cant get rid of you but what about horus she had a mothers panic i know where he is right where i told him to be come with me below and indeed i found him below in the sail locker curled fast asleep his look was that of the angels but he sleepily blinked as we watched him and then looked at me hungry papa hed crept off to nap in the one place where i told him hed be safe historical note americas conflict with the barbary states simmered and boiled from when the new nation had won independence and lost the protection of the british navy until when the united states sent naval forces against algiers the british navy launched another punitive attack in and the french conquered algiers in starting the colonization of north africa that finally ended barbary piracy once and for all the american war with tripoli in presentday libya immortalized in the marine corps hymn line to the shores of tripoli ran from to and was punctuated by victories and defeats on both sides it ended after capture of the tripolitan city of derna by rebel forces aided by american marines bashaw yussef karamanli agreed to release american prisoners and cease attacks on american shipping in return for a ransom of an ambiguous victory that nonetheless marked the comingofage of the american navy and what of the daring and revolutionary submarine raid on tripoli by the american adventurer ethan gage and three famous scientistsan episode missing from more conventional histories we do know that georges cuvier was one of the most prominent zoologists and paleontologists of his day william smith was the father of english geology but unrecognized for his achievements until very late in life robert fulton was a tireless inventor who marketed schemes to both the french and british navies and who eventually returned home to develop the first commercial steamboat the clermont on the hudson river in his invention of the submarine nautilus was a century ahead of its time fulton came to france hoping that the revolutionary government might be open to new inventions given the inferiority of its navy to britains american david bushnell had developed an even moreprimitive submarine the turtle which unsuccessfully attempted to sink british ships during the revolutionary war fulton expanded on bushnells idea after plans for the turtle were published in and proposed a submarine or plunging boat to the french on december the eventual design is described in this novel the idea languished until napoleon seized power in france in november of with preliminary backing by the spring of fulton had built a working submarine approximately twenty feet long and six wide it was launched july and on july commenced sea trials in the seine further experiments followed in le havre in august where fulton managed to blow up a barrel in a test he actually tried twice to approach two anchored english brigs but the british had heard of the experiments and whether by accident or from alarm raised anchor and sailed before fulton could get close experiments resumed in the summer of off brest there the nautilus dove as deep as feet stayed submerged as long as three hours and traveled underwater about a half mile the vessel also sailed adequately on the surface unfortunately for fulton a new minister of marine was opposed to this secretive method of war and french support ended while history records that fulton told the french he broke up the nautilus to prevent its being copied ethan gage suggests the vessels remains may actually be at the bottom of tripolis harbor fulton subsequently demonstrated a steamboat to napoleon in the seine on august and then frustrated at the lack of french backing went to britain to propose submarine and torpedo schemes to defeat a french invasion fleet equally revolutionary was the mirror or death ray of the great greek mathematician archimedes syracuse a greek colony on the island of sicily founded in bc became one of the major cities of the ancient world and was eventually caught up in the titanic struggle between rome and carthage it was besieged and captured by the romans in bc despite the orders of the roman general marcellus archimedes was slain by a roman soldier who did not recognize the famed mathematician legend has it that archimedes invented ingenious machines to defend his city including an improved catapult giant mechanical claws that could crush roman galleys and a mirror that could set them on fire the first surviving biography of archimedes is that of polybius written seventy years after the inventors death it does not mention the mirror however in the second century ad the historian lucian wrote that the greeks repelled a roman attack with a burning glass or mirror this story was elaborated on by later writers and has ignited the publics imagination ever since modern attempts to replicate the weapon include a greek experiment in athens that set a plywood mockup on fire using an array of mirrors a try by massachusetts institute of technology students set a stationary target on fire but an attempt to replicate that deed for the television show mythbusters was unsuccessful whether a genius like archimedes might have done betterand whether a renegade american helped rediscover just such a device in we leave to the readers discretion certainly there has been a steady accumulation of evidence in recent decades that the ancient world was more technologically sophisticated than once supposed cicero recorded that archimedes made an early geared computer to imitate the motion of heavenly bodies and just such an ancient device was discovered by greek sponge divers in dubbed the antikythera computer and on display in athens it calculated the movements of sun moon and stars fultons idea of a flamethrower is predated to at least ad when byzantium used a new invention called greek fire to destroy an islamic fleet the french legend of a little red man is true and recorded in some bonaparte biographies also reported is napoleons habit of shooting at josephines swans the palais royal was the las vegas of its day and the ruins caves and cathedrals of syracuse are mostly as described ioannis kapodistrias the greek patriot whom ethan meets on thira became the father of greek independence from turkey other characters taken from history include french secret policeman joseph fouche american naval lieutenant andrew sterett and yussef karamanli the gigantic lizard aboard auroras ship is the famed komodo dragon of indonesia while not documented by western science until the animals were most likely known to natives of the archipelago history records that yussef did keep lions and other cats in his tripoli palace the egyptian rite was a real heretic offshoot of freemasonry founded by the con man and conjurer cagliostro about its reach ambition and longevity have been fictionalized in my novels the island archipelago of thira is better known as santorini today the rim of a shattered volcano in approximately bc the island blew itself apart in an eruption so violent that the tsunami waves that hit crete may have toppled minoan civilization some scientists believe that platos story of atlantis was inspired by that reallife incident minoan ruins were uncovered near akrotiri and some of the murals described in this novel can be seen at a museum on the island was there ever really an og mysterious ancestors and fantastic ancient weapons history is just that a story and sorting fact from legend will occupy historians and archaeologists for centuries to come what we do know is that legends once dismissed as complete myth such as atlantis seem to have some basis in geologic truthand that the more we learn about ancient people the more ingenious they seem this novel was made possible by the research of scores of nonfiction authors who have written on the lives of its principals the barbary wars and the history of france and the mediterranean the book was also a wonderful excuse to visit lovely lairs such as santorini and syracuse special thanks to huxley college and to nick and cynthia zaferatos who introduced
