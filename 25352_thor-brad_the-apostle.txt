brad thor the apostle the eighth book in the scot harvath series for james ryan warrior people sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf george orwell chapter nangarhar province afghanistan next to a stream of icy snowmelt from the hindu kush a small caravan unloaded its contraband cases filled with weapons money communications equipment and other gear were placed beneath a rocky overhang and covered with camouflage netting to keep them concealed from overhead surveillance a man in his late forties with deep slavic features stood nearby and supervised he had blue eyes mediumlength gray hair and both the clothing and bearing of a local afghan when his team of pakistani smugglers was done the man removed a stack of bills and paid them double what he normally did for bringing him into the country it was a severance package he wouldnt be using them again this was going to be his final operation he made himself comfortable near a stack of rams horns that marked a taliban grave site and watched as the line of smugglers and pack animals disappeared back into the mountains toward pakistan though he couldnt spot them he knew there were men in the rugged hills above men with sophisticated weaponsweapons he had provided to themwho were keeping him in their sights twenty minutes later three muddy toyota hilux doublecab pickup trucks appeared from the other end of the valley the convoy splashed across the fastmoving stream and drove up to the overhang as the trucks rolled to a stop young men with thick dark beards and kalashnikovs jumped out like the man next to the rams horns they were dressed in traditional afghan clothing known as salwar kameezbaggy cotton trousers that stopped just above the ankle and loosefitting tunics that ended just above the knee they all wore winter coats that came to midthigh many slung warm wool blankets referred to locally as patoos over their shoulders to further ward off the cold upon their heads they wore pakols the wide wool hat encircled by a thick rolled brim made famous by the mujahideen during their war with the soviets the men worked quickly and efficiently once the gear was loaded the blueeyed man climbed into the front passenger seat of the lead vehicle the driver popped the clutch and the truck lurched forward it was a painful kidneyjarring ride along a rutted road that followed the snowmelt downstream into the valley as the truck came down hard into yet another pothole the men in the backseat erupted in a barrage of pashtu curses the blueeyed man tuned them out and stared through the spattered windshield the landscape outside was windswept and barren it was hard for him to believe that he had been fighting and running operations in this country for over twentyfive years his blood had been spilled upon its soil on more occasions than he cared to remember and he had watched more men die than anyone ever should he loved and hated afghanistan at the same time it had taken far more from him than it had ever given his body was in shambles as was the small family he had managed to begin over the years during his short visits home all he was left with in his life was a sweet innocent boy who had been terribly disfigured the blueeyed man blamed himself he had known about his wifes alcoholism he also knew that it grew worse when he was away even though hed been trained to listen to his intuition he had ignored it when it told him that the woman could no longer properly see to their child had he made other arrangements for the boy had he found a responsible caregiver to see to him while he was away the fire might never have happened but it had happened and the father wore the guilt of his sons disfigurement across his shoulders much like the patoos across the shoulders of the taliban fighters now riding alongside him he tried to forget his pain and to instead focus on his mission it was one of the most audacious operations his intelligence service had ever considered if it was successful he could finally retire and would be so highly rewarded that he and his son would never want for anything else that success though ultimately rested with the man he was about to meet in the near distance his destination finally came into sight the village in nangarhars rugged khogyani district was mostly mud houses with some made of stone which were set along either side of the road it was austere and colorless as much of afghanistan was window and door frames were unpainted roughhewn beams jutted out from beneath rooftops and none of the buildings were more than two stories tall dust and children and hardlooking men with guns were everywhere no women were visible they were there of course hidden behind the thick mud walls of their houses by taliban husbands and fathers who forbade them to work to go to school or even to go outside without being completely covered and with a male family member accompanying them the convoy ground to a halt before a high wall set with two massive double doors the driver of the lead vehicle tapped his horn three times in quick succession a small panel opened in the gate and a pair of angry dark eyes peered out moments later the doors swung open and the convoy rolled into a typical afghan compound known as a kwala when the blueeyed man climbed out of the truck he was greeted by one of the talibans most notorious battlehardened commanders mullah massoud akhund stood about fivefooteight a good three inches shorter than the blueeyed man but he had a commanding presence massouds eyes were the color of flint and possessed with the power to look right through a man his heavy black beard was streaked with gray he was only in his late forties but a life of incessant combat had aged him beyond his years giving him the appearance of a man twenty years older placing his right hand over his heart in the traditional afghan greeting mullah massoud nodded slightly to his guest and said salaam alaikum the blueeyed man performed the same gesture and replied wa alaikum salaam massoud embraced his guest and held him tightly for many moments the blueeyed man had learned early in his career that a hug from an afghan man was a sign of respect the longer the embrace the deeper the respect you were held in finally the commander broke off the hug it is good to see you again bakht rawan chapter many suspected that the blueeyed man was russian but it was a topic mullah massoud did not like to discuss there were still dormant animosities even in his own village over the long and bloody war the afghans had fought with the soviets for this reason massoud addressed the man as bakht rawan and not by his given name of sergei simonov their relationship stretched back more than twenty years before massoud had joined the taliban he had been a fledgling afghan intelligence operative and simonov had been his mentor his code name was pashtu and meant running luck something massoud felt his mentor possessed in abundance the pair politely inquired into each others health families and affairs as massoud gave orders to his men to unload the trucks he then motioned for simonov to follow him inside the russian removed his hiking boots at the door and followed his host the room was spartanly furnished with two long tables a low bed a small wooden desk and a single chair it would be more than adequate two of massouds men brought in an ancient carpet and unrolled it along the floor it was a red elephantfoot pattern known as a bohkara simonov could only imagine what such a rug would fetch in moscow or st petersburg other men entered bringing blankets a pillow a power strip and an extension cord which would allow him to run his electronic equipment off the compounds generator satisfied that his guest was on his way to being situated mullah massoud informed him that he would see him for tea in twenty minutes simonov thanked his host and closed the door from the leather holster beneath his tunic he withdrew his mm cz pistol and placed it on the desk next to a suppressor from his coat pocket inside the compound he had no need for any of his weapons ze talibano milmayam he said aloud in pashtu i am a guest of the taliban the traditional code of honor among the pashtun known as pashtunwali dictated every aspect of their lives and was very explicit one of the most important edicts of pashtunwali dealt with hospitality and the treatment of guests once a pashtun invited someone into his home he was honorbound to protect that guest at all costs even if it meant fighting to his own death to protect him as simonov unpacked his gear he ran through the arguments mullah massoud had initially raised about the operation and how he would counter them if they came up again the bottom line was that the time was right for the taliban to finally move beyond alqaeda in two years after seizing majority control of the country the taliban had molded afghanistan into the purest islamic state on the planet their ambassadors were shuttling back and forth to america and were close to signing a peace treaty with the northern alliance fightersthe last holdouts in afghanistan against full taliban control of the country the soviets were long gone selfserving afghan warlords were being dealt with and the taliban were on the brink of bringing stability to their warravaged nation in short they had achieved almost everything they wanted then osama bin laden and his alqaeda organization carried out the bombings of the american embassies in kenya and tanzania the americans had responded by firing missiles into afghanistan angered taliban leader mullah omar broke off peace talks and disengaged himself from the americans the war with the northern alliance picked up speed and things gradually deteriorated just when it looked as if things couldnt get worse september happened and the americans invaded in short every problem the taliban had could be traced to alqaeda it was time for a divorce mullah massoud had always been smart enough to see alqaeda for what they really werea liability they were foreigners who put their global jihad ahead of everything else they didnt care what happened to afghanistan and its people in the process massoud on the other hand did and that was why he had agreed to go along with simonovs operation in typical russian fashion it was elegantly simple simonov had found a way to deal alqaeda a death blow but to make it look as if the americans had been behind it as the ineffective mullah omar drowned with the weight of the dying alqaeda organization tied around his neck mullah massoud would step into the vacuum of power and would take over as supreme leader of the taliban with the windfall they intended to reap from alqaedas demise they could purchase all the weaponry and hardware they needed they would mount a devastating offensive against the americans and their coalition partners and send them running from afghanistan like whipped dogs and what the russians asked for in return for their help was a pittance the russians had learned their lesson and had no desire to repeat the mistakes of the s afghanistan had been a soviet graveyard this time they wanted nothing to do with the governance of afghanistan only the ability to help increase and share in its prosperity how the russians would use their influence in the region was of no concern to the taliban as long as they stayed out of afghan affairs the relationship showed significant promise simonov unpacked his satellite uplink equipment and reflected on how ironic it was that russia was now funding and orchestrating instability within afghanistan exactly as america had done to the soviets in the s but the russians needed to be very careful times had changed america had many partners in afghanistan and if russias role in promoting insurgency was ever proven the international repercussions would be extraordinarily severe he was still running these points through his head when he heard a crash as his door was kicked in the russian reached for his cz atop the desk but caught himself and stopped standing at rigid attention in the doorway was mullah massouds mentally challenged brother zwak he wore a blue hooded sweatshirt and boots two sizes too big one of his pants legs was rolled up to just beneath his knee and he clutched an ak to his side the top of its barrel wrapped with blue tape he had the official job of guarding the village well and watching for spies carrying the rifle was a source of pride and made him feel equal to the other warriors who fought for his brother zwak was thirtyone years old stood only a hair above five feet tall and had a coarse dark beard that followed his jaw line exactly like his brothers each morning the two men shaved their upper lips together in a cracked mirror in the courtyard when not searching for spies or guarding the well spending time with his brother was zwaks favorite thing to do simonov had great respect for how massoud treated his childlike brother he never mistook the mans compassion for weakness he knew that massoud was anything but weak and as soon as his country was rid of alqaeda he would be the taliban commander under whom the country would be united the russian studied his visitor an intent look of satisfaction spread across zwaks face as he realized he had startled simonov he was exceedingly proud of his accomplishment sergei approached and gave the man a military inspection which zwak took very seriously he stood as straight as he could while the russian examined his clothing and then his weapon shaking his head simonov crossed the room to retrieve something from his pack zwak removed his boots and stepped inside to see what the russian was doing when sergei turned he held in his hands a pair of white hitop basketball shoes despite their hatred for the west and western culture the only thing the taliban prized as highly as their rifles was basketball shoes zwak couldnt believe his eyes simonov smiled as he handed them to him dont let anyone take these from you he said though he didnt believe there was anyone in afghanistan dumb enough to rob the brother of mullah massoud forgetting custom zwak dropped the shoes on the floor and slid his feet inside they werent a perfect fit but they were much better than the oversized boots he had been wearing for as long as he could remember zwak tested the shoes by bouncing up and down on his toes his excitement registered in the smile on his face but as he remembered his purpose for coming to the room his smile faded and zwak was all business tea he said tea now the russian smiled back and said in pashtu tell your brother i will be there in a moment snatching up his rifle zwak slung it over his shoulder and headed for the door as he reached it he turned back around simonov assumed a thank you was coming instead zwak repeated tea now soon said the russian tea soon and he watched as the man left his room and stepped out into the courtyard to show off his new shoes to his brothers taliban soldiers walking over to his pack simonov withdrew a picture of his son sasha it was the last photo that had been taken of the boy before the accident he pinned the picture to the wall above the desk and placing a kiss upon his fingers pressed them against the photo soon sasha soon he said grabbing a folder full of photographs the russian took a deep breath before heading toward the door everything depended now on whether mullah massoud was still percent committed to his plan stepping into the courtyard simonov prayed that the american he had selected would be the right bait for his trap time and the new president of the united states would tell chapter kandahar province monday three weeks later dr julia gallo sat on a dusty carpet and eyed the cracked mud bricks and exposed timbers of the tiny room she didnt need to look at her interpreter to know that he was watching her ask again she said sayed cleared his throat but the question wouldnt come they were in dangerous territory it was bad enough that the young american doctor dragged him to the most godforsaken villages in the middle of nowhere but now she was openly trying to get them killed if the taliban knew what she was doing theyd both be dead the fivefootsix afghan with deep brown eyes and black hair had a wife three children and a notsoinsignificant extended family that relied on him and the living he made as an interpreter for the first time in his twentytwoyearold life sayed had something very few afghans ever possessedhope hope for himself hope for his family and hope for the future of his country and while what he did was dangerous there was no need to make it any more so by taunting the specter of death dr gallo on the other hand seemed to have a remarkably different set of priorities at fivefootten julia was a tall woman by most standards but by afghan standards she was a giant and although she kept her long red hair covered beneath an afghan headscarf known as a hijab she couldnt hide her remarkable green eyes and the fact that she was a very attractive woman she was a graduate of the obstetrics and gynecology program at rush university medical center in chicago and ten years her translators senior and while she might have shared sayeds vision for the future of afghanistan she had her own opinions of how best to bring it about in a country where most parents didnt name their children until their fifth birthday because infant mortality rates were so high dr gallo and others like her had made a huge difference infant mortality was down more than percent since the taliban had been ousted that meant forty thousand to fifty thousand infants who would have died under the old regime were surviving she should have been thrilled but for some reason she wasnt she was unhappy and that made her push harder to bring about change gallo knew she wasnt just rocking the cultural boat on these visits out into the countryside she was shooting holes in the stern and reloading but she didnt care the taliban were a bunch of vile misogynistic bastards who could rot in hell as far as she was concerned ask her again she demanded sayed knew the answer and was certain dr gallo did too it was embarrassing for the women to have to answer yet she pressed her point anyway it was the setup for a message she had taken to proselytizing on a regular basis gallo had become a zealot in her own right no different from the taliban and as much as sayed admired her this was going to be their last trip out of kabul together he would respectfully ask their ngo care international not to assign him to her anymore he wasnt going to die because of her dr gallo had always been complicated she never spoke about her family or personal life no matter how many hours they spent driving together or how many opportunities sayed offered her she either turned the conversation back to him asking questions she already knew the answers to or she simply sat in the passenger seat staring out the window sayed had given up trying to connect with her and now was done trying to understand her two pairs of eyes lowered toward the floor as sayed capitulated and asked the women dr gallos question once more a long silence followed the translator was tempted to fill the uncomfortable void but gallo held up her hand to quiet him finally the elder of the two women responded in pashtu julia listened and when they were finished sayed translated they traded the girl to pay off her fathers debt he said like some sort of farm animal gallo replied tell them they dont have to live like this i dont care what kind of arrangement the men of this village have with the taliban women have rights even in afghanistan but unless they know their rights they cant begin to exercise them the first step is for them to get educated there is a school less than five kilometers from here why arent they going to it sayed shook his head you know why julia fixed him with her intense green eyes because its dangerous the interpreter didnt reply more dangerous than being beaten by your husband or sold off because your fathers opium fields failed to produce julia waited for an answer and when none was offered she stated we need to explain to them that they have options you say this even though the taliban ride by on motorbikes and spray children and teachers who dare go to school with acid it is easy for you to demand that these women exercise their rights as you say but im sorry dr gallo said sayed as he stood i cant do this anymore cant do what the young man didnt have the energy to explain he had told dr gallo repeatedly that what she was doing was dangerous for both of them ill wait for you outside at the car turning he exited the room and closed the door quietly behind him julia felt a stab of regret sayed was the best interpreter she had ever worked with they had spent countless hours together in some of the wildest most remote regions of the country she had learned that she could trust him and he was invaluable to her she had contributed money out of her own pocket to make sure he was paid better than any of the other translators care used and she had also spearheaded the effort to get the organization to pay to send him to medical school he couldnt leave her not now she wouldnt let him they had a long drive back to kabul she would talk to him shed promise to relax her rhetoric a bit shifting her attention back to her patients julia employed her limited pashtu medical vocabulary and completed the exam chapter twenty minutes later with the sun beginning to sink low in the sky dr gallo exited the mudwalled kwala with her olivedrab medical bag slung over her shoulder and her hijab tightly wrapped around her head afghan men many with aks propped nearby squatted in a circle chatting they fell silent and stared at the american woman as she walked past julia found sayed leaning against the hood of their faded nissan patrol smoking a cigarette ready to go she asked sayed nodded as julia opened the rear passenger door tossed her bag onto the backseat and climbed in front taking one last drag sayed tamped out his cigarette on the bumper and slid the remainder into the pack for later it took several slams before the latch caught and his door would stay shut after starting the engine the interpreter ground the vehicle into first gear and pulled out julia tried to read his face as he picked his way down the dusty road from the village if sayed felt any anger toward her he didnt show it as she tried to come up with the right words to say he beat her to the punch im going to ask to be reassigned julia didnt know how to reply after everything she had done for him she felt betrayed but she knew she was being selfish she had met his wife and his children she understood she had been putting him at greater and greater risk in all fairness it actually said a lot about their friendship that he had kept going into the countryside with her for as long as he had with no words that seemed to suit the moment she said what was in her heart i understand sayed smiled again i will pray for you dr gallo and for your work the redheaded american was about to respond when they came around a bend and she noticed three green afghan national army pickup trucks blocking the road ahead roadblock said sayed julia retrieved her bag from the backseat with her id why would they have a roadblock out here were in the middle of nowhere i dont know he replied eyeing the soldiers manning the mm machine guns mounted atop the vehicles roll bars well have to stop julia nodded running the roadblock was out of the question ana soldiers were poorly disciplined and would open fire with the slightest provocationstopping only when they had exhausted their ammo dont worry he said as he rolled down his window im sure its just routine julia looked at the soldiers they seemed keyed up tense keep the car running she said quietly the interpreter nodded and fished his id out of his pocket as their vehicle slowed to a stop they were surrounded by the heavily armed soldiers sayed placed his hand over his heart nodded and bade the men salaam alaikum no one returned the greeting a captain appeared at sayeds window and snapped his fingers for his id the young afghan complied and handed over his papers without even looking at the documents the captain ordered him out of the suv julia put her hand upon his arm something definitely wasnt right sayed smiled at her and gently pulled his arm away when he had trouble opening his door the captain got angry and wrenched it open from the outside sayed tried to explain that the door was unreliable but the captain wasnt listening he grabbed the young man by the back of the neck and threw him to the ground inside the truck julia gasped and covered her mouth what was going on sayed tried to rise to his feet but the captain kicked him in the ribs wheezing the afghan fell back to the ground julia had seen enough she began to open her door but it was kicked shut by one of the soldiers who then seated his rifle in his shoulder and pointed the muzzle right at her head gallo turned her attention back to sayed she could see him through the open drivers side door lying on the ground with his arms wrapped around his sides he tried to speak but the captain ignored him and brought his boot back for another kick this one landed under the interpreters chin and snapped his head backward julia screamed as sayed fell unconscious and a stream of blood began to trickle from his mouth the captain barked orders at the soldiers and julia knew it was about to be her turn with her elbow she drove the door lock home and leaped for the drivers seat one of the soldiers standing near the captain saw what she was doing and rushed to stop her but instead of shooting her he reached inside the vehicle and grabbed hold of her clothing julia had removed a scalpel from her bag and slashed at him wildly the man roared in pain and fell backward with his hold broken julia forced the car into gear revved the engine and released the brake immediately there was a deafening chorus of gunfire as the nissans tires were flattened and the chassis dropped onto the rims now julia was in real trouble she let go of the scalpel and held up both of her hands with two soldiers covering him the captain extricated her from the vehicle and slammed her up against its side she saw a flash of skin as the back of his hand came forward and cracked into the bone of her cheek just beneath her left eye the force of the blow caused julias vision to dim her knees shook and she felt she was about to lose consciousness the captain stepped away while his men kept her pinned against the suv as julias senses returned she had the distinct impression that they were about to do something very bad she felt certain that she was going to be raped but these men had something much worse in mind the captain squatted and began slapping sayeds face to bring him around it took several minutes to revive him but when he finally came to the captain called over additional men to pick him up they held him until he could stand on his own and then they stepped away without saying a word the captain drew his pistol from his holster and julias stomach dropped she opened her mouth to plead for the interpreters life but as she did a soldier drove his fist into her midsection and knocked the wind from her body as she gasped for air she saw the captain place his weapon against the side of sayeds head and watched in horror as he pulled the trigger chapter mclean virginia wednesday two days later the bright spring day stood in sharp contrast to the new presidents mood robert alden had suggested a walk outside as a way to allow things to cool down between himself and the woman he was with so far it wasnt working you and i both know said the presidents guest that the cia is so riskaverse that even if you showed them where their asses were theyd be afraid to grab on with both hands stephanie gallo was perhaps one of the biggest reasons fortyeightyearold robert alden now occupied the highest office in the world gallo had not only helped orchestrate the alden campaign for president and been one of its biggest donors and best fundraisers she had delivered the mainstream media to him on a silver platter she was an entertainment titan who upon the death of her husband in the early s had spun a midmarket newspaper and two shitty am radio stations into a series of conglomerates that owned newspapers movie studios and television stations around the world she was the person who had convinced alden not only to run for president but that he would win would it was an interesting choice of words she had not said could win but would win she was that confident and she was right the election had been a blowout aldens mildmannered opponent never stood a chance to secure this incredible win gallo had insisted that her media strategy be at the very center of the campaign it was the hub that everything else radiated out from they had worked tirelessly and it had paid off with overwhelming dividends alden owed gallo a tremendous debt which made the discussion they were having that much more difficult if we cant remain calm about this stephanie theres no way well be able to think clearly remain calm gallo shot back how calm would you be if it was your daughter those animals had kidnapped if robert alden hadnt already been married he and stephanie gallo would have made a stunning couple the new president was athletic and handsome he stood sixfoottwo with dark hair and hazel eyes and had a magnetic personality that drew people instantly to him at fiftyfive stephanie gallo was seven years his senior but didnt look a day over forty she was an incredibly attractive woman with auburn hair blue eyes and a large sumptuous mouth she was tall fivefootten when not in heels and had a very alluring physique an international celebrity in her own right gallo competed successfully in a largely male world and made no apologies for doing it as a woman women around the world adored her not only for her sense of style which retained just a hint of sex appeal but also for her frank belief that god had blessed women with curves and that any woman who tried to exercise her body into a replica of a teenaged boys was a fool but despite everything she had going for her all of the notoriety money and power right now she needed a man this man only robert alden could effect her daughters release and stephanie gallo was determined to make that happenno matter what it took alden put his hand on her shoulder i understand how you must feel gallo didnt like being patronized really then why arent you doing anything we own that fucking country for gods sake agree to the terms and here they were again back at the beginning of the argument alden tried to explain his position once more stephanie i agree with the cias assessment these people kidnapped julia for this very reason they knew you would come to me and ask me to intervene the terrorist imprisoned in kabul the one they want for julia is an alqaeda operativea very bad one do you know how many highlevel afghan government officials he has helped kill for the afghan government this is like capturing lee harvey oswald john hinkley and john wilkes booth all at once we cant say that we want afghanistan to obey the rule of law only when it serves our interests besides i ran on a platform of being tough on terrorists and not repeating any of the mistakes of my predecessors screw your platform and screw your predecessors snapped gallo were talking about julias life for christs sake im sorry stephanie i what do you mean youre sorry are you telling me that we cant convince the afghans to give us this mustafa khan for twentyfour hours fortyeight tops so that we can get my daughter back and if we lose him asked alden then flood the skies with predators and retask all of our satellites over afghanistan i dont care i just want her back i know you do i do too i also care about what happens in afghanistan youve got to know that this is not easy for me gallo scowled at the president this is your first chance to really exercise your power and youre afraid to use it thats what i think alden could feel his blood pressure rising and he fought to keep it under control i warned you both about this julia knew the risks when she took that job over there that doesnt change anything stephanie ive explained to you how this works the afghans take the lead in kidnapping investigations within their own countryeven those of american citizens the cia everyone at our embassy in kabul and our entire military apparatus in theater are doing everything they can to get julia back except giving her kidnappers the one thing theyve asked for alden shook his head sadly youre the president of the united states youre telling me you cant tell the afghans that khan is part of a larger investigation we are running and that we need to interrogate him in our facility at bagram once we trade him for julia and get her back we can hunt him down ourselves if the afghans caught khan once we should be able to catch him a second time with no problem first of all the afghans got lucky because someone tipped them off second what youre asking me to do is dishonest and thats not how i operate gallo stared at alden and let the presidents statement hover between them like a lit stick of dynamite it didnt take alden long to get uncomfortable his guest didnt have to say a word he knew what she was thinking listen stephanie were going to get julia back i promise im sorry but your promise is not good enough you need to start doing more a lot more or what gallos eyes bore right into aldens or your presidency is going to be one of the shortest in us history are you threatening me he asked youre damn right im threatening you weve lost two days its time for you to get her back and if i dont then said gallo choosing her next words carefully the world is going to quickly find out that the new american president was not only an accessory to the deaths of four innocent people but actively conspired to cover it up fifteen yards away in the thick blanket of trees that bordered stephanie gallos equestrian estate a young secret service agent froze dead in her tracks chapter rockwood maine thursday scot harvath pounded down the abandoned logging road with his enormous white caucasian ovcharka right by his side a former navy seal who until recently had been the nations top counterterrorism operative harvath was in his late thirties fivefootten with a handsome rugged face sandy brown hair and bright blue eyes his dog bullet stood nearly forty inches at the shoulder and weighed almost two hundred pounds caucasian ovcharkas or caucasian sheepdogs as their name translates to had been the breed of choice for the russian military and the former east german border patrol they were exceedingly fast fiercely loyal and absolutely vicious when it came to guarding their territory and those closest to them if ever a dog and its owner resembled each other it was these two harvath and his girlfriend tracy had spent their winter in maine this year tracys grandfather a former navy man himself had a winterized cottage on moosehead lake and was glad to see it used the peace and quiet had agreed with both of them the snowshoeing skiing hunting and chopping wood had taken harvath to an entirely new level of physical fitness he couldnt remember the last time he had felt this good now spring had come early and summer appeared to be right on its heels the snow and ice disappeared almost overnight and the temperature for two weeks straight had been downright balmy harvath had been torn about the upcoming summer on the one hand he was excited to be getting back to work the new president had been very aggressive with his first hundred days campaigning on a platform of change he had done just that the minute he stepped into the oval officeand not necessarily for the better robert alden had singlehandedly eviscerated the nations intelligence apparatus granted much of it especially at the cia needed to be ripped out and rebuilt but for every smart move the man made he made two more that were downright dangerous for the nations security the elimination of the topsecret program where harvath had been working under the previous administration was a prime example dubbed the apex project it was buried in a littleknown branch of dhs called the office of international investigative assistance or oiia for short the oiias overt mission was to assist foreign police military and intelligence agencies in helping to prevent terrorist attacks in that sense harvaths mission was in step with the official oiia mandate in reality he was a very secretive dog of war enlisted post to be unleashed by the president upon the enemies of the united states anywhere any time and with anything he needed to get the job done his sole mandate had been to help protect americans and american interests at home and abroad by leveling the playing field with the worlds terrorists and since they chose not to play by any rules harvath wasnt expected to either he took the tactics from his enemies that worked and turned those tactics right back on them he had also invented several of his own along the way harvath took no pleasure in the killing he was required to do for his country but he understood that to keep america from harm violent men often had to be met with violence the men harvath killed were beyond diplomacy beyond being reasoned with violence was the only language they understood president robert alden though was of a different mind the winds of change had blown him into office and because of that he believed he had been given a mandate the hawks had flown high above the american political landscape for eight years now the doves had taken flight the american people had spoken that was democracy and harvath both understood and respected it but america wouldnt make its enemies disappear just by putting someone new in the oval office the republic would always need its sheepdogs no matter which way the political winds blew maybe alden would get lucky and actually bring about true reform in the american intelligence community but if what he had done so far was any indication of what was to come things were not going to get any better any time soon bureaucrats at the cia and elsewhere were too riskaverse and too concerned with getting promoted to focus on beating americas enemies the men and women in the field were not getting the resources they needed nor were they getting even halfway decent management or leadership the nation spent billions of dollars to find solutions to intelligence problems that shouldnt even exist americans slept soundly in their beds at night believing their country had countless james bonds around the world infiltrating terrorist networks and rogue regimes in order to keep them safe and prevent the next attack if they only knew the real truth theyd be marching on dc with torches and pitchforks how nineteen goatherds could do what they did on to the most powerful nation on the face of the earth was still beyond harvath what puzzled him more was that heads had not rolled at the cia over the attacks accountability as well as personal responsibility had been chucked out the window of american government it also had been abdicated by the american voter as long as most americans could have their mcdonalds drivethroughs listen to their ipods and watch american idol they didnt seem to care how negligently the nations national security apparatus was being run bread and circuses the romans had it right as long as people had food and fun they didnt care much about the erosion of their nation that said a small and growing number of americans did care and as their voices grew harvath hoped they would attract more attention to themselves and more attention to what needed to be done time was running out for the ineffective business as usual system in washington one day soon the american citizenry was going to wake up harvath only hoped it wouldnt take another catastrophic attack to make that happen for his part harvath was glad to have cast off the bureaucratic shackles of washington as of june he would start a new position in the private sector with a private intelligencegathering company not only would he continue to use his full skill set in the service of his country hed also be increasing his income several times over it looked like the perfect winwin situation and no matter what harvath did he was always about winning he hit the sevenmile mark on his run and clicked the button on his kobold chronograph to halt the stopwatch he slowed to a walk and used the bottom of his shirt to wipe the sweat from his face when he looked down at his dog he noticed something was wrong the hair on bullets back was standing straight up they were deep in moose territory and there was always the possibility of an encounter with a black bear or a bobcat but they tended to shy away from humans unless they had young with them and you got too close harvath stopped walking and tried to discern what was bothering bullet as he did the dog began growling they were less than fifty yards from where harvath had left his suv and that was the direction bullets attention seemed drawn to something told him hed better get control of his dog but when he reached for his collar bullet took off harvath yelled for him to stop but the dog kept going for a fraction of a second harvath stood transfixed it was like watching a lion charge across the savanna the beauty of the moment was shortlived the dog was likely headed for danger and harvath took off after him he soon disappeared into the trees near where harvath had parked his truck and began barking it wasnt his normal bark and harvath was now certain that something was very wrong running at a fullout sprint he came around a stand of trees and noticed the front door of his trailblazer was wide open and parked right behind the suv blocking it in with its engine still running was a blackedout chevy tahoe bullet stood on his hind legs with his huge front paws pressed against the tahoes driversside window he was barking even louder and more angrily than before his long sharp teeth gnashing together harvath drew the taurus tcp he jogged with and approached the tahoe as he got closer he saw that it had government plates he didnt know what it was doing here but he didnt like it leaving bullet to distract whoever was inside harvath kept his gun out of sight and approached the passengerside window sitting in front were two men of medium build with short hair and dark suits they looked like feds secret service or maybe fbi but that still didnt explain what they were doing in the middle of nowhere parked behind his suv and why one of his doors had been opened harvath had always lived by the maxim have a smile for everyone you meet and a plan to kill them it was what had kept him alive in his particularly dangerous line of work the key was in striking the right balance between healthy suspicion and crippling paranoia not an easy feat with the number of enemies harvath had made over the years part of the appeal of maine had been that nobody knew him here and he could relax it was a plan that had been working right up until just a few moments ago tightening his grip on his weapon harvath tapped the glass with his free hand and caught the men inside by surprise the suit in the passenger seat lowered his window but only partway jesus christ he exclaimed is that your dog and my truck replied harvath nodding toward the suv the men had blocked in you want to call him off after scanning the inside of the tahoe harvath whistled bullet growled for a few seconds then leaped down and came around to harvaths side of the tahoe whats your name demanded the passenger harvath didnt like the mans attitude william howard taft he replied whats yours cutting off his lessthanaffable partner the driver answered im benson hes wagner were united states secret service as if they had rehearsed this a million times both men reached into their jackets in unison ostensibly to remove their credentials whoa whoa whoa said harvath lets take it easy nobody needs to be in a hurry benson motioned for wagner to relax and using his left hand he pulled back the left side of his suit jacket to show harvath what he was doing slowly he slid his thumb and forefinger into his inside pocket and retrieved his credentials he then opened his id wallet and extended his arm toward harvath were from the portland office what were you doing in my truck it was unlocked interjected wagner harvath ignored him and kept his eyes on benson we were looking to see if youd left a map or some indication of which direction you were running answered the driver why we needed to speak with you as soon as possible your girlfriend said benson his voice trailing off as he replaced his credentials and looked down at a notepad on his armrest for the name tracy she told us we could probably find you out here she said this was where you normally run she didnt mention that dog though did she added wagner angrily that fucking thing almost bit me its like a goddamn polar bear im lucky i got back into the car in one piece harvath patted bullet on the head and smiled benson seemed okay but he didnt care much for this other guy wagner good dog he said to bullet and then turning back to benson asked what do you want the president needs to see you the man replied which one the new one president alden the name still took some getting used to for harvath alden he repeated why does he want to see me benson shook his head no idea we were told to find you and transport you to greenville municipal theres an aircraft waiting there to take you to him wagner looked out his window at bullet who began growling at him again i dont think so replied harvath as he covertly tucked his weapon into his waistband covered it with his shirt and prepared to walk away mr harvath insisted benson we were told that whatever the president wants to discuss with you its very important and very timesensitive thats why we came all the way out here to find you harvath had no idea what alden could possibly want with him but based on what he had seen of the mans judgment it wasnt anything harvath wanted to be involved with if the new president was interested in him he should have thought of that before he fired him and harvath had found a new job please tell the president that i respectfully declined i dont work for washington anymore in that case said benson as he slowly reached for the glove compartment and opened it we were asked to give you this the agent withdrew a sat phone and handed it to his partner wagner still wary of the dog balanced it on the partly open window until harvath took it whats this he asked a snowcone maker said wagner as he rolled his window back up youd think a smart guy like william howard taft could figure that out harvath took the window rolling up as a sign that their meeting was over and backed bullet away from the tahoe just as benson put it into reverse moments later the government suv uturned onto the deserted logging road and disappeared chapter the interior of the super puma ec helicopter was as elegant as any private jet harvath had ever flown on white handstitched leather seating was complemented by black hermès pillows and polished chrome tables while it was a little cold for harvaths taste he had to give the helicopters owner whoever he was points for style when he had been told that transportation was standing by this was not at all what he had envisioned president alden had surprised him whether that was a good thing had yet to be seen harvath was reserving judgment until he had actually met the man facetoface he had returned home with the satellite phone and set it upon the kitchen table while he went upstairs to take a shower and change when he came down tracy was waiting for him with two mugs of coffee they had gone back and forth about what to do with tracy playing devils advocate throughout she knew that as much as harvath was fully prepared to take on his new job he still missed his old one he was a patriot and serving his country was his ultimate calling in the end harvath agreed that it couldnt hurt to talk blowing the new president off even if he had eliminated the project harvath had worked on was probably not the best of ideasespecially with what he did for a living at some point he could very well need the presidents help the least he could do was to hear the man out harvath went outside and activated the sole number that had been programmed into the satellite phone on the second ring the president himself answered alden was polite but brief he was in maine and wanted to see harvath in person hence the helicopter he had standing by he was not at liberty to explain things over the phone and would fill harvath in when they met though harvath had not voted for alden and questioned many of his policies he still respected the office and agreed to go meet him within twenty minutes harvath was airborne and within forty more he had arrived at seal harbor seal harbor was a very affluent new england enclave located on the southern end of maines mount desert island while the betterknown town of bar harbor had been attracting celebrities tourists and politicians for generations seal harbor was where the truly rich and powerful could enjoy the islands thick forests gently sloping mountains and jagged coastline without being bothered one such resident was a lifestyle and homedecorating maven with an immensely popular television series with her primary residence in manhattan and other homes in connecticut upstate new york and nantucket her sixtytwoacre seal harbor estate was occupied only a fraction of the year she often loaned out the twelvebedroom pink granite summer cottage which had been built by a wealthy automobile family in the early s to friends and business associates invisible from the road and completely insulated from the public the estate allowed its guests to get away from it all and relax in an intensely private setting it was exactly this high degree of privacy that had attracted the estates current guests the super pumas tires touched down on an impeccably manicured esplanade of grass when the airstairs were lowered harvath exited the helicopter and was met by a pair of secret service agents who led him to the main house they walked up a paved path and entered the kitchen via a breezeway with its retro appliances and vintage furnishings the room gave one the feeling of having stepped back in time after harvath was screened for weapons he was taken down a paneled hallway to a dramatic wooden staircase following its red and gold runner to the top of the stairs he was met by another pair of secret service agents who accompanied him down a long wainscoted hall to a pair of mahogany doors with shiny brass hardware standing guard there was a lone female secret service agent having been recruited to the former presidents protective detail before being tasked to the apex project harvath still maintained a lot of contacts in the service he was aware of how robert alden had cleaned house and forced improvements there as well his intent had been to demonstrate more diversity in the agents who surrounded him it was a noble endeavor but like many other wellintentioned efforts alden had undertaken he had rushed through it like a bull in a china shop more concerned with appearances than results as part of the presidents mandate many exceptional agents were promoted to his detail as were many lessthanexceptional agents some of the most experienced agents were then asked to step aside and take other assignments outside the white house in order to make room for the younger agents alden wanted to pull up through the ranks the president was not only gambling with his life he was also gambling with the lives of all those sworn to protect him the secret service had tried to dissuade the president from such a drastic course of action but no matter how many alternatives they offered him alden wanted the results he wanted and he wanted them immediately his childish refrain of i won was often heard in the white house and was intended to end all discussions it created much resentment and was beneath the dignity of the office but the president didnt seem to care such was the depth of his insecurity looking at the freshfaced blondhaired blueeyed agent on the door harvath wondered if she was one of those who had been recently rocketed to the top of the secret service ticket over his career he had known a lot of extremely qualified female agents all of whom had been serious asskickers they had also all paid their dues and earned their stripes promoting anyone in this job based on anything other than talent experience training and commitment was a potentially tragic mistake harvath tried to push the thought from his mind alden had made his bed and he would have to lie in it the presidents policies as well as the makeup of his protective detail were not harvaths problems smiling at the agent harvath waited as she knocked and then opened the door for him once he had stepped inside she closed the door and resumed her post in the hall the room looked like a study in a british manor house with soaring ceilings exposed beams and tall leadedglass windows the walls were covered in silk and exhibited a hodgepodge of oil paintings hung salon style at the end of the room near a fireplace large enough for a hockey faceoff were two couches sitting upon the couches were two people harvath had never met but whom he recognized instantly the first was president robert alden the second whose presence made no sense to him was one of the presidents biggest donors and supporters media mogul stephanie gallo both stood and greeted harvath as he crossed to the sitting area thank you for coming said the president as he shook harvaths hand scot harvath id like to introduce you to mrs stephanie gallo im pleased to meet you mr harvath said gallo likewise replied harvath as he accepted the womans hand he had seen her on television and in countless magazines but she was even more stunning in person i hope your flight in was comfortable harvath smiled it was very comfortable but im confused gallo arched her perfectly tweezed eyebrows about what when the president promised to bring change to washington i didnt expect it to include his marine corps helicopters alden chuckled you can thank mrs gallo for your transportation mr harvath that was her helicopter you flew here on thank you youre welcome responded gallo not certain whether the man was trying to be charming or if he was being a smartass she didnt like people she couldnt read they tended to be difficult to control which made them difficult to work with why dont we take a seat suggested alden as he motioned harvath to one of the couches on a low table was a silver coffee service may i offer you some coffee thank you said harvath alden filled three cups and once they were all seated with their coffee the president got down to business mr harvath ive asked you here today on a very sensitive matter are you familiar with a man named mustafa khan harvath shook his head no im not the president opened a dossier and read mustafa jamal khan dual britishpakistani citizen age thirtysix one of osama bin ladens junior lieutenants khan was born in the uk to pakistani parents he attended university in britain as well as alqaeda training camps in afghanistan and pakistan he has a degree in finance and worked in insurance international banking and at the london stock exchange before giving everything up and moving to karachi and committing himself to alqaeda fulltime he was said to have been moving back and forth between afghanistan and pakistans northwest frontier province where he helped plan a series of deadly terrorist attacks including the assassinations of several highranking afghan government officials no one had ever been able to pinpoint his exact location until the afghan national army captured him just over a week ago they now have him awaiting trial in kabul and plan to make an example of him closing the folder and handing it to harvath alden then said three days ago mrs gallos daughter julia was kidnapped in afghanistan im so sorry about that said harvath as he accepted the folder and opened it the president continued the people holding her have agreed to let her go in exchange for mustafa khan at that harvath looked up from the file do we know who has her based on our intelligence we believe were dealing with taliban militants aligned with alqaeda do we think mullah omar has a hand in this him or someone close to him replied the president what about the afghan government asked harvath whats their position on this when the ana tracked khan down he was being protected by a cadre of more than fifteen alqaeda bodyguards the afghans suffered heavy losses more than thirtyfive of their soldiers died and considering the afghan government wants to put khan on trial im guessing theyre not exactly amenable to handing him over to us so we can trade him for mrs gallos daughter alden gave stephanie gallo a glance as if to say see i told you this man knows what hes doing and then replied no theyre not and unfortunately we cant force the afghans to cooperate harvath sensed that they were beginning to close in on the reason he had been invited to this meeting even though were talking about an american citizen the kidnapping happened in afghanistan so that means that the afghans have authority over this correct replied alden i assume cia fbi dia state and all of our military assets in the region are at the disposal of the investigation the president nodded harvath had been down this delicate road before and knew how to read between the lines im guessing you want to make sure no options go unexplored is that correct exactly stated gallo alden held up his hand to quiet her mr harvath i did my homework before asking you here while i regret having to close the project you were working on under the previous administration it was by no means a comment on your exceptional abilities or exemplary service to our nation harvath had never been comfortable with fulsome praise and was doubly suspicious when it came from politicians should i assume that the reason im here is to assist in the recovery of mrs gallos daughter in a manner of speaking said alden there was something the man wasnt telling him the president took a deep breath his cheeks filling with air and exhaled slowly before responding the afghans have not made an acceptable amount of progress on julias kidnapping in all fairness i believe the government in kabul means well but they alden trailed off as he tried to find the right words gallo had no trouble coming up with them the entire government in that shithole of a country is inept and they dont have control over anything they cant even move around kabul without heavily armored convoys the taliban and alqaeda on the other hand go wherever they like whenever they like weve put billions of dollars and countless lives into that country and what do we have to show for it not nearly enough thats for damn sure she had hit the nail on the head and all three of them knew it harvath looked at the president who replied mrs gallo is a good friend of mine and i want to do everything possible to get her daughter back harvath looked back down at the file it says here that mrs gallo offered a sizable ransom but it was turned down ten million dollars stated the media titan it was an incredible amount of money theyve made it very clear said alden that theyre interested in one thing and one thing onlythe release of mustafa khan so what is it exactly you want me to do asked harvath give him to them replied gallo harvath looked up at her excuse me you heard me she said we want you to travel to afghanistan snatch mustafa khan out of that prison in kabul and exchange him for my daughter chapter this is a pretty dangerous operation were talking about said harvath and from what i understand replied gallo youre not exactly allergic to getting your hands dirty pardon me he said not sure he was hearing this woman correctly are you having a problem understanding me mr harvath i think i might be gallo looked at the president and rolled her eyes harvath was growing increasingly displeased with what he sensed was going on here friend and major donor or not it was completely out of bounds for the president to have read a civilian in on his background alden recognized what was happening and tried to clear the air mrs gallo was part of my transition team she has topsecret clearance to the degree i felt was necessary she has been filled in on your background mr harvath continued gallo im not looking to hire a clown to make balloon animals at a childs birthday party i need an experienced operator who can and will do everything necessary to bring my daughter back alive harvath marveled at the irony of it all gallo had rallied the media behind aldens candidacy she and others like her in the news industry were antius military antiextreme interrogation tactics antigitmo and proterrorist rights on a daily basis now she not only needed but wanted the help of exactly the kind of person she vilified in her papers and on her television stations even more ironic was that she had sought out the help of a president who had run on scaling back his nations overaggressive military and who didnt know the first thing about the military intelligence or foreign policy but the icing on the cake was that they both appeared to want harvath to reprise his previous job the one alden had just eliminated it was everything harvath could do not to laugh out loud none of the sheep ever wanted a sheepdog around until one of them spotted a wolf by then it was often too late even though he had never met julia gallo he felt sorry for her from what he could tell of her file she was a good person dedicated to serving others who had gone to afghanistan to make a difference harvath knew the taliban all too well and what they did to their prisoners for her sake he hoped that she actually could be rescued harvath looked at the president he already knew what the answer to his next question would be but he had to ask it anyway if i do accept this assignment what kind of support can i expect from the white house alden paused before replying unfortunately none harvath had figured as much the united states government continued the president cannot be tied to this or to you in any way at this point youre a private contractor who has been employed by a private american citizen mrs gallo that would be the extent of it harvath was quiet he had spent the better part of his adult life hunting down and killing terrorists not breaking them out of prisons it flew in the face of almost everything he stood for even so he knew that julia gallo shouldnt be made to suffer just because he disliked the terms of her release gallo sensed hesitancy and tried to pinpoint where it was coming from according to what ive been told youve operated in afghanistan before correct i have answered harvath and youve got contacts there a few enough to get my daughter back nothings ever a slam dunk replied harvath a lot will depend on the situation on the ground stephanie gallo placed her cup and saucer on the table lets talk money harvath was uncomfortable with the idea of haggling over the value of saving an american citizens life that said he did know he was being asked to do a very dangerous job that few were as qualified as he to carry out he also knew that putting together the kind of team hed need in afghanistan wouldnt be cheap its going to be expensive he stated as he tried to come up with a rough number in his head what are we talking about the media maven asked the right people weapons vehicles intel itll run into the six figures very quickly without blinking an eye gallo replied ill give you five hundred thousand dollars up front and another five hundred thousand when you get my daughter back as far as expenses are concerned ill have two million dollars wired to a bank of your choosing within the hour do we have a deal harvath looked at the file in his lap and studied the photos of julia gallo and her slain interpreter once more closing the folders cover his eyes met gallos and he gave her his answer half an hour later after sorting out as many of the details as possible harvath climbed back aboard the super puma helicopter and lifted off on the other side of the estate elise campbell the young secret service agent whod been standing post outside the door to the study had just finished her shift as she watched the helicopter rise above the trees and recede into the distance she wrestled with what she was about to do making sure no one was within earshot she punched a number into her cell phone and raised it to her ear when the call connected she thought seriously about hanging up but instead said its elise campbell we need to talk chapter kabul afghanistan friday stephanie gallo removed the first hurdles to harvaths assignment with nothing more than a handful of phone calls via a relationship with the board of the international aid organization her daughter worked for she arranged for harvath to be listed as a new volunteer and paved the way for an expedited visa for him from the afghan embassy in dc when gallo returned harvaths passport it was accompanied by a large amount of american currency which he sewed into the bottoms of his two suitcases gallo arranged to fly him on her dassault falcon x longrange jet from dc to dubai and though the aircraft could have easily taken him on to kabul he declined he wanted to attract as little attention to himself as possible when he arrived in afghanistan he had even dressed down in addition to jeans and a longsleeved under armour shirt he wore a pair of asolo hiking boots and a lowkey blackhawk warrior wear jacket system he boarded his kam air flight for kabul in dubai and as he passed the cockpit he picked up the unmistakable odor of russian aftershave the former soviet pilots who made the hop from the uae to afghanistan were notorious for their drinking problems harvath hoped the mans drinking wouldnt impair his ability to fly the plane he spent an extra couple hundred bucks for first class which meant that his armrests were held together with blue duct tape instead of gray and that five out of a possible twenty screws bolted his seat to the floor instead of the three the poor folks back in coach had harvath wisely declined the inflight meal and instead snacked on food he had bought in the dutyfree shop before leaving dubai he had spent a good amount of the flight over to the uae sleeping he wanted to get adjusted to the nineandahalfhour time difference between afghanistan and dc as quickly as possible even though stephanie gallos jet was extremely comfortable his body still felt tired and stiff had he had the time he would have preferred a couple of days in dubai to allow his body to unkink and his internal clock to reset going into a place like afghanistan jetlagged and off his game was a good way to get killed harvath stared out the window and tried to relax his mind as some of the most godforsaken territory on the planet slipped beneath the belly of the aging kam air when they finally came over the jagged mountain peaks just outside kabul the sky was a bright blue and harvath saw that snow remained on many of the mountaintops it must have still been cold at night as a thin haze hung over the city from the diesel stoves known as bukharis that afghans used to heat their homes as the plane made its steep descent and came in on approach they flew over kabuls notorious policharki prison where mustafa khan was being kept from above it looked like a giant wagon wheel surrounded by four very high walls harvath compared the prison and the area around it to the satellite imagery he had seen before leaving the united states as he did his thoughts were interrupted by a slight concern though the plane was quickly descending harvath had never felt the landing gear lowered within seconds the plane reached one thousand feet and there was a blaring siren from the cockpit as the gear horn announced the pilots potentially fatal error harvath gripped his ducttaped armrests as the pilots transferred power to the aircrafts large engines and tried to abort the landing the kam air plane barely missed the rooftops of houses near the end of the runway as it climbed back up dropped its gear and came back in for a second attempt safely on the ground harvath peeked inside the cockpit at the russian pilot on his way off the plane the man was so covered in sweat he looked as if hed been thrown in a shower fully clothed so much for a quiet arrival thought harvath the landinggear incident was not a good omen stepping onto the tarmac harvath took a deep breath hed been on airplanes and inside stale terminal buildings for over twentyfour hours and though it wasnt the freshest air in the world it was still better than the recycled stuff hed been forced to endure kabul international airport was exactly how he remembered itbland boring and indistinguishable from any number of thirdworld airports he had passed through over his career the twostory terminal was constructed of concrete covered with opaque white plaster and blue trim though the temperature was somewhere in the forties airport employees shuffled slowly across the tarmac as if it were three times that antennas bristled from every rooftop and a smattering of old planes many of them russian sat off to one side waiting for someone to haul them to the scrap heap adjacent to the commercial portion of the airport was the international military airfield it was ringed with razor wire and armed checkpoints sleek new jets and helicopters stood in marked contrast to the aircraft harvath had just disembarked from and it seemed a fitting metaphor for what side of the fence he was now on in his professional life making his way across the tarmac he entered the terminal building and waited for his suitcases once he had them he proceeded to customs where the afghan inspectors were even less interested in him than the emiratis had been muslim nations were not exactly known for being bastions of activity and intellectual curiosity nevertheless had he run into a problem in either country he carried an envelope of currency in his breast pocket that would have smoothed everything over baksheeshthe arabic equivalent for bribewas the universal lubricant that drove the engine of commerce everywhere but especially in the islamic world having operated all over it he had watched baksheesh work miracles after filling out an entry card and passing through passport control harvath stepped into the bustling main terminal area though his demeanor never would have suggested it he was completely switched on afghanistan was incredibly dangerous especially for foreignersboth military and nonmilitary and not having had the time to grow a beard or to take other steps to blunt his western appearance he looked every bit the outsider his eyes scanned the terminal as he made his way toward the front doors outside people waiting to get in stood in line to have their belongings searched and to undergo a patdown watching the absence of skill exhibited by the male and female afghan national police officers conducting the physical searches harvath guessed it would only be a matter of time before a suicide bomber got inside and detonated near the ticket counter or some other densely packed spot within the airport as he pushed through the doors he was glad to leave the building behind the muddy parking lot was a mass of people dodging dingy minibuses soiled suvs and derelict sedans off to the right on the edge of the parking lot was a pair of heavily armored suburbans surrounded by a group of equally wellarmed andarmored men whose appearance screamed private security contractor the locals referred to the american contractors as the gunmen of kabul and the afghan president had been working hard to get as many of the companies closed down as possible he claimed that many of the contracting companies were corrupt and had been using their guns and power to commit murders smuggle drugs deal drugs rob banks and conduct extortion while a handful of contractors had most likely gone rogue and deserved the contempt of both the government and their peers the majority were honorable professional outfits that believed in their mission in afghanistan they also believed that the afghan president was on a bogus witch hunt and charged contracting firms exorbitant licensing fees there were also rumors that the firms being hounded the hardest were those who neglected to pay off the right government bureaucrats in return for administrative protection the net effect was that the smaller contractors had to get very creative in order to make ends meet especially with license fees now north of seventy thousand dollars on the other side of the lot leaning against a dented toyota land cruiser reading a paperback was one such contractor greg gallagher or baba g as the afghans had nicknamed him which meant grandfather g was a fiftyyearold force reconnaissance marine he and harvath had been assigned to the same amphibious ready group in the persian gulf early in harvaths career as a seal they had been good friends ever since gallagher had come to afghanistan four years ago after taking early retirement from the corps most assumed he had come in search of adventure and easy money and very few people knew the real reason he was there force recon marines were similar to seals in that they conducted deep reconnaissance operations carried out strikes and other smallscale offensive actions in hostile or politically sensitive environments captured and destroyed enemy targets and engaged in the sophisticated world of direct action in short they were the special operations forces of the us marine corps and greg gallagher was one of their best operators at least he had been until he shot a young child whose father had charged a roadblock in iraq it was a textbook example of how when everything can go wrong it does gallagher and his men were augmenting a checkpoint during a time of heightened violence in iraq there was intelligence stating that four different vehicleborne explosive devices or vbeds were going to attempt to infiltrate downtown karbala which was sixty miles southwest of baghdad and considered by shia islam as the secondholiest city after mecca one of karbalas most popular attractions was the tomb of the prophet mohammeds grandson husayn ibn ali known as the masjid alhusayn the tomb was believed to be one of the gates to paradise and was a popular shia pilgrimage location according to us military intelligence it was also the bombers primary target the vehicle that gallagher had fired upon was a white chevy caprice it had swung out from behind the line of cars waiting to be inspected and rushed the checkpoint despite repeated commands to halt not even warning shots had deterred its driver based upon his rules of engagement and fearing for the safety of his marines and the civilians clustered near the checkpoint gallagher engaged the vehicle and painted a racing stripe up the center of the hood and right through the windshield of the car when the vehicle skidded to a stop just before the checkpoint everyone braced for impact within seconds the driver leaped from his vehicle and pulled his bloody child from the backseat he sat down on the road cradling his little boy and wailing in arabic when he had ascertained that the car posed no threat gallagheran accomplished medicpersonally attended to the boy while the teams interpreter translated for the father the boy was very sick and the father had been trying to get him to the hospital he had no idea there was a checkpoint and when he had seen the long line of vehicles he feared his son wouldnt survive the wait so he had decided to risk coming up the shoulder to ask the americans if he and his son could be granted permission to pass gallagher called in a helicopter for transport but it arrived too late the little iraqi boy bled out in his fathers arms though the father was clearly to blame gallagher didnt see it that way he had pulled the trigger and his bullets had killed that little boy it made no difference to him that the investigation had absolved him of any wrongdoing and that the vehicle could very well have been carrying an explosive device instead of a sick child tactically he had done the right thing but gallagher couldnt get beyond the fact that he had killed a little boy finally he had left the corps at sixfootfour and pounds baba g was a big bear of a man and still looked every inch the marine he had an intense pair of dark eyes a full head of gray hair kept at an acceptable length and a short wispy beard that no matter how hard he tried refused to come in fuller he was wearing jeans and hiking boots along with a denim shirt and a black duluth trading company carpenters jacket as harvath neared the truck gallagher tossed his book onto the front seat and smiled mister mister he shouted mimicking the swarm of afghan cabbies that had been dogging harvath since he had come out of the terminal you need ride no thanks replied harvath as he drew alongside baba gs land cruiser and dropped his bags i was told to wait here for a big handsome marine you havent seen one have you gallagher looked over both shoulders there was one here a few minutes ago but he heard some squid was in town and ran home to lock up his goats those marines chuckled harvath always so protective of their women gallagher pretended to go for his gun but then stopped and extended his hand harvath grasped it and baba g pulled him in for a hug its good to see you brother you too replied harvath breaking off the hug gallagher bent and grabbed harvaths suitcases youre just in time for rush hour he said as he opened the back of his truck and tossed the bags inside depending on how fast the donkey carts are moving it could take us at least fifteen minutes to get to the compound i hate friday traffic in kabul you and me both gallagher replied with a smile as he pointed harvath around to the passenger side of the land cruiser climbing inside harvath looked down at the book the marine had been reading jackie collins he asked as gallagher climbed into the drivers seat and shut his door the infidel section of the kabul library is somewhat limited my friend baba g replied as he slid the gearshift which was surrounded by expired air fresheners into first but we do what we can tia right tia was an acronym that stood for this is afghanistan it was a catchall phrase that unburdened them of the need for long drawnout explanations of things both men had come to appreciate that afghanistan was a country and culture unique unto itself here certain things happened certain ways for certain reasons to try to explain or understand them in a western frame of mind was a waste of time hence tia before letting out the clutch gallagher reached behind his seat and withdrew a small insulated cooler bag a little something to help you adjust he said as he handed it to harvath courtesy of the local welcome wagon harvath unzipped the lid and saw that it contained a cold sixpack of sugarfree red bull and a mm glock i feel at home already he said as he removed the pistol checked to make sure a round was chambered and then tucked it into his waistband before popping the tab on a red bull dont get too comfortable replied gallagher thereve been a couple of developments since we last spoke and i dont think youre going to like what i have to report chapter they splashed through the streets past drab sovietera buildings mudwalled compounds and stores fronted by pushcarts and wheelbarrows filled with cheap merchandise from pakistan afghan men squatted in groups alongside the road or shuffled slowly through the cold air that still clung to the sixthousandfoothigh city their hands clasped behind their backs in the afghan fashion while women in cornflowerblue burkas filled ratty shopping bags with their marketing or carried large plastic jugs of water children ran everywhere the latemorning traffic was thick and was accompanied by a cacophony of car horns the only person who wasnt honking was baba g who was busy answering harvaths questions youre absolutely sure asked harvath one more time baba g nodded as he downshifted and maneuvered his land cruiser around one of kabuls many traffic circles at the top of the circle were two trucks filled with afghan national army soldiers all of them armed with heavy weapons as well as mm machine guns mounted to the roll bars of their vehicles harvath didnt know what he liked less the close proximity of so many carsany number of which could be carrying alqaeda or taliban militantsor the fact that mustafa khan was no longer being kept at policharki prison whyd they move him gallagher smiled and rubbed his left thumb and forefinger together for the same reason we thought wed be able to get him out baksheesh welcome to afghanistan harvath was familiar with the ancient adage that you cant buy an afghan you can only rent one and policharki wasnt immune from this longstanding afghan tradition of trading money for favors in fact policharki was infamous for being able to hold anyone but a rich man bribe the right guard the right family of a guard or the right elders of the village the guard was from and anyone could be sprung from policharki harvath hadnt expected freeing khan to be a walk in the park he and gallagher had assumed that the alqaeda operative would have been kept away from the general population and that it was going to take big money not only to get the two of them inside but also to get back out again with khan in their custody what had bothered harvath from the start though was that if he was thinking this way then alqaeda had to be as well they would be willing to spend a lot of money to get him back and this must have been exactly what the afghan government was worried about they had come to the conclusion that policharki couldnt hold him so they had moved him the question was where so how do we find him asked harvath ive got some feelers out said gallagher as they passed another heavily armed afghan national army checkpoint harvath watched the picture recede in his sideview mirror i dont remember seeing so many soldiers the last time i was here the government is trying to exert more control over kabul attacks and suicide bombings have been going through the roof everybodys all keyed up harvath was aware of the fact that the situation in afghanistan had deteriorated but seeing how severely kabul which once had a modicum of security had been affected didnt do much for his mood tell me about the feelers youve got out the afghans are bigtime gossips nobody talks more than they do ive got a guy in the afghan national police who has a couple of cousins in afghan intelligence ive fed him some information in the past nothing stellar pretty lowhanging fruit but it made him look good at work and so weve got a happy relationship were meeting him this afternoon inshaallah hell have something worthwhile for us harvath laughed at baba gs use of the popular muslim phrase for allah willing you havent gone native on me have you when in rome answered gallagher applying his turn signal as they approached a narrow deadend street threequarters of the way down on the lefthand side was baba gs kabul compound his company owned or more appropriately managed another in jalalabad which was where gallagher was normally based as in all the other compounds in afghanistan there were no windows facing the street the main entrance consisted of a pair of thick ninefoothigh steel doors painted green with a normalsized door cut into the steel to make it easier for people to come and go gallagher pulled a uturn brought his truck to a stop outside the gates and turned off the ignition welcome to the plaza he said as he opened his door and hopped out harvath picked up the cooler bag met him at the rear of the land cruiser and grabbed his suitcases gallagher walked up to the door and rang the buzzer moments later it was opened by gallaghers business partner tom hoyt hoyt was a chain smoker from miami who stood about fivefooteight and had a thick head of saltandpepper hair he was in his early fifties spoke fluent arabic and could have passed for the brother of movie actor robert mitchum as exus army intelligence hoyt was the logistical mind behind the company he and gallagher had named international security solutions or iss hey the circus must be in town said hoyt as he looked past gallagher and saw harvath standing in the street theres a seal outside neek hallack harvath replied in arabic suggesting his friend go perform an anatomically impossible act wow and hes got quite a mouth on him too once they were inside hoyt bolted the door and gave harvath a slap on the back its good to see you again have you gained weight you seals just go right to shit the minute the navy kicks you loose harvath smiled hoyt loved to play up interservice rivalries and so did gallagher both could be mercilessespecially when they were drinking harvath tapped hoyts burgeoning midsection and said married life seems to agree with you doesnt it tom threw his hand up in the air and almost lost his cigarette i bought her a color tv and a satellite dish but all she still wants is sex sex sex im a man not an animal for chrissake hoyt was referring to his younger and much more attractive wife mei she was a chinese national who had come to kabul to start a restaurant to serve its growing chinese population many of whom worked in the massage industry it had been love at first sight for hoyt and he had almost bankrupted himself eating every meal in meis restaurant she was twentyfive years his junior and made him feel like he was eighteen years old again in addition to being incredibly sexy she was smart as hellsmarter than hoyt which was something he hadnt come across that often in life more important she understood him and even appreciated his offcolor sense of humor within six months mei had sold her restaurant and had moved into the compound with hoyt she was in charge of daytoday operations and did all of the cookingbreakfast lunch and dinner harvath had visited the compound on two different trips to afghanistan and no matter where they went out to eat the food was never as good as meis speaking of which said harvath wheres your better half the dragon lady replied hoyt with his characteristic feigned disrespect for his wife shes off playing mahjong somewhere harvath shook his head what i dont know why you talk about her like that hoyt looked at gallagher and shrugged his shoulders she left an hour ago to play mahjong right thats what she said replied gallagher harvath was about to make a crack about hoyts marital skills when the compounds majordomo stepped out of the main building he was a chubby thirtyyearold afghan with slickedback hair and a pointy goatee he was the youngest of eight children and his parents had given him the urdu name for pine flower hoyt had found that hysterical and since the name was too hard to pronounce everyone just called him flower flower recognized harvath immediately and walked right over the two men gave each other the customary afghan greeting and embraced its good to see you flower said harvath how is your family flower smiled and replied good mr scot good i have two more boys now two how many does that make total four boys one girl beamed flower and his wifes pregnant again replied gallagher flower quipped hoyt maybe i should give your wife meis tv set harvath laughed thats great when is she due any time said flower as he pulled his cell phone from his pocket and held it up indicating he was on call congratulations flower bent and picked up harvaths bags ill take you to your room while mei managed the compound flower was in charge of the heavy lifting when the municipal power went out which happened daily all over afghanistan the call went out for flower to fire up the auxiliary generator if someone needed a ride they called flower if you needed anything from the marketflower and even though he couldnt shoot to save his life he knew how to point a sawedoff shotgun in the right direction and look imposing so gallagher and hoyt even took him on operations from time to time flower had a bedroom at the compound which not coincidentally was the closest to the gate so he was also the de facto porter harvath had no idea when the man ever had time to see his wife and children much less make more flower took his job very seriously and worked harder than most people harvath had met the singlestory compound was laid out in a rough u shape in the center was a long courtyard and next to it a small parking pad big enough to hold three vehicles if you parked them bumper to bumper right now it was empty except for isss sole armored vehiclea toyota pickup there were seven bedrooms each with a tiny bathroom and handheld shower every bedroom had its own entrance and one window that faced onto the courtyard there was a kitchen and a long communal room that functioned as the compounds bar dining room and entertainment center detached from the main building was a small structure that housed isss communications and strategic operations center on the roof were a series of satellite dishes and antennas flower walked harvath to his room set the bags inside and turned the heater on via a small remote very cold at night he offered there was a small wardrobe a desk and a single bed with one thin blanket on it harvath knew the weak wall heater and his current bedding werent going to cut it reaching into his pocket he withdrew a handful of afghanis and peeled off several large notes the store on the corner has those thick wool blankets hanging outside can you go down and buy me a couple please flower nodded anything else harvath rattled off a short list and once the man had gone he closed the door and unpacked his bags tearing up the lining in each suitcase he removed the stacks of currency and placed them in a small backpack along with his laptop he fished another red bull out of the cooler bag and then took it along with his pack down to hoyts room he knocked on the glass and when he heard toms grunt he opened the door and stepped inside the room reeked of cigarette smoke hoyt had one going in the ashtray at his desk next to his computer and another in his hand everything okay with your room he asked i upgraded you to the one with the biggest bathroom mirror we have i know how you seals are about looking at yourselves very funny replied harvath you know as a returning guest i would have appreciated an ocean view or at least the club floor pay off your bar bill and ill talk to my manager speaking of which said hoyt as he leaned over and flipped open the door of a small refrigerator next to his desk how about a beer harvath held up his hand maybe later greg and i have to meet an afghan contact of his for tea i dont want to smell like a brewery probably a good idea hoyt flipped the fridge shut i came to see you about a safety deposit box what do you need to store harvath held up his pack close the door said hoyt even though harvath disliked being trapped inside the room with all that smoke and no fresh air he did as he was told hoyt stood up placed his cigarette in his mouth and crossed to a small closet when he opened the door it was obvious that most of the clothing belonged to mei the lion the bitch and her wardrobe he muttered through the cigarette as he removed everything next he took down the rod and pulled out the shelves then he pried a panel off the back of the closet and revealed a cannonbrand gun safe that had been set into the concrete wall whered you get that harvath asked mei had it at the restaurant whered she get it ive got no idea knowing mei she probably stole it replied hoyt as he punched in his code harvath doubted that and was about to say as much when hoyt swung open the safes door inside was a rather thin weapons cache especially for men who were supposed to be in the private security business all harvath saw was a single ak a pistolgrip mossberg twelvegauge shotgun another glock and a few boxes of ammunition what happened to all of your gear asked harvath ever since one of the sons of afghanistans illustrious president got into the private security business owning weapons has become very expensive but you guys had a ton of stuff still do we just dont keep it here harvath looked at him why have they outlawed them all but said hoyt youre supposed to pay per man per gun and per contract that your company is working under its a big pain in the ass the afghan bureaucrats not only get rich off the bribes they still paperwork us to death i go through the trouble of keeping a few of our weps on the up and up but as far as the rest are concerned the afghans can go fuck themselves so as long as your papers and payments are up to date said harvath you can have whatever you want its complicated if you cross all your ts and if you dot all your is you can legally carry a pistol and a long gun that said contractors in kabul still get stopped on a regular basis and have their perfectly registered weapons confiscated the afghans do it to afghan contractors as well as expats its totally fucked up now if you get caught with a crewserve weapon like a pkm youre going straight to the big house same for grenades and rpgs plus p and hollow point ammo are also big nonos even so everybodys got that stuff especially if they plan on traveling outside kabul lets face it this isnt the caymans its afghanistan true basically the numberone rule greg and i have is to just keep everything below the window line and out of sight what a scam replied harvath tia said hoyt as he motioned for harvath to hand him his bag removing his laptop harvath handed hoyt the pack im going to need a receipt for that he joked you can talk to our accountant when she gets back from mahjong anything else you wouldnt happen to have a holster for the im carrying would you hoyt riffled through a few items stacked on one of the shelves in the safe and came up with a blackhawk check six concealable leather holster he tossed it to harvath closed the door and put the wardrobe back together harvath pulled the glock from his waistband and set it on the bed after he had slid the holster onto his belt he replaced his weapon and looked in the bathroom mirror to see if he was printing confident no one could see the weapon beneath his untucked shirt he turned back to hoyt i also need a secure link for email ive got one and gregs got one if that jarheads not watching war porn you can probably get online in his room thanks said harvath hoyt waved at him with his cigarette as he went back to whatever it was hed been doing on his computer gallaghers room was two doors down and the door was ajar harvath knocked but there was no answer pushing the door open he stepped inside scanning a room when he entered was second nature for harvath years of training had wired him to take a quick and detailed mental picture of what he saw for all intents and purposes gallaghers room looked like it belonged to a very neat very wellorganized person the bed was perfectly made papers were stacked neatly on his desk next to his computer the items on his shelves were in perfect order and precisely spaced harvath guessed that a drill instructor could have bounced a quarter off gallaghers bed taken a ruler to the spacing of the items on his shelves and run a white glove over the door frame and come away with nothing to fault the room reflected a pictureperfect marinea man who had his act entirely together thats what made the last thing harvath noticed that much more unsettling in gallaghers wastebasket were eleven empty beer bottles unless baba g had been hosting a party last night it looked like he might have been hitting the booze pretty good harvath hoped the man wasnt being haunted by any demons from his past with khan having been moved this assignment had already taken one bad turn it would probably take several more before it was over that was just the nature of this business but the last thing harvath needed to worry about was if greg gallagher was going to be able to perform at percent he was going to have to keep an eye on him one screwup and good people could be killed chapter alexandria virginia i really appreciate your seeing me so late elise campbell said as she stepped inside the small pitt street town house weve been on the road a couple of days and i had some paperwork to catch up on after my shift ended tonight dont worry about it replied carolyn leonard as she took campbells coat and hung it on a peg near the door i remember the hours how about some coffee do you have anything stronger i do said leonard with a smile come on in carolyn leonard was a fit and attractive woman ten years older than elise campbell she had red hair and a quiet yet powerful presence leonard was one of those people you might not notice the moment you walked into a room but once you did you couldnt help but be impressed by the confidence she exuded it was a trait that in her personal life seemed to intimidate most of the men she met the only ones able to get beyond who she was and what she had done for a living were other law enforcement officers the fact that she had been the head us secret service agent for the previous president of the united states simply freaked a lot of guys out were not going to wake the children up are we asked campbell as she took a seat on a stool in the kitchen theyre not here said leonard of her twins theyre visiting my mother campbell knew well enough not to inquire after leonards ex hed left her with two young kids and a mountain of credit card debt at the high point of her career she was the first woman to ever head a presidential protection detail and the insecure excuse for a man shed married had not only left her hed slashed and burned everything in his path on his way out of the relationship as devastating as the experience had been leonard had continued right until the day after the inauguration she was one of the high profile refuseniks who declined to remain with the secret service in the new administration and who had elected to leave rather than comply with what they felt were dangerous choices being made by the new president the defections created a lot of bad feelings in an organization that already had significant morale problems while many exceptional secret service agents still wholeheartedly believed in the mission there were those who were dead tired of the dearth of leadership and the crushing layers of exceedingly poor management the newly elected presidents desire to turn his protective detail into a s style benetton ad rather than promote hire and train on ability was the tipping point for agents like leonard despite the bad feelings swirling throughout the service agents who knew carolyn leonard still respected her those who remained behind were indeed sorry to see her go but few of them held her decision against her especially not elise campbell leonard knew better than anyone how hard it was to be a woman in the service she had taken campbell under her wing early on and had been her mentor as best she could being head of the presidents detail and a single mother of two little ones never seemed to leave enough time leonard had always felt that she hadnt done enough for campbell campbell on the other hand had soaked up every piece of advice and had hung on every word of carolyns as if she had been sitting at the feet of a master which in a way she had leonard was a legend in the service and campbell felt honored by their time together no matter how limited it was is chardonnay okay asked carolyn as she pulled a bottle of toasted head from the refrigerator thats great replied campbell carolyn set the bottle down along with two glasses and fished her wine key out of her junk drawer when the bottle was open she poured a glass for each of them and then sat down on one of the stools cheers campbell raised her glass and they toasted carolyn studied the younger agents face she hadnt changed much in the years since she had left the virginia beach police department to join the secret service she still looked young and was still very pretty while times had changed since carolyn had joined the service she knew it hadnt changed that much and that it was still difficult for women especially attractive ones like elise the long hours the days and weeks away from family the lonely hotel roomsit all came together to create some less than professional situations if people werent vigilant carolyn took a sip of wine and then set the glass down raising her eyebrows she asked so what did you need to talk about elise took a drink before responding the president call it intuition but carolyn instantly had a bad feeling about where this might be going fairly or unfairly president robert alden had a reputation as being a bit of a womanizerthis despite the fact that his wife terry was a very goodlooking woman many said the rumors about alden were untrue and were due only to his good looks and the fact that so many women found him so desirable in carolyns experience though where there was smoke there was usually fire and the idea of the president coming on to one of the agents sworn to protect him though incredibly unprofessional was not beyond the realm of possibility what about him replied leonard campbell took another sip from her glass and stared past her mentor to the calendar on the womans refrigerator when you were on presidential detail did you ever hear anything you werent supposed to hear carolyn studied her young protégée all the time but its your job to ignore it and forget it what if i cant then you need to find another job cmon carolyn stated campbell as she turned her eyes to her you know some things arent that easy nothing about the secret service is easy replied leonard especially protecting the president if you want easy become a politician other than that either you can do your job as an agent or you cant theres no gray pausing carolyn then added did the president say or do something to you that made you uncomfortable no absolutely not did he say something to someone else about you or what he wanted to do to you carolyn my god no is that why you think im here you think im upset because the president came on to me he wouldnt be the first well nothing happened campbell replied flatly so then what are we talking about campbell eyed the bottle of wine and before she could ask leonard topped off her glass elise held the stem near the base and slowly moved it in a circle what do you know about nikki hale aldens campaign staffer the one who died campbell nodded and took another sip of wine not much more than what i heard from the agents working aldens detail during the campaign she was young twentyfive or twentysix i believe she was also very pretty if i remember correctly she had something to do with the campaign website director of new media or something like that a lot of people on the campaign didnt like her they thought she was a little too young and a little too inexperienced for such an important position she rode the campaign bus and was on the plane everywhere alden went everyone wanted to have that kind of access and i guess a lot of folks were jealous of her do you remember how she died carolyn thought about it for a minute it was the end of last summer just before the general elections i think headon collision in the hamptons right campbell nodded fourth of july weekend alden had been out there for a big fundraiser from what i heard nikki hale was quite the partier and that night was no exception her blood alcohol level was double the legal limit she crossed into oncoming traffic and killed herself along with a family of four in the opposite lane i think president alden had something to do with it carolyn looked at her you what i overheard him talking with stephanie gallo elise your job is not to listen in on the presidents private conversations besides do you think the man would be so dumb as to admit to something like that in front of one of his secret service agents i was in the woods on gallos estate i dont think either of them knew i was even there as far as i could tell they thought they were completely alone wait a second why come to me with this asked carolyn because i dont know what to do i need advice leonard set her wineglass down on the counter you want my advice forget the entire thing you heard a snippet of a conversation and have taken it out of context your job is to protect the president period you start getting distracted trying to make sense of what youre hearing and youll not only get the president killed youll get yourself killed as well but what if he was involved in nikki hales death somehow if you think he might have been involved tell your supervisor at the service what if im wrong asked campbell then you wont have to worry about overhearing any more of the presidents private conversations because youll be bounced so hard youll need the space shuttle to deliver your final paycheck campbell was silent for a moment what if i told you gallo knows all about it and shes blackmailing the president id say thats his problem elise shook her head youve made no secret about not being a fan of president aldens well thats the beauty of being a private citizen answered leonard i can do that because i no longer work for the secret service well i believe in him i voted for him youre behind the curtain now elise be prepared to be disillusioned there arent many honest men or women in washington anymore politicians get where they are by the sheer force of their egos not their convictions and you know what its our fault as voters we dont demand better candidates so we end up getting what we deserveon both sides of the aisle i agree with you the majority of them are crooked and we should consider them all guilty until proven innocent said campbell but i thought alden was different i still do leonard poured a little more wine into her glass for the sake of argument lets say youre right about what you overheard how can someone blackmail an honest man campbell didnt have a response what exactly asked leonard did stephanie gallo say to the president she said that if he didnt give her what she wanted she was going to expose his involvement in the deaths of four innocent people and his would be one of the shortest administrations in us history how do you know this had to do with nikki hales death because after that threat answered campbell they walked off arguing about the night she died did you hear anything more specific asked carolyn not really not from where i was standing what possible role could the president have had in hales death did he get her loaded and hand her a set of car keys i wasnt there i dont know but gallo was very insistent about his complicity and the president was very bothered by the whole thing so what was it gallo was pressing him for said leonard switching to a more jovial tone has she changed her mind about wanting a cabinet position elise didnt think now was an appropriate time to be making jokes no she replied harshly actually her daughter was just kidnapped in afghanistan and she wants the presidents help im sorry replied leonard i wasnt aware of that elise brushed it off its okay no one knows theyre keeping it very quiet gallos daughter is a doctor who was working for some ngo over there apparently the kidnappers want to trade her for some highranking alqaeda operative that the afghans are holding for trial and alden is going to arrange the trade not exactly said campbell what do you mean not exactly he doesnt think its right to force the afghans to give the aq operative up hes a terrorist who has been involved with the killing of multiple afghan government officials president alden supports the afghans in establishing the rule of law and thinks they should prosecute the guy in full and stephanie gallo isnt pleased with that position is she youve got two children replied campbell how would you feel if one of them was being held hostage and the person youd helped get elected to the most powerful office in the world wouldnt get your child back for you id be angry very angry as is she apparently hence the blackmail stated carolyn campbell nodded kidnapping a united states citizen is serious business for all intents and purposes we own afghanistan ive got to imagine that were throwing everything we have at this theres no way were leaving any rocks unturned over there short of forcing the afghans to give us the alqaeda operative to trade out for mrs gallos daughter i dont know what more the president could do which makes me think either hes prepared to call her bluff or theres actually nothing there for him to be blackmailed over theres something else stated campbell carolyn raised her eyebrows again and waited the trip we just wrapped up was official businessall except for one leg what was the leg asked carolyn we flew to maine so the president could see stephanie gallo leonard pursed her lips and exhaled she had heard that the first lady was no fan of stephanie gallos terry aldens contempt for the woman was thinly veiled at best it made no difference how much gallo had aided her husbands campaign the first lady didnt see gallo as an ally she saw her as a rival for her husbands time interest and affection in fact it had been widely rumored that it was because of mrs aldens strong protestations that stephanie gallo did not stay on past the transition period and move into a permanent position within robert aldens administration considering the kidnapping though the trip should not have automatically been suspect they met at an estate in seal harbor owned by some television personality mrs gallo knows continued campbell im not surprised hes a handson guy her daughter was kidnapped and hes keeping her in the loop at this point nothing would surprise me about his meeting with her im not saying the meeting was remarkable but you might think who they met with was are you familiar with a former secret service agent named scot harvath harvath leonard said somewhat surprised what was he doing there on second thought dont tell me i probably dont want to know are you sure it was him i asked one of the agents who cleared him they confirmed it and told me a little about who he was so youre familiar with him very but harvath doesnt work for the government anymore whatever he was doing for the previous administration was shut down he left for the private sector in fact when i announced that i was leaving the secret service he emailed me and put me in touch with the group hes supposed to start working with well as of that meeting in maine hes now working for president alden or more specifically stephanie gallo as shes apparently the one who is paying him probably a smart move harvath is an exceptional operator he was a seal before joining the secret service and coming to the white house hes a good person to have consulting on this based on what i heard i think hes doing a lot more than consulting replied elise i think the president brought him in to snatch that alqaeda operative from prison in kabul and trade him for gallos daughter are you serious campbell nodded which now brings us back to the president and the night nikki hale died chapter afghanistan julia gallo knew the pashtu word for whore shed heard it muttered behind her back and under peoples breath in countless villages throughout afghanistan this time though it was different the four boys standing above her in her small mud cell were repeating it in an effort to build up their courage for what she had no idea but she knew that it wouldnt be good she was being held by the taliban that much she had ascertained and taliban children were raised on extremist videos they were subjected from ages as young as three years old to videos of suicide bombings beheadings torture and rape it was a diet of unadulterated horror that served to desensitize them to violence and inoculate them against having any pity whatsoever for their enemies gallo had no illusions about how they viewed her she was their enemy in less than a week of captivity she had become an emotional and physical wreck they kept her in a room twelve feet long by eight feet wide the room had one window which had been nailed shut and covered over on the outside by a piece of canvas her only connection with the world outside was a small ventilation hole the circumference of a coke can cut into the bottom of one of the walls near the floor through it she could make out a small tree of some sort in the foreground and a narrow mountain valley beyond lying on her stomach studying the tree and the small sliver of valley was the only thing that kept her from losing her mind using the tree she marked the passage of the hours based on the shadows cast by its slim trunk and twiglike branches she counted its buds and wondered if she would still be here still be alive when the tree bloomed she marveled at how despite being a doctor and understanding the science of life she had never really stopped to appreciate it there was a bitter irony in coming to finally value and understand it only to be on the verge of losing it gallo subsisted on the meager amount of food she was given once a dayshort ropy pieces of beef scraps of nan bread or almonds washed down with lukewarm tea for her bodily functions there was a hole in the floor on the opposite side of the room a narrow wooden bed with a thin blanket was the only furniture she enjoyed and at night the temperatures fell so low gallo wondered if she was more likely to die from hypothermia than at the hands of the taliban she knew why she had been taken sayed had been right the taliban were going to make an example of her she had pushed her luck too far and it had finally run out the taliban had interrogated her mercilessly upon her arrival they had called her a spy and had threatened to execute her why they had not yet done so was a mystery but she had read enough accounts of kidnappings in afghanistan to know that it could take time before they finally dealt with her that was the way things worked here they could be incredibly cruel like cats that had caught a mouse they delighted in seeing their captives suffer julia had been required to take a security preparedness class in the united states before leaving for cares mission in afghanistan she learned about what to do and what not to do and that kidnappers could keep better control of you if they kept you frightened and off balance she tried not only to remember the training she had received about how to handle being a kidnap victim but also why she had come to this country in the first place julia had come to afghanistan because she wanted to help its people she now realized that she had also come in search of adventure even danger the longer she had been incountry the bolder she had become and in becoming bolder she had taken up an extremely provocative cause though she deeply believed in what she was encouraging afghan women to do she now had time to truly examine her motives would she have been as passionate if her trips into the countryside didnt serve to heighten her sense of danger looking death in the eye she could no longer delude herself she had been addicted to the danger she justified the risk by focusing on the people she claimed to be helping she reveled in the awe her peers back in kabul showered upon her for traveling so far outside the relative safety of an already unsafe city she was a smart woman and should have known much better life in afghanistan was an extremely dangerous gamble she hadnt needed to go looking for trouble working at the care hospital in kabul was dangerous enough afghanistan wasnt some drivethrough safari park where as long as you kept the windows rolled up and the doors locked youd come out unscathed she had pushed her luck farther than she should have and the crushing isolation she had since been subjected to and the promise of a very unpleasant fate only drove the point home but of course now sayed was dead and it was too late julia wondered if her mother knew what had happened certainly the care international doctors were aware that she and sayed had gone out and had not returned the question though was whether they even knew where to begin searching for her by gallos calculations they were at least three maybe four hours away from where she and sayed had been ambushed a bag had been placed over her head and her watch had been taken away so she had no idea how long they had traveled before reaching wherever they now were the door to her cell had been repeatedly kicked open both day and night she never knew when anyone was going to materialize in its frame and she tried to keep her headscarf wrapped around her head at all times when the men did enter she kept her eyes cast down toward the floor her heart palpitated and she had trouble taking deep breaths it was like living through one prolonged panic attack intermingled with the feelings of terror and loneliness were the sorrow and guilt over sayeds murder while she tried to push the image of him from her mind it always found a way back in they had killed him in cold blood and she knew they were capable of that and worse toward her the chanting of the young boys increased in intensity gallo steeled herself for what was going to happen being in captivity she had not taken her birth control pills recently and then almost laughed out loud at herself for the concern getting pregnant was the least of her problems at this moment she looked at the young boys and recalled the high level of homosexual activity among the taliban there was an old fable that said that birds flew over taliban territory with only one wing because they needed the other to guard their rectums one of the boys reached his hand out to touch her breast reflexively gallo slapped it away the other boys laughed and the first boys face flushed red julia couldnt be sure whether it was embarrassment or anger the boy who couldnt be more than sixteen drew his hand back and struck her hard across the mouth julia tasted blood the other boys laughed and the chanting began again in earnest when the boy reached out to touch her breast again julia didnt stop him when he made contact his hand crushed down like a vise julia winced and bit down on her lip to keep from crying out his grasp was amazingly strong she almost felt that she deserved thisthat this was the price she must pay for having gotten sayed killed as the boys other hand clamped down on her opposite breast julia willed her mind to leave her body she wanted to travel as far away as possible she had made it to a small village in the south of france where she had vacationed after graduating medical school when the sound of the door being kicked open pulled her back to her tiny cell standing in the doorway was the mentally challenged man who had been feeding her in his hands he held the cardboard box he always carried slung over his shoulder was a rifle its barrel covered with tape on his feet was a pair of new basketball shoes upon seeing the boys in the room the man set down his box and unslung his rifle he pointed it at the boys but it had no effect they werent scared the man repeated a pashtu phrase julia was familiar with lar sha lar sha go away the boy gripping julias breasts called the man over to the bed he approached slowly and looked confused the boy let go of one of julias breasts and motioned for the man to put his hand in its place the man shuffled forward and julia resigned herself to the fact that what was about to happen might turn out to be worse than she had imagined fighting back the nausea rising in her throat she prepared her mind to return to the south of france the man studied the situation as the boy and the others behind him egged him on the chant of whore whore whore in pashtu was taken up again and he looked at julia with an emotion she couldnt quite decipher then he lowered his rifle and she closed her eyes for what would happen next but it didnt happen with amazing force the man snapped his rifle straight up there was a crack as the butt of the weapon connected with the boys jaw spinning the man raised the weapon as high as he could and began beating the other boys they shouted curses at him and he shouted right back but none of them raised a hand to strike him he hit them repeatedly against their backs and shoulders as they dragged their dazed friend from the room and ran once they had gone the man slung his rifle reached down and helped julia up he was incredibly strong for his small size he helped her to the bed and took her chin in one of his rough hands he turned her face from side to side examining her split lip and then let her go returning to his cardboard box he unpacked her paltry meal and muttered to himself repeatedly the pashtu word for bad julia had never spoken to the man each time he had entered to bring her food she had kept her eyes cast toward the floor she had remained quiet her goal to appear meek and unthreatening the last thing she wanted was to draw the ire of her kidnappers but now that the local boys had made their intentions clear she needed to make sure she was protected from them while far from the stereotypical knight in shining armor the mentally challenged man had come to her rescue once would he do so again the man appeared to take his job very seriouslyunceremoniously kicking her door in at all hours in some form of surprise inspection she had no idea if the kicking was necessitated by a sticking door or if it was designed to keep her on edge if it was the latter it was working every time the door crashed open julias heart raced into the red zone she never had any idea who was on the other side or what their intentions were were they coming to kill her beat her rape her the not knowing had frayed the nerves of the normally cool and collected doctor right to their bitter ends stan a shukria she said thank you the man in the basketball shoes acted as if he didnt hear her sta noom tse dai she asked whats your name my name is julia she said im a doctor doctors were revered in afghanistan and she hoped that if her kidnappers could see her as someone who could provide value to them they might think twice about killing her though her pashtu was limited it was passable but despite her attempt to communicate the man continued to mutter to himself after laying everything out he gathered up his box tucked it under his arm and headed for the door stan a shukria julia repeated as he reached the door the man stopped he then spun so quickly that he startled julia and she shrank into the corner he stepped quickly almost violently across the room and shoved his hand into his pocket when he pulled it out he held two afghan sweets known as dashlama in his upturned palm suddenly very timid like a little boy feeding an animal at a petting zoo he offered them to julia slowly she crept forward and reached her hand out to take the sweets the man watched and then motioned with his fingers to place them in her mouth julia placed one of the candies on her tongue the man smiled but as soon as the smile appeared it was replaced by a frown he returned to muttering the pashtu word for bad and left the room slamming the door on the way out chapter kabul baba gs afghan national police contact inspector ahmad rashid had picked a small restaurant in an obscure part of the city that rarely if ever saw any white people based on how violent things had become in kabul gallagher advised that they go native they wore the salwar kameezthe baggy cotton trousers and loosefitting tunicsas well as the pakol hats upon their heads and patoo blankets over their shoulders to combat the intense cold that would build in the late afternoon as soon as the sun started to dip behind the mountains after changing into his afghan clothes harvath stopped in hoyts room to access his safety deposit box and then stepped out into the courtyard gallagher looked him up and down and reminded him to leave his sunglasses behind few things in afghanistan screamed im a westerner shoot me louder than a pair of shades and that went double if they were oakleys thanks greg said harvath but this isnt my first rodeo gallagher laughed im so used to carting civilians around that it just becomes second nature to tick off all the boxes let me see your walk my afghan walk baba g nodded then what a bathing suit contest and the talent portion of the show remarked harvath ive got it dont worry about it gallagher wasnt giving in were not driving into downtown detroit buddy tia remember harvath shook his head he was as detailminded as the next guy but gallagher took things to a whole new level he had learned long ago not to argue with him theyd get on the road a lot faster if he simply gave the man what he wanted harvath tucked his hands behind his back beneath the patoo leaned forward and began the slow shambling afghan walk at the edge of the small courtyard he turned and came back are we good ill make sure to park as close to the restaurant as possible he replied up yours said harvath once they were in the land cruiser and baba g had it started harvath cracked another can of red bull and cranked the heater up as far as it would go his jet lag had made him extra susceptible to the cold you can monkey with that all you want admonished gallagher it wont do any good until the engine heats up really harvath replied as he took another sip of red bull baba g was about to explain when he realized that harvath was being facetious for a moment he had forgotten who he was with harvath had used humor to deal with good situations and bad for as long as he had known him he decided to change the subject hows tracy doing harvath had been so exhausted he honestly hadnt thought much about her since hed landed in kabul hed learned a long time ago that one of the keys to being successful and staying alive in his line of work was the ability to compartmentalize if you couldnt put the rest of your life in a box and keep a lid on it while you were in the field this wasnt the career for you gallagher was an old friend though and the question wasnt out of bounds still the relationship with tracy was complicated shes good he replied are her headaches any better this was where things got complicated tracy had been shot almost two years ago by someone with a very serious vendetta against harvath she had survived and recovered but not percent the doctors had advised her to avoid stress as much as possible there had been little to no stress in maine in fact they had joked that it had been like spending the winter inside a snow globe but the net effect on tracys headaches had been negligible she still got them and when she did she had to pop some pretty strong medication to beat them back tracy was tough and she refused to give up she also however refused to move forward an exnavy explosive ordnance disposal technician she had seen danger up close and had even had an ied she was defusing detonate prematurely and take one of her eyes the doctors had matched it perfectly and you had to look very closely to notice any of the scarring her face had suffered lesser people would have given up but not tracy and scot admired the hell out of her for that where she refused to move forward was in their relationship harvath wanted to get married and tracy didnt she knew how badly scot wanted children and she just didnt think she could handle the headaches and kids they were engaged in a quiet stalemate and had been most of the winter on the job front harvath couldnt have hoped for a person more understanding or supportive of his career tracy was content keeping the home fires burning for as long as his assignments took him wherever they took him she appreciated both the danger and the fact that this work was what he was born to do she would never make him decide between being with her or pursuing his career tracy allowed him both what she asked in return was to accept their relationship as it was and to not ask her to make any changes it sounded reasonable but the longer he and tracy were together the more he realized what a great mother she would beeven with the headaches harvath wanted kids and he wanted to have them with her he still held out hope as dim as he knew it was that tracy might change her mind and come around the headaches are still the same said harvath regularly irregular and when they come theyre pretty tough have you guys seen any specialists tons replied harvath as he took another sip of red bull that sucks said gallagher harvath attempted to change the subject how long have you known this police inspector were going to see ahmad asked gallagher as he did the math in his head about three years now and you trust him baba g laughed if i didnt we wouldnt be going to kabuls version of south central la for this meeting dont worry hes good people dont worry it was a funny piece of advice coming from the man who had insisted upon seeing harvaths afghan walk normally we just meet to gossip sometimes we trade pieces of intelligence this is the first time im going to offer him money for something harvath looked at him any reason to believe that might change things between you if anything itll probably make me more valuable to him and technically im not giving him any money you are ahmad and i are just facilitators or fixers as they say im hooking you up with him and then hopefully hell hook you up with some information hopefully repeated harvath dont worry gallagher said yet again as they drove toward their rendezvous the streets were as crowded as they had been before men rode three and sometimes even four to a motorbike yellow and white taxis were everywhere as were donkey carts and bicycles cars were parked halfway on sidewalks and men stood in the road every fifteen feet selling prepaid phone cards baba g had the land cruisers radio tuned to an afghan station with music that sounded like a bollywood sound track they passed the normally anemic kabul river which was swollen with spring runoff and had to stop for two men who were driving a flock of dirty sheep out of a muddy alley and across the road all the while harvath kept his eyes alert for trouble his local garb might help in not drawing attention to himself but he had no doubt that he still looked every bit the american and that he was one big target he pressed the glock hidden beneath his tunic for reassurance and when he looked over at baba g he saw that he was not only watching the traffic but scanning the sidewalks and parked cars for danger as well kabul was like a wild west town surrounded by indian country there wasnt one single place where you could let your guard down when they reached the restaurant there werent any parking spaces available in front and baba g had to park about a block down dont leave any valuables in the car he cautioned harvath tapped his side and replied dont worry the restaurant was housed in a twostory concrete structure with a dark green corrugated metal awning hanging over the sidewalk on the ground floor was a small shop selling household odds and ends like the one harvath had sent flower to for extra blankets next to the shop was a door that opened onto a staircase leading to the buildings second floor harvath tried to make out the writing on the door as they approached private club offered gallagher pashtuns only seriously asked harvath not really but the sign is written only in pashtu not dari so the message is pretty clear if youre not pashtun find someplace else to eat harvath was well aware of how the hierarchies operated here afghan identity followed a clear trajectory of loyalty family came first then clan village tribe and finally at the bottom of the list was national identity as a citizen of afghanistan afghan tribalism was pervasive throughout the country and was a big reason why it was so fractured pashtuns who accounted for roughly percent of the population hated the tajiks and tajiks who made up percent of the population hated the pashtuns together the pashtuns and tajiks both hated the percent minority hazaras and the tribalism continued right down the ladder to include the lowly uzbeks turkmen baluchi nuristanis and all the other minority groups the only time the tribes worked together was when they united to repel an outside invader after the invader was sent packing the tribes went back to waging war against each other in essence afghanistan was both its own best ally and its own worst enemy if you wanted to develop contacts with the most powerful people in the afghan government the pashtuns were the ones to be in bed with from the president of afghanistan on down the pashtuns occupied the most important posts though the government was working hard to desegregate its infrastructure it still had a long way to go and baba g had been wise to align himself with a highly placed pashtun police inspector harvath just hoped the man would have the information they needed chapter gallagher and harvath climbed the dank stairs to the restaurant and were shown to a private room near the back its floor was covered with a variety of faded afghan carpets and several brightly colored cushions a pair of mismatched curtains had been drawn across the windows sitting in the corner near a small propane heater was ahmad rashid a round man in his late forties he rose to greet his guests after rashid and gallagher had touched hearts and completed their embrace baba g introduced harvath im pleased to make your acquaintance said rashid as they shook hands his english was excellent as harvath and gallagher had walked from the truck to the restaurant baba g had explained that rashid had been a university student before two of his brothers had been killed by the taliban after aiding his family in hunting down those responsible rashid had become a police officer he had a very sharp mind coupled with a keen eye for opportunity and had risen quickly through the ranks of the anp the man was adept at trading favors and gallagher claimed that while rashid never technically broke the law he often bent it in exceptionally creative ways the inspector was in plain clothes wearing a gray sweater over a blue tunic and a vest popular with afghans that resembled the vests photographers or people on safari often wore harvath didnt know if the man was on duty or not but considering that cops were prime taliban and alqaeda targets going plainclothes was probably a very good idea beneath his traditional pakol rashids hair poked out over his forehead in loose black curls the sides like his jetblack beard were neatly trimmed he motioned for harvath and gallagher to join him and they each picked a cushion and sat down rashid articulated instructions to the waiter and once he was gone he and gallagher engaged in the customary afghan preamble regarding each others health families and various local goingson when the waiter returned he rolled a green plastic mat out along the floor and upon it set glasses a pot of tea and dishes filled with several things to eat the police inspector poured the steaming hot green tea known as chai sabz for each of them it had been seasoned with cardamom and the scent quickly filled the air despite the heater and having three bodies in the small room it was still so cold you could almost see your breath rashid explained to harvath what all the dishes were and encouraged him to help himself harvath hadnt eaten since his arrival and hadnt realized how hungry he had been he tore off a large piece of freshly baked afghan bread known as nan and then served himself some rice he added a few chunks of cooked lamb and then covered everything with yogurt sauce in order to protect his stomach he avoided the salad and took a serving of fried vegetables known as borani harvath had always enjoyed the cuisine in afghanistan and laughed at westerners who arrived expecting to lose weight only to return home having added several pounds there was a dish of sugar cubes on the mat and rashid who like most afghans had a sweet tooth picked up three and dropped them into his short glass of tea soon he and gallagher began talking shop the city is surrounded by the taliban said rashid all four highways even the road to the shomali plains are now under their control i heard fuel truck drivers are being offered ten thousand dollars to make the run down to kandahar replied gallagher the inspector nodded and dropped another sugar cube into his tea its an percent increase over what afghans are paid for carrying anything else the only problem is that the taliban forbade transporting fuel to foreign troops gallagher looked at harvath and said a contractor asked one of flowers brothers if he wanted to make the run and the man wisely declined but another man from their village agreed the taliban stopped him on the road and chopped his head off harvath grimaced in disgust commercial aircraft can no longer refuel at the airport in kandahar and most military bases are being forced to ration even the americans said rashid the greater problem though is that the taliban once again control most of afghanistan as they did in their rise to power in the s theyre promoting themselves as the best and most reliable force for stability throughout the country which is only bolstered by the fact that the afghan government cannot project any power outside of kabul added gallagher rashid looked at harvath your country has invested significantly in us but unfortunately the us does not have much to show for it im afraid we are all losing ground harvath didnt disagree the situation in afghanistan was deteriorating daily the mujahideen had defeated the soviets and while harvath still held out hope he had to admit that if the united states did not drastically change its strategy there was a very good chance that the taliban along with alqaeda were going to be the winners an outcome like that would be devastating not only for afghanistan but for america and the rest of the world it was an all too real possibility that harvath didnt like thinking about he nodded as rashid continued i know many afghans who will not go back to life under the taliban again these people are beginning to plan their exit strategies the united states will turn things around stated harvath the inspector smiled thats exactly what the soviets said before they pulled their troops out well see said harvath the afghan people deserve better than the taliban they deserve a government that can protect them and provide an environment that will allow them to succeed rashid raised his glass i agree gallagher and harvath raised their glasses and they all took a sip when they had been lowered gallagher quietly got to the heart of the meeting does the amniyat have anything new on the american doctors kidnapping amniyat was a local term for the national directorate of security afghanistans domestic intelligence agency also known as the nds no nothing they questioned the people of the last village she and her interpreter had been in and no one knows anything as you know her organizations vehicle and the body of the interpreter were found a couple of kilometers away and village elders within thirty kilometers have all been questioned but still nothing said rashid who then turned to harvath i understand that is why you are here harvath nodded ahmad gallagher replied my friend represents dr gallos family as i explained to you he is a man of much experience and is highly regarded by the government of the united states he has a deeply ingrained dislike for both the taliban and alqaeda as well as much experience dealing with them i am hoping you will be able to help him by finding mustafa khan correct asked rashid gallagher nodded my government will not be very happy if khan does not stand trial for his crimes and you asked harvath how would you feel about it as a police officer i would be professionally disappointed of course but as a pashtun i know that justice will eventually be served several of khans victims have been pashtun their families know who he is and he wont be able to hide forever now whether tribal justice should trump the national rule of law in afghanistan is another debate entirely the rule of law notwithstanding can we assume you may be willing to help asked harvath rashid smiled have you ever heard of the red mullah mr harvath harvath shook his head mullah sorkh naqaib or as he is more commonly known the red mullah continued the inspector is a highranking taliban commander from helmand province who specializes in attacks on british troops over the last three years he has been arrested and released three times each time he purchased his release through bribery the last time was just this past summer when he was being held in nds custody at policharki prison he had a visitor smuggle in fifteen thousand dollars and a half hour later he was free an investigation wasnt begun until naqaib bragged to the british press about how easy it is to get out of jail in afghanistan so what you are saying stated harvath is that with money all things are possible rashid clicked his tongue against the roof of his mouth no what i am saying is that the afghan government is tired of being embarrassed these are not stupid men who run our country many of them are corrupt but they realize that they must at least appear to be trying to do their jobs if afghanistan hopes to enjoy continued international support these men fatten their bank accounts from the aid money that flows into the country and rivers run downhill not up meaning meaning prison guards are not sending a portion of the bribes they receive back to kabul the men in power dont profit when prisoners escape in fact it jeopardizes their positions so they have taken measures to crack down on it this is why mustafa khan was moved do you know where he was moved to rashid nodded but remained silent gallagher looked at harvath and gave an almost imperceptible nod harvath slid his hand beneath his patoo and discreetly withdrew an envelope filled with cash he was well aware that no senior afghan liked to be passed money directly so he tucked the envelope beneath one of the cushions between him and rashid dr gallos family and i appreciate any support you can give us harvath said as he reached for his tea and took another sip the inspector scooped up some rice with his nan and looked at it as he chose his next words there are many men like me who still believe in afghanistans future but only a foolish man would ignore the possibility that our future may not be that bright the taliban might return to power and we have our families to think of as you may know mine is not very popular with the taliban there is much bad blood between us once harvath had been put in a position of having to choose between protecting his family or his country it was a decision he never should have been asked to make but he hadnt hesitated he had chosen his family in that respect part of him understood where ahmad rashid was coming from there was also part of him that didnt the man was apparently willing to undermine his own government in order to finance his personal escape plan maybe if harvath had experienced everything rashid had experienced over the last thirtysomeodd years he would see things differently he honestly couldnt say nevertheless he replied i understand looking at baba g rashid asked do you know the abandoned soviet military base on the darulaman road gallagher nodded beneath the barracks there is an old detention facility after the current government was installed our president reopened the facility its his own private prison thats where theyve moved mustafa khan youre absolutely sure the inspector nodded whats the security like asked gallagher afghan special forces all handpicked by the defense minister all pashtuns loyal to the president how many asked harvath i dont know but i may be able to find out said rashid harvaths mind moved in multiple directions as he made a list of the specific intelligence theyd need to mount their operation well also need schematics drawings im not sure if any professional drawings exist id prefer professional drawings but ill settle for unprofessional as long as theyre accurate the soviet base is directly across the darulaman road from the care hospital said gallagher correct replied rashid it took harvath a second to realize the irony isnt that where julia gallos ngo care international is based yes they had been keeping their voices low but gallagher lowered his even more as he said this might work to our advantage how asked harvath way before care international came along it was a soviet hospital in fact the soviets built it so so the soviets did a lot of construction in that area including the building of their embassy many of the structures are rumored to be connected to the base by underground tunnels the hospital was one of the closest buildings to the base if they were going to build an escape tunnel that would have been one of the easiest places to do it harvath turned to rashid do you know anything about these tunnels ive heard about them yes he replied but have you ever seen them yourself no but i may know someone who has if theres a tunnel between the hospital and the base hell know about it how soon can you get hold of him asked harvath the inspector looked at his watch i will call you in two hours harvath wrote down the number for the prepaid mobile phone flower had purchased for him and then made a list of gear he would need rashid to procure can you get these things for me as the inspector read the items on the list he raised his eyebrows this is quite an unusual list this is going to be quite an unusual job can you get them ill make some calls okay said harvath anxious to get back to baba gs and make some calls of his own well talk again in two hours inspector rashid stood and offered harvath his hand if you need anything else in the meantime mr gallagher knows how to get hold of me as harvath and baba g turned to leave the police officer added please be careful kabul is a very dangerous place chapter there was gunfire on the way back to the iss compound but it wasnt directed at baba gs land cruiser it was smallarms fire referred to in military parlance as saf and as best they could tell it had come from a block or two away too close for comfort and even more unsettling when gallagher explained that saf rpg and suicide bombing attacks were on the upswing in the afghan capital back at the compound harvath grabbed a bottle of water from the kitchen and then commandeered baba gs room so that he could send secure emails and make a few phone calls as he waited for his laptop to power up he noticed that gallaghers trash can had been emptied and that the bottles from the night before had been removed while his browser connected with the internet harvath took a long slug of water glanced at his watch and did the math it was nearing pm in kabul which meant it was almost am back in dc he forced the jet lag from his mind and focused on the work he needed to get done pulling out his encrypted blackberry he texted a colleague based in dc with the message need help can u talk three minutes later he received a response lifedeath in a meeting harvath shook his head cia was obsessed with meetings if their management showed even half as much interest in supporting the excellent people it had in the field and greenlighting operations to nail bad guys america would be a much safer place harvath texted back a oneword responseyes he was fairly certain the free world would continue to survive if his contact stepped out of a meeting for a few minutes less than sixty seconds later his blackberry rang activating the call harvath raised the phone to his ear and said nineoneone whats your emergency i think the cia is trying to kill me replied a voice from northern virginia harvath laughed death by powerpoint worse said the voice mandatory sensitivity training theyre killing us with kindness only cia thought harvath would waste time and money putting its paramilitary operatives through sensitivity training if it wasnt so sad it might actually have been funny my tax dollars at work look at it this way the voice stated when i eventually kill bin laden ill be able to do it while embracing all of the differences between our cultures that make us both unique and special not if i get to him first this time it was aydin ozbeks turn to laugh harvaths cia contact was a part of the agencys special activities division which was responsible for counterterrorism activities he and harvath had gotten to know each other the previous summer when cases they were working on intersected harvath had a lot of respect for ozbek who refused to let the cia tie him up in bureaucratic knots if management wouldnt cooperate the man wasnt afraid to do what needed to be done even if it meant coloring outside the lines ozbek represented not only what was right about cia but what direction it needed to take to go from being a cold war era relic that many referred to as the failure factory to a modern terrorismfighting machine it went without saying that ozbeks style didnt exactly endear him to his superiors the only reason he still had a job at the cia after breaking multiple laws in pursuit of a nest of islamic radicals operating on american soil last summer was that harvath had asked the president to intervene on his behalf now that the cia had a bean counter with no intelligence experience in charge and a president in the oval office who knew even less about the intel community ozbek needed to tread carefully harvath and ozbek were similar in many ways in particular the love they held for their country and the animosity they possessed toward its enemies especially islamic fundamentalists even if harvath hadnt saved ozbeks job the two would have been good friends the jobsaving part of the relationship did however mean that harvath had a lot of bonus points on his side of the board theres a bit of a delay on the line said ozbek where are you kabul replied harvath howd you get out of your sensitivity training so fast i told my supervisor you were a north korean arms source i was developing and that i needed to take your call you should have seen the look on the guys face knowing you his bs detector was probably pegging into the red on the contrary said ozbek i could hear the gears grinding away in his mind as he tried to figure out how to work it into his next report and take credit for it so what are you doing in kabul or shouldnt i ask im looking for something something or someone both said harvath but i need the something before i can get my hands on the someone ozbek understood harvaths need to watch what he said over the phone and didnt press him any further how can i help how deep is the talent on your afghan desk pretty deep any people there from the soviet days asked harvath ozbek thought about it a moment i think theyve hired one or two of the retired guys back as private contractors can you get to a computer in the next few minutes im going to miss out on the trust fall but if i have to i have to ill drop something in the box said harvath roger that how soon to do you need a reply asap all right said ozbek im on it harvath thanked him and disconnected the call he then opened the webbased email account he and oz used to communicate and left a note for him in the draft folder what he wanted to know was what kind of intel the cia had developed on the old soviet military base where mustafa khan was being held as well as the hospital across the road hopefully the cia had turned the soviet embassy inside out as the last of the russians were rolling out of kabul and maybe just maybe they had come up with something that he could use the next thing harvath had to do was prepare a report for stephanie gallo she had no background in intelligence or national security and harvath had to assume that no matter how badly she wanted her daughter back any correspondence he exchanged with her could end up being compromised before leaving he had explained that his communications would be purposefully vague and that there would be periods when he would not be able to send her any reports at all he wasnt in afghanistan to trade emails with her he was there to rescue her daughter harvath knew though that despite her tough exterior stephanie gallo was still a mother and like any parent she was undoubtedly agonizing over her daughters situation when harvath thought of stephanie gallo it was her role as parent that he tried to picture drawing from the code words they had developed he dashed off a quick message have arrived rug dealer has moved working on new location will be in touch when i know more he debated adding an assurance that he felt good about the prospects of getting gallos daughter back alive but he decided against it he hadnt been hired to hold her hand he had been hired to get results in the end thats all anyone would care about logging out of that email account harvath switched over to gmail and found a message waiting from tracy in it was a picture she had taken of bullet lying by the front door of the cottage who needs a deadbolt hope you had a good flight stay safe see you when you get back harvath smiled tracy was a wonderful woman he sent her a reply logged out of the account and opened google earth to see what kind of opensource imagery was available for their target locations the imagery was somewhere between one to three years old yet fairly detailed all the same harvath wasnt happy with what it showed him at least three of the buildings and possibly more had brandnew roofs and displayed other signs of having been upgraded it was very possible that the base was being used as more than just the afghan presidents private detention complex before they did anything they were going to need to get a look at those facilities and the closer the better chapter washington dc thirtytwoyearold elise campbell lived in a tiny apartment on massachusetts avenue between sixth and seventh it was a junior onebedroom with an efficiency kitchen a narrow bathroom and a livingsleeping space separated by a sleek divider that only went threequarters of the way to the ceiling lining the walls were black and white reprints of famous french photographs stainlesssteel shelving held an assortment of hip periodicals as well as a commemorative coffeetable book about the new york yankees and a small entertainment center housed a flatscreen tv a dvd player and an ipod docking station all told the apartment looked more like a trendy hotel suite than a space someone actually called home it was obvious that elise campbell didnt spend much time there the only personal touch was a collection of framed photos of friends and family along the windowsill she had grown up in the eastern portion of the commonwealth of virginia often referred to as the tidewater region her father had been a virginia beach police officer and had risen through the ranks to become a detective as had his father and his grandfather even elises greatgreat grandfather had been a law enforcement officer in the tidewater area she was the fifth generation of campbells to continue the tradition which was significant not only because she was the first campbell woman to join the vbpd but because both of her brothers had chosen careers in the corporate world one had become a banker and the other a stockbroker many believed elise had followed the distinguished campbell tradition to please her father and grandfather but the answer was more simple than that for elise as it had been for the campbells who had come before her law enforcement was a calling she believed in justice and fair play she believed in protecting those who were too weak to protect themselves and she also knew that no matter how hard the police worked they would never rid the world completely of evil there would always be a need for cops because evil would always need to be kept at bay elise also believed that she would touch more lives and affect them for the better than either of her brothers would in their chosen fields she didnt see that as a knock on them and what they had chosen to do their careers were their callings and she respected them for having the guts to break with what the family had expected them to do though she would never make the kind of money her brothers did her compensation wasnt measured by a paycheck it was measured by the sense of satisfaction and fulfillment she got from performing her job well and from the distinguished men and women she served alongside her decision to switch to the secret service hadnt been easy but it was one of the smartest career moves she had ever made while she loved her colleagues and her job with the virginia beach pd she never felt shed make a good detective like the campbells before her and the pressure from her father and grandfather to follow their career track was just too intense though she didnt see herself as a detective and wanted to get away from the pressure from dad and pop to be one she also didnt want to entirely give up a career in law enforcement simply put she loved being a cop oddly enough it was her chief jack jarett who had encouraged her to consider a career in federal law enforcement jarett had an uncanny ability to read people and he had seen early on that regardless of generations of campbell service to the vbpd elise wasnt going to stay in virginia beach forever it was obvious that she wanted to do more and see more than just the tidewater as a graduate of the fbis neia program and a member of the major city chiefs organization chief jarett had a lot of contacts in dc though he practically had to threaten to fire elise campbell to get her to pursue the leads he had set up for her she interviewed with the fbi the dea and the secret service all three organizations invited her back for followup interviews and all three subsequently offered her positions but it was the secret service that appealed to her the most while pop had been supportive of her career move her father couldnt hide his disappointment and though he might have considered elises decision abandonment her brothers congratulated her for following her own desires she knew they were full of it with her gone from the virginia beach pd they could both feel better about having bucked the family tradition as well it made no difference that she was still in law enforcement as far as they were concerned she was on their side now and their father could not use her as a wedge anymore she became a means for her brothers to magnify their independence from their father and he blamed her for everything he felt had gone wrong with their family including its geographical breakdown with one brother in new york another in chicago and her even in nearby dc campbell didnt care for being the familys emotional football and even though she loved them she had grown somewhat estranged over the past couple of years with all of the travel and long hours in the service it was easy to put any semblance of a personal life on hold it didnt mean she didnt want to have one it just seemed as though there wasnt time for anything more than casual relationships she knew that also bothered her father not that he was aware of the kind of casual relationships she was having but she wasnt married and neither were her brothers her father saw it as yet another example of the unraveling of america and indicative of how the nation was committing cultural suicide elise wanted to have a family it was just a matter of meeting the right man but as capable as she was as a law enforcement officer she was incredibly shy when it came to meeting men it was an odd juxtaposition that her friends constantly teased her about some were fond of saying that if she ever met the right man it better be while he was in the process of committing a crime or she was very likely to let him escape she doubted that was how it would play out she was simply oldfashioned she believed that when she met the right man they both would know it and that would be it plain and simple and as far as remaining desirable until that someone special came along elise had nothing to worry about as the service required that she remain in top physical condition to that end and even though she had been at carolyn leonards so late the night before and had allowed herself to sleep in because she had several days in a row off shed still gone for a fivemile run once she was up after returning to her apartment she took a long hot shower and continued to think about everything she and carolyn had discussed leonard was right the final decision about what to do rested with her she had also laid out a million different ways that pursuing the presidents alleged involvement in nikki hales death could blow up in elises face and end her career the upside if there was one was minimal compared with what the downside very likely would be that said leonard had admitted that if she was in elises shoes she would have had trouble dropping the matter as well campbell didnt need the added encouragement but she appreciated her mentors admission in fact elises mind had been made up from the beginning she just hadnt realized it no matter how small the upside or how great the downside she couldnt sit back and do nothing while shed remained neutral onduty during the primaries and through the general election offduty she had been an ardent alden supporter many of her friends had said she was in serious need of a twelvestep program in order to kick the alden koolaid habit those same friends would be stunned if they saw her questioning him now in all fairness she herself was stunned a week ago if anyone had suggested president alden could have been involved in anything untoward much less a coverup around the death of nikki hale she would have told them they were out of their minds yet here she was ready to begin her own quiet and highly illegal investigation of the newly elected president of the united states pouring a cup of coffee elise grabbed her cordless phone off the counter and headed back into the living room scrolling through her blackberry she found the number she was looking for plugged it into the cordless and then leaned back onto the couch and took a quick sip from her mug the call was answered by a woman with a heavy bronx accent east hampton town police detective klees hi rita its elise hey there responded a voice deepened from years of smoking how ya doing im good im good said campbell you been watching the yankees theyre off to a good start elise laughed you could take the girl out of the bronx but you couldnt take the bronx out of the girl rita klees was a rabid yankees fan are you surprised asked campbell look how well they did in the grapefruit league this year theyre going all the way from your lips to gods ears replied klees ive still got my reservations about girardi but hes very goodlooking and hes starting to grow on me rita the mans married campbell teased so was alex rodriguez until he met madonna listen as long as mrs girardi keeps mr girardi out of east hampton hell be fine but if he happens to come to town and just happens to bump into this particular material girl i cant be responsible for what cupid does to the poor guy elise laughed again she had no doubt that if girardi or any other new york yankee showed up in her jurisdiction rita would personally put them under twentyfourhour surveillance not only that but she would probably find a way to introduce herself and end up inviting them out to her favorite tavern to drink them under the table she was one of those people you couldnt help but enjoy being around she had an infectious laugh and a largerthanlife personality she was an irresistible force that immediately became the center of gravity in every room she ever walked into an attractive woman in her late forties with dark hair and bright blue eyes klees had a pair of breasts almost as big as her personality she was fond of saying that her boobs did for her what columbos wrinkled raincoat had done for the clever television detective most men and more than a few women believed that breast size and intelligence were inversely proportional that patently asinine line of reasoning was fine by klees she was smarter and better at her job than any four men put together the nypd had known it and had promoted her accordingly shed earned her gold shield faster than any woman in the history of the force but after losing two close friends on shed decided shed had it with new york city she traded in the stress the crime the hassles and a not insignificant portion of her paycheck for life in the hamptons and while she didnt live like a rock star or a hotel heiress she was happy rita made friends wherever she went and east hampton was no exception though she was several years removed from manhattan she still maintained excellent contacts back at the nypd and with many of the federal law enforcement agencies when organizations like the secret service came to east hampton it was a nobrainer for ritas chief to assign her as the liaison that was how she and elise campbell had become friends due to the number of threats he had received robert alden had been assigned secret service protection very early on in the primary campaign and elise had been one of the agents tasked to his detail part of her responsibility was doing advance work and interfacing with local law enforcement wherever the senator traveled though elise wasnt working the trip on which nikki hale was killed she had made several visits to east hampton with alden and had gotten to know rita klees very well their mutual love of the yankees vaulted campbells standing in the east hampton detectives eyes and on multiple evenings off rita dragged elise to some of her favorite watering holes and even though campbell had not returned to east hampton since the hale incident she and rita still kept in touch via emailwhich technically meant that she was on the daily receiving end of humorous emails forwarded by the east hampton detective so you coming to town or did you call just to talk baseball asked klees no to both unfortunately whats up i need some help with something said campbell do you remember the nikki hale case the wasted senior staffer who plowed her car into that minivan headon last summer yeah i remember it why i need to see the file what for asked klees off the record sure off the record theres a concern that someone may not have been completely truthful in their witness statement there was a pause and elise thought she could hear her friend taking a puff on a cigarette though she doubted even the largerthanlife rita klees would be allowed to smoke in the east hampton town pd headquarters when rita finally answered her tone had changed she was a lot less jovial and a lot more businesslike which witness are we talking about she asked and who exactly is concerned i cant say replied elise cant say to which question both no offense elise but you were just one of aldens advance people and you werent even out here during the whole hale thing why am i getting this call from you because were friends klees was silent again elise strained to discern if it was because rita was taking another drag but she couldnt tell she assumed it was because klees was deciding how to respond are you in some sort of trouble asked the detective no of course not she replied why would you think that because youre not being straight with me whether it was because shed been a cop or because she was a native new yorker rita had an exceptional bullshit detector in all fairness elise did too and she knew better than to try to lie her way through this i cant go into the specifics why not i told you i cant say again rita was silent listen continued elise i could be completely offbase here thats why i need to see the file and thats why im asking you so this isnt an official secret service request then stated klees no replied campbell its just cop to cop well cop to cop theres no way in hell im sending you a copy of this file ritas retort stung and it took campbell a few seconds to reply im not asking for my own permanent copy elise ive seen people lose their careers over stuff like this i like where i am and id like to stay here i also like my captain even if he is a mets fan hed be in a hell of a lot of trouble if this thing went sideways i dont want to get you or anyone in your department in trouble rita listen like i said i dont know if theres anything to this or not so what exactly are you looking for i wont know until i see the file rita was silent yet again as she thought it over and then replied i cant send you a copy of the file but i can let you see the one we have here on one condition shoot you come completely clean and tell me what youre looking for and if i think even for a second that youre not being totally honest cop to cop or friend to friend it wont matter our deal will not only be off but ill get your boss on the phone and find out what the hell is going on even if i have to reopen this case and make it official chapter northeastern afghanistan atrip to nangarhar hospital in jalalabad confirmed what elam badar already suspectedhis sons jaw was broken though it was difficult for the boy to speak elam badar had coaxed from asadoulah what had happened when the boy explained that mullah massouds retarded brother zwak had attacked him without provocation the father was incensed he had always thought it ridiculous that the elders of massouds village allowed zwak the halfwit to run around with a rifle even if the barrel was taped at the end the man should have been kept indoors allowing him to roam the streets of his village accusing visitors of being spies or having come to poison the village well was asking for trouble and now trouble had come asadoulah told his father how he had made the hour trek to the neighboring village to visit friends while there the boys told him about the american that massouds men had taken hostage like many afghan boys asadoulah had never seen an american woman before his friends offered to show her to him asadoulah told his father that zwak must have been on the other side of the hut they were using to hold the woman because no sooner had he begun peering through a crack in the wooden door than the retarded man appeared called asadoulah a spy and clubbed the boy in the jaw with the butt of his rifle elam badar knew that zwak had a difficult time remembering the faces of those from even neighboring villages he himself had been called a spy many times by massouds brother and had been prevented from even walking past their well on more than one occasion zwak took his mock duties seriously but in this case he had gone entirely too far and so had his brother if the taliban commander was holding an american woman hostage that was bad enough but to put zwak in charge of guarding her seemed downright foolish the halfwit was incapable of responding appropriately the fact that he had countered a bunch of boys peering through a crack in a door with violence proved what a danger he was his attack on asadoulah couldnt be ignored zwak and his antics had been tolerated for far too long now a boys jaw had been broken enough was enough elam badar parked his truck on the edge of the village and walked toward its center he was not a particularly big man nor was he particularly brave and he did not relish the idea of having to deal with a taliban commander like mullah massoud but this was about honor and the pashtun code was very clear about how such things must be handled specifically when it came to an assault on a family member in the center of the village built into a small copse of trees was an elevated wooden structure with a wide veranda it was here that the council of village elders or shura conducted all of the affairs for the village elam badar mounted the structures stairs and removed his shoes before stepping inside one of the villagers sitting on the floor inside recognized him and stood to greet him they touched hearts and embraced it is good to see you brother said the villager and you replied elam badar who though anxious to speak with the village elders quieted the anger in his heart and chatted with the man for several minutes before requesting to be seen what has happened asked the man elam badar forced a smile he knew all too well how quickly gossip spread and he didnt want mullah massoud or his halfwit brother to have time to concoct a story to explain away the attack he wanted to take them completely by surprise and so said nothing of great importance i have a small matter that concerns both of our villages that i need to discuss he was shown to a small room off to the side where the village elders had just finished a meeting with a handful of men on another subject after the greetings the village elders ushered the other men out and invited elam badar to take tea with them as he had done with the villager at the door elam badar kept his anger in check and adhered to pashtun etiquette they talked about several different subjects of mutual interest before arriving at the true reason elam badar had come i understand you have an american visitor he said a woman of the four elders in the room it was customary for only one to speak the man who did was in his sixties with an ashcolored beard and a stern disposition he had a thick scar that began at the bridge of his nose and traveled downward across the left side of his face to just beneath his ear elam badar knew that the scar was a souvenir from one of the many battles the elder had fought against the soviets his name was baseer our village is often blessed with visitors replied the chief elder with a motion of his hand that indicated he considered elam badars visit a blessing elam badar nodded politely and kept going she must be very important if she is being kept guarded an uncomfortable silence descended upon the small room elam badar allowed it to linger for several seconds before continuing are you aware that while he was guarding her zwak assaulted my son it was obvious from the look on baseers face that this piece of information took him by surprise elam badar allowed his eyes to shift to the faces of the other three elders and he saw that they were equally shocked feeling the wind at his back he removed from his pocket the paperwork that the young doctor at the hospital in jalalabad had given him carefully unfolding them he handed the pages to the elder with the butt of his rifle elam badar asserted zwak broke my sons jaw the elder studied the paperwork and then handed it to his colleagues to read you have four boys correct yes replied elam badar which one are we talking about my oldest asadoulah i am sorry for his jaw being broken and for your familys trouble in this matter said baseer thank you elam badar responded the elder stroked his beard as his mind processed what he had heard zwak is a simple man we all know this but he has never before been violent elam badars eyes widened he accuses everyone who enters your village of being a spy and prevents those he doesnt recognize or cannot remember from walking anywhere near your well baseer shrugged and raised his palms yet still he has never harmed anyone let me ask you your son can speak elam badar nodded what did he tell you happened he said that he had come to your village to visit friends they told him about the american woman and asked if he wanted to see her he agreed and they took him to where she was being held while he was trying to see her through a crack in the door zwak came from the other side of the building and struck him in the jaw with the butt of his rifle once again the elder was silent elam badar watched him as he stroked his beard and wondered if they truly grasped the seriousness of the situation the pashtun code was on his side in such a matter no longer able to contain his anger over this situation having even been allowed to develop in the first place elam badar opened his mouth and his illchosen words burst forth i know the american woman is not a guest in your village she is a hostage and you know it too have you any idea how dangerous this is for us its not just your village that will suffer repercussions for this if word gets out well all suffer because of what mullah massoud has done baseer held up his hand this man was getting away from himself very quickly the other village was nearly five kilometers away whatever mullah massoud had done it wouldnt affect them that said baseer was not happy that word had spread about the american woman he had warned massoud against bringing her back to the village he had suggested they find someplace else to keep her but massoud had insisted no doubt his decision came in part at the behest of the russian the one they called bakht rawan the russians had never had the afghans best interests at heart and the elder doubted that much had changed since their departure from afghanistan the elder had seen far too many of them in recent years to believe they had given up wanting a stake in his country but as much as the elder didnt trust bakht rawan and the rest of his countrymen the matter before him had to do with mullah massoud it sounded as if the taliban commander had placed too much confidence in his brother and though the elder had not yet heard zwaks side of the story so far it was a very unpleasant situation that had the potential to get much worse elam badars son had had more than his pride wounded something needed to be done villages had gone to war against each other over less and while massoud could summon hundreds of battlehardened soldiers elam badars village possessed guns and experienced mujahideen as well we will speak with mullah massoud said baseer but he was not there to see what happened to my son protested elam badar the elder held his hand up again we will also speak with zwak he added once more elam badars passion flared there can be no excuse for what happened to my son smiling baseer signaled that the meeting was over as elam badar embraced him the elder held on for a little longer than normal we will make this right i promise you your family and your village are important to us elam badar felt indignant but he tried to push the emotion back down into the pit of his stomach where it had begun thank you he replied the other elders embraced elam badar and summoned the villager he was friendly with to walk with him back to his truck when they stepped outside the sun was already slipping behind the mountain peaks that surrounded the village and the temperature had begun to drop baseer watched elam badar descend the wooden stairs and disappear from sight beyond the copse of trees beneath his breath he silently cursed mullah massoud he and all of his taliban brothers were going to be the death of afghanistan chapter kabul when mei began sending out buckets of beer and enormous plates of food from the kitchen gallagher turned off the tv and rang the dinner bell as people selected seats around the table mei ditched her husband and grabbed the chair next to harvath flirtatiously she tucked her arm through his and glancing heavenward said finally a real man my prayers have been answered mine too replied hoyt as he grabbed a large bowl of fried rice and scooped a portion onto his plate i havent had a decent nights sleep in months everyone laughed in addition to harvath mei hoyt and gallagher there were three of meis chinese girlfriends and two of isss other employees seated at the table for dinner mark midland was a twentysixyearold american communications expert who functioned as tom hoyts righthand man and helped run the iss ops center he was tall and thin with strawberry blond hair pale skin and a face full of freckles across from him was a thirtyfouryearold canadian daniel fontaine he was a former member of canadas storied counterterrorism unit joint task force while he claimed he had left jtf to get into the private security world in order to make enough money to pay for a ranch he had his eye on back home harvath had never believed him there were plenty of other outfits that paid a lot more than hoyt and gallagher the canadians were a smart bunch when it came to gathering their intel harvaths guess was that fontaine worked for the canadian intelligence security service and was in afghanistan to gather intel for the canadian military operating within the country under nato command his iss job was just a cover fontaine was a handsome sixfootone man with dark hair who was used to commanding most of the attention from meis girlfriends as well as any other female visitors who came to the iss compound if fontaine wasnt working protection on one of the iss security contracts he spent most of his evenings out partying with the western expat community and what gallagher and hoyt referred to as partying harvath saw as most likely developing relationships with noncanadian nationals and gathering intel but no matter what fontaines true marching orders were both gallagher and hoyt praised him as being an exceptionally talented operator he was also an immediately likable guy and though he and harvath had only met once before they had gotten along very well the sticky part for harvath was whether fontaine could be brought into what hoyt comically referred to as their circle of trust both gallagher and hoyt not only knew that harvath was in afghanistan to spring khan they were being paid to help him do it while fontaine might be a good guy to involve in their operation if he was what harvath suspected him to be hed feed all of their plans straight back to canada so as much as harvath liked him he decided to keep him out of the loop on khan as far as fontaine was concerned harvath was incountry to drum up leads and help consult on the gallo kidnapping as the meal continued everyone was drinking except for harvath his jet lag weighed on him and he decided to stick with caffeine they also had yet to hear from rashid and harvath wanted to keep a clear head until they had a better angle on what was going on that went for gallagher too when harvath saw him reaching for his third bottle of beer he shot him a look baba g was harvaths right arm while he was incountry and he needed to stay sharp he was getting paid a lot of money to be on call twentyfour hours he wouldnt be good to anyone drunk after rashid had missed the twohour call window by an hour harvath gave up looking at his watch tia he reminded himself he was on afghan time now and a promise from an afghan to get back to someone in two hours didnt necessarily mean he would get back to you in two hours you have watches but we have time the afghans were fond of saying when the cell phone in his pocket did begin to vibrate it took harvath by surprise he fished it out only to realize it wasnt his afghan phone ringing but his us blackberry standing up from the table he excused himself and stepped outside into the cold night air a fire was going in the courtyards fire pit and harvath walked toward it as he activated the call and held the device up to his ear this is harvath scot its oz replied his pal back at cia harvath was glad to hear from him he hoped the man had good news were you able to speak with anyone from the afghan desk i talked to two of them as well as an agent whod been senior on the soviet desk when the russians pulled out and you were right about one thing said ozbek the agency did have operatives there taking advantage of the troop withdrawal in as well as the collapse of afghanistans kremlinbacked government in when the russians shuttered their embassy how about the hard intel i need according to these guys not much was left behind and what the russians did leave was pretty well sanitized so no drawings no blueprints nothing about the old soviet base im sorry harvath filled his lungs and exhaled watching his breath float upward all right he said thanks for trying disconnecting the call he slid the blackberry back into his pocket and stood for a moment warming his hands over the fire from inside the dining room he heard more laughter in the everworsening hell that was afghanistan it was good that they could relax long enough to laugh that made him wonder what julia gallo was experiencing at the moment she was undoubtedly cold hungry and very scared she also probably had no idea whether she was going to live or die kidnapping was one of the cruelest tortures a person could be forced to endure every time the jailers key turned inside the lock every bump or shuffle outside your cell door made you wonder is this it are they finally coming for me is this the moment i die he picked up a piece of brittle scrap wood and dropped it into the fire somewhere behind him he heard the door to the dining room open turning he saw baba g with his jacket on and his cell phone in his hand rashid just called he said hes got something for us and wants to meet harvath wasnt surprised that the man had reached out to gallagher they were the ones with the relationship he was a stranger he just hoped that trusting rashid wouldnt turn out to be a mistake chapter within five minutes they had gathered their gear and were ready to roll flower who had returned from eating dinner with his family was outside waiting for them behind the wheel of gallaghers land cruiser baba g got in front to ride shotgun while harvath hopped in back as flower put the truck in gear and pulled away from the curb harvath pulled a red bull from the backpack at his feet and prayed that their meeting would be a short one while being forced to stay awake was one way to get acclimated to local time doing so while rolling through kabul after dark had a considerable downside traffic was light as most afghans huddled at home trying to keep warm the people who were out were westerners patronizing the many restaurants and clubs that catered to them across the city as they exited a traffic circle onto a smaller side street harvath took a mental snapshot to help him keep track of their route just in case the unthinkable happened and he had to make his way home alone following gallaghers instructions flower performed a series of surveillance detection routes or sdrs and when the trio was satisfied they werent being followed they headed toward their rendezvous inspector rashid had provided gallagher with a specific route which flower now followed he threaded the land cruiser through quiet streets and neighborhoods some of which baba g had never been through himself they had just turned out of a narrow side street when harvath noticed gallaghers posture change whats up he asked from the backseat flower answered before his boss checkpoint doublecheck your weapons said gallagher make sure everything is out of sight have your id available and remember to smile and be friendly were just a couple of ngo workers out for dinner as harvath did as gallagher suggested he asked have you ever seen a checkpoint here before no but they move around all the time it doesnt bother you that weve got a lot of money with us and right in the middle of the route that rashid sent us on theres a roadblock of course it bothers me replied gallagher but this could just be a checkpoint with all the attacks the afghans are on heightened alert just stay calm and well be okay harvath didnt believe in coincidences and adjusted the position of his holster so he could access his glock quickly if he needed to ahead of them were several green ford pickup trucks with the afghan national army emblem on the side flower brought the land cruiser to a halt and rolled down his window gallagher and harvath did the same with theirs the soldiers looked cold and bored harvath took that as a good sign this wasnt a holdup if it was the men at the checkpoint would be nervous and switched on he smiled as hed been instructed and holding his hand over his heart bade the soldier outside his window salaam alaikum the soldier had both hands on his ak but he nodded and returned harvaths greeting gallagher bantered with his soldier in broken dari while flower spoke in calm quick sentences when harvath heard the soldier laugh he started to relax seconds later the soldiers bade them all a good evening and waved them through the checkpoint see nothing to worry about stated gallagher as he powered his window back up and they drove on ten minutes later when they were within two blocks of their destination gallagher pulled out his mobile and called inspector rashid the gates were open and waiting for them when they arrived flower drove into the narrow courtyard and killed his lights ill wait here he said you sure you dont want to come inside asked gallagher he shook his head and removing a pack of cigarettes from his heavy winter coat pointed to a small guard shack where the men who had shut the gates behind them had gone and said ill be over there gallagher climbed out of the land cruiser and harvath followed his backpack slung over his shoulder a sentry outside the house they were using for the rendezvous stuck his hand out and asked for something in dari harvath looked at gallagher who translated for him take the batteries out of your cell phones well get them back when we leave the afghans harbored a paranoia regarding cell phones especially their ability to act as beacons for american missile strikes warring factions had been known to toss compromised phones over the walls of each others homes in the hopes that they could draw an american military response the taliban were so afraid of mobile phones they made cell providers in many parts of the country shut down their networks at night so they couldnt be tracked harvath found it ironic that other than batteries they hadnt been asked to surrender anything else they didnt look into harvaths bag nor were he or gallagher frisked they were free to walk into the meeting armed as long as it wasnt with a functioning cell phone the men slipped off their boots and were met inside by inspector rashid who embraced them both they touched hearts in greeting with the police officer and were shown into a large living area where two bearded men were already seated the men rose and rashid introduced them as marjan and pamirhis cousins who worked for the national directorate of security once the group had said their traditional hellos and had shaken hands harvath and gallagher removed their coats and sat down upon thin cushions on a greencarpeted floor though the room was surrounded with windows the panes of glass had been carefully covered over with paper a small chandelier cast a yellow glow over the otherwise barren room dishes of candy and sweets sat on the floor along with a silver pitcher and several glasses unfortunately rashid said with a smile as he reached for the pitcher and began pouring for everyone we only have american tea this evening my favorite replied gallagher the instant his was poured harvath recognized what american tea was a euphemism forwhiskey harvath sipped his drink slowly gallagher on the other hand made short work of his first round and wasnt shy about accepting a second cultural sensitivity notwithstanding harvath was concerned that baba g needed to watch his intake while he was all for male bonding especially with foreign intelligence assets this wasnt boys night out the whiskey was a preamble to a negotiation for which he and gallagher needed to remain sharp after fortyfive minutes of chitchat during which harvath noted thankfully baba g ignored his third round they got down to the reason they were sitting in an nds safe house in kabul on a friday nightsnatching mustafa khan rashids cousin pamir had the best news harvath had heard yet he not only knew of the underground tunnels radiating out from the old soviet military base he had been through many of them and could get his hands on any maps harvath wanted marjan had been tasked to the bases secret interrogation facility at one point and could provide any intel needed inspector rashid had certainly delivered but harvath was wary that it was all just a little too convenient undoubtedly they saw him as a walking atm machine suckers were born every minute but rarely did they roll through afghanistan with the kind of money that harvath was carrying hed been leery about giving rashid so much up front but gallagher had insisted and harvath trusted his knowledge of the marketplace to know the right amount to get rashids attention well they had apparently gotten the police inspectors attention the question was could they rely on what they were purchasing as if reading harvaths mind inspector rashid got to his feet and asked his guests to follow him harvath and gallagher obeyed with marjan and pamir right behind at the end of the hall rashid removed a key from his pocket and opened the door to a bedroom arrayed along two single beds were almost all of the items harvath had requested entering the room he began going through the gear and inspecting it gallagher stepped in and took a look at it as well once he had finished the inspection harvath asked rashid what about the munitions the munitions you asked for are not easy to get we cant do this without them the inspector smiled you requested something highly specialized gallagher looked at harvath and rubbed his thumb and forefinger together how much to get the munitions asked harvath lets have some more tea replied rashid harvath turned toward the door and said to gallagher we obviously made a mistake lets go rashid put his hands up and inserted himself into the doorway please my friends he said i am here to help you then i suggest you help us find those munitions of course of course anything is possible with the right amount of money right replied harvath as i said this particular item is not so easy to get but it is possible if he cannot locate any of the items on your list we can stated pamir rashid smiled as if that settled everything and directed his guests back into the living room reluctantly harvath acquiesced after twenty more minutes of tea they discussed terms while the prices werent unreasonable harvath knew the afghans expected to haggle and he was an exceptional negotiator when they were finished the cost had not been dramatically reduced but harvath had locked in a key insurance policymarjan and pamir would join their team to help snatch mustafa khan of course the nds operatives were not crazy about this idea at first but the promise of a bonus of several times what each man made in a year sealed the deal they spent another hour talking with rashid marjan and pamir drinking the majority of the american tea in the pitcher when they said goodbye the two americans received long whiskeysoaked hugs from their afghan hosts harvath removed several thick stacks of cash from his backpack and placed them under one of the cushions in the living room out in the courtyard marjan and pamirs men loaded the equipment into the back of the land cruiser and covered it over with a couple of blankets sliding his cell phone back into his pocket rashid walked over to the truck and gave flower a new set of directions which would allow them to avoid the most recently positioned mobile checkpoints after pulling into the road gallagher looked over his shoulder as he watched the gates to the nds safe house close behind them he asked so what do you think in the darkness of the backseat harvath remained silent rashid had turned out to be better than he had expected and marjan and pamir looked poised to pick up where the police inspectors expertise had left off but in all honesty harvath knew they were still a long way from where they needed to be their preoperational planning had been tossed out the window when mustafa khan had been moved from policharki they were starting from scratch now and harvath didnt like that nevertheless they were moving forward he only hoped that they were moving fast enough chapter east hampton new york elise campbell stepped off her train and onto the east hampton platform the evening air was chilly and damp the secret service agent had caught a highspeed acela express from washington to penn station and from there the long island railroad via jamaica station out to the easternmost town on the south shore of long island standing beneath the portico was detective rita klees whatever you do said rita as she greeted elise with a hug and took her bag please tell me you didnt eat any train food rita ive been on trains and in stations for over seven hours so sue me i broke down and had a sandwich klees made a face i refuse to eat that garbage they serve nodding toward her car she said cmon well get you a real dinner and a drink the detective threw campbells overnight bag into the cargo area of her mini cooper and then slid into the drivers seat after starting the car she picked up a pack of cigarettes and asked do you mind the car already smelled like an ashtray go ahead said campbell as she rolled down her window they chatted about elises trip up from dc as rita drove to a small restaurant called thackers and parked her car she grabbed her briefcase from the backseat and the two women made their way inside it was obvious by the attention klees received from the hostess as well as the piano player segueing out of the song he had been playing and launching into the sinatra classic that closed every yankee game new york new york that she was a bit of a regular rita waved and said hello to other patrons she knew as they were shown to a quiet leather booth in the corner when the hostess presented the menus klees declined and asked elise youre a meat eater right do you like short ribs i love short ribs replied campbell these are the best youll ever have she said and then looked back at the hostess two orders of the short ribs then and ill have a johnnie green on the rocks elise ordered a glass of red wine and the hostess disappeared reaching into her briefcase rita removed a thick folder and set it on the table is that it asked campbell klees nodded elise had spent the trip up from dc trying to figure out what to say to her friend she knew she couldnt lie to her which left her with only one optionthe truth but how much of the truth should she reveal i need your word that none of what im about to tell you will go any further if were talking about a crime being committed began klees who stopped when a waiter appeared with their drinks once he had gone elise said i dont know for sure if a crime has been committed thats why im here but if im wrong and theres nothing to this then my careers over so this has to do with the president campbell nodded can i assume hes the one you were referring to when you said maybe somebody wasnt completely truthful in their witness statement again campbell nodded okay did he have something to do with the accident elise looked at her friend i hope not then wheres all of this coming from i may have overheard a conversation rita stirred the ice cubes in her drink now i understand this puts me and the secret service in a very difficult position said campbell if he didnt do anything wrong and it gets out that i told people about the conversation then the entire secret service not only looks bad presidents will forever distance themselves from us which will make it even harder to protect them but if he did do something then hes an idiot to have mentioned it in front of you he didnt exactly know i was there what are you talking about i was standing guard in a wooded area he couldnt see me he stopped within earshot and i heard his conversation who was he talking with do i have your word that this will stay just between us asked elise rita nodded he was talking with stephanie gallo thats who was having the fundraiser for him here i know said campbell thats also whose house he was staying at i know its also where nikki hale had been before she left and had her accident campbell reached for her wine and took a long sip were gallo and the president having this conversation in person or was he on the phone asked klees as she glanced around the room to make sure no one was eavesdropping on their conversation they were together taking a walk on her horse farm just outside dc what exactly did they say elise filled rita in on the kidnapping of julia gallo the ransom demand and stephanie gallos threat to expose the presidents involvement in the death of nikki hale unless the president got her daughter back when she was finished she lifted her wineglass sat back and tried to dissolve into the booth im stunned said klees you and me both he doesnt seem like that type of guy i know replied campbell so what exactly are the specifics of his involvement or this alleged coverup around nikki hales death that i dont know he and gallo walked off before i could hear the rest of the conversation then you do have a problem a big one but if he wasnt really guilty why would gallo threaten to expose him and ruin his presidency good point said klees as she stood up with her drink and left the file sitting on the table between them ill have to think about that im going to go have a cigarette when the waitress comes back order me another cocktail okay the east hampton detective stood outside long enough to smoke two cigarettes and polish off her drink before returning she was tempted to have a third cigarette but worried it would be obvious that she was avoiding going back in and having to face campbell she steeled herself with the knowledge that as a detective especially one in whose jurisdiction the crime in question took place she had every right to do what she had done to elise it was time to face the music walking back into the restaurant she found a fresh johnnie green at the table and campbell on her second glass of wine the file was back where she had left it and their dinners had arrived as she had expected elise was not happy you told me you were going to let me see the entire file that is the entire file replied klees as she took a sip of her new drink it cant be rita set down her cocktail and said east hampton pd conducted the investigation as well as the onscene accident reconstruction the vehicles in question were impounded to our motor pool where each underwent a full safety inspection by our mechanics the bodies of the deceased were removed from the scene to the suffolk county medical examiners office in hauppauge per the attached report their portion of the investigation was to detail the cause of death for each fatality and to run toxicology tests to determine the intoxication andor presence of any other substance or substances in the drivers bodies that would have impaired them as you can see from the report nikki hale was the only one who was impaired case closed case closed replied campbell as she reached over and shook the file youve got photographs diagrams of the crash scene everything but witness statements thats because there were no eyewitnesses to the crash one of our patrol officers was the first person on the scene but what about the people back at stephanie gallos estate what about them what about putting together what led to nikki hales intoxication who was drinking with her who saw her last and so forth klees understood where campbell was going you were a patrol officer when you were with the virginia beach pd not a detective right what do you mean by that she asked a bit defensively rita put up her hands im just trying to explain the way these things work as a patrol officer you take eyewitness statements at the scene anything above and beyond that is normally handled by detectives if nikki hale had survived the accident then the investigation would have definitely been more indepth we would have wanted to know what happened at the fundraiser how much she had had to drink etcetera because shed be facing criminal charges but since shes dead theres no one to charge with a crime hence case closed so you let me come all the way out here knowing there were no witness statements for me to go over asked campbell you said you wanted to see the file you didnt say you only wanted to see witness statements which i assumed were in there and which you could have specifically asked about replied rita elise shook her head in frustration i feel like you lied to me i never lied to you you held back from me and ill admit i wasnt percent forthcoming with you but what you were suggesting over the phone was that there might be adjunct criminal activity to nikki hales death i could have kicked it up the chain of command and made it official or i could do it this way i love you elise but cop to cop there wasnt a third option campbell lifted her fork and stabbed at her food without any witness statements i cant even begin to piece together what happened that night and what the presidents involvement in all of this might be wouldnt the secret service have written up a report of some sort asked klees im sure they did but thats not something i have access to maybe not replied rita as an idea began to form in her mind but you could get access to the agents who were on duty the night hale was killed elise thought about it theoretically but i dont have any authority maybe you could sort of what do you mean if a civil suit had been filed everyone including then senator and now president alden would have been subpoenaed but a civil suit never was filed was it klees shook her head no with charlie and sheryl coleman and their two children dead the only surviving relatives were charlie colemans parents they decided not to sue sheryl coleman didnt have any family none at the risk of sounding callous said campbell everyone sues today at the drop of a hat but in this case it might have been justified im no lawyer but i would think that the coleman parents could have named both gallo and president alden as defendants they would have been prime targets from what i heard replied rita they were you mean charlie colemans parents did want to sue klees nodded so what happened the hamptons rumor mill has it that stephanie gallo bought them off are you serious asked elise if you believe the gossip replied klees and do you i saw charlie colemans parents not long after the accident his mother was beside herself and his father was mad as hell i also gathered that he was not a big fan of senator aldens he lawyered up pretty quick and hired a big firm out of manhattan they wasted no time in getting a lawsuit rolling they were a couple of months into everything when all of a sudden the firm was discharged because gallo bought them off makes sense said klees the one thing gallo has in greater supply than anything else is money i have a feeling that if she wanted to avoid a messy trial and save her candidate the embarrassment and bad press she could pull it off thats something else thats bothering me remarked campbell how did this story never make national news something this scandalous especially during an election is pretty juicy doubly so by todays journalistic standards im sure president alden can thank gallo for that as well shes a very powerful woman probably insisted on some sort of a gag order from the getgo and if the colemans reached a settlement with her she probably would have had them sign a bunch of nondisclosure agreements theyd be gagged so tight their lips would turn blue agreed so without any other relatives thats it said campbell theyre the only ones who could bring a civil action to get to the bottom of what happened not necessarily replied klees there may be someone else who still has legal grounds for a suit so how would that give me any leverage with the agents who were posted to gallos home that night it depends on how far youre willing to go to get to the bottom of this campbell drained the last sip of wine from her glass held it up to get the waiters attention and then replied im still sitting here arent i chapter afghanistan saturday mullah massoud arrived back at his compound along with sergei simonov and the small security contingent they had taken with them they had visited a village called surobi halfway between jalalabad and kabul as it was safer for massoud to travel at night they had conducted the entire trip in two cars under the cover of darkness per standard practice none of the taliban commanders attending the meeting had known its exact location until shortly before the meeting was scheduled to take place they had many things to discuss but the most important was their spring offensive the taliban had successfully placed a noose around kabul and the readiness status of their forces was excellent but their infrastructure and the condition of their military equipment was quite poor the russians and several other countries covertly supported their cause but were only willing to supply so much if they flooded afghanistan with hardware and other things that could be traced back to them they risked the wrath of the united states government and its allies most of the commanders were pessimistic about what they were going to be able to do with the limited resources they had at hand opium eradication in afghanistan had been stepped up dramatically and that meant their main source of revenue had been just as dramatically stepped down if they were to have any longterm success they needed more money to buy more equipment and to train more fighters without a major infusion of cash all their achievements of the last several years would be for naught none of this was news to massoud in fact hed been one of the first commanders to see it coming but the other commanders wouldnt listen to him the poppy crops had produced so much money for so long and the americans had been so halfhearted in their attempts to stem the flow that they thought they had a license to print money that would never expire as their circumstances started to erode so did their blind faith in mullah omar his empty promises and unwise alliance with bin laden and his arab alqaeda would be his ultimate undoing massoud knew something that no one else in the room but simonov did soon things were going to change while the other commanders complained and worried about the progress of the spring offensive massoud had looked beyond it he had seen a new future for afghanistan and he was quietly confident in the resurgence the taliban was going to achieve under his command his optimistic mood though did not last long during a break in the meeting massoud and simonov learned that mustafa khan was no longer a resident of policharki the talk was that he had been moved to another more secure facility the two men were well aware of how the afghan grapevine worked every piece of information was normally inflated as each person in the chain exaggerated his involvement or knowledge of the topic to make himself look more important and better informed the taliban commander and his russian colleague would have been considerably more heartened if the news had been of a full blown escape rather than a transfer if the afghan government had indeed moved khan to a more secure facility it would mean the americans would have a much tougher job on their hands while massoud didnt particularly care how difficult the task was for them he was dependent upon their success mustafa khan was the key not only to the talibans ridding itself of alqaeda but also to its being able to drive the american and other international troops out of the country so they could retake complete and final control of afghanistan when they returned to massouds compound it was shortly before sunrise most of the men were already saying their dawn prayers to help him stay both warm and awake in surobi the taliban commander had consumed large quantities of tea though he had urinated before leaving he had refused to allow any stops on the way back even for himself combined with the hour at which the meeting had finally ended he was not only late for prayers he also needed to urinate again most urgently stepping out of the vehicle mullah massoud shooed away one of his lieutenants eager to speak with him and headed for the compounds rudimentary toilet facilities after relieving himself the taliban commander performed his ablutions and then hurried to his quarters for his prayer rug upon opening the door to the main room he was quite surprised to find his brother zwak leading the four village elders in prayer his pride was quite apparent as the volume of his voice was much louder than it should have been massoud removed his shoes and stepped quietly inside after retrieving his prayer rug he respectfully laid it on the floor and prostrated himself toward mecca he followed the prayers until their completion and then greeted the elders and his brother stepping away for a moment he opened his door and found his lieutenant waiting for him the mans message was no longer urgent now that the commander had discovered the village elders waiting for him massoud sent the lieutenant for tea and stepped back inside the room was colder than it should have been and massoud realized that in his excitement over the visit from the elders zwak had forgotten to turn on the heat approaching the propane heater in the corner the taliban commander took down a box of matches and got it going he was tired and not much in the mood to deal with village politics but he had no choice undoubtedly the elders needed something important from him and had appeared at such an early hour in the hopes that their request would magically jump to the top of his list though he was annoyed to see them he knew his place he might be the most powerful man in the village but it was necessary that he respect the elders they provided him and his men with cover and that was very valuable the quality of his life was directly proportional to how content the elders were though massoud had tried a long time ago to force communication to go through his lieutenants the elders hadnt gone for it they would deal with no one but him and him directly it could be an incredible distraction at times but it was also a sign of great respect and respect was a twoway street the men made small talk about the weather how deep the snows had been and the relatively strong grip the cold still held on their valley especially at night once the tea came zwak played host and made sure everyone was well taken care of before he saw to himself when they had been served baseer the chief elder explained why they had come upon mention of the american woman zwaks mouth spread into a broad smile revealing several of his missing teeth doktar doktar he sang as he brought his hands together massoud motioned for him to be quiet baseer waited until zwak had calmed down before continuing zwak he said addressing him directly did you strike someone with your rifle yesterday the mans smile faded and a confused expression fell across his face he looked around the room for his rifle like a child suddenly gripped by the fear that a cherished blanket or stuffed animal had disappeared spotting his rifle zwak visibly relaxed and turned back to face the elder as the man was about to repeat the question mullah massoud stepped in and came to his brothers defense what are you talking about baseer recounted his meeting with elam badar from the previous evening and how his son asadoulahs jaw had allegedly been broken why did he not come to discuss this with me demanded massoud you are a taliban commander replied the elder elam badar is a farmer it is understandable that he came to speak to us first the taliban commander shook his head this should have been settled between us like fathers but he did not have the courage to come to me what else did he say baseer shrugged this was his primary concern massoud laughed he spoke of nothing else he attempted to build no further case against my brother seconds passed before the elder spoke he did raise concern over zwaks behavior in the past what kind of behavior his aggressive behavior aggressive behavior that is ridiculous scoffed the commander baseer fixed him with a hard stare massoud you yourself encourage this behavior you have given him a rifle which you know has been specially modified for him be that as it may you are well aware of how he acts toward people from outside our village he accuses them of spying or trying to poison our water the commander looked at his brother and smiled because of his hard work our water is pure and we have not had one spy in our village zwak who had grown more agitated as the conversation grew more intense stared nervously at his brother no spies he said clean water safe water do you feel that your brother was the best choice to guard the woman asked baseer in conjunction with the lock upon the door yes i do said massoud he is very attentive and has watched prisoners for us before the elders had all known zwak since he was a boy he was just as much a member of their family as he was of massouds zwak is a very important member of our village and in respect to the well and chasing away spies he has done a very good job offered the elder careful not to demean zwak or his powerful brother and he has never harmed anyone added massoud not once if his behavior frightens people elam badar is the only one complaining if he is so delicate maybe he should stay home and tend his children while his wife tends his affairs the commander had paid elam badar a very egregious shkanza and the elder was glad the man was not present to have heard the insult uttered maybe we should ask zwak what happened stated baseer massoud turned to his brother zwak do you know the boy we are taking about asadoulah zwak nodded and repeated the words bad boy bad boy several times did you see him yesterday zwak was frightened and his eyes darted from side to side slowly he nodded did he come to where you were watching over the american woman protecting said zwak correcting his brother it was an odd choice of words but massoud had learned long ago that it was easier to communicate with his brother using the words he chose did he come to where you were protecting the american woman zwak nodded and began repeating the words bad boy bad boy again did he make you angry zwak began to rock back and forth as he nodded what did he do zwak didnt want to answer and put his arms around himself as he continued to rock massoud repeated the question zwak what did he do to make you angry he still wouldnt answer and massoud pushed him by raising his voice the mentally challenged man began to cry as his brother pressed the question tell me what happened he demanded unable to take it any longer his eyes filled with tears zwak yelled at the top of his lungs unclean unclean unclean and wouldnt stop the commotion brought people running to massouds door and he ordered them to go away standing up he walked over to the door bolted it then came back and put his arm around his brothers shoulder it took more than five minutes for zwak to calm down and to stop trembling the only sound in the room came from the hiss of the propane heater and the short quick gasps of air zwak took as he tried to stop crying elam badar is concerned that someone could inform the authorities about the american woman and that it would be bad for our villages baseer interjected into the relative silence massoud looked up from comforting his brother i suspected there was more said during your meeting it sounds like elam badar is threatening us and it wouldnt be the first time he has caused trouble he does not care for the taliban the elder locked eyes with the commander be that as it may on this point his concern may be justified massoud was getting angrier by the second and fought to keep himself under control elam badar is a fool he has no idea what he is talking about so were wrong to be concerned then the womans presence is no danger to us at all the taliban commander did not care for the elders facetiousness if elam badar keeps his mouth shut there is no danger especially to elam badar and his village and if he doesnt massoud spoke slowly and clearly so that the elder would understand that the topic was no longer open for discussion i will worry about elam badar and as far as the woman is concerned her presence at least for the time being is necessary and will also benefit our cause so you have said but what exactly is our cause massoud it was all the commander could do not to reach out and slap this arrogant old man silently he vowed that he would make elam badar pay for his interference you know full well what our cause is i do replied baseer but i remain confused about why our cause needs to be intertwined with the russians you know why i know only what you have told me but regardless right now we must focus on making compensation to elam badar and his family compensation exclaimed massoud for what for his sons broken jaw snapped the elder we still dont even know what happened we know enough replied baseer as he rose to his feet and was joined by his three silent colleagues i will let you decide what is appropriate but i want it done quickly if his grievance is left too long elam badar could become a very serious problem for usand by us i mean our entire village i am counting on you to do the sensible thing and i expect you to see that no harm comes to him or his family massoud embraced the elders but as soon as they had left the compound he crossed the courtyard to simonovs room and pounded on the door when the russian answered it was obvious he had been sleeping what is it i need you to do something for me replied the taliban commander and i need it to look like an accident chapter though harvath had slept fitfully hed gotten a better nights sleep than he had expected he took a hot shower in his meat locker of a bathroom and shaved after getting dressed he walked across the courtyard to the dining room opening the door he bumped into daniel fontaine who had just finished eating and was on his way to see a client they were in the midst of exchanging greetings when gallagher yelled in or out and demanded that the door be shut harvath stepped inside and closed the door behind him hoyt and gallagher were sitting at the table reading the kabul daily which was a stack of pages they had printed off different news sports and entertainment websites and stapled together both men were wearing reading glasses mei was scrambling eggs in the kitchen and the dining room smelled fantastic judging from the tray of fresh croissants on the table flower had already been out to the best bakery in kabul it was run by an iranian whom harvath gallagher and hoyt were convinced was a spy for iran the bakery was a superb front as it offered every kind of westernstyle baked good including pizza as well as such other western products as gatorade doritos and hersheys chocolate westerners based in kabul flocked to the iranian by the carload harvath could only imagine the kinds of relationships the man was building and the level of intel he was gathering from his unsuspecting customers harvath poured himself a mug of coffee and sat down at the table i distinctly remember when i checked in he said to no one in particular requesting a morning paper gallagher didnt bother looking up from his reading material it wasnt outside your door this morning nope replied harvath as he took a sip of his coffee damn paperboy if its not in the bushes its up on the roof take hoyts hoyt held up his middle finger in response and kept reading you want an omelet asked mei as she stuck her head out of the kitchen and pointed a spatula at harvath yes please he no eat omelet hoyt shouted back at his wife mimicking her chinese accent he on continental breakfast plan one cup coffee one iranian bagel one swift kick in ass out door mei swore at her husband in chinese and vanished back into the kitchen if that woman had any sense shed leave you said harvath if that woman had any sense clarified gallagher she never would have married him in the first place i heard that said mei as she reemerged from the kitchen carrying a heaping plate of food you all in trouble now added hoyt continuing to mimic his wifes accent as she passed him she snatched the pages from his hand and delivered them along with the food to harvath hey exclaimed hoyt thats my paper and my breakfast ive been waiting longer than he has the kitchen is now closed stated mei what do you mean closed returning to where her husband was sitting mei bent down and grabbed one of his love handles i married an old man okay but not a fat old man your new diet starts today hoyt lunged to kiss her but mei evaded his grasp and with a shriek ran back to the kitchen and stop making fun of my accent she admonished him or you wont get dinner either thats okay replied hoyt im getting sick of eating dog anyway hoyts remark was met with another string of invective in chinese harvath kept his eyes on his food but couldnt help laughing you think thats funny demanded hoyt ill show you funny the dining room is now closed hand over that breakfast sailor harvath put down his fork raised his shirt and flashed his glock then went back to eating hoyt swore and reached for another croissant just as mei reappeared to clear the tray gallagher slid his glasses atop his head and set his paper down whats on the agenda for today he asked as he slid his coffee mug over to hoyt and motioned for his partner to pour hoyt leaned back and grabbed the pot after he had poured for gallagher he held it up to inquire if harvath wanted more when harvath nodded hoyt smiled and put it back out of harvaths reach i want to pay a visit to the care international hospital said harvath as he took his plate with him and walked over to the coffee pot to top off his mug are we doing recon on the soviet base or background on julia gallo both said harvath as he sat back down how soon can we leave gallagher looked at his watch ive got a squash game in a half hour then theres my rotary club meeting dont forget the kabul junior league luncheon added hoyt i almost did forget replied gallagher as he ticked off his appointments on his fingers im sorry but it looks like im booked solid all day harvath picked up his fork and scooping up a large bite of omelet replied ill see you out front in fifteen minutes so much for our bake sale when harvath exited the compound he found gallagher sitting in the land cruiser with his jackie collins book about seven or eight wisecracks raced through harvaths mind but he kept them to himself and just shook his head as he hopped in the passenger seat and closed the door dont start with me gallagher warned harvath shook his head again and reached over to turn up the heater it seemed to be twice as cold today as yesterday gallagher pulled to the end of the short street and then turned left onto the main road when he turned the radio on to his afghan bollywood station harvath was ready for him removing a cd hed burned on his laptop he slid it into the player as apache by the sugarhill gang began to play harvath settled back into his seat and smiled what the hell are we listening to gallagher demanded classic american funk music i want my radio back on youve been incountry too long youve gone native im going to go medieval if you dont turn that crap off he threatened sorry brother replied harvath this is an intervention its for your own good after we work on your musical taste were going to cowboy you up in the reading department five songs and a litany of curses from gallagher later they arrived at the care hospital on darulaman road it was fronted by blast barriers and an eightfoothigh stone wall that ran the length of the road unauthorized vehicles were not allowed inside the main gate so harvath and gallagher parked near the perimeter wall they were given a cursory patdown by a male guard who failed to notice that both men were carrying pistols and were waved inside harvath could only hope that the mans sole job was to discourage suicide bombers if it entailed anything else care had some big problems on its hands the hospital was a narrow whitewashed twostory building with singlestory wings sprouting off it the grounds were typical third worldhardpacked brown earth with little to no vegetation the only hint of color came from the occasional woman who decided to wear a blue burka rather than the everpopular black cultural sensitivity be damned it was a practice harvath found demeaning to muslim women walking around with a bag over your head was walking around with a bag over your head it made no difference how apologists for islam tried to bullshit it as liberating and empowering for women no matter where he encountered them they reminded him of aliens that had just climbed off a spaceship from some strange planet far far away he and gallagher walked up the drive to the main entrance and stepped inside though there were some women right behind them harvath knew the laws of polite western society didnt always translate well in muslim nations his instinct was to hold the door for them but doing so would not only have confused them it could have drawn the ire of any of the men they were most likely traveling with while he thought it was stupid and didnt like acting that way harvath knew it was often best to pretend the women werent there at all in the corner of the lobby was a registration desk harvath greeted the young man sitting behind it and gave him the name of the doctor he had come to see the man picked up his phone and as he dialed handed harvath a pen and asked him to sign the log book with gallagher standing next to him harvath printed the names samuel colt and jack e collins though he couldnt be sure he thought he heard gallagher sling the f word at him under his breath after hanging up the phone the young man pointed to the waiting area and said please five minutes tashakor harvath replied he and gallagher grabbed seats along the wall and sat down the waiting area was packed especially for a saturday best medical care in afghanistan said gallagher lots of volunteer docs from the west this is a firstrate hospital harvath looked around everything was clean and there was a faint odor of antiseptic it was better than most of the hellhole medical centers hed seen across the third world even so it still wasnt someplace hed want to have to undergo a procedure the waiting area was filled with families all of their women were shrouded in burkas so the only adult faces he could see belonged to the men afghanistan was a hard place to live and that was reflected in their countenances they looked drawn and haggard their faces as weatherbeaten and craggy as the jagged mountains that surrounded their country dark solemn eyes stared off in different directions the only vitality in the room came from the children who were running and laughing sitting near harvath and gallagher was a family of adults who did not speak an older man peeled an orange and silently offered slices to the other men sitting near him harvath couldnt tell if they were waiting to go in or waiting for someone to come out his question was soon answered when a young afghan doctor in a white lab coat entered the waiting area and asked the man at the reception desk a question the man leaned forward and pointed in harvaths direction harvath gave gallagher a jab with his elbow and nodded at the approaching doctor while he wasnt the american medical director they had come to see harvath assumed the young doctor had been sent to collect them as he neared harvath began to stand but then noticed the doctors eyes were not on him but on the family sitting next to them easing himself back into his chair harvath watched him he could tell by the young mans face and his body language that he wasnt bringing good news when the family saw the doctor the men quietly rose their faces masks of apprehension as the young afghan spoke to them in pashtu baba g translated as best he could the patienta womanhad died several of the men seemed to have expected this one of the men though became angry as the doctor tried to calm him down gallagher told harvath that he was the womans husband the doctor explained that the hospital had done everything it could for her but that she had arrived with injuries that were beyond treatable gallagher translated the words comfortable and no pain despite the doctors reassurances the husband flew into a rage everything in the waiting room came to a complete stop as the husband raged at the doctor every pair of eyes even those of the staff was watching the commotion unfold the husband was well over six feet tall and quite broadshouldered standing behind him were two more relatives who were equally broad and almost as tall harvaths instincts as well as his secret service training told him that this situation had the potential to go bad very quickly nevertheless it wasnt his problem there was no need for him to get involved to the young doctors credit he kept calm even with the husband right in his face everyone could see though that he was slowly losing control over the situation the highly agitated husbands anger along with the volume of his voice continued to rise someone at the registration desk must have made a phone call because a hospital security guard armed with an ak suddenly appeared approaching calmly the guard politely asked the husband to relax and lower his voice in response the husband shoved him backward harvath was tempted to do something but reminded himself that this wasnt his fight the doctor now had backup and together with the security guard the two of them could take care of themselves he watched as the husband continued screaming at the doctor for letting his wife die showing exceptional restraint the guard once more stepped in and politely asked the husband to calm down this time though the husband did more than just shove in the blink of an eye he had snatched away the guards ak harvath had just become part of this fight launching out of his chair he came in on the edge of the husbands peripheral vision he struck hard and fast grabbing the weapon with his left hand he pointed the muzzle in a safe direction while he popped the giant afghan behind his left ear with his right it was a simple yet effective move that completely shortcircuited the afghans brain and dropped him onto the floor harvath spun to engage the two large relatives but discovered that baba g already had it taken care of even though he could have said several things to them in pashtu the look on the marines face was all that was necessary the afghans wisely decided not to tangle with the two americans instead they bent down picked the giant up off the floor and helped carry him out the door when they were gone harvath handed the ak back to the poorly trained security guard the shaken young doctor looked at him and said thank you before turning his attention back to the remaining family members and carrying on with his duties well i think that certainly calls for a red bull baba g joked as he and harvath retook their seats theres a canteen outside and im buying what do you say i think my heart rates high enough said harvath with a laugh thats probably about the last thing i need right now gallagher smiled and put his hand on his friends shoulder you could have really put the boot to that guy and no one in this room would have blamed you harvath imagined the husbands grief and while grabbing the guards weapon had been a stupid thing to do he didnt deserve to have the shit kicked out of him on top of everything else you were right there ready to mix it up harvath said shifting the focus off him im glad to see youve still got it we all think weve still got it replied gallagher the key is in knowing how much is really left he was right one of the secrets of survival in this business was knowing your limitations harvath nodded and as he did an american doctor in his early fifties appeared in the waiting room and began heading in their direction it looks like were up chapter dr kevin boyle medical director for the care kabul hospital was an amiable balding fivefootten general surgeon from omaha nebraska he had been in afghanistan since when the afghan ministry of public health asked care a notforprofit organization dedicated to transforming the lives of sick wounded and disabled children and their families throughout the developing world to take over the former soviet onehundredbed hospital and health clinic after getting the rundown on what had happened in the waiting area boyle thanked harvath and gallagher and then took them on a tour of the facility as they walked he told stories about not having any heat when they started out as well as how badly ravaged the buildings had been from years of war and neglect he pointed out burn marks on the floors in the hallways where the taliban had set up campfires during their siege of kabul harvath asked boyle to detail the training their doctors received before leaving for afghanistan especially as it related to kidnappings and though it wasnt as thorough as harvath would have liked it was considerably more than most organizations offered their staff if julia gallo could remember to do what she had been taught she had a much better chance of staying alive boyle led them up a flight of stairs past a seated afghan security guard and through an iron gate to the main buildings second floor here he explained were all of the hospitals administrative offices and lecture rooms in the middle of the corridor was a door marked surgeons which he unlocked and held open for his guests the surgeons office was a large square room with windows on the far side that looked out toward the main gate and the old soviet military base across the road there was a metal desk in each corner with extra chairs in front only two of the desks had computers stuffed bookcases and mismatched file cabinets lined the perimeter of the room there was a small door that led to a private bathroom upon it was a single hook overloaded with white coats boyle introduced the only other person in the room an afghan surgeon named dr hamid who was busy at one of the computers after shaking hands boyle led his guests to a couple of chairs in front of a desk on the other side of the room he disappeared into the bathroom and returned with three clean coffee cups which he filled with hot water from a dispenser next to one of the file cabinets dropping a tea bag into each one he then set the mugs down on the desk pulled up a chair and said thank you again for what you did downstairs harvath was about to respond when the young afghan doctor from the waiting room entered with a thick stack of folders tucked beneath his arm boyle waved him over and introduced him as dr atash one of their family medicine residents he still looked shaken by what had happened he shook hands with harvath and gallagher then excused himself to discuss his charts with dr hamid when atash had walked away gallagher turned to dr boyle and said you should think about hiring additional security next time you may not be so lucky true he replied but unfortunately we need a new ultrasound machine more than we need additional security but thats not important were here to talk about dr gallo we are said harvath and as mrs gallo explained to you in her email mr gallagher and i have been brought in to help secure julias release well the hospital is ready to help in any way we can thats good so let me ask you when dr gallo came to work here did you know who she was or more important who her mother was i did julias mother is friendly with one of our board members but she wanted to be treated like every other doctor we have not like the daughter of stephanie gallo in other words no special treatment dr boyle nodded as he took his tea bag out of his cup and dropped it in the wastebasket she also didnt like talking about her mother or her family much she was real tightlipped about it but did people know who she was asked harvath as he tossed his tea bag too if youll pardon the graveyard humor doctors like to say that the only way three people in a hospital can keep a secret is if two of them are dead and the other is in a coma harvath had read copies of all the reports dealing with julia gallos kidnapping he knew that all of her colleagues at the hospital had been thoroughly questioned unfortunately hospitals werent the only places with thriving gossip mills so were expat communities add in the fact that gossiping was the afghan national pastime and julia gallo was all but guaranteed to have caught the attention of the taliban it was just a matter of time she didnt trade on the family name continued boyle that was for sure she didnt need to she was a damn good doctor and really cared about the afghans she treated maybe even cared too much what do you mean by too much asked harvath boyle showed him an official reprimand that had been placed in julias file proselytizing whether it was religious or political was strictly against cares rules especially in afghanistan they expected their doctors to lead by example not by persuasion the medical director detailed their rural medicine program and how julia had jumped at the chance to travel to remote villages outside kabul it was dangerous work made even more so by allegations that she was encouraging women to do things like go to school report abusive husbands and fathers and refuse to enter into forced marriages looking back boyle realized he should have forbidden her from making any more trips outside the hospital but because of her familys vip standing within the organization he had looked the other way instead he had written up the reprimand provided julia with a copy and put the original in her file he had hoped it would show her how serious what she was doing was but it didnt seem to have worked kevin boyle was a good person and harvath could see that he believed in what he was doing for the people of afghanistan and he cared very much for his staff he felt guilty about what had happened to julia gallo but what he didnt know was that her kidnapping had nothing to do with what she was encouraging the women of afghanistan to do it had everything to do with her mother and her mothers close ties with the new president of the united states if the taliban hadnt been able to snatch her in the countryside they might have eventually come to the hospital to grab her and if that had happened harvath knew that it would have been much worse than what had transpired in the waiting room that morning he asked boyle to fill in several blanks from the reports hed read about the kidnapping and then asked a few additional questions about hospital security gallagher also asked one or two of his own when they were finished the men stood and shook hands as if it was an afterthought harvath said i heard youre a navy man i am replied boyle with a smile theyre the ones who sent me to medical school how about you i was in the teams the medical director was impressed well i can understand why mrs gallo wanted you on board if i had known there was another navy man in kabul i wouldnt have had to bring a marine on the team harvath said pointing his thumb over his shoulder at gallagher who rolled his eyes removing his afghan cell phone and opening up the address book harvath added if i need to call you where can i get hold of you the medical director dictated a number he said was good day or night and harvath entered it into his phone boyle accompanied the men to the bottom of the stairs where they all shook hands one more time and after harvath assured the surgeon they could find their own way out said goodbye despite having seen most of the small hospital on their tour harvath wanted to poke around a little bit more before they left he was particularly interested in locating the mechanical room and any other belowgrade facilities as they looked around he took a mental inventory of everything he saw a half hour later they were nearing the double doors that led into the waiting area when a voice from down the hallway called for them to stop the men turned to see dr atash jogging in their direction i need to speak to you please he said slightly out of breath if this is about what happened earlier replied harvath as the young doctor drew closer its okay you dont need to say anything no this is about something that happened in nangarhar nangarhar yes he said at the nangarhar hospital in jalalabad as jalalabad was home to the other iss compound and had been his stomping ground the majority of time hed been in afghanistan gallagher was interested immediately what happened he asked i had been working there for the last month as part of my residency program i was taking care of a boy a teenager actually who had been struck in a fight his jaw was fractured as i came into the exam room i overheard his father talking with him in pashtu about a woman an american who had been kidnapped were they from jalalabad which neighborhood asked gallagher dr atash shook his head no they were from a village in khogyani did they mention her by name did you overhear a description or anything that could prove they were talking about dr gallo asked harvath no they didnt did you tell anybody about this atash shook his head once more why not why keep this to yourself i assumed it was another aid worker these things happen all the time the organization they work for pays the ransom and the worker is returned its not my job to get involved in these things i could put the entire hospital at risk so why are you telling us i apologize for not saying something upstairs but it wasnt until i finished reviewing my charts with dr hamid that he told me who you were he didnt know that i hadnt heard about the kidnapping did you know dr gallo not well she taught obstetrics here to my class but shes my colleague and i want to help her besides im also pashtun and its my duty to repay you for what you did for me this morning ten minutes later harvath and baba g walked out of the care hospital and headed for the main gates how do you want to play this asked gallagher should we get the military involved we dont even know if dr gallo is being held in that village if we can roll up this elam badar and his son asadoulah it might not matter get to them and we may just get to julia gallo we could also end up spooking whoever has her thats a possibility but at the very least responded gallagher somebody has got to get eyes on that village i agree said harvath i think we ought to take a drive to gallagher cut harvath off as he pulled his vibrating cell phone out of his pocket and looking at the caller id said its rashid baba g raised the phone to his ear and listened after a short conversation he flipped it shut looking at harvath he said weve got bad news what is it rashid just heard from his cousins the afghans are going to move khan again they say that if were going to grab him we have to do it tonight they want to meet with us in half an hour chapter gallagher made the drive from the care hospital to kabuls famed chicken street in just under twenty minutes as it was one of the citys most popular shopping districts it wasnt unusual to see foreigners walking up and down the street and as it was only a block away from the headquarters of the afghan national police it also wasnt unusual to see highranking anp and even nds officials doing their shopping here it was therefore an excellent location to hold a clandestine meeting the small shops of chicken streets rug merchants sat cheek by jowl with antique dealers and jewelry shops anything could be had on chicken street from traditional afghan carpets vintage rifles and ivoryhandled knives to gold necklaces silver earrings or bracelets studded with one of afghanistans most prized gemstones the intensely blue lapis lazuli gallagher parked a block away and paid a group of street kids who materialized out of nowhere a buck apiece to keep an eye on the land cruiser as harvath stepped out of the truck he was accosted by a new group of children who shouted mister mister im your bodyguard okay gallagher had warned him about this as well as the burkaclad women who trolled chicken street with phony prescriptions begging naïve westerners to give them money to buy medicine for their sick children kids who begged to be bodyguards were harmless in his opinion and even respectable as they were actually willing to work for their money but the women with the bogus prescriptions were simply scam artists harvath looked at the bright faces of all the kids gathered around him yak dollar mister only yak dollar they said yak being the dari word for one okay yak dollar harvath relented and the children all cheered the gaggle of boys tagged along until they reached a nondescript rug shop where harvath gave them each a dollar and the shops owner shooed them away after the kids had disappeared the owner showed the two americans into the back of his shop where he pulled a trap door down from the ceiling and extended an aging wooden staircase that led to the second floor the men mounted the narrow steps single file and emerged in a warehouse space that smelled faintly of tobacco and damp carpets sitting on a large rug at the opposite end were inspector rashid and his two cousins marjan and pamir in the middle was a pot of tea judging from the steam coming from their cups it appeared to be afghan and not american the shop owner retreated to the first floor telescoped the stairs back into their hiding place and closed the trap door to give the men their privacy after conducting the customary greetings the three afghans invited their american counterparts to sit down and take tea harvath wanted to get straight to business but he knew you never said no to tea so he sat down and accepted a cup fortunately the afghans were in no mood for chitchat once the tea was poured they got right to the point marjan was the first to speak our president is so determined that mustafa khan stand trial for his crimes that he wants to watch over him personally what do you mean personally asked harvath he is going to have khan moved to the presidential palace where are they going to put him in a guest room marjan shook his head of course not there are two cells beneath the palace when are they going to move him as early as tomorrow replied pamir which is why interjected rashid we must do this tonight they were right grabbing khan at the old soviet base made more sense than trying to launch an assault on the presidential palace but they still didnt have everything they needed what about a map of the tunnels asked harvath pamir reached into a small shoulder bag that was sitting on the floor behind him and pulled out a mediumsized tube right here harvath looked at marjan you can sketch the base layout as well as the interrogation facility the nds operative nodded then the only thing were missing harvath began to say but his voice trailed off as inspector rashid stood and disappeared behind a pile of carpets he returned carrying a watertight highdensity plastic storm case and said are the munitions gallagher looked at harvath and smiled i told you he was good i never doubted it for a second lied harvath the room was warm and he removed his jacket and set it on the floor behind him rolling up his sleeves he looked at the afghans as rashid retook his seat and said now we need a plan they spent the next six hours evaluating their objective and assessing their options the shopkeeper downstairs kept the tea coming and sent his son out twice for food one of the biggest things bothering harvath about the operation was the satellite imagery hed seen according to marjan the afghans had reconstructed several of the base buildings to use as barracks the nds operatives assurance that the barracks were only used when training exercises were being conducted did little to stem harvaths concern especially considering that the interrogation facility was located beneath one of them not knowing how many afghan special forces soldiers were guarding khan was one thing but they also had no way of gauging how many soldiers would be in the barracks above or how many would be on the base in general the fact that his team could easily be outnumbered and overwhelmed weighed heavily on harvaths mind as did the fact that if that happened there would be no cavalry he could call for help he and gallagher drilled rashid pamir and marjan relentlessly looking at his watch harvath decided they all needed a break there were only a couple of hours of daylight left and he wanted to drive the perimeter of the base as well as visit the ruins of the old palace at the end of darulaman road to see what kind of vantage point it might provide the men agreed to reassemble at midnight and harvath warned them all one last time not to talk to anyone especially rashid who had repeatedly offered to reach out to a few more contacts to see if he could nail down the exact troop strength at the base it was more important that they maintain the element of surprise besides based on harvaths plan it didnt matter if the afghans had five men there or five hundred either it was going to work or it wasnt harvath wrapped the storm case in a plastic garbage bag and waited while gallagher brought the land cruiser around once it was loaded the two americans drove down chicken street and headed for the darulaman road baba g was uncharacteristically silent you can still back out said harvath what makes you think i want to back out nothing im just saying i dont like rush jobs harvath nodded nobody does but when the window of opportunity opens you move or it closes we can still bring fontaine with us harvath understood gallaghers apprehension and the idea of bringing someone as qualified as the canadian was tempting though he and baba g had both the right kind of training and the experience for an operation like this pamir and marjan were a different story at best the two afghans were window dressing if the fit hit the shan there was no way of knowing how theyd react having fontaine along would dramatically improve their odds but he had the potential to be a political liability harvath couldnt allow the president or the united states to be implicated in what he was going to do were not taking him he finally said gallagher understood and changed the subject so youre sure boyle will let us stage at the hospital it depends on how much he trusts us this whole thing could end up being a big problem for him if we spring khan and the afghans figure out he helped itll be very bad for him and the hospital we have to do it in a way that provides cover for him and how do we do that im still working that one out said harvath well youd better hurry up replied baba g without boyles cooperation theres absolutely no way this thing is going to work chapter east hampton new york elise campbell and rita klees were leaning against the detectives mini cooper finishing their starbucks coffees as christine de palma pulled into the gravel parking lot of the cobblestone nursery at am on the dot thank you for meeting us this morning said rita as de palma climbed out of her mercedes suv and came over to greet them she was an attractive petite woman in her late forties her mediumlength brown hair was pulled back in a bun and her face bore only a hint of makeup she wore a green barbour jacket a gray cashmere sweater tan jodhpurs and a pair of green wellington boots of course you said this had to do with sheryl and charlies accident it does replied klees as she introduced elise id like you to meet elise campbell of the united states secret service campbell stepped forward and the two women shook hands is it okay if we speak inside certainly replied de palma follow me pulling a large brass ring from her pocket de palma found the correct key slid it into the lock and opened the front door she flipped on the lights and deactivated the alarm the room was cold and smelled of damp earth after locking the front door behind them she led the women through another door and across a small landscaped court to a vintage greenhouse inside the temperature was much more agreeable the air smelled of flowers and other fresh greenery de palma flipped a series of switches and somewhere a fountain began to bubble in the center of the greenhouse was a castiron table with matching chairs de palma pulled one out and motioned for the ladies to sit the greenhouse beats meeting in my cramped office any day of the week mine too replied klees so what can i do for you first of all stated elise i want you to know that this is all completely off the record and has nothing to do with the east hampton police department i asked rita if she knew you and she offered to introduce us okay said de palma drawing the word out as sheryl colemans business partner elise continued you could have had grounds to bring a wrongful death claim why didnt you de palma was a bit taken aback am i suspected of having done something campbell smiled and shook her head no not at all im just curious what does this have to do with sheryl and charlies death mr colemans parents began a civil action but then dropped it supposedly there was some sort of settlement there was nothing supposed about it replied de palma stephanie gallo had been trying to get them to drop that suit from day one but charlies father wouldnt quit he hated alden and he said no amount of money in the world could get him to back down he told you that de palma nodded he probably shouldnt have but were like family even more so after charlie and sheryl and the kids were killed so what happened to change their minds apparently they had just gotten through the first set of questions they wanted the defendants to answer interrogatories asked elise thats right she replied gallo and aldens attorneys kept trying to outmaneuver the colemans with continuances and that kind of garbage and i think herb and janet realized just how many years they could be in court over it the suit definitely wasnt going to keep alden from getting elected which is something i think herb secretly wanted finally gallo made the colemans an offer they couldnt refuse may i ask how much that i dont know all i know is that they had turned down multiple offers from gallo up to that point according to herb she handed them a blank check and told them to fill in any amount they wanted seriously de palma nodded how about you were you ever offered a settlement i dont think i was ever even a lawsuit contender in anyones eyes when sheryl was killed along with charlie and the kids i inherited her full share of the business i didnt have a reason to sue so stephanie gallo never approached you you never heard from any of her people no why are you trying to tell me i should sue campbell put up her hands no not at all thats not why im here then im confused why are you here it was a good question and one elise had spent the night on rita klees pullout sofa bed trying to find an answer to what if there is more to this story than any of us know like what what if someone that night did do something that led to the accident de palma placed her elbows on the table and leaned forward agent campbell do you have any evidence to support that elise took a deep breath and blew it out im not sure youre not sure now im really confused why are you even talking to me why arent the east hampton police following this up its complicated offered rita de palma looked at her were not only talking about the death of my business partner were also talking about the death of my best friend those children were my godchildren we were family so if you know something i want to hear it klees took her time and explained the limitations of pursuing a criminal investigation exactly as she had for elise the night before so if there is some sort of evidence from that night thats being suppressed stated de palma im the only one who can bring a civil suit to punish the person or persons responsible if there is such evidence said campbell then thats correct christine de palma sat back in her chair and was silent for several moments i always thought gallo offered charlies parents the money to avoid the embarrassment of a trial i never took it as an admission of guilt we dont really know what her motivation was cautioned elise but you believe theres something more to what happened that night or you wouldnt have come all the way out here to talk to me thats correct so what exactly do you think happened i think someone made a very big mistake and has tried to cover it up but to find out who it was and how big a mistake they made i need your help this could be all smoke and no fire though you want me to go through all the hassles and the risks of mounting a lawsuit against not only stephanie gallo but also the president of the united states just because you have a suspicion that something may have happened elise shook her head you dont have to mount anything all i need to do is to say that youre considering a lawsuit thats all thats all if my suspicion is wrong youre not out anything but if im right you get your friends and your godchildren the kind of justice they deserve for several moments there was only the sound of the fountain finally de palma spoke tell me what you need me to do chapter afghanistan sergei simonov didnt take any pleasure in having to kill elam badar but he wouldnt lose sleep over it either the afghan peasant had picked a fight with the wrong man his veiled threats to the shura of mullah massouds village had earned him an early ticket to paradise massoud had debated taking out the son asadoulah as well but the russian had advised against it killing two people at the same time and making it look like an accident was very difficult unless they were a bombmaking team once massoud had acquiesced the russian discussed the best way to handle the situation they agreed that the sooner the problem was taken care of the better and though it posed considerable risk they further agreed that it should happen in broad daylight or as much daylight as possible which would make it very hard for people to believe that what had transpired was anything but a tragic accident the winding footpath the russian now hid near was just as massoud had described it in all his years among the afghans their intimate knowledge of the terrain never ceased to amaze him the bleating of the injured sheep on the rocky ledge below had continued unabated for nearly a half hour while he waited simonov pictured his son sasha in his minds eye soon they would not only be together inseparable but he would have the money to care for him properly he would be able to afford the best surgeons not just those idiots the state hospitals had provided in russia he could take sasha anywhere in the world for treatment america even he would spare no expense and would go to any lengths to help his boy regain as much of a normal life as possible they only had each other and needed to stick together together anything was possible together he would prove to his boy how much he loved him and how sorry he was for what had happened to him as the bleating of the sheep started to deaden simonovs hearing he suddenly noticed another sound the sound of feet shambling up the rocky path he began to slow his breathing the moment was almost here elam badar was close enough to hear the bleating of his animal now and his pace quickened simonov marveled at how the world worked both he and the afghan had been drawn to this moment by the same thinga deep and abiding love of their sons as well as a misfortune that needed to be set right the russian ignored the fact that he had the benefit of surprise strength and experience on his side and instead believed that he would succeed in killing elam badar simply because he loved his son more they were championing two separate causes and in simonovs mind his was more worthy when elam badar appeared on the path and peered over the jagged outcropping for his injured sheep the blueeyed russian took a final breath and sprang from behind the rocks at the sound of movement the afghan spun but it was too late simonov was already on him elam badar should never have underestimated mullah massoud to the broken neck the russian added a very badly broken arm and then rolled the body off the path and watched as it landed with a thud only feet from the wounded animal his job complete simonov stepped back and disappeared into the landscape but as he retraced his steps back up and over the top of the mountain his heart rate quickened as he suddenly realized he was being followed chapter two hours later when the door was kicked open dr julia gallo was caught in a significant state of undress the outside temperature that afternoon had been quite mild which meant that inside the small poorly ventilated mud brick room where she was being kept the temperature had been stifling she had been lying on the floor trying to stay cool while staring out the small hole in the base of the wall she wore only a damp tshirt and trousers both of which clung provocatively to her body and her long red hair hung loose about her shoulders her overseer had returned the mentally challenged man had not been there that morning to feed her in fact no one had come by her cell at all that day and she had been battling a terrible fear that she had been forgotten or worse still purposely left to die julia was ravenous and as the man set the tray down she noticed that there was more food on it than usual whether it was an attempt to make up for his tardiness or an additional apology like the candies he had given her yesterday she could not say she also didnt much care whoever these people were they were not feeding her enough a meal this size as paltry as it still was was the least they should have been feeding a prisoner she had no idea how much weight she had lost since sayed had been murdered and she had been taken into captivity but she had to imagine it was significant and she hadnt had that much extra weight to lose to begin with julia collected her clothes and quickly dressed affixing her hijab she looked down and noticed her guards new basketball shoes were gone and in their place he wore a pair of battered boots too big for his feet when she looked up she saw that his eyes were red and puffy something had happened to him and intuitively she knew it had to do with the boys who had come to rape her the day before pointing at his feet she spoke quietly the pashtu word for shoes botaan the mans eyes welled with tears and he rubbed his sleeve across his face to try to hold them back he began stammering and gesturing at his feet julia couldnt understand what he was saying but it sounded like his shoes were gone and that it had something to do with his brother he had been very attached to his shoes and she found it horrible that his own brother would take them away the taliban were absolute bastards stealing from a mentally challenged man was reprehensible but if alqaeda had no problem using the intellectually disabled as suicide bombers then she shouldnt find it difficult to believe that the taliban would prey on them as well her body was desperate for nourishment but gallo poured some tea and held the metal cup out to her guard he didnt know what to do his captive was offering him tea having been steeped in the pashtunwali his entire life he understood that he was obliged to accept and so took the cup sta noom tse dai asked julia what is your name he drank the warm tea in one long swallow and wiped his lips with the back of his hand zema num zwak dai he replied his sadness over his shoes temporarily forgotten zwaks broad face broke into a wide smile whether it was his size his beard or the pointy sweatshirt hood he always wore the man reminded julia of a gnome zema num she began but zwak interrupted her doktar he said proudly julia smiled back at him he had heard and understood her yesterday hoo she replied doktar julia doktar doktar zwak repeated even prouder of himself they were communicating that was good if she could bond with him maybe she could convince him to let her go she had learned a long time ago that the fastest way to build a bond with someone was to ask them to do you a favor sarraoh nan shpa tonight cold she attempted in her broken pashtu sheta brresten lutfan do you have any blanket please doktar doktar zwak repeated soor wextu julia smiled and nodded hoo soor wextu yes red hair sheta brresten any blankets she asked once more zwak looked at the blanket on julias bed and then back at her then without another word he set down the metal cup and walked out of the room slamming and locking the door behind him he was a strange little man she wondered if she had offended him resigning herself to the fact that there was nothing she could do about it now she sat down on her bed tore off a piece of nan bread and used it to scoop food into her mouth she poured more tea and savored the rest of her food when she was finished she discovered that zwak had hidden two more pieces of dashlama just like the candies he had given her yesterday under her plate julia put one in her mouth and tried to enjoy it stay positive she repeated to herself but it was so hard she wasnt living day to day she wasnt even living hour to hour it was minute by minute and she was slowly losing her mind as well as her will to live she chastised herself for being so weak she needed to snap out of it she had to focus on something worthwhile that she could live for she searched herself but couldnt come up with much the one significant person in her life was her mother and their relationship wasnt exactly storybook material julia had spent a good part of her adulthood trying to find her own sliver of sunshine beyond the mammoth shadow her mother cast it was that search that had brought her to afghanistan and ultimately to the cell in which she now sat if the taliban killed her today she felt she wouldnt have left much of a mark on the world a voice deep inside told her she was being too hard on herself but she refused to listen to it she didnt want to be told she was a good person and that her life had value she had gotten sayed killed and who knew how many other afghan women who had been naïve enough to follow her political advice had been brutalized or killed because of it rise up take control of your lives embrace your rights she had told them it was all easy enough for an american woman to say especially one who could go home to her first world country any time she wanted what an idiot i have been gallo thought as she broke down the tears were flowing down her face when the door to her cell was kicked open it took her by surprise as it always did and her heart leaped into her throat looking up she expected to see zwak but instead she saw several of the men who had killed sayed they moved quickly two of them jerked her up off the bed while a third approached with a light blue burka and other items once her wrists were bound her eyes blindfolded and the burka had been pulled down over her head she was shoved outside she heard several vehicles come to a skidding halt only feet away and she was thrown roughly inside the nearest one as it lurched away she could feel the presence of another person near her as he began to cry she knew in an instant that it was zwak and that wherever they were taking her it was so they could kill her chapter kabul harvath knew enough about surgeons to know they werent night owls and that went double for missionary doctors he also knew that the best time to get someone to do what you wanted was when they were running for the fence in the case of dr kevin boyle his fence was sleep and harvath waited until just after ten oclock at night to call him he had come to the conclusion that the less boyle knew about what was going on the better he dialed the number the medical director had given him and woke the man out of a sound sleep having seen the call schedule while they were walking through the hospital harvath knew the resident on duty that night was none other than dr atash explaining that he was leaving to follow up a lead in kandahar province in the morning and needed to speak with atash once more before he left harvath asked boyle to call the security team at the hospital and clear him and baba g as well as their vehicle through the main gate boyle grumbled his assent and hung up the phone without saying goodbye or asking if harvath needed anything else he doubted boyle would bother to try to track down atash and tell him to expect visitors even if he had it wouldnt have been a problem harvath didnt say when he would be at the hospital based upon how exhausted the surgeon sounded he was pretty confident that hed fall back asleep within sixty seconds of placing the call to the guards at the front gate from their reconnaissance of the old soviet military base harvath and gallagher had identified two alternative evacuation points where they would station flower and inspector rashid in two different vehicles tom hoyt would monitor the operation from the ops center back at the compound and just to make sure he wouldnt be disturbed mei and her girlfriends had taken fontaine and mark midland out drinking and dancing courtesy of a stack of bills harvath had slipped her everything so far was right on track as the main threat to the care hospital was a suicide bomber or an active shooter who tried to walk or drive onto the property the primary security focus was the front of the property along darulaman road the rear while secured by a high gated fence wasnt patrolled as heavily and even less so at night electricity was not only expensive but also unreliable so the rear of the property wasnt even lit this was where harvath had decided marjan and pamir would enter when it was time for the operation to begin flower led the way in the land cruiser while harvath and gallagher brought up the rear in a van purchased specifically for the job three blocks later flower slowed down as inspector rashid pulled out from a side street and took the lead his job was to navigate them around any checkpoints and make sure harvath and gallagher arrived at the hospital without being stopped when they reached the darulaman road and could see that traffic was moving without any impediments harvath grabbed his cooler bag from behind his seat and pulled out another red bull you want one he asked baba g you got any beer in there sure you want it in a bottle or draft forget it said gallagher as he reached behind his seat and withdrew a bottle of water unscrewing the cap he took a long sip and then put the bottle back when this is all over ill buy you as much beer as you can drink i want that in writing baba g might have worn an outward air of confidence and nonchalance but underneath he was obsessively cautious he had not only triplechecked all of their gear he had quadruplechecked it and had made harvath run through the plan so many more times than was necessary that hoyt eventually turned on the television back at the iss compound to drown him out harvath reminded himself of how gallagher had performed in the hospital waiting area that morning and the way hed been in the marines the man had excellent instincts hed have harvaths back the ones he really needed to worry about were marjan and pamir the nds operatives appeared professional enough but there was no telling how they would act under pressure even though they were going in as a fourman team harvath had designed the entire assault around him and gallagher doing all of the heavy lifting as they neared the care international hospital gallagher slowed applied his blinker and slapped his warmest american grin to his face as he turned into the main drive harvath handed over his id which gallagher added to his own as he rolled down the window a bored sentry with an ak slung casually around his neck stepped out of the heated guard shack checked their ids then opened the gate and waved them through they drove the van to the main entrance and parked with its sliding door on the drivers side the guard down at the gate couldnt have seen what harvath and gallagher were doing without walking all the way up to the hospital after a quick check inside to make sure the coast was clear the two men unloaded their gear onto a small hand truck and pushed it inside entering the building harvaths afghan cell phone began to vibrate removing it from his pocket he read the text message out loud to gallagher flower just handed off the money to rashid which means we ought to be seeing marjan and pamir momentarily harvath nodded as he slipped the phone back into his pocket and continued unlike american hospitals the care hospital was very poorly staffed at night in addition to dr atash harvath doubted there were more than two other employees in the building both of them western nurses who were probably either off sleeping or surfing the net in the nurses lounge the men came to a stop before a doorway marked no admittance in english dari and pashtu which led to the hospitals mechanical room harvath and gallagher had discovered it on the unguided portion of their tour earlier and now opened the door and pushed the hand truck inside as gallagher unloaded the gear and moved it down the two flights of stairs to the mechanical room harvath took off his coat grabbed his empty backpack out of one of the containers they had brought in and stepped back out into the hallway after rechecking to make sure no one was about he headed for the operating theater and a small door off to the side that led to the surgeons changing room inside he scrounged four white lab coats he donned one himself then put the others in his pack the theater was composed of three small operating rooms around a central hub where the surgeons scrubbed in in operating room b harvath found a small gurney with a folded blanket atop it he wheeled it back into the locker room and left it near the door slinging his pack he stepped into the hallway and walked to the exit door at the very end when he opened it marjan and pamir were already waiting for him he handed each of them a lab coat and once they had put them on they followed him they retrieved the stretcher from the surgeons locker room and navigated it back down the hallway to the stairwell where he had left gallagher after helping move the rest of the gear down into the mechanical room pamir began searching for the access point to the tunnel in less than two minutes he had found it harvath had overestimated soviet ingenuity the entrance wasnt hidden behind a false wall or some elaborate blast door but rather was behind an oversized castiron air grate now partially hidden from view by a stack of boxes it was obvious the hospitals engineer had no idea what the grate was for or where it led as marjan and pamir cleared a path to it gallagher began laying out the gear harvath watched as pamir produced a rather crude set of picks and went to work on the old chinese tric padlock on the grate the operative worked quickly and was actually able to get the lock off in a respectable amount of time the only problem was that even with the lock removed the grate refused to budge harvaths first thought was that it had rusted shut he knew how hard cast iron was to cut the proper way to do it was with a plasma torch but he doubted they were going to find that kind of torch in kabul especially in the middle of the night the grate was set in the thick cement wall so somehow working it free wasnt an option either there was the possibility of trying to saw the grate or to blow it out with plastique but making that much noise was out of the question harvath was about out of ideas when he saw pamir place his flashlight in his mouth and insert a dental mirror on an expandable wand between the bars of the grate ten seconds later he held his thumb up in the air and handed the flashlight and mirror to marjan who held them for him as he went to work on the padlock he had found on the other side when pamir had the second and final lock removed he held on to the grate while marjan searched for oil to lubricate the hinges when they were good and soaked pamir slowly pushed the grate in toward the tunnel it moved without making a sound pulling it back toward the mechanical room pamir put it back in place and then he and marjan joined their american counterparts near the gear and began getting ready harvath and baba g struggled with both their boots and their uniforms which were a bit on the small side but would have to do next came armor rashid had provided four sets of chest rig plate carriers used by the afghan special forces along with the plates as an added precaution tom hoyt had lent harvath some point blank brand soft body armor which he wore beneath his uniform gallagher was doing the same with his hung from the chest rigs were numerous pouches loaded down with everything they saw themselves needing baba g then handed out the encrypted motorola radios and bone mics that would allow them to communicate albeit only if necessary and only with each other as the radio signal would not pierce the heavy concrete of the subterranean passage they did a radio check and then gallagher handed marjan and pamir each an ak harvath removed hoyts twelvegauge mossberg shotgun and laid it on the table next to gallaghers both had been outfitted with blackhawk breachersgripstyle pistol grips that cut recoil in half and even allowed for the weapon to be fired onehanded opening the storm case rashid had presented him with above the rug store harvath loaded both weapons and secured six extra rounds of the highly specialized munitions in the sidesaddle of each shotgun after divvying up the rest of the equipment gallagher slipped into the stairwell to exchange final situation reports via text with hoyt back at the iss ops center three minutes later gallagher returned and flashed the thumbsup they were good to go rolling his balaclava down over his face harvath picked up his weapon pulled open the grate and gave his team the signal to move out chapter the tunnel was pitchblack and gallagher only had two pairs of night vision goggles also known as night observation devices or nods as he and harvath were the designated hitters for the operation the night vision devices and their ir illuminators went to them this meant that marjan and pamir would be quite literally left in the dark going through gallaghers gear harvath had found two streamlight sidewinder flashlights and remembered something a buddy of his had been teaching to highend tactical units back in the states for nighttime and lowlight operations the flashlight could be set to emit green light and clipped to an operators belt with the articulating head pointed toward the ground the streamlights would throw out just enough illumination to allow the nds operatives to see where they were going without alerting anyone farther down the tunnel that they were coming the team lined up in a formation known as a stack with harvath in front followed by pamir and marjan and then gallagher in back carrying a small backpack loaded with extra equipment the tunnel was wide enough to drive a jeep through it was constructed entirely of concrete and its walls were covered with peeling paint and faded cyrillic writing harvath hated it tunnels were deathtraps that funneled gunfire and improved the hit rate of even the poorest of shooters there was no cover or concealment anywhere if they got into a firefight down here they were going to be in deep trouble harvath tried not to think about it as he kept a watchful eye for booby traps as well as any monitoring systems that might tip the afghan special forces off that they were coming pamir had assured harvath that very few afghans actually knew of the tunnels much less exactly where they ran and how they connected knowing that the gossiploving afghans had invented viral marketing harvath found that hard to believe nevertheless pamir had insisted that while there were rumors about the tunnels only a handful inside the nds actually knew of them and that was only because the information had been passed to them by their counterparts in soviet intelligence he was very confident that the special forces soldiers guarding mustafa khan hadnt been read in on them to bolster his point pamir pointed to how marjan had worked in the interrogation facility but didnt know anything specific about the tunnels though harvath wouldnt bet the farm on it it wasnt impossible either the nds was highly compartmentalized in fact it was about the only organization in afghanistan that could keep a secret their units didnt even have names just numbers like fifteen or twentysix they were that secretive harvath just hoped that pamir was right if the afghan special forces were watching the tunnels he didnt like their odds of being able to snatch mustafa khan much less get out of this operation alive as per their target the aging interrogation facility was built beneath the old soviet officers quarters based upon the opensource satellite imagery harvath had pulled the distance from the hospital to the officers building was about yards when they were planning everything out it hadnt seemed very far but now that they were underground in the dark and taking pains to watch out for trip wires electronic sensors or anything else the distance felt a lot longer according to pamir the tunnel ended at another mechanical room beyond which was the interrogation facility from what they had been able to gather the base was empty right now except for the special forces soldiers guarding khan active afghan national army units were out doing training exercises in the mountains prepping for the talibans impending annual spring offensive marjan anticipated a squad of eight to fourteen soldiers at the most and knowing what he did about them he didnt expect more than two to be down in the interrogation facility actually watching over khan and the only reason thered be two and not one was that the last thing the afghan president would want was for the alqaeda operative to be able to strike a oneonone deal with one of his guards to help free him from captivity having two men on him at all times would he hoped keep the soldiers honest the rest of the special forces soldiers would be upstairs in the barracks with a couple of men keeping watch outside as the end of the tunnel came into view harvath signaled for everyone to stop gallagher moved up to the front of the column and harvath crept forward to sweep the rest of the tunnel and make sure it was clear their entry point was another castiron air grate just like the one back at the hospital he tried to peer inside the base mechanical room but boxes or crates of some sort on the other side made it impossible to see retracing his steps he came back briefed the others and then had them follow him forward at the grate harvath and gallagher provided cover as marjan and pamir unclipped the streamlights from their belts and went to work first they lubricated the hinges and then pamir worked the locks he got the first one off without difficulty but the second was a problem the crates in the mechanical room were jammed right up against it no matter how hard he tried to jostle the lock he couldnt manipulate it to an angle where he could insert his picks and get it open when harvath moved closer to see what was taking so long pamir showed him night vision goggles were not very good for upclose work so he flipped his up and took a look the crates in the mechanical room were wedged so tightly against the lock no one could get at it flipping up his goggles gallagher came over to examine the situation after harvath gave the crate another firm push gallagher held his hand up and offered to help the only problem was that they had no idea how solidly the crates were stacked with harvath and gallagher both pushing they might succeed in creating enough space for pamir to work in but they might also tip the stack over and sink the entire operation harvath shook his head at gallagher and pantomimed his concern over the crates gallagher pulled his goggles back down stepped back and watched as harvath came up with another idea he had packed very lightly for his trip to afghanistan but one of the things he had brought with him was his favorite fixedblade knife it had been produced by benchmade to commemorate marc lee the first navy seal killed in the iraq war if the terminator carried a knife this would be it it was one of the most radical designs harvath had ever seen and it could take any punishment thrown at it as harvath had done with knives throughout his career he had demonstrated his sense of humor by placing a short piece of tape on the sheath with the words plan b it always gave people a good laugh he removed the knife now and guiding marjan to where he wanted him to hold the streamlight he went to work he slid the blade between two slats of wood on the crate blocking the inside padlock and began to pry them away he rocked the knife back and forth until the slat started to splinter and then finally came free with a sharp crack inside the tunnel the noise sounded as loud as thunder the team froze in place for several minutes as they waited to see if it had drawn any attention to their presence when harvath was confident that it was safe to proceed he pried off two more boards and peered inside the crate which was packed with loose belts of ammunition he worked quickly pulling out belt after belt and stacking them neatly on the floor as soon as hed made a big enough dent he stood back and let pamir tackle the other lock once it was off pamir motioned for harvath to help him together they slowly pulled back on the cast iron the minute it began to groan they stopped marjan appeared with the oil and nodded for them to continue as he applied extra doses to the hinges the groan abated and harvath and pamir opened it the rest of the way now the only thing standing between them and the mechanical room were the crates flipping his goggles back down harvath stood guard as the other men carefully began removing the crates and stacking them in the tunnel it took over twenty minutes before they had cleared enough space to crawl inside when it was ready harvath hoisted his shotgun and reminded marjan and pamir one last time of their numberone rule of engagement the afghan special forces soldiers were not their enemy none of them were to be killed chapter harvath and gallagher entered the mechanical room first it was nearly identical to the one back at the hospital once they had it cleared gallagher signaled for the afghans to join them as gallagher helped them crawl across the crates and made sure they didnt make any noise harvath tracked down the electrical panel power outages were a daily fact of life in afghanistan but harvath doubted the special forces soldiers were equipped with nods plunging them into darkness would give his plan a major advantage marjan was positioned at the electrical panel while harvath gallagher and pamir assembled near the door of the mechanical room harvath flipped up his goggles and gallagher followed suit he allowed his eyes to get accustomed to the green light radiating from pamirs streamlight and then signaled for it to be turned off harvath then cracked the mechanical room door and peered into the hallway as harvaths eyes adjusted still further he saw that straight across from their position exactly as marjan had said it would be there was a heavy metal door that led to the stairwell to the officers barracks that meant that just around the corner and outside his line of sight was the interrogation facility harvath listened for sounds of a sentry or anyone in the stairwell there was nothing he nodded to gallagher who opened his pack and removed a lock and a length of chain counting down from three on his fingers harvath then eased the door the rest of the way open and slipped silently across the hallway with his weapon up and at the ready he entered the stairwell and checked to make sure it was completely empty when he exited gallagher was waiting for him quietly they closed the door and chained it shut harvath did a quick peek around the corner pulling his head back he gave the all clear and then signaled pamir who turned and flashed his streamlight to marjan inside the mechanical room to begin the countdown with the clock ticking down harvath took one more look around the corner and then he and gallagher got moving they crept down the hallway and stopped just before the door to the interrogation facility voices spilled out from inside which was the good news the facility was being used the bad news was that it sounded like much more than two guards taking a deep breath harvath adjusted his weapon and waited behind him gallagher did the same it was only sixty seconds but sitting there exposed in the hall it felt like an eternity all of harvaths senses were on fire his entire body was coiled ready to spring as he let the air out of his lungs marjan threw the switch and the entire basement level went dark flipping down his nods harvath applied pressure to the trigger of his shotgun and spun into the room it was about thirty feet long by fifteen feet wide and along the opposite wall were three cell doors two of which were open four afghan special forces soldiers sat on rugs in the middle of the room chatting as if nothing had happened none of them had even bothered to turn on a flashlight so certain were they that their auxiliary generator would kick in at any moment their weapons sat on the floor next to or in front of them while two more soldiers were sound asleep in the open cells on either side of mustafa khan harvath fired his first round before even fully entering the room the taser xrep which stood for extended range electromuscular projectile was a selfcontained fully functional taser circuit payload housed inside a twelvegauge shotgun shell that could take down targets at up to a hundred yards and had recently been issued to the afghan national army and the afghan national police in order to deal with riots and civil insurrection as the xreps were totally selfcontained they had the benefit of allowing the shooter to engage a separate target with each pull of the trigger but with no wires leading back to the shotgun the suspect could only be given one hit from the projectiles battery once the effect wore off no further electricity could be introduced unless the subject was reengaged with another round this meant the shooter had to act fast the rounds were incredibly quiet and there was only a hushed thump as harvaths first xrep left the barrel of his shotgun and ripped down the length of the room catching his target in the upper chest the mans body stiffened and he roared as the voltage coursed through his body and incapacitated his neuromuscular system entering the room right behind harvath gallagher pulled his trigger and nailed his first target deadon both men then moved to engage their second targets but while harvath caught his soldier square in the center of the chest gallaghers shot went wide suddenly a soldier who had been sleeping on the bunk inside one of the open cells appeared with his ak check the cells harvath yelled gallagher engaged the soldier in the open cell and fired while harvath took out the remaining soldier sitting on the floor gallaghers shot was perfect and the soldiers weapon clattered to the ground as his muscles seized and he fell like a tree trunk but just as suddenly as the first soldier had appeared another sprang from the cell at the far end of the room bobbling a flashlight and his weapon harvath didnt have a good angle but he turned his weapon in the mans direction and pulled the trigger anyway the xrep raced from the barrel of his mossberg only to clank off the cell door as the man let loose with a burst of fire from his barely level rifle as the room erupted in strobes of muzzle flash and a deafening barrage of rifle fire the rounds ricocheted off the concrete walls there was a loud slap when one of them slammed into harvaths back as he dove to the ground it felt as if someone had walked up behind him and cracked him with a heavy metal shovel and while the air hadnt been completely knocked out of his lungs it had come real close rolling onto his side harvath ignored the pain and jacked his final xrep into the chamber he brought his mossberg up to fire but stopped as gallagher who had closed on the soldier bravely stepped around the cell door and fired harvath couldnt tell if it was one of the dumbest or most courageous things he had ever seen and he didnt have time to figure it out even though in general the xreps packed a lot more punch than the conventional pistolstyle taser and subjects tended to remain out of it for a lot longer there were always exceptions where the effect could be shortlived he sucked in a deep breath and pushed himself up off the floor everything still worked which meant he wasnt paralyzed and as best he could tell he wasnt bleedingall good signs gallagher had seen harvath get hit and wanted to check the extent of the damage harvath waved him off they had too much work to do the center cell door was locked up tight and after they had divested the soldiers of their weapons hogtied them with ez cuffs and covered their mouths with duct tape they searched for the keys when harvath found them he opened khans cell despite everything that had just taken place in the room the alqaeda operative sat smugly on the edge of his bed in the dark as if he had expected this all along harvath hated the arrogance of the muslim fanatics and laying eyes on this one in the eerie green of his night vision goggles he immediately despised him stand up and turn around harvath ordered who are you demanded khan the tooth fairy replied harvath as he drew back his hand and struck khan in the face now get up harvath had to yank the man to his feet once he was up harvath spun him around secured his hands behind his back and slapped a piece of duct tape over his mouth gallagher had reloaded both of the shotguns and he handed harvaths to him as he exited the cell guiding khan they moved quickly to the hallway where already they could hear the sound of pounding coming from the other side of the stairwell doorway harvath knew it wouldnt be long before the special forces soldiers retreated upstairs and dropped a grenade down in an effort to blow the door open he didnt want to be anywhere near when that happened once they were all in the mechanical room harvath sent pamir and marjan up and over the crates while gallagher used his second chain to secure the door when that was done he scrambled over the crates and waited on the other side to assist khan after harvath climbed into the tunnel and snapped the locks shut behind him he could see pamir and marjan standing in the green glow of their streamlights reassuming control of the prisoner he told gallagher to take point and for marjan and pamir to follow harvath and khan would bring up the rear are you okay gallagher asked ill be okay replied harvath go gallagher nodded and as he and the nds operatives disappeared into the darkness harvath nudged khan forward the man refused to move harvaths back was throbbing and he was in no mood to play around with this asshole he slid his arm underneath khans grabbed his trapezius muscle in a vise grip and lifted up on khans arms pain shot through the terrorists body and he stutterstepped forward to get away from it reluctantly he began walking the hardest part of harvaths assignment was almost complete he had khan now all he had to do was get him someplace safe and then coordinate the exchange for julia gallo his injury notwithstanding he should have felt much better than he did but having laid eyes on khan harvath knew that he wouldnt be able to trade him for julia gallo he couldnt let an animal like this just return to terrorism he was going to have to come up with another way and that meant this thing wasnt over not by a long shot chapter harvath peeled off his soft armor and dropped it to the bathroom floor pulling up his tshirt he turned and looked into the mirror at the softballsized bruise growing on his lower back the ricochet had missed his plate entirely and had slammed right into his soft armor though the bullet had been flattened out and its impact had been somewhat blunted from having skipped off the wall his injury still hurt like hell opening up gallaghers med kit he fished out a onethousandmilligram horsepillsized motrin affectionately referred to by seals as vitamin m and chased it down with a long swig from the can of red bull hed brought into the bathroom with him transporting khan from the hospital to the safe house gallagher had arranged for them had gone exactly as they had planned after donning their white doctors coats they wrapped the terrorists head with gauze strapped him to the gurney threw the blanket over him and wheeled him right out the front doors to their van pamir and marjan had followed pushing the hand truck loaded down with all the gear after helping load khan and the equipment into the back of the van they had left the grounds the same way they had come in the hospital had remained quiet the entire time never once did they see another soul the safe house was in kabuls shahre naw districthome to many of afghanistans opium kingpins and corrupt politicians the neighborhood was full of newly constructed mansions impressive even by american standards many of shahre naws dubious landowners had built more than one residence and made sizable not to mention quasilegitimate flows of income by renting out their additional homes to westerners it was exactly such a property that gallagher had secured for them taking khan back to isss kabul compound was out of the question not only was it not set up to hold a prisoner there were too many people who would ask too many questions here nobody asked any questions and the neighbors kept to themselves even better the cops had been paid off by the opium lords to stay out of the neighborhood and anyone who could afford to live here had private security which meant it wasnt unusual to see men with guns coming and going at all hours of the day and night only four people knew about the safe houseflower harvath hoyt and gallagher inspector rashid had offered to act as an escort on their way back just in case there were any checkpoints but harvath had turned him down instead once they were free of the hospital he had flower sit with rashid and monitor his radio flower knew the route gallagher and harvath were driving and could warn them in time of any potential problems as it was things went off without a hitch harvath and gallagher stashed khan in a cleverly constructed panic room the safe houses owner had constructed in his basement the room was perfect for holding their prisoner there was a hole in the floor that functioned as a turkishstyle toilet there were no windows and the walls and ceilings were solid concrete mustafa khan could make as much noise as he wanted and no one would ever hear him gathering up his gear harvath stepped out of the bathroom and walked down the marblefloored hallway into the living room gallagher was sitting on one of the leather sofas with a bottle of heineken in his hand watching the large plasma tv want one he asked holding it up why not replied harvath as he sat down on the couch gallagher walked into the kitchen and returned with another beer for himself and one for harvath hows your back feeling he asked as he handed over one of the bottles ill live gallagher was silent for a moment listen he finally said about missing my second target harvath stopped him those xreps take some getting used to the important thing is that you popped that last guy before he could get off a second burst gallagher nodded and after a lengthy sip of beer asked so now what it was exactly the question harvath had been wrestling with technically he shouldnt have had any misgivings his assignment was very straightforwardfind mustafa khan and trade him for julia gallo for simply agreeing to undertake the operation harvath had already been paid five hundred thousand dollars bringing julia back alive would net him another five hundred thousand dollars hed be an idiot to screw that up all he had left to do at this point was to conduct the exchange and the assignment would be over the problem though was that harvath had decided not to let khan go the man was a terrorist and thats exactly what he would go back to being there was no reforming these assholes you had to either lock them up or kill them setting khan free was an option harvath was not willing to entertain not when it meant more people who didnt deserve to die would die there was also the possibility that a man with khans background could be behind the next or attacks knowing he had had him and had released him back into the wild if something like that ever happened was not something harvath could live with and the more he thought about it the more he realized he might not have to looking at gallagher he asked how long do you think it will be before word gets out that the afghans have lost khan baba g rolled the bottom of his heineken on the armrest leaving a chain of wet circles i dont know this is going to be pretty embarrassing for the government the afghan president has made a big deal out of how afghanistan is a nation of laws and how he intended to see that khan was put on trial my guess is that theyre going to keep it secret for as long as they can how long until the taliban and alqaeda know hes been snatched with the moles theyve got everywhere id say twentyfour to fortyeight hours tops harvath looked at his watch and calculated the time difference with dc he owed stephanie gallo an updated report he also needed her to do something for him do you think we can get hoyt and mark midland to help babysit he asked gallagher nodded if the price is right putting down his beer harvath pulled out his cell phone good call them and tell them to get over here then he added and i need to have a powwow with fontaine fontaine why because now that the khan part of the operation is over hes going to help us get julia gallo back chapter town tavern washington dc so you want to tell me what were doing here asked max holland as he set his drink down on the table and looked elise campbell in the eye holland a twentyfiveyear veteran secret service operative had short gray hair blue eyes and hands the size of catchers mitts he had been robert aldens lead protective agent during the campaign and had been promoted to head of his detail when alden was elected president at fiftythree he was the oldest agent protecting the presidentsomething his smartass colleagues were more than happy to point out at all hours of the day and night in fact they liked to joke that holland could never stand too near the military officer who carried the nuclear football for fear that his ive fallen and i cant get up life alert necklace might trigger an accidental launch the secret service agent took it all in stride with the flood of young and relatively inexperienced agents that had been transfused into the white house holland was their senior in more ways than one he knew their jokes were only goodnatured ribbing the most important thing was that they respect him and they did while holland would have preferred that the president be surrounded by more experienced agents there had been such a mass exodus after the election he could do nothing more than make sure the people that the president did have were the absolute best that the secret service could provide quietly holland resented the hell out of his colleagues who had taken early retirement rather than serve under president alden as far as he was concerned they were a disgrace to the secret service no matter how much they didnt care for the new potus they should have still been able to carry out their commitment to protecting the person who held the office the exodus had destroyed many friendships and poisoned many more to the point that they were as good as ruined looking across the table holland wondered what personal problem campbell was going to unload on him one of the drawbacks of being the most senior man on the team was that a lot of the agents saw him as a father figure and continually wanted to unburden themselves to him the best reason he always held these meetings at the town tavern in adams morgan was that it was the unofficial home of chicago sports fans in dc and while campbell droned on about her credit card debt boyfriend problems or how she felt her parents didnt really understand her holland a native chicagoan who had been married and divorced twice could keep one eye glued to the cubs game on the tv behind the bar do you remember nikki hale the young agent asked after their food had arrived sort of he said as he took a bite of his bacon cheeseburger why i heard she was pretty out of it the night she died thats what they say replied holland as he held up his empty glass and got a nod from the bartender did you see her that night elise why the sudden interest in nikki hale the great thing about train rides was that they gave you plenty of time to think and elise campbell had done just that as she made her way back from east hampton she understood the path she had chosen and she knew it wasnt going to be easy that was why she had decided to start with holland i think theres more to what went on that night than people know like what like began campbell before she was interrupted by the bartender who set a new draft in front of holland and asked her if she wanted another diet coke declining she turned her attention back to holland like whom shed been partying with before she sped off like maybe the president offered holland as he clamped down once more on his cheeseburger and tore off another bite if they were actually together then yes leave it alone elise why what if the president actually had something to do with what happened that night holland chewed his food slowly and then took a long swallow of his bud light im going to eat my dinner and forget that we ever had this conversation what are you talking about elise why are you so interested in nikki hales death campbell knew from being a cop that when someone answered a question with a question he was usually avoiding telling you something prepared for the fact that her next question could very well end her career with the secret service she took a deep breath and let it fly you were working aldens detail the night nikki hale died i want to know if the president had anything to do with it slowly holland put down his cheeseburger and pushed his plate away picking up his napkin he wiped the grease from his fingers in sixty seconds im standing up and walking out of here why fiftynine seconds he replied as he raised his glass to his mouth and knocked back half of his beer campbell waited for him to put the glass back down and then said youre going to be subpoenaed over what happened what are you talking about theres going to be a new investigation holland couldnt tell if the woman was telling the truth or not how would you know he asked trust me i know holland laughed removed two twenties from his wallet and dropped them on the bar see you around elise put her hand on his arm as he rose from his stool im doing you a favor max she said and then corrected herself actually im doing the secret service a favor a big one but i can only do it if you help me the elder secret service agent closed his eyes pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger and sat back down what is this all about elise its about a new lawsuit against the president for his involvement in hales death who says he had anything to do with it stephanie gallo gallo what are you talking about did she tell you this not directly no holland stared at her for a moment before it hit him jesus elise you overheard the president and gallo talking about something didnt you this isnt about me for the first time tonight youre right it isnt about you its about the secret service and our ability to protect the president how the hell are we supposed to do that if he wont let us get close enough to him because hes worried were eavesdropping on him when elise tried to reply holland interrupted her if you hate the guy so much why dont you just resign like the others did why do this i dont hate the president i voted for him but that doesnt mean we should look the other way if a crime has been committed were law enforcement officers whose job it is to protect the president replied holland not to solve crimes were in protection not detection max listen she began no elise you listen nikki hale got drunk she got behind the wheel and she caused a horrible accident she took four other people along with her it was tragic but its over dont pick at the scab max i can help head this thing off and save us all a lot of trouble and embarrassment but i cant do that if you wont cooperate hales dead elise shes the one responsible for what happened case closed youre wrong about that how do you know holland asked how do you know there are going to be subpoenas whos behind all this are you going to help me or not that depends youve got to give me something first elise reached for the remnants of her diet coke and weighed what to tell him the family hale plowed into and killed the colemans she nodded their only living relatives were charlie colemans parents they started a lawsuit but eventually agreed to an out of court settlement supposedly paid for by stephanie gallo big deal gallos free to do what she wants with her money and why wouldnt she want to make the lawsuit disappear she had a lot invested in aldens campaign and the drinking that night happened at her fundraiser on her property with a bank account like hers i would have done the same plus with nikki hale dead theres no one to charge with a crime and when the elder colemans folded their tents and went home that was the end of any civil suits too not necessarily theres someone else who can bring a suit for what happened that night who sheryl colemans business partner i dont understand how you know all of this said holland i was invited to talk to her invited by whom it doesnt matter the hell it doesnt this smells like a political hatchet job whos putting you up to this elise resented the insinuation nobodys putting me up to this then why are you doing it because its my job no it isnt let it go elise what are you so worried about holland drained the last of his beer and then held the empty glass up to get the bartenders attention again what im worried about he said as he set it back onto the bar is how the secret service could be made to look in all of this why should that matter has the secret service done something wrong holland waited until the bartender had set down his new bud light and walked away before responding you said you could do the secret service a favor how i might be able to convince sheryl colemans business partner not to pursue the lawsuit so might stephanie gallo and her mighty checkbook not this woman said elise ive met her this isnt about money you know he said as he raised his glass but stopped just before it reached his mouth its funny how you just happened to overhear something between the president and gallo and now all of a sudden this woman wants to bring a lawsuit id think long and hard about what youre doing elise i have max believe me so about that night holland took another long sip of beer and set the glass back on the bar are you sure about this elise nodded yes after the dinner that night the president was with nikki hale what were they doing i wouldnt know unlike some agents i dont eavesdrop on the president elise let the remark slide what do you think was going on im not going to speculate there was a lot of talk that they might have been having an affair is that a question asked holland yes its a question you worked his detail what do you think i was an advance person for most of the campaign if there was anything between them i didnt notice it like i said replied holland im not going to speculate fine how long were they together after the party that night about fortyfive minutes were they drinking do you think alden could be held liable for her condition that night first of all said holland as he raised his beer to take another swig im not an attorney and second i think nikki hale bears the ultimate responsibility for her condition you remember what her reputation was elise looked at him i do and i also know what people have said about alden i need to know youre not covering for him that this isnt some winkwink boyswillbeboys sort of thing the mans personal life is his business you can say what you want about kennedy and marilyn monroe but we all know how clintons affair blew up in his face we also know how the service came away from that with black eyes morale is at an alltime low we dont need a scandal and we dont need agents having to testify about what they saw or didnt see ill tell you this though i dont care how many americans love this new president his administration has gotten off to a very rocky start a mistress would be bad for his image but a dead one would be fatal elise thought about that remark for a moment before asking did you see nikki hale leave that night i saw her and the president part company i didnt see her leave the estate had they been in his bedroom no gallos library study were they alone holland nodded what about the drinking you already asked me that he replied and you didnt answer had they been drinking maybe elise studied him maybe i wasnt in the room max her blood alcohol content was off the charts youre telling me she wasnt bombed when she left maybe she had been drinking with him and it just hadnt hit her yet all i know is that she didnt look pieeyed to me when she left elise was confused then what happened she made another stop before leaving the estate that evening she did where asked elise that youre going to have to figure out for yourself replied holland as he stood up from the bar and polished off the rest of his beer hold on a second max you cant just leave it like that if ive got to go around asking every agent who was on duty that night what they saw or might have seen words going to get out holland hadnt thought of that reluctantly he threw her a bone talk to hutch hutchinson but he was on mrs aldens detail that night reaching over holland collected his forty dollars off the bar thanks for dinner if you want to chat about this some more ill expect to see a process server on my doorstep as he disappeared into the crowd and exited the town tavern elise thought about what he had said a mistress would be very bad for the presidents image and a dead mistress would be fatal chapter spinghar mountains afghanistan sunday the cluster of mud brick buildings abutted a summer grazing pasture not far from the tora bora cave complex even when the roads were clear it was an extremely rough ride now with snow and ice still on the ground at this altitude it took mullah massoud an extra hour to get there which didnt do much to improve his mood yelling for his men to get out of the room he slammed his ak down on the table and let loose on his russian counterpart who was sitting on the floor having tea i told you to make it look like an accident you idiot calm down said simonov how dare you tell me to calm down roared the taliban commander the russian lifted the kettle and poured another cup well have tea and we will talk massoud took two steps onto the rug and kicked the teacups across the floor his face was flushed and his eyes were bulging simonov had never seen him like this before my village will have to go to war now because of you quietly simonov stood retrieved the cups and brought them back to the rug the taliban commander was furious you and i have seen too many battles together to have our friendship end this way massoud said the russian i am inviting you one more time to sit and have tea with me removing his boots massoud sat down on the rug as the russian refilled the cups he spoke your brother is not wearing the shoes i gave him why not because i took them from him snapped the taliban commander it was to be his contribution to the debt paid for breaking asadoulah badars jaw well you can give them back to him massoud snorted i might as well shoes will no longer cover the debt no thats not the reason said simonov your brother caught asadoulah fondling the american woman zwak warned him repeatedly but he wouldnt stop he was protecting her how do you know this demanded massoud the woman told me herself why what were you doing even speaking to her i received an email from the mother four questions asking for proof of life i needed the answers to prove that we still had her alive elam badars son lied said the taliban commander as it all sank in it would appear so and we killed him correction said the russian i killed him but as far as his village is concerned it is the same thing you also killed two other men tell me what happened simonov explained how he had carried out elam badars killing exactly as they had planned but that he had been seen by two other men from his village and had been forced to kill them as well how did you kill them asked massoud one round each to the head that was very rash i had no choice said the russian i had to act quickly the taliban commander shook his head and the bodies he asked they wont stay hidden forever massoud signaled for simonov to continue the russian explained how he had returned to massouds village as quickly as possible but when he discovered that the taliban commander was not there he decided to act gathering several of massouds best men he loaded gear and equipment into three trucks collected zwak and the american woman whom he disguised in burkas to make it look as if they were traveling with two women instead of just one and then headed for their fallback location if elam badars family or anyone in his village tried to retaliate by alerting the american military or afghan forces it would do little good at this point it was a small consolation and the taliban commander massaged his temples with the heels of his hands now that two other men from his village have been killed elam badars death will no longer be viewed as an accident i agree and all you want to do is to sit here and have tea demanded massoud his anger rising again have tea and discuss my plan said simonov will your plan prevent my village from going to war the russian smiled no but it will prevent elam badars chapter butkhak afghanistan twenty kilometers east of kabul on the jalalabad road was the village of butkhak of the several small ngos working in this village only a handful could afford security one such group was clean water international though they werent one of gallaghers richest clients they were one of the steadiest and that meant a lot to isss bottom line baba g liked to joke that instead of referring to themselves as cwi a more appropriate acronym for their organization would have been psh short for potsmoking hippies afghanistan was awash in vacant real estate and gallagher had seen an opportunity for iss in being able to provide not only physical security for ngos in the form of armed manpower but also safe places for them to be housed most afghans didnt know the first thing about marketing to the westerners who were flooding into their country all they knew was that if they could land even the smallest of fishes they could make big money through one of gallaghers many afghan contacts hed been offered a sizable walled property in butkhak the area was booming with reconstruction projects and he knew it was only a matter of time before he found a tenant the main house also had something hed never seen before in afghanistana jacuzzi gallagher had agreed to represent it on the spot what had sold him on the compound had also sold the potsmoking hippies from the moment they had seen the jacuzzi they were hooked it was only later that he realized that the property also included a dilapidated greenhouse which the hippies gladly repaired out of funds from their own pockets though the rent and security package gallagher had sold them was likely a tad more than their office somewhere in europe had budgeted the money always arrived on time in gallaghers account every month there were several structures on the property one of which baba g had excluded from the hippies lease it was here inside a long stone garagelike structure that he and hoyt kept their most important investment gallagher referred to it as the golden conex and as he unlocked the twentyfootlong shipping container he quoted a line from willie wonka a small step for mankind but a giant step for us harvath let out a whistle the iss team had put together quite an impressive collection of small arms in addition to crates of fragmentation grenades and rpgs there were neatly stacked rows of battle rifles submachine guns and shotguns along one wall a pegboard had been mounted and from it hung a myriad of pistols there were beltfed weapons along the back crates of ammunition boxes of spare magazines as well as an armorers bench it was like stumbling into santas workshop leaning right up front was a pink m covered in hello kitty stickers who does this belong to he asked oh that replied gallagher thats hoyts come on its a surprise for meis birthday he better hope she loves it said harvath with a shake of his head as he picked up a considerably more manly larue tactical stealth osroptimized sniper rifle it had a surefire suppressor magpul precision rifle stock harris bipod and a leuopold scope im running a special on that one today said gallagher oh yeah replied harvath as he got comfortable with the weapon in his hands how much for you mister yak dollar sold said harvath setting it aside how about these he asked pointing to several heckler koch mp submachine guns those are particularly fun they scare the shit out of the afghans especially when you attach the suppressors why most of them havent seen that kind of weapon before plus i dont have to tell you how good they are for cqb work no he didnt harvath had done a lot of close quarters battle with the mp and knew it was an exceptional weapon ill take it he said take two joked baba g with a wave of his hand theyre small i think one will be fine as they decided on the rest of the gear they would need there was the sound of tires crunching on gravel outside harvath looked at his watch daniel fontaine was right on time he stepped outside and greeted the former canadian counterterrorism operative as he climbed out of his truck did you get everything he asked you owe me two hundred dollars said fontaine as he shook harvaths hand harvath looked at him on top of the stack of cash i gave you in kabul i got stopped at a checkpoint on the way out of town said the canadian with a shrug it was either one hundred bucks and they take half of the stuff or two hundred and we call it even i decided to call it even good choice replied harvath as he followed him around to the back of his suv fontaine lifted the tailgate and threw back the blanket covering the cargo area underneath were several cases of beer and hard liquor and hoyt said all your late nights in kabul would never amount to anything stated harvath obviously he was wrong replied fontaine obviously but wait said the canadian as he stepped away from the tailgate and over to the rear passengerside door theres more harvath joined him as he opened the door and flung back another blanket revealing a case of sugarfree red bull on the backseat looking at it harvath said theres one missing fine replied fontaine take five bucks off what you owe me but after thinking about it for a second stated better yet fuck you thats what you get for waking me up at three in the morning harvath laughed peeled two hundred bucks from a wad of bills in his pocket and handed it to him though afghanistan was an islamic country there was still alcohol to be found getting this much of it especially on such short notice was a considerable feat fontaine had done well still plagued by jet lag and not having had much sleep harvath appreciated the gesture and helped himself to a can of the energy drink tough night asked fontaine as he watched harvath pop another onethousandmilligram motrin in his mouth and wash it down with a swig of red bull just an underground party said harvath as he slid a couple of cans into his pockets and closed the door you didnt miss much wheres baba g santas in his workshop said harvath pointing toward the structure checking off items on my christmas list fontaine smiled and after covering up the booze with the blanket closed the tailgate following harvath toward the building he said ive got first dibs on the hello kitty rifle the taliban hate hello kitty chapter only a fool or a heavily armored military column went anywhere in rural afghanistan uninvited to enter the village of asadoulah badar the young man dr atash had treated for a broken jaw harvath gallagher and fontaine would have to be invited the best way especially for westerners to secure such an invitation was to offer the village shura something they needed based on gallaghers relationship with his tenants in butkhak he came up with what he thought was the perfect offer in exchange for half the booze in the back of fontaines suv clean water internationals project leader agreed to allow the trio to pose as a scouting team they were given a brief overview of cwis mission and how they conducted project assessments more important the project leader contacted a resourceful fixer and interpreter they used in khogyani who was adept at getting the most difficult jobs done as long as the money was right they asked him to reach out to the village shura to see if they would consent to being considered for a clean water project after agreeing to a price the interpreter explained that he would call back in a few hours once he had been to the village and had met with its elders harvath gave the cwi leader an alias as well as his afghan cell number for the interpreter to call back on they loaded the cargo area of gallaghers land cruiser with all of the weapons except for their pistols threw a blanket over them then loaded the alcohol on top and covered that with another blanket if they were stopped along the kabul to jalalabad road they could plead to the lesser offense give up the booze and keep going that was simply the price of doing business in afghanistan once they got off the main road and headed for khogyani though they werent likely to run into many official checkpoints at that point they were going to make sure they had the bulk of their firepower very close at hand cwis afghan houseboy cooked them lunch and then after changing into their baggy salwar kameez or manjammies as harvath like to call them the trio hit the road gallagher drove while fontaine rode shotgun and harvath sat in back and tried to catch up on his sleep the narrow twolane highway took them through snowcapped mountain passes and tunnels carved by hand out of solid rock garishly decorated handpainted pakistani trucks known as jingas often found themselves stuck inside the tunnels or losing significant portions of their cargo which were stacked beverly hillbilliesstyle higher than common sense would ever allow they were halfway to jalalabad when baba g told harvath to wake up all hands on deck he said harvaths hand moved to the butt of his glock before his eyes were even fully focused whats up were coming up on surobi replied fontaine whats in surobi nothing good responded gallagher its known to have a very heavy taliban presence said fontaine lots of the hits on convoys have supposedly been orchestrated out of this village they also run bullshit checkpoints at night shaking down anyone dumb enough to be out driving this way they were in the kabul river valley and would be following the water the rest of the way to jalalabad gallagher slowed his vehicle as they entered the outskirts of surobi took off his seatbelt and made sure his door was unlocked fontaine and harvath followed suit with traditional afghan clothing hiding their body armor and driving a slightly beatup unarmored toyota the hope was that the men would not draw too much attention to themselves as gallagher and fontaine spent a lot of their time bouncing back and forth between kabul and jalalabad they both knew the jalalabad road quite well you want to stop for tea gallagher asked harvath as they rolled into the village itself theres a nice little tea house here i think ill pass said harvath as he made eye contact with a man walking along the side of the road wearing a black turban the symbol of the taliban the look the afghan shot back was pure hate some people called it the evil eye though baba g liked to refer to it as the death stare or the hairy eyeball whatever the case the man obviously wasnt fooled by harvaths local costume he was an outsider and therefore didnt belong ive actually got the tea thing down to a science continued gallagher from the moment they first realize youre in town youve got twenty minutes give or take until they start pulling the trigger harvath turned away from the window and met baba gs eye in the rearview mirror why do they wait twenty minutes the lookout who sees you has to call his handler the handler then has to call the higherups the higherups then have to decide how much they think youre worth once they have a price theyre willing to pay they call the handler who then argues with the lookout over how much hell get paid for popping you of course the lookout thinks hes getting ripped off because the handler is taking too much off the top which he is so they argue back and forth for a little while longer until the handler relents and agrees to pay a little bit more thats why i say it takes about twenty minutes give or take the day they go to a straight rate card harvath said with a laugh youre in big trouble that would make too much sense tia tia repeated harvath as he turned his eyes back to the window surobi like most of afghanistan was nothing more than a collection of mud brick buildings the only color at all came from the produce or massproduced consumer goods being sold from drab roadside shops and stalls harvath spotted three more men all of whom were wearing black turbans and had aks slung over their shoulders the fact that they not only carried weapons but so openly and brazenly displayed their allegiance to the taliban said a lot about surobi if only all of the taliban and the rest of worlds islamic fundamentalists had the courage to so openly identify themselves instead they hid behind women and children and used mentally challenged people to carry out suicide attacks for all their talk about being brave warriors they were the biggest cowards on the planet if the world could see these assholes for the animals they really were maybe there wouldnt be such a hue and cry from the fools who wanted to afford them all of the protections due signers of the geneva and hague conventions forget the fact that idiots like the taliban werent signers of either geneva or hague refused to appear on the battlefield wearing even so much as an armband to identify themselves as honorable combatants and wreaked untold misery upon civilian populationsthe major group the conventions were designed to protect harvath just couldnt understand the liberal mindset he was convinced that they believed deeply in what they said and what they did his only problem was that it so often flew in the face of reality they continually focused their rage on their protectors rather than their enemy they denigrated their country believing it was the source of all evil in the world the truth was when it came to islam it had been violent since its inception its clearly stated goal was worldwide conquest it was a mandate handed down in all of its religious texts and while harvath believed there were peaceful and moderate muslims he knew from studying the religion that there was no such thing as peaceful and moderate islam the entire religion was a mess and needed a complete gutrehab and though he had a good feeling his countrys new president would probably not agree with him he also knew that until the politically correct crowd stopped making excuses for them and undercutting any motivation to reform their religion themselves the majority of muslims wouldnt do anything their religion forbade them from even changing one word of the quran islam had been islam for fourteen hundred years and what it had been was violent as far as harvath was concerned they could have the rest of the world but they couldnt have his country harvath was content to go door to door and eliminate as many troublemaking members of the religion of peace as was necessary he didnt need nor did he expect so much as a thankyou for it he knew it was the right thing to do and he would continue to do it for as long as he was able to squeeze a throat or a trigger it was what he was trained to do and it was an oath he had taken that he was no longer in the direct employ of his nation did not mean that he felt any less responsible to see to its protection there was nothing he held more sacred than his duty to his nation seeing a roadside vendor up ahead advertising cocacola harvath told gallagher to pull the truck over are you serious he asked of course i want to be able to say i stopped for a drink in surobi baba g looked at fontaine fine by me replied the canadian gallagher navigated the truck to the side of the road and came to a stop in front of the small shop ill wait here he said chickenshit replied harvath as he opened the door and hopped out walking into the tiny store he found a toothless old man sitting behind a worn table that functioned as the shops makeshift counter with a faded cookie tin that acted as its cash register the old man smiled as harvath entered covering his heart and bowing slightly he wished harvath peace wa alaikum salaam harvath replied the old mans smile remained as he waited to serve his customer cocacola asked harvath smiling more widely the man removed one of the many plastic bags hung on the arm of his chair and shuffled across the dirt floor to a small cooler dua the man asked holding up two fingers harvath couldnt tell if he was the worlds greatest salesman or if he was trying to figure out how many people harvath was traveling with to maybe relay the information up the road to a waiting sniper it was an inhospitable way to think especially as the old man seemed very nice but it was the kind of viewpoint that kept people like harvath alive harvath held up four fingers and the old man beamed he was making his day as the man selected four cokes and placed them in the bag harvath looked around the little shop not knowing when they might be eating again he bought a can of nuts some chocolate and a tube of pakistani pringles the old man followed harvath carefully placing each item in the bag harvath was about ready to pay when he noticed a small dusty row of books along the floor in the corner the man had one or two books in german swedish french italian dutch and englishsomething for almost every potential ngo worker who might have once stopped at his place of business before surobi became so dangerous harvath looked through the titles in english one in particular caught his eye picking it up he smiled done with his shopping he followed the old man to the counter and paid him handing the bag across the table to his customer the old man said uk no usa ah america america good harvath nodded and replied afghanistan good too glancing toward the door to make sure they were still alone the old mans toothless smile faded as he stated taliban bad yes harvath said as he picked up his bag taliban very bad but afghanistan good the smile returned to the old mans face and he watched his american customer leave the shop outside harvath climbed back into the waiting land cruiser pulled out the tattered jackie collins novel and tossed it into the front seat what took you so long asked gallagher as he looked at the book i thought you were just buying a drink i was making a new friend replied harvath youd like him same taste in literature you two could start your own book club i dont think so said baba g as he put the truck in gear and pulled out onto the road you just couldnt pay me to sit around with a bunch of taliban deconstructing lady boss how about having a lady boss who pays you to deconstruct a bunch of taliban who are just sitting around asked harvath as he settled back into his seat gallagher laughed throw in a cooler of cold beer at the end and that would be my kind of job but by the same token i learned a long time ago that you should be very careful what you wish for chapter in bagrami on the outskirts of jalalabad gallagher turned down the driveway of the largest walled compound harvath had seen outside of kabul it sat in the middle of about eight acres and was surrounded by nothing but flat rockstrewn dusty ground tactically it was a brilliant location you could not only see trouble coming from any direction you could also engage it and mow it down before it even got close to your front door the realtors around jbad will talk your ear off all day long about location location location stated baba g as they approached but for me its all about the interlocking fields of fire the compound had been constructed by a local afghan contractor at the behest of the united nations it was built to exacting un standards and was composed of two buildings with seventeen en suite bedrooms a full basement with workout facility and safe roombomb shelter a large communal dining room and kitchen an expansive garden swimming pool and tiki bar when the un fled bagrami on the heels of the overhyped mohammed cartoon riots gallagher had heard about the property and drove down from kabul to check it out he and hoyt had been wanting to expand their operations farther into eastern afghanistan ngos were doing more work there and would need security gallagher also saw the compound as a great moneymaking opportunity and turned it into a guesthouse complete with free wifi access and dubbed it the shangrila its garden tiki bar was the only international bar in the region and did a hell of a thursday night business in the summer months baba g sold memberships to the pool where westerners could swim and sun themselves without offending afghan sensibilities the man was always alert to opportunity there was a guardhouse outside the main gates and as gallaghers guards saw him driving up they opened the large iron gates for him he parked near the main building and when harvath stepped out of the vehicle the first thing he noticed was how much warmer it was the air was thick and humid the sky was clear and azure blue pretty nice huh asked baba g youve come down over four thousand feet in elevation very nice replied harvath as he unwrapped the patoo from around his shoulders and took the pakol off his head it was at least twenty degrees warmer it can get pretty cold at night though added gallagher as two members of the house staff appeared he directed them to grab the liquor out of the back of the truck and take it inside along with harvaths bag fontaine already knew his way around the shangrila and told his colleagues that hed see them shortly for lunch baba g gave harvath a quick tour of the property then put him in the biggest room he had available and told him hed see him in the dining room in fifteen minutes harvath drew back the drapes and opened the large french windows the fresh air felt good setting up his laptop he logged on to the internet and checked the email account he had established for communicating with stephanie gallo there was a message waiting the subject line read pol short for proof of life opening the email harvath read gallos update wonderful news all questions answered correctly when will you get hold of the rug dealer harvath didnt like stringing stephanie gallo along but it was going to be necessary for a little while longer he was way off the reservation running an operation that she had not sanctioned he dashed off a response telling her that they expected to move on the rug dealer in the next fortyeight hours it was as far as he felt comfortable pushing things if he couldnt locate julia gallo in the next two days hed have no choice but to set up the exchange with her captors waiting any longer than that was just asking for them to get desperate the last thing he wanted was for them to start slicing off body parts one of the talibans favorite attentiongetters and dropping them off in front of the american embassy in kabul pulling out his afghan phone harvath dialed hoyt at the shahre naw safe house hows our guest he asked when hoyt answered who hannibal fucking lecter harvath sat up straighter in his chair what happened after he soiled himself midland went in to try to clean him up and wait a second interrupted harvath why did midland go in and not you because rock beats scissors thats why besides im management and hes labor do you think he soiled himself on purpose asked harvath youre damn right he did you should have left him like that i didnt have a choice flower was raising holy hell he thought maybe the guy was sick or something since hes our prisoner its our duty to see to his comfort you know all that pashtunwali crap blah blah blah harvath knew what pashtunwali was and he had a lot of respect for it it was far from crap the rest of modern civilization could benefit from adhering to such a code of honor so what happened midland and flower went in to deal with the guy while i covered them as midland was removing khans pants the shitbag bent over and tore a chunk out of his ear with his teeth jesus is he going to be okay flower drove him over to the care hospital to get his ear sewn back on care replied harvath relax said hoyt he doesnt know anything about where we got khan from besides care is the best place for plastics plastic surgeons or no plastic surgeons harvath didnt like it you should have gone with him if he talks this whole operation could be blown dont worry hes not stupid he wont talk and as far as me going to the hospital with him i figured youd rather i stay here and watch our guest if im wrong i can call a cab right now harvath put his elbow on the desk and rested his forehead in the palm of his hand no you did the right thing im glad you stayed there tell mark ill cover all his medical bills i already told him that replied hoyt by the way did you know the biter speaks english yeah he grew up in the uk well hes one creepy son of a bitch he keeps threatening us every time we open the door to his cage and im not talking runofthemill macho imgoingtokickyourass kind of stuff hes one

tore into midland all right we messed him up once how bad asked harvath flower beat the crap out of him midland and i had to pull him off so much for pashtunwali eh said hoyt with a chuckle i told you the guy was dangerous the only reason he got marks ear was that he was probably aiming for his throat and missed i dont want you going into that room unless you absolutely have to and if you do and he moves tase him thats an order understand you got it boss good replied harvath let me know if mark has any problems at the hospital by the way whats he going to say anyway when the doctor asks him how it happened theyre picking up mei along the way theyre going to say it was rough sex harvath couldnt believe his ears now youve got mei involved in this im just kidding said hoyt relax midland will say he tore his ear on a piece of sheet metal you keep screwing with me cautioned harvath and im going to tear you on a piece of sheet metal im shaking in my saddle shoes here aquaman get back to work and find our doctor weve got everything covered on this end if anything else happens with khan i want to know about it okay roger that replied hoyt harvath disconnected the call and stood up from the desk closing the windows he stepped into the hall locked the door behind him and headed toward the dining room gallagher and fontaine were already seated at the table when he got there whats our status asked gallagher as harvath walked in harvath couldnt talk about khan in front of fontaine so he stuck strictly to julia gallo weve got positive proof of life fontaine grabbed a large orange from the bowl in the center of the table and began peeling it so were a go for khogyani yup lets assume we get a meeting with the shura said gallagher then what the first thing i want is a tour of the village we take as many pictures as we can and map as many gps points as possible well push to look at everything if they hold anything back or say that something is offlimits we mark it as a location of interest i want each of us planning as we walk through that village how we would come back in at night hit our objective and get out again are there any dogs any livestock we would want to avoid disturbing if we got pinned down where would we want to hole up and fight from wheres the nearest location we could use as an lz if we had a helicopter brought in if it has to be a hot extraction and were taking fire how would that work how thick are their doors how many armed men could they field and how quickly if we get the chance to do a walkthrough i want to make sure were making the most of it what about this kid with the broken jaw asadoulah badar said harvath baba g nodded we obviously cant come right out and ask the shura about him theres no reason a bunch of ngo workers would know his name wed be blown right from the getgo so what do you suggest asked fontaine we need to figure out a way to get them to offer him to us what do you mean by offer harvath pulled out another motrin and reached for one of the bottles of water on the table the way youre going through those things interrupted gallagher you should have a pez dispenser do you think i can get a jackie collins one asked harvath as he popped the painkiller and took a sip of water youre going to fry your liver and your kidneys if you keep knocking those things back like that can we get back to badar and the shura please gallagher put up his hands in surrender and harvath continued if we tell them we want to involve the young men of the village in the project as well we might be able to arrange a casting call after tea well do our tour and while were touring the shura can have the young men rounded up for us well then do a q a with the kids ostensibly to select the best candidates if one of them has a broken jaw well know and if they dont bring him to the casting call asked gallagher then well ask the shura where the rest of the men in that age group are well tell them that we selected their village based in part on the number of young men in that age group who could help maintain the wells and irrigation systems and carry that knowledge to other villages within their tribe well call them water ambassadors or clean water warriors i dont really care the point is that the shura should be concerned were going to pull the project because wed expected more boys in that age group to be there theyll pony him up even with the broken jaw trust me and then said fontaine and then replied harvath well divide them into teams and elect captains get the gps devices out and act like they can actually seek out water well ask the kids on that team to show us where each of them live and well tag asadoulahs house assess the hell out of it in the short time we have and come back for him later tonight gallagher sat back in his chair and smiled thats got ngo written all over it not bad harvath was about to respond when his afghan cell phone vibrated pulling it from his pocket he activated the call yes a voice on the other end used the alias harvath had given the cwi people mr staley it asked this is he replied harvath i am ghazan daoud your interpreter in khogyani yes mr daoud have you spoken with the village shura mr staley there is a big problem harvath could tell by the mans voice that he was very upset first of all calm down mr daoud tell me what the problem is there are soldiers everywhere where here in the village what kind of soldiers asked harvath taliban no sir nato soldiers they have the entire village surrounded why why are they there im not sure said daoud but there are three dead bodies outside right now bodies of nato soldiers asked harvath no afghans two of them were shot i am afraid of what the nato soldiers might do mr staley i have tried to speak with them but they will not listen to me are you near please say you are near dont worry mr daoud we are on our way and will be there as soon as we can do you understand yes mr staley said the interpreter please hurry harvath disconnected the call and set the phone on the table what was that all about asked gallagher a group of nato troops just hit our village in khogyani is it julia gallo asked fontaine im not sure said harvath but were not going to sit here and wait to find out lets go chapter the drive from jalalabad to khogyani normally took an hour gallagher made it in twenty minutes they encountered their first roadblock a mile out along the singlelane road leading through the village two eightwheeled lav iii armored personnel carriers were parked diagonally blocking all traffic in or out their mm bushmaster chain guns along with a complement of and machine guns were ready for action coming up on the roadblock said gallagher two more lavs were blocking the road on the other side of the village anybody see any activity on the ground asked harvath baba g shook his head looks like all theyve done so far is set up a cordon which means theyre either waiting for another element to show or theyre gearing up to go in themselves we run this exactly the way we planned on the way down stated harvath actually said fontaine as they closed on the roadblock and he reached in his pocket for his military id we might have just caught a break what kind of break asked harvath well see in a moment he replied fontaine rolled his window down and told gallagher to pull all the way up they were waved to a stop by a canadian soldier carrying a c assault rifle good afternoon sir said the soldier as he studied fontaines canadian military id card corporal said fontaine as he retrieved his id and slid it back into his pocket who are you and what the hell are you doing here mechanized quick reaction force b company first battalion the man responded we were sent in to hold this village hold it for whom the americans theyre sending a unit to go housetohouse do you know what theyre looking for asked fontaine no sir whats their eta i dont know sir said the corporal whos in charge here demanded fontaine captain west sir captain chris west yes sir fontaine opened his door and stepped out get him on the radio for me right now he said as he began walking toward one of the lavs get the captain on the line the corporal ordered one of the soldiers standing near the lav whos raising captain west for me asked fontaine as the hatch was raised on the armored vehicle and he ducked inside right here said a soldier who offered up a handset fontaine took the handset and spoke into it chris this is dan fontaine you and your men have just walked into the middle of our operation we need to talk right now fontaine listened for a moment and then gave the handset back to the soldier he waited for the soldier to finish speaking with his superior and then he stepped out of the lav as he did the soldier stuck his head out of the back and informed his sergeant that fontaine and the men in the land cruiser had been granted permission to pass so far so good said fontaine as he hopped back in the truck and the canadian soldiers directed them around their roadblock where to asked gallagher as he steered around the lavs and got back on the road were going to meet up with their captain at the roadblock on the other side of the village what do you think the americans want with this place drugs weapons taliban or alqaeda fighters replied fontaine you name it julia gallo harvath asked thatd be one hell of a coincidence i dont believe in them continued harvath from the backseat more convinced than ever that fontaine was csis by the way you still carry an active military id expired replied fontaine nobody ever checks the date how about you ill bet you have some interesting items in your wallet harvath doubted the canadians id was expired he also knew that while he had never told fontaine what exactly he did for a living it was quietly understood that he worked for the us government based on harvaths special operations experience it wasnt a huge leap to assume he did something other than pushing paper the suggestion of what might be in his wallet was a way of intimating that fontaine had a good idea who harvath really was too it was also probably a reminder that the pot shouldnt call the kettle black you know this guy west well asked harvath changing the subject yet again he and i served in the pats together replied fontaine harvath was familiar with canadas highly decorated regiment princess patricias canadian light infantry do you think hell help us out we always say once a patricia always a patricia well no matter what happens and no matter what reason the americans have for wanting to get in there and do a housetohouse stated harvath we are going into that village if julia gallo is in there the longer we wait the greater the odds are that theyll figure out a way to slip that cordon and smuggle her out and for all we know they might have fled with her the minute they spotted these soldiers coming i dont want to wait around to find out agreed said gallagher you got us over one hurdle harvath said to fontaine now how do we get over the second and into the village staring at the armored vehicles up ahead he replied by appealing to wests innate sense of canadian patriotism harvath looked at him i think i like my plan better dont worry replied fontaine its still your plan this is it said gallagher as they slowed to a stop before the two lavs that formed the roadblock on the other side of the village you want us to wait in here you can come but try to let me do the talking okay well try said harvath opening his door the three men exited the land cruiser and were greeted by captain west a career military man in his late forties with dark hair and pale eyes whats this about us walking into the middle of your operation asked west as he shook hands with fontaine the former jtf man didnt bother introducing harvath or gallagher even among their allies spooks often preferred to keep their identities private weve had this village under surveillance for two days why asked west fontaine dropped his voice and moved the captain off to the side out of earshot of his men harvath and gallagher followed we believe that the village elders have been harboring an alqaeda asset weve got one of our men inside who can id him we were about ready to pull the trigger when you guys showed up speaking of which what are you and your men doing here nato command got some sort of tip from one of its taliban informants they passed it on to the americans who knowing we were in the area asked us to come in and establish this cordon did they get anything in the air for you asked harvath a predator anything west shook his head theyve been tied up they couldnt get any assets on target before we arrived so we dont know if anyone slipped out as your cordon was being established no we dont said west as he turned back to fontaine and asked is this alqaeda asset youre looking for the same reason the americans are on their way no replied fontaine it isnt you sound pretty sure i am well replied west my gut says i should put the brakes on everything until the americans get here chris weve been chasing the alqaeda operative in that village for almost a year and now that we have him cornered hes sitting in there wondering who gave him up pretty soon if he hasnt already hes going to zero in on my operative a canadian i might add wholl be as good as dead when that happens i need to shut this thing down now dan you and i go way back but orders are orders said west and what happens if this guy slips your cordon im sure your men are good but its not beyond the realm of possibility if we let a canadian operative get killed and an alqaeda bomb maker who specializes in targeting canadian troops escape it wont exactly be a blueribbon day will it captain west was silent as he thought it over sensing that the man was leaning in their direction fontaine pressed him all we need is thirty minutes to button this down west finally spoke okay heres what i am prepared to do based on one of our operatives being in imminent danger inside the village im going to go ahead and authorize you to extract him but thats it the bomb maker is secondary and you can sort him out with the americans when they get here agreed fontaine shook hands with west were good with that how many of my men do you want to take with you the captain then asked you maintain your cordon well go in and link up with our operative and take things from there you might want to rethink that when we showed up there were a lot of villagers moving around with guns which brings up something else said fontaine our operative indicated that there are three dead afghans in there two of whom had been shot what do you know about that im assuming youve got snipers out we do but it wasnt us theres been no gunfire since we arrived replied west but thats not to say that it couldnt start at any moment those villagers were getting ready for something you should take some of my guys with you well be okay stated fontaine how are you going to do this without stirring up the hornets nest do you know which structure hes in hes got a relationship with the village elders if they give their permission well be able to walk in and get him west didnt look as if he put much faith in pashtunwali how are you set for comms he asked weve got radios in the truck answered gallagher give us your frequencies and well be good to go west nodded and called over one of his men to accompany gallagher to the land cruiser and help set up the radios id also like to know where your snipers are added fontaine west nodded and motioned fontaine back to his lav ill show you on the map how were set up fifteen minutes later harvath gallagher and fontaine were ready to roll harvath pulled out his afghan cell phone and dialed clear water internationals khogyani interpreter mr daoud harvath said when the man answered this is mr staley were at the village now the soldiers have agreed to allow us to come in what do they want asked daoud no one understands why they are here its all going to be okay harvath reassured him are you with the shura right now yes i have two other members of my team with me do we have the shuras permission to enter the village harvath waited while the interpreter spoke to someone in the background and then came back on the phone yes you and your colleagues have their permission after being given a description of the building they were in and how to find it harvath disconnected the call tucked the phone back in his pocket warned his team to be on their guard and headed with them into the village chapter as the men made their way into the dusty village it was like walking into a ghost town every house and compound was shuttered and not a single soul roamed the streets not even children any soldier worth his salt knew that kids were a combat indicator when they disappeared it meant that something very bad was about to happen nevertheless harvath ignored the hair standing on end on the back of his neck and kept going he also ignored the pain from the hidden mp banging against his bruised back everybody stay sharp he said all three made mental notes of the buildings they passed finally they came to the structure where the shura was meeting just as daoud had said laid out in front were three bodies covered with sheets harvath and gallagher approached to examine them while fontaine kept his eyes peeled for trouble this one looks like a broken neck said gallagher as he inspected one of the corpses how about the other two harvath looked under the first sheet and then the second bullet wounds to the foreheads very clean and also very professional thats not the way afghans normally handle their problems so who shot them no idea said gallagher as harvath set the sheet down and the two men straightened up motioning toward the door of the structure harvath said lets see if we can get some answers inside none of them were prepared for what they discovered crammed inside were at least fifty heavily armed men from the village they all eyed harvath and his tall wellbuilt compatriots warily harvath gallagher and fontaine all placed their hands over their hearts bowed ever so slightly and wished the men peace a handful of men returned the gesture most of them did not daoud stepped forward and introduced himself he was a short man in his late thirties dressed in traditional afghan clothing with a neatly trimmed beard and a checked kaffiyeh hung loosely around his neck after harvath and his team had removed their boots the interpreter led them into an inner room where the shura was waiting as they were introduced the men repeated the customary greeting to the elders of the village who politely greeted them back the interpreter invited the men to sit down upon the floor which they did harvath noticed very quickly that the shura had no intention of serving tea tell the shura harvath said to daoud that we have come for the american woman the interpreter was confused but based on the stern faces and powerful physiques of the three men surmised they probably werent ngo workers here to conduct a project assessment i dont think i understand he began harvath held up his hand theyll know what were talking about tell them daoud turned to the shura and repeated what harvath had said he waited for their response and then translated they say they dont know anything about an american woman ask them why they have three bodies outside the interpreter posed the question and while the elders exchanged hushed remarks among themselves he tried to ask harvath a question of his own but harvath silenced him he was intent on studying the old mens faces and listening to the cadence of their voices it was obvious they were very upset about something after extensive deliberation the chief elder a man named fayaz spoke and daoud translated they say it is a private matter private repeated harvath please inform the shura that with their village surrounded they no longer have privacy in fact if they dont turn over the woman immediately im going to call in an airstrike the interpreter delivered harvaths ultimatum and then asked a question on behalf of the elders the shura wants to know if this means there isnt going to be a clean water project for their village are these people trying to horse trade with us harvath wondered to himself it didnt make any sense not only had he just threatened them with an airstrike but their village was surrounded soldiers were poised to come kick in every door flip over every bed and turn every one of their buildings inside out what could they possibly have to bargain with tell them said harvath that i didnt come here to negotiate i want the woman now harvath waited for the interpreter to respond when he did his face reflected considerable shock the woman is not here he said so these fuckers did know where gallo was it was all harvath could do not to string the village elder up by his ankles and beat the shit out of him where is she he demanded first daoud translated we must reach terms harvath was stunned by the audacity of these people no matter how weak their hand the afghans never missed an opportunity to haggle harvath removed his radio so they could see he was serious about calling in a strike im giving you sixty more seconds and then im going to have your village turned into one big grease spot as the interpreter relayed the message to the shura the elders began yelling na na no no together in pashtu daoud looked at harvath and said they say they are not the ones who kidnapped the american woman tell them i dont believe them the interpreter relayed the statement and the shura broke into a barrage of heated crosstalk after a moment fayaz the chief elder spoke and daoud translated the shura says that their village is the victim here the bodies of the men you see outside they were killed by the man who took the american woman harvath still didnt believe them why are so many of your men armed right now obviously you have been expecting trouble why shouldnt i believe it was because this village was involved with doctor gallos kidnapping when daoud passed on harvaths remarks the elders erupted in another chorus of na na and the chief of the shura locked eyes with harvath and began speaking as the interpreter translated we did not kidnap the american woman then who did demanded harvath mullah massoud akhund a local taliban commander and massoud killed the men outside na na said fayaz no his russian did explained the interpreter what russian asked harvath daoud listened to the shura and then said massouds men call the russian bakht rawan how do you know it was this russian who killed the men he was seen by the son of one of the men and where is he now the interpreter conveyed harvaths question to the shura and the chief elder yelled toward the door it opened and one of the armed villagers stuck his head inside harvath didnt understand the entirety of the order fayaz delivered but he caught part of it and that was all he needed to hear the elder had told the villager to fetch the young man they had been looking for asadoulah badar chapter because of his broken jaw the young man was difficult to understand and several times during their interrogation the shura rebuked him for speaking too softly and ordered him to speak up the elders had already heard the story once but they wanted the boy to tell it again for the benefit of the three men the only things standing between their village and what they knew would be a crippling airstrike asadoulah badar though distraught over the murder of his father recounted the circumstances surrounding his death he explained how one of their sheep had gone missing asadoulah and his father along with his two cousins raham and yama who also tended the large family flock had gone looking for the animal they split in different directions with asadoulah taking one of the higher mountain trails on the opposite face it was from that vantage point that he had seen the russian dump his fathers body so that it landed near the familys crippled sheep below as the russian retreated up his side of the mountain asadoulah caught a glimpse of his cousins they were still looking for the lost sheep and he doubted they had any idea what was about to happen to them asadoulah tried to warn them but they didnt hear when he found their bodies they were both dead but unlike his father whod had his neck and arm broken by the russian his cousins had both been felled with single shots to the head asadoulah finished his tale by explaining where he had seen the american woman and though it shamed him to admit to his lies he told the entire truth he then explained how based upon his lie his father had met with the shura of massouds village and had chastised them for housing the american woman and had demanded redress for what had happened to his son when he returned he explained that he had called massoud reckless and said that he posed a great danger to their villages in the face of such a despicable act of murder the shura explained that the men of their village lusted for badalrevengeand the badal for killing was to kill this was an affair they were not confident could be mediated with the shura of massouds village their men wanted blood plain and simple vengeance was the cornerstone of pashtun character had the soldiers outside not arrived when they did the men would have had it fayaz shared his doubts about whether the bloodletting would have ended with the russian and mullah massoud im sure the men of your village are very capable warriors said harvath but massoud is a taliban commander which means he has soldiers of his own probably many more than you do how did the men of your village expect to win as the question was translated the old man shook his head they were waiting for nightfall said daoud translating the chief elders remarks they had hoped to take massoud and his men by surprise do you think they knew you were coming asked harvath the taliban have their spies everywhere replied fayaz should massoud be any different probably not thought harvath who then asked is there any reason any reason at all that the americans would take an interest in your village once the question had been translated the chief elder put it to each of his colleagues on the shura in turn daoud translated as each elder replied none of them could think of a single reason harvath could though massoud was taliban and chris west said that he and his men had been mobilized based upon a tip from a taliban informant the russian had apparently intended for the death of asadoulahs father to look like an accident if that hadnt been the intent he would have simply shot the man the same way he did asadoulahs two cousins massoud now had a big problem on his hands it wouldnt take long for the family to find the bodies and to suspect that massoud was behind the murders little did the taliban commander know that there was actually a witness faced with the prospect that his neighboring village was going to be out for blood and would want to do as much damage to him as possible he had to have envisioned that they might tip the authorities to the identity of their captive that meant massoud would have to deal with foes on two different fronts what should he do the answer seemed very apparent to harvath and he was willing to bet he knew exactly why there was a cordon around the village and the americans were on their way in massoud had set the two against each other based on the description asadoulah had given of the woman held captive in massouds village he was convinced that it was julia gallo what didnt make sense was that somehow the russians or at least a russian was mixed up in all of this at this point though it didnt matter what mattered was getting to julia gallo as quickly as possible and getting her back alive and if harvath was right about massoud having tricked the nato forces into surrounding asadoulahs village hed have done it for one reason and one reason onlyto buy himself time to get away nevertheless harvath wanted to see massouds village for himself the only question was how looking at asadoulah he began to get an idea studying the elders harvath asked if i could provide an opportunity for you to prove that your village had nothing to do with the kidnapping would you act upon it after the question was translated fayazs response was simple and concise hoo he said yes and if we help you he continued through daoud will you help get us the water project the threat of the airstrike was one thing but harvath needed to earn the shuras loyalty for what he was going to ask them to do next in order for that to happen he had to give them something they needed something that would make the shura look good to their village meeting fayazs gaze harvath replied hoo we will help you get the clean water project excusing himself then to use the bathroom harvath took fontaine and gallagher with him so they could talk privately ive got an encrypted sat phone back in the truck said harvath as he stood next to fontaine outside the bathroom i need you to get hold of whoever you can so that west will allow us to take some of these villagers out of here with us who do you expect me to call asked fontaine im sure youre well connected why not you the only reason that canadian cordon is there is that the americans asked for it i dont have that kind of pull said harvath fontaine laughed modesty now thats an interesting character trait in an american he let the jab slide listen dan im not even supposed to be here really okay ill bite where should you be then back in kabul replied harvath negotiating julia gallos ransom so youre telling me youre not authorized for this thats exactly what im telling you and you want me to pull strings for you so that you can take a bunch of villagers out of here to do god knows what not god knows what were going to take the shura out so they can meet with the shura from massouds village and mediate their dispute you want to set up a jirga asked fontaine using the pashtu word for a gathering orchestrated specifically to administer tribal justice yes and how do you know that once the cordon is lifted here the men of this village wont just march over that mountain and mow massoud his russian counterpart and the rest of his village right down because i dont think massoud the russian or his men are even there anymore replied harvath so whats the point the point is that we can gather some good intel there you want to pull the ngo bit again asked fontaine i doubt it would work said harvath you cant draw a bucket of water from the well without the village elders knowing about it any interest from an outside organization at this point especially a western one is going to raise alarm bells then whats your plan the elders here have a legitimate reason to call for a jirga with the elders of massouds village they could have one set up in less than an hour because of the violent nature of the dispute the shura is going to travel with some muscle we ride with the shura as far into the village as we can and then we bail out we take asadoulah with us and have him show us where they kept julia gallo kept as in past tense youre that convinced massoud and company are long gone i dont know about long gone said harvath but i guarantee theyve moved on all we need to find out is where and if we bump into some taliban along the way then well deal with them fontaine looked at gallagher and then back to harvath suppose i could make a phone call and get west and his men to look the other way for a few minutes why would i want to besides the fact that rescuing this woman is the right thing to do besides that ill give you two reasons said harvath the first is that news of a taliban commander working with a russian operative would be very interesting to both of our governments fontaine was listening and the second you can take credit for loosening up the cordon and arranging the jirga the elders of this village seem like good people youd be doing them a favor and you know how highly the pashtuns regard favors plus gallagher threw in with the cordon left in place after we leave it will buy the two shuras time to reach an agreement no matter how badly the men of this village are itching for a fight they wont be able to leave youll also get points for helping to head off a war between their two villages harvath agreed with all of the time you spend in this area he said it wouldnt hurt to have these guys owe you one who knows how much intelligence they could mine for you thats assuming said fontaine i am even in the intelligence business of course harvath replied with a smile fontaine was a smart guy and it didnt take him long to make up his mind if you can convince the elders to set up the jirga ill get west to turn his back long enough for us to get whomever we need out of town when they returned to the meeting room the elders had laid out tea and they invited the men to sit down with them and drink harvath gallagher and fontaine sat down and as their cups were filled harvath spoke through daoud and explained what he wanted to do right off the bat the elders expressed concern about asadoulahs being part of the operation but when harvath explained why the boys presence was necessary for more than just identifying the location where doctor gallo had been held captive they began to relent it was baba gs unsolicited promise that he would personally guarantee the boys safety that finally seemed to do the trick though harvath couldnt have scripted a more perfectly timed response gallaghers spontaneous offering was seen by the shura as genuine and therefore trustworthy once the details had been established and the limit to how far the elders would transport the team into the neighboring village was set the men finished their tea and harvath gallagher and fontaine walked back through the village to the canadian cordon to put their plan into effect chapter washington dc todd hutchinson was a classic midforties narcissist incapable of recognizing that his better days were already behind him a career bteam secret service agent hutchinson or hutch as he insisted on being called had risen just about as high in the organization as he ever would though he was a thoroughly competent agent simply by being hutch the man had grated on the nerves of almost everyone who had ever worked with him including the majority of the people he was charged with protecting one of the few exceptions was theresa alden through some opportune twist of fate hutch had been assigned to her detail during the primary campaign and he and the soontobe first lady had professionally clicked she was a woman with multiple anxiety problems which often kept her from sleeping some said that was why hutch often worked night shifts on her detail as he and the first lady liked to sit and talk no one in the service could understand what she saw in him and when hutch finally outlived all of the company pools for when terry alden would finally wake up and request his removal from her detail they gave up on trying to figure it out the best physical description of him that elise campbell had ever heard was that he reminded people of fivefooteight burt reynolds without the mustache the female agents in the white house were in total agreement that there was no way there could be any sexual connection between him and the first lady how she could enjoy being around him was anybodys guess but terry alden did and that was all that mattered therefore hutch had become a permanent fixture in the first ladys retinue elise had arranged to meet hutch for coffee after his overnight shift had finished until she could account for how nikki hale had spent her final hour and a half before driving away drunk and killing herself and four other people she wouldnt be able to forget the conversation shed overheard between the president and stephanie gallo she met hutchinson at a starbucks a few blocks from the white house on pennsylvania avenue near seventeenth street so whats with all the cloak and dagger he asked as they exited with their coffees and headed toward lafayette park we could have grabbed a table inside i thought it would be nicer if we walked todd hutchinson looked up at the overcast sky and turned up the collar of his overcoat what did you want to talk with me about alone and oneonone like this campbell had expected the man to come on to her as he had in the past instead his demeanor was surprisingly professional i want to talk about the night nikki hale died hutchinsons coffee cup was halfway to his lips when the question came and instead of taking a sip he lowered the cup and looked at elise why do you want to talk about that call it professional curiosity it was a sad night for everyone he said raising his coffee cup again and taking a sip i understand you saw her shortly before she died who told you that max holland did she replied why were you and max talking about nikki hale campbell ignored his question and gently pushed forward with her own do you think the president was sleeping with her who responded hutchinson nikki how would i know the night she died she had been alone with him for a while maybe they were sleeping together who cares max says that after she left the president she was still on the estate for a little bit before she finally climbed into her car to drive back to her hotel stated campbell so so she replied he also said while she might have had a drink or two with alden she didnt look drunk to him when she left what does any of this have to do with me hutchinson asked i dont know why dont you tell me as a secret service agent campbell had been trained in detecting microexpressions small facial clues that indicated someone was either lying or trying to mask an intent to do harm as she glanced at hutchinsons face she could clearly see the man was under stress and did not like answering her questions elise listen he said if max knows where nikki hale went after leaving the president that night he should tell you if he doesnt want to then thats between the two of you hutch he did tell me thats why im talking to you its unprofessional why because by pointing you to me hes casting aspersions on the first lady campbell looked at him i dont get it listen i know holland doesnt care for me said hutch as they passed blair house and entered the park there are plenty of senior agents just like him that ive either butted heads with or not gotten along with over the years i dont want to lose my position i like being on the first ladys detail how are you going to lose your position by talking to me if i start telling tales out of school and the first lady hears about it how long do you think itll take for her to have me reassigned elise couldnt argue with him it was the same fear shed had still had actually about pursuing the conversation between the president and stephanie gallo so this is a job security issue for you no said hutchinson pointing to a nearby bench its a loyalty issue were here to protect these people thats our job and their job is to let us and that cant be easy for them they arent allowed many private unguarded moments okay said elise as she sat down on the bench with him we all know that its drilled into us as agents but no buts for a second said hutchinson interrupting her i want to know why you suddenly find nikki hales death so interesting elise had no intention of lying to hutchinson he had the same training she did and would be able to smell a lie a mile away at the same time she had no intention of being completely truthful with him either someone is considering bringing a civil suit over her accident hutchinson was clearly taken by surprise who he asked christine de palma the business partner of sheryl coleman who was killed that night the wife of the man driving the minivan hutchinson said absentmindedly who also added elise was the mother of the two children killed in that crash why now maybe she wants justice it was an accident a lawsuit is not going to change anything what grounds could this woman possibly bring a civil suit on hale obviously had way too much to drink before she left the estate im not an attorney but from what i understand if anyone contributed to nikkis intoxication and knowingly allowed her to drive drunk they could be in some serious trouble hutchinson balanced his coffee cup on his knee and stared across the park toward the statue of andrew jackson how do you know about this lawsuit he asked im friends with a detective in east hampton do you think this de palma woman is serious about the suit i dont know campbell replied but if she does go through with it everyone who was there that night is going to get subpoenaed hutchinson closed his eyes and shook his head exhaling a long breath he opened them again and said the first lady is not fond of the women the president surrounds himself with stephanie gallo and nikki hale in particular she resents the access gallo has to her husband it makes her feel like she has been cast aside wherever the president was on the campaign trail gallo was always close by in fact she traveled with him more than mrs alden did rumors of affairs have been rampant as have rumors of the first ladys drinking interjected campbell wondering aloud about something many insiders had long suspected some say that played a part in the presidents not putting her out front as much as other candidates do with their spouses hutchinson shrugged from what i saw id say the stress was pretty hard on her how does nikki hale fit into all of this was she with the first lady that night whether hutchinson was resigned to the fact that the information was bound to come out at some point or simply needed a colleague to unburden himself to elise couldnt tell all she knew was that for some reason hutch had decided to come clean with her stephanie gallo is a beautiful powerful woman but with all her money there is one thing she doesnt haveyouth that was something nikki hale had in abundance and it was her that the first lady most suspected her husband might be having an affair with he said did she have any proof asked campbell not that i know of i think she was going more on intuition than anything else the president sure seemed to spend a lot of time alone with her elise looked at him from what i understand she was one of the primary architects of his web campaign considering how influential it was and how much money it raised id say she was an important player im not defending the first lady im just telling you what i saw well what did you see the night she died was she with the first lady yes she was said hutchinson as he turned away and looked off at the statue again why what did the first lady want with her she had decided to confront her she asked me to find hale and bring her back to the guesthouse wait a minute said elise what was the first lady doing in the guesthouse she and the president had had an argument that evening over something i wasnt there so i dont know what it was about all i know was that when i came on duty he was still in the main house and she had moved to the guesthouse okay so you tracked down hale and brought her back there no said hutchinson she was with the president at that time so i left word with max to send her to the guesthouse whenever they were finished then you went back and reported to the first lady correct and how did mrs alden take that piece of information asked campbell not well said hutchinson she grabbed a glass and a bottle of wine and went upstairs when did nikki hale get there about a half hour later what happened then i brought her up to mrs aldens room and left them alone were you the only agent posted to the guesthouse there were other agents on the grounds outside said hutchinson but you were the only one inside clarified campbell thats right did you hear anything or see anything after that hutchinson was slow to respond mrs alden asked if i would bring a glass upstairs for ms hale elise looked at him askance thats somewhat inappropriate isnt it youre there to protect her not wait on her did you say no no i didnt said the man with a shake of his head why not because it wasnt a big deal all right elise couldnt help but feel that todd hutchinson had grown a bit too close to the first lady nevertheless she let it slide so she continued now mrs alden and nikki hale were up there drinking together apparently do you think the first lady was trying to get her drunk i think she was trying to get to the bottom of hales relationship with her husband she probably thought the wine would help replied hutchinson you know what they say in vino veritas in wine there is truth hutch nodded then lets suppose the first lady was trying to loosen hale up to get at the truth she said did you hear any arguing anything like that not at first so they did argue yes how long into their meeting was it i dont know he said twenty minutes maybe a half hour did you overhear any of the specifics no i was downstairs it was just a lot of raised voices then what happened asked elise hale came down the stairs and walked right out the front door that was it that was it didnt you think maybe you should try to stop her from leaving why should i i didnt have any way of knowing how much alcohol she had consumed besides im not paid to conduct field sobriety tests im paid to protect mrs alden and fetch wineglasses for her fuck you campbell you couldnt have at least radioed one of the agents at the gate she asked how the hell should i have known she was going to get in her car she could have been going back into the main house to ask stephanie gallo to put her up for the night so she didnt have to drive back to wherever she was staying listen from what i understand nikki hale had a lot of experience holding her liquor she didnt tumble down the stairs or weave on her way out the door could she have been drunk when she left sure was it my duty to know absolutely not does the president know all of this i would imagine the first lady filled him in said hutchinson elise tried to think of something else to ask him but her mind was blank she was missing something but she couldnt figure out what more confused than when she had started she felt that she should wrap things up and let hutchinson get home she could think of only one other thing to ask him you said the president and the first lady had been fighting did he come to the guesthouse that night yes he said after hale left there was something about his answer that bothered her it came quicklytoo quickly and came off rehearsed and as he was speaking he turned back to look at the statue and elise thought she detected a telltale microexpression so what happened she asked did they fight some more did they make up what nothing happened hutchinson replied and there the microexpression was again this time she was certain of it he was lying about something that had to have been why he had looked away from her elise watched his face closely and pressed her point what do you mean nothing something must have happened hutch turned back and looked her square in the eyes by the time the president arrived the first lady had passed out chapter nangarhar province afghanistan back at the cordon daniel fontaine made two phone calls and within fifteen minutes captain west had been given orders to allow the former jtf operative to leave the village with whomever he wanted as his superiors failed to provide him with an excuse to give the inbound americans if they happened to show up in the middle of this canadiansanctioned exodus west encouraged harvath and company to move quickly they compared the captains maps with the one the shura had given them which included the layout of the village and the location where asadoulah had seen julia gallo convinced the information was reliable harvath gave the order for everyone to mount up including the elders security detail they numbered fifteen people anticipating at least two checkpoints on the way into massouds village fayaz the chief elder rode shotgun in gallaghers land cruiser with one of his men at the wheel harvath gallagher and fontaine rode in back their patoos pulled up high to help disguise their faces the rest of the men including asadoulah and daoud the interpreter who had agreed to come along for an additional fee were divided between another suv and a severely beatenup pickup truck by the time the small convoy drove around the roadblock and out of the village the sun had already disappeared from the sky and as it did the temperature began to drop as the shura had predicted they encountered precisely two checkpoints on the way into massouds village before each of them harvath watched as fayaz removed a special sim card from his pocket and used it in his cell phone to make calls to notify the elders of the opposing shura that they were coming and should be allowed to pass through the checkpoints he was a clever old man using different sim cards clearly demonstrated that he wasnt as provincial as he looked and that he took his own operational security very seriously thanks to the phone calls at each checkpoint the speeding convoy was waved right through and not asked to stop so far so good crumbling rock walls and the occasional abandoned mud brick building were the only signs that they were actually headed toward a populated settlement other than that the landscape was completely desolate when they had driven as close as they dared with harvath gallagher and fontaine the convoy stopped the three men hopped out of the land cruiser quickly gathered the weapons and supplies they needed from the back and with daoud and asadoulah in tow signaled for the convoy to take off again the drop had worked like clockwork and the vehicles were moving again in less than sixty seconds gallagher wasnt thrilled about relinquishing control of his suv but there was no other choice it was now completely dark and at the speed with which the vehicles had zoomed through the checkpoints the men manning them never would have been able to count how many people were inside all they would be able to report was that there was a total of three vehicles on their way into the village the other advantage to doing it this way was that though harvath and his team would have to sneak into the village by foot the land cruiser would be waiting for them when they got there according to asadoulah the structure where julia gallo had been held was less than a kilometer away if you were walking straight through the center of the village wrapping their way around the outside of the village as they tried to avoid all human contact meant that their trip was going to take a little longer as they had been when they had gone after mustafa khan harvath and gallagher were both wearing night vision goggles fontaine was wearing a pair he had brought as well and to allow daoud and asadoulah to see where they were going without attracting any attention harvath had clipped the streamlights marjan and pamir had used in the tunnel under darulaman road to each of their belts he also made sure they both knew how to operate them in case they needed to be extinguished in a hurry harvath fontaine and gallagher also had their bone mics in and carried their encrypted motorola radios with them even though they had been switched to a new frequency they had adopted call signs specific to this assignment if anyone heard them they intended to sound like a convoy of some sort harvath was convoy fontaine was convoy and baba g was cover with the temperature dropping they now donned afghanstyle coats with plenty of pockets to hold everything over their coats they wrapped their patoos and they still wore the pakols on top of their heads eyeballing the impressive array of weapons and equipment daoud and asadoulah asked to be given firearms though harvath knew most afghans had experience with firearms he didnt see any upside to these two carrying and turned them down the men tried to argue with him but harvath shot them a look that quickly shut them up the village was built in a valley with a stream that ran right down through it the terrain was rocky and steep though harvath worried about his afghan charges of whom one was wearing sandals and the other was wearing the afghan equivalent of penny loafers his concern was misplaced even in the dark with nothing but the small pool of light from their streamlights they steadily picked their way along like a couple of afghan mountain goats in fact had they been leading instead of following harvath had a strong suspicion that he gallagher and fontaine would have been working very hard to keep up with them fortunately the village had no dogs and very little livestock that could be disturbed the men gave all of the dwellings a wide berth and reached a concealed area about two hundred meters away from their target without incident gallagher removed his nods and placed them over asadoulahs eyes once the boy had become accustomed to seeing things through the goggles harvath illuminated the structure with an ir laser and they quietly asked if that was where dr gallo had been held the boy studied it in relation to the other mud brick structures nearby and then whispered hoo before putting his plan together harvath had quizzed asadoulah repeatedly not only on what dr gallo looked like but also on what circumstances she was being held under he found it hard to believe that massouds mentally challenged brother had been put in charge of guarding her but gallagher fontaine and even daoud explained that if the structure and lock on the door were considered secure enough the taliban often left their prisoners unguarded the village was quiet after passing the second checkpoint they hadnt seen any more armed men harvaths premise that massoud had called in the nato troops on the neighboring village so he could slip away with gallo unimpeded was looking more and more like a reality nevertheless he didnt want to move too quickly the team lay in their concealed location and studied the small mud brick structure dr gallo had been kept in nothing moved and no one appeared to be about finally harvath gave the signal to get ready gallagher had already slid his nods back on and he continued to scan the area he was responsible for staying back with asadoulah and daoud and providing sniper overwatch though he would have preferred being further up the mountain with better cover and concealment the team had no choice gallagher would have to make do with conditions as they were as harvath and fontaine gave their weapons one last check harvath whispered in and out then we regroup and head for the secondary target fontaine nodded and after scanning the area once more for any signs of life harvath signaled that it was time to move with their silenced mps grasped beneath their patoos the two men slipped soundlessly onto the road they walked in the slow shambling afghan fashion fully aware that from a distance they might look like the real deal but anyone who got close enough to see their nods would immediately raise the alarm they stayed close to cover hugging walls and the sides of the few houses they passed all the while making sure to avoid windows harvath could feel his heart pumping in his chest and the adrenaline coursing through his body even with gallagher manning a rifle they could be outgunned and overwhelmed very quickly harvath reminded himself to scan and breathe scan and breathe when they reached the mud brick structure harvath flipped up his nods and studied the door while fontaine kept watch it was secured by a simple sliding bolt after pressing his ear up against the door he flipped his goggles back down and signaled the former jtf operator what he wanted him to do both men then pulled their mps from underneath their patoos and when harvath nodded fontaine drew back the bolt and swung open the door harvath entered first followed by fontaine there was a small bed in the corner but nothing else no julia gallo harvath flipped up his nods and motioned for fontaine to close the door the tiny mud brick room was pitchdark and smelled like damp earth and sweat there was only one window which had been covered with a cloth or a tarp of some kind from outside harvath removed the extra streamlight he had grabbed from the golden conex and switched it on now came the moment of truth if julia had remembered the security training care international provided its volunteers before they arrived in afghanistan harvath would be able to tell very quickly if she had in fact been held in this makeshift cell while fontaine kept guard harvath moved the bed and looked along the walls and floors behind it nothing next came the area above the door frame still nothing harvath examined both sides of each timber that ran across the mud ceiling and helped support the roof once again he came up empty it was the same story near the hole cut into the floor to be used as a toilet harvath was starting to lose hope maybe gallo hadnt been here at all maybe it had been some other western ngo worker the boy had seen or maybe asadoulah was full of shit and leading them on a wild goose chase harvath played his light along the base of the last wall until he came to a small ventilation hole about the diameter of a coke can bending down he focused his beam just to the left of it and found what he was looking for carved into the wall about an inch above the floor were the initials jlg julia louise gallo she had done exactly what she had been taught to do it was one of the key things taught to people operating in areas with a high likelihood of kidnappings whenever possible wherever possible always leave a trail pulling his cell phone from his pocket harvath snapped a picture of julias initials and then stood our package was definitely here harvath said via his bone mic weve got confirmation weve also got a problem replied gallagher from his position back with daoud and asadoulah youve got a truck full of bad guys headed right for you chapter how many asked harvath as he turned off his flashlight and flipped his night vision goggles back down four said gallagher two in the bed and two in the cab how far out a hundred twentyfive meters and closing were sure these are bad guys asked fontaine over his mic unless the local h club has started issuing rpgs these are definitely bad guys what do you want me to do harvath knew these were not simple villagers not with rpgs they werent these were massouds men and he didnt need to think twice about what to do take them out roger that said gallagher hold your position it was a clear night with enough starlight for a marksman like gallagher to be able to engage his targets with the optics he had on his weapon flipping up his nods he settled his shoulder into the stock of his larue sniper rifle and calculated the lead on his moving target as the truck closed to within a hundred meters gallagher slowed his breathing and prepared to fire exhaling he focused on his sight picture and gently applied pressure to the trigger there was a muffled pop as the round spat from the suppressed rifle and blistered through the air toward its target gallaghers lead had been perfect and the bullet took out the trucks right front tire the effect was instantaneous and the driver immediately slowed the vehicle to a full stop with no clue to what they could have hit to cause such a dramatic blowout all of the men climbed out of the truck to survey the damage short of painting targets on themselves the small party of taliban soldiers could hardly have made it easier on gallagher as they squatted in unison to investigate the shredded tire baba g whispered cleanup in aisle five and began applying pressure to his trigger the bullets ripped from the weapon filling the night air with a fine red mist as they tore into heads throats and even chests there was a faint tock tock tock like the stamping of sheet metal as a handful of rounds either went slightly wide or passed directly through their victims flesh and pinged into the body of the truck gallagher had definitely oversaturated his targets but it was one of those cases where if a little was good a lot was better he had absolutely no doubt that those four had climbed aboard the seventytwovirgin express and werent going to pose a problem to anyone anymore flipping his nods back down gallagher scanned the area as he inserted a fresh magazine into his weapon convoy youre all clear said gallagher over the radio dont trip over the bodies on your way out how close are they asked harvath outside up the road to your left within a hundred meters and by the way youre welcome turning to fontaine harvath said if those are massouds men there could be some worthwhile intel on them the former jtf operative illuminated his suunto and checked the time ill go he said you need to get to that jirga because as soon as those bodies are found their buddies are going turn this village upside down thats assuming there are more of them said harvath trust me theyre like roaches for every four taliban you see there are forty more hiding somewhere nearby unless massoud took the rest with him for all we know cautioned fontaine massoud is still here thats the mindset we need to operate under agreed said harvath are you sure youre okay with checking out that truck fontaine nodded im sure thank you replied harvath as he made his way to the door hailing gallagher he said convoy is going to investigate the four downed tangos convoy is returning to your position roger that replied gallagher two out with a split ill cover you both as best as i can negative said harvath who wanted to afford fontaine as much protection as possible keep your eyes on convoy convoy will come back on his own roger that once they were ready harvath nodded and fontaine pulled back the door it was still quiet at their side of the village as the two men crept outside harvath gave fontaine the thumbsup and the canadian took off toward the four dead taliban with the flat while harvath retreated several feet risked a flash photo of the structure with his camera phone and then carefully made his way back to where gallagher and the two afghans were waiting baba g didnt bother looking up at harvath when he rejoined them his eyes were focused on fontaine we ready for phase two he asked yup replied harvath who removed his afghan cell phone and handing it to daoud said its time to make the call the interpreter took the phone and dialed fayazs cell phone he spoke briefly to the elder then disconnected the call and returned the phone to harvath they are ready for us he said harvath nodded and tucking the phone into his pocket got on his radio and said convoy were ready to roll to our next location copy that convoy ill meet you there convoy out using a tiny cejay fingerlight to illuminate fayazs handdrawn map of the village harvath and gallagher went over the route they were about to take to the jirga one last time but asadoulah shook his head and suggested another route harvath didnt like it it was too direct and went straight through the center of the village na he insisted using the pashtu word for no and then retraced the route he intended them to take grabbing harvaths left index finger with the small aviators light secured to it with velcro asadoulah illuminated harvaths proposed route once more and pointed to specific structures along the way taliban taliban taliban massoud he whispered with his broken jaw as he pointed to house after house after house harvath looked at gallagher what do you think well out of all of us he replied this kids the only one whos been to this village before and i may not be crazy about walking right up main street but he sure seems adamant about it fine said harvath as he turned off his fingerlight and tucked the map back into his pocket well do it his way but that means no nods if even one person sees us and gets suspicious well be blown before we ever make the jirga chapter though the moon wasnt full it was entirely too bright for harvaths liking as were the stars as the group moved deeper into the village they threw long shadows across the ground and were silhouetted against every mud brick and stone building they passed they slipped from one property to the next staying low and seeking out as many places of concealment as possible there was no sound except for the wind which had begun to pick up and the river of snowmelt that rushed past the village as it made its way further down into the valley the cold mountain air enveloping them was filled with the scent of wood smoke and roasting meats with his back against one of the many walled village compounds harvath was about to peek around the corner to make sure it was safe for them to proceed when he heard a noise immediately he signaled for everyone to get down straining his ears against the sound of the river he tried to make out what he was hearing as the noise got closer he figured out what it was footsteps contrary to what people saw in the movies suppressed weapons were not completely silenced gallaghers taking shots from his suppressed weapon on the outskirts of the village was one thing harvaths trying to do so here among the densely packed houses was something else entirely they couldnt risk it waving everyone back harvath pulled his knife from its sheath letting his mp hang from its sling beneath his patoo he readied himself to take out whoever was coming around the corner with one hand poised to clamp down and cover the persons mouth so he couldnt scream out and the other wielding the knife which measured over a foot in length harvath prepared to attack the footsteps grew closer and as they did harvath adjusted his grip on the weapons notched handle slowing his breathing he focused on the sound of the approaching figure the person was less than a meter away at this point harvath inched closer to the edge of the building and got ready closer the footsteps came as they did harvath took in a deep breath of air like a statue he stood perfectly still as had been true in the raid on the interrogation facility beneath the soviet military base in kabul and as was true in all such scenarios the keys to success were speed surprise and overwhelming violence of action when the figure suddenly appeared harvath sprang grabbing the person by the throat harvath yanked him off his feet spun him around the edge of the building he was hiding behind and slammed him up against the wall the blackenedsteel blade was up against the soft flesh of the persons throat in a fraction of a second harvath looked into the face of his victim and saw abject terror in his eyes he also saw that his victim was a boy no older than fourteen suddenly asadoulah had broken away from gallagher and was at harvaths arm imploring him in pashtu na na then he spoke the first word harvath had heard him say in english friend harvath looked at asadoulah and then back at the teen he had pinned to the wall slowly he lowered the boy back down to the ground he left the blade in place just underneath the teens chin but removed his hand from around the boys throat as he did harvath raised his finger to his lips and instructed the teen to remain quiet the boy looked at asadoulah and then back at harvath and nodded harvath lowered the blade the second he did the boy tried to rabbit on him harvath though was ready grabbing hold of him he once again lifted the teen off his feet by his throat and pinned him against the wall harvath hissed for gallagher and daoud to come over while asadoulah tried to calm his friend down daoud was at harvaths side in a flash and harvath instructed the interpreter about what he wanted to say to the boy tell him were not here to hurt him but if he doesnt calm down i will frightened by harvaths intensity daoud hesitated tell him harvath snapped the interpreter relayed harvaths orders to the boy now ask him how many taliban are in the village right now daoud obeyed and despite harvaths hand wrapped around his throat the boy was able to croak out an answer at least twenty the interpreter replied where asked harvath the boy had no idea what about massoud gone daoud translated and the american woman harvath asked daoud listened and then said the boy says they took her with them harvath lowered the teen back down to his feet pointed at the ground and told him to sit daoud was about to translate but as the boy sat right down he saw that harvath had made himself perfectly clear what are we going to do about him asked gallagher were not going to kill him of course were not said harvath we also cant let him go if we do hes going to raise the alarm and were as good as dead well not only have massouds men on us well have every other member of this village gunning for us gallagher was right he remembered the story of a fourman seal team in afghanistan that had been dispatched to capture or kill a highranking taliban leader only to be discovered while doing their reconnaissance by a small group of goatherds hamstrung by politically correct rules of engagement and fearful of what their own government might do to them if they pursued the most logical option the seals reluctantly and against their better judgment let the goatherds go within an hour the team was engaged in a firefight with over taliban three of the seals as well as the sixteenman rescue force sent in via a chinook helicopter that was shot down were killed only one of the seals survived and even then just barely to recount the horrific tale it was a situation harvath was not interested in repeating looking at asadoulah harvath said to daoud ask asadoulah if this boy is one of the friends who accosted dr gallo with him the interpreter put the question to asadoulah and the boy turned his face away in shame that was answer enough for harvath staring back down at the teen hed told to sit harvath said i want to know this boys name the interpreter posed the question and the teen replied usman repeat my promise to usman that as long as he cooperates no harm will come to him as the interpreter spoke to the boy harvath withdrew his map of the village and illuminated it with his fingerlight for the boy to see tell him where were going and ask him if he knows if there are any taliban or any other villagers that he has seen out in fact i also want you to ask him why he is out daoud put all the questions to the boy and then said his uncles family has a stomach flu his mother made dinner for them and he took the food to their house he was on the way home when we found him what about taliban or other villagers he said he didnt see any other villagers he saw a truck with four taliban in it twenty minutes ago but nothing since harvath wondered if that was the same truck baba g had taken care of ask him where massoud went daoud asked but the boy replied that he didnt know how many of his men are still here harvath asked the boy shrugged only a few he replied no more than ten how do you know we have a small village it is not easy for taliban to hide here said the boy harvath didnt believe him there was just something about this kid that he didnt like looking at gallagher harvath asked did you bring any restraints baba g reached into his pocket and handed a pair to harvath who ordered usman to stand up and hold out his hands sliding his knife back into its sheath harvath locked the boys wrists together with a pair of the ez cuffs and then asked daoud for his kaffiyeh pantomiming what he wanted harvath waited for usman to open his mouth and then used the long piece of checked cloth as a gag he wrapped the remaining fabric around the boys neck and the lower part of his face it wasnt the worlds best disguise but it was better than nothing and if the boy tried to yell for help nobody was going to hear anything unless they were standing right next to him harvath made usman daouds problem and told the interpreter to keep hold of the boys arm and make sure he didnt get away harvath then flashed his mp so usman could see it and had daoud tell him that if he tried to run or made any noise whatsoever he would shoot him he told asadoulah the same thing just in case then with the two teens in tow harvath gave the order to move out and prayed they wouldnt encounter any more trouble before they made it to the jirga chapter when the center of the village finally came into sight harvath instructed his group to stop while he pulled on his nods and took a long careful look around as fayazs map indicated in the center of the village was an elevated wooden structure surrounded by a copse of trees it looked like a tree house with a wide wraparound porch lights burned inside and over the tumble of the icy river as its water slushed down out of the mountains harvath could hear voices the two shuras were still engaged in their jirga it was time harvath moved his three afghan charges quickly through the open over to the stand of trees while gallagher covered them once they were safely at the base of the structure gallagher traversed the open space and joined them what do you want to do with him baba g asked as he nodded toward usman should we cut him loose harvath powered down his nods and stuffed them into one of his coat pockets well let his elders decide what to do with him he said as he pulled out his knife and sliced off the boys plastic restraints daoud helped unwind the kaffiyeh from around his face and warned him to remain silent putting daoud in the lead harvath ordered his team up the stairs at the door the interpreter removed his loafers and stepped inside harvath and company immediately followed suit inside there was a group of gnarled weatherbeaten men with automatic weapons some belonged to fayaz and his shura the others were local and immediately scrambled for their guns salaam alaikum salaam alaikum daoud repeated with his hand placed over his heart in an attempt to reassure the men that they meant no harm the locals werent buying it harvath and gallagher were westerners and that could only mean one thingtrouble the men hurriedly leaped to their feet the room filling with the metallic clicks of ak safeties being flipped off salaam salaam daoud continued to implore the men peace peace gallagher took a step to his right to better shield asadoulah one of the locals recognized usman standing behind harvath and began speaking to him tell them were here to see the shura harvath said to their interpreter daoud relayed the message but the man ignored him instead he kept speaking to usman and was now cocking his head beckoning the boy to step away from the strangers and join him on the other side of the room the interpreter once more repeated his request and the man swung his rifle barrel over and focused his sights right on the center of daouds face immediately all of the color drained from his face it was a very aggressive move and in unison harvath and gallagher pulled their weapons out from under their patoos and trained them on the handful of afghans who were aiming at them from the other side of the room it was a mexican standoff afghanistan style across the room the man began raising his voice as he called for usman to come to him na harvath said no the man did not like that answer and was about to reply when a door on the other side of the room opened in the doorway stood an older man with a long gray beard coalblack eyes and a thick scar that ran from his nose to the bottom of his left ear he appeared to be one of the village elders and he was very angry he yelled at the villagers to put down their guns and reluctantly they did he then turned his eyes upon the group of strangers daoud bade the elder peace and as they had not been invited into the village like fayaz and his shura had been and were in effect trespassing immediately requested melmasthiaprotection and hospitality the elder studied the strangers and then slowly granted his approval with that harvath and gallagher lowered their weapons as they did usman bolted for the elder and began yelling out what had happened to him the elder fixed the boy with a glare that stopped him in his tracks he looked at daoud for an explanation which the interpreter quickly gave the elder was obviously not happy with what he heard and he locked eyes with harvath harvath returned the mans stare and refused to look away finally he held up his hand to silence daoud and called for the strangers to follow him into the other room as they entered harvath gallagher and daoud politely greeted fayaz and his shura as well as the members of the local shura their chief elder who introduced himself as baseer asked the men their names and then invited them all to sit down and take tea when the teenagers tried to join them baseer hissed through his teeth and dismissively waved them away to the back of the room where he ordered them to remain standing the men sat down on a large blue rug baseer had more tea brought in and small plates of food harvath knew that he had no choice in the matter taking tea was an ancient timehonored tradition meant to show respect and secure good relations rejecting it would have been an incredible insult to his hosts nevertheless gallagher had taken out four taliban soldiers on the edge of the village and as fontaine had said where you see four taliban there are always at least forty more nearby or if one wanted to believe usman no more than ten whatever the number harvath felt like a sitting duck and wanted to be on his way as quickly as possible to do that though he would have to convince baseer and the other members of his shura that it was now in their best interest to work with him daoud and fayaz spoke briefly and then the interpreter filled harvath in on everything the two shuras had thus far discussed waving asadoulah over fayaz made the boy apologize to baseer and the other members of his shura for how he had treated the american woman and for lying about his altercation with zwak usman was then summoned by baseer who severely chastised him and demanded the names of the other boys who had joined them in assaulting the american woman so that they could be dealt with once the boy complied he and asadoulah were dismissed from the room it was now time to discuss the most serious issues fayaz made it clear to baseer and his shura that harvath had the biggest stick in the room he could call upon american and nato militaries at will and they would do his bidding including leveling this village with a massive airstrike as daoud translated harvath was concerned that fayaz might be laying it on a bit too thick but if there was one thing the afghans recognized and respected instantly it was force watching the faces of baseer and his fellow shura members it was clear that fayazs words were sinking in baseer looked at harvath finally and said you have come for the woman yes we have harvath replied through daoud mullah massoud is one of the most powerful taliban commanders in all of afghanistan if he had caught you here he would have killed you but he is not here is he na replied baseer he is not harvath had been right but there was little satisfaction in the knowledge the important thing was getting julia gallo back safely removing his cell phone harvath showed baseer the pictures he had taken and said we know the woman was held here and i have proof i have sent these pictures to the american military commanders at bagram they know and i know that mullah massoud couldnt have kept dr gallo here without your knowledge because of this we make no distinction between you and the taliban if you do not cooperate with us airstrikes will be launched immediately against your village there will be nothing left here but dust harvath was bluffing again of course but hed dealt with enough village elders in his day to know that their primary obligation wasnt to a man like massoud but to the people of their village whom the taliban relentlessly manipulated extorted and hid behind give me the woman added harvath and we will go in peace baseer shook his head i warned massoud that taking her would be bad for our village he should have listened to you the only person he listens to is himself and the russian offered one of the other elders harvaths eyes studied the man as the interpreter translated his remark it sounds like this russian has also caused much trouble for your village said harvath too much trouble continued the elder until baseer held up his hand to quiet him did massoud order him to kill elam badar baseer nodded massoud was afraid that elam badar might tell the americans about his prisoner who is the russian a mercenary asked harvath harvath studied the faces of the shura after his question had been translated but none of them appeared anxious to answer it having already threatened to use his stick he knew it was time to dangle a carrot if you help me i can help you said harvath i am in a position to be extremely generous how generous asked baseer that all depends what do you need we want a small hydroelectric dam built at the bottom of our valley we also want new roads built harvath thought about it these are both very important projects control over such projects would not only increase your villages wealth and power but also the authority of your shura and we want generators said baseer until we can generate enough power ourselves the elder certainly wasnt shy with his list of requests if you give me what i want replied harvath i will do everything i can to help you secure these things for your village baseer listened to the interpreters translation and then conversed briefly with his fellow elders turning back to harvath he said we only know the russian by his afghan name bakht rawan he is not a mercenary what is he he is a russian intelligence agent harvath looked at gallagher and then back to the chief elder whats his connection with massoud the russians never really left afghanistan said the chief elder not completely many supported and maintained intelligence networks throughout the country massoud was the russians student he helped place massoud in the nds massoud was in the nds replied harvath hoo said baseer but he grew tired of it he wanted to change afghanistan and for him the taliban was his answer what about for you i have never believed in the taliban replied the elder right answer thought harvath now lets see if he can keep them going and what does all of this have to do with kidnapping dr gallo baseer looked at him and spoke slowly so daoud could translate they offered to give you the woman back if you freed mustafa khan from prison correct harvath nodded what they didnt tell you was that the russian was the one who helped the afghan national army locate and capture khan in the first place but that doesnt make any sense why would they do that the elder looked at harvath and asked what do you know about the lake of broken glass chapter ive never heard of any lake of broken glass replied harvath it is a story said baseer a fantasy then why are we talking about it because the russian was obsessed with it harvath looked at gallagher have you ever heard of this lake baba g shook his head no but im not exactly the resident expert on afghan folklore harvath turned back to the elder and through daoud said how does this fit in with dr gallos kidnapping afghanistan the elder responded can seem like a puzzle to understand it you must put the pieces together correctly even if some of the pieces are only a fantasy through his network the russian became convinced that the lake of broken glass was not a fantasy but in fact a reality so what is the lake of broken glass harvath asked it is where sheik osama is said to have hidden all of his riches bin laden baseer nodded before his attacks on new york and washington he knew his money would not be safe in bank accounts people say he took all of his money from these banks and used it to buy diamonds i think i actually read something about that said gallagher me too replied harvath its not a bad idea diamonds are easy to hide they retain their value and theyre virtually untraceable theyre also easily converted to cash and can be transported anywhere in the world without dogs being able to sniff them or setting off alarms so how does this lake of broken glass fit in harvath asked sheik osama was said to have hidden his diamonds in a cave somewhere in afghanistan to keep them from being stolen he then had the cave flooded with water eventually the wooden cases used to store the stones rotted away and the diamonds spilled out across the cave floor the diamonds are said to sparkle so brightly that the flooded cave looks like a lake of broken glass the afghans loved their tall tales and while obviously the story had been embellished as it passed through the afghan grapevine harvath couldnt help but wonder if there was something there he remembered hearing testimony released after one of the first gitmo trials that spoke of an afghan man who had drowned with his pockets full of diamonds hed also heard of a dhs alert for dive shops to be on the lookout for arab men wanting to purchase diving equipment which was born of confusion over scuba tanks discovered in a terrorist stronghold along the afghanpakistan border dhs believed alqaeda was training men to carry out attacks on bridges cruise ships and other waterrelated targets now harvath strongly suspected those two dots might connect in a way that no one had ever considered whether there was fire behind all this smoke or not harvath had more questions he needed answered explain to me why the russian had mustafa khan arrested he said it is believed that khan is the person who encouraged the sheik to remove his money from the banks and purchase the diamonds people said that khan also helped the sheik hide the diamonds he was one of his most trusted lieutenants when money was needed for an operation it was khan who went and fetched the diamonds from the lake so if the russian got hold of khan said harvath he believed he could force him to reveal the location of the lake the chief elder nodded so why not just grab khan himself why kidnap dr gallo and go to all of this additional trouble from what massoud said the russian was warned by his country not to betray their involvement if the lake could be discovered the diamonds were to be removed even though alqaeda has other sources of funding they would be greatly weakened and so would taliban leader mullah omar always overly ambitious the russians intended to transfer the money to massoud so that he could use it to unite the other taliban commanders under his control purchase more weapons build his army and wear down the american and other western forces in afghanistan exactly the way the mujahideen had done to the soviet union it was a bold plan and harvath could see a lot of upside in it for the russians alqaeda was the primary source of a lot of the radical islamist trouble they were having in places like chechnya also if they succeeded and massoud ending up running the country the russians would be able to ask for almost anything they wanted in return harvaths guess was that they would want to pick up on the abandoned pipeline project that had ground to a halt when america had bombed alqaeda terrorist training camps after the attacks on the us embassies in kenya and tanzania considering the way russia actively bullied both europe and its former soviet republics like the ukraine by regularly cutting off their natural gas supplies harvath could only imagine how much influence it would have if it controlled the only pipeline from central asia straight through afghanistan to ships waiting in the arabian sea russia would have a stranglehold on the entire region the russian chose the american woman carefully said baseer he knew about her mothers relationship with your president and he knew that your president would find a way to get khan freed from prison and then what was supposed to happen asked harvath the elder held his hands up near his head and shook them as if to indicate that the russian was crazy he expected the americans to torture khan until he told them the location of the lake of broken glass the americans would then retrieve the diamonds and an exchange would be arranged for the girl he would also insist on khans release so that khan could return to mullah omar and sheik osama and blame the americans for everything harvath shook his head it was an incredibly audacious plan the downside for the russians was next to nothing their man used his afghan contacts to do everything he used his afghans to locate khan he then had them tip off the ana to khans whereabouts and then he most likely used massouds men to snatch julia gallo then if khan was the real deal and there was indeed a cache of alqaeda gemstones somewhere in the country the united states or more specifically in this case harvath would be forced to torture the information out of him to get the diamonds and trade them for dr gallos release if the russian was smart which harvath believed he probably was he would arrange for khan to be released as far away from where the diamonds were being exchanged for julia gallo as possible probably on the other side of the country at least thats how he would have done it and then khan would make his way back to bin laden and mullah omar and fill them in america would be the bad guy and no one would suspect the russians or mullah massoud of having had any involvement whatsoever in the plot and if there were no diamonds or khan turned out not to be the right person to help locate them massoud and the russian had a host of options to choose from they could change their minds and accept the ten million stephanie gallo had offered for her daughters safe return they could let gallo go they could sell her into the lucrative white slavery market that operated throughout the islamic world or simply slash her throat and dump her body by the side of the road in essence it was all upside with very little on the down harvath had to give the men credit that said they had made one significant mistake though keeping prisoners with them in their villages was a taliban tradition doing so in this case had been a bad idea massoud and the russian would have been better off stashing julia gallo in a deep dark hole somewhere where only they knew where she was because they hadnt they had created a lot of problems for themselves which harvath hoped to add to do you know where massoud and the russian are now he asked there was considerable discourse among the elders this time harvath sensed in all but baseer a reluctance to cooperate and give up massouds location finally the chief elder said we are not certain but we think we may know where he is how many men did he take with him baseer calculated in his head and then replied the russian left first we believe it was shortly after he killed elam badar massoud wasnt here he was at a meeting with taliban commanders in another province the russian took the woman massouds brother zwak and ten of massouds men they left in three trucks when massoud returned to the village and heard that they had left he organized about thirty men and divided them into six trucks they left the village two trucks at a time to avoid drawing a predator strike massoud was smart if they traveled in too big a group or drove too many people to the same place they would attract a lot of attention to themselves how many of his men did he leave behind here baseer conversed with his colleagues at least sixty he stated maybe seventyfive seventyfive thought harvath to himself that was a hell of a lot more than the no more than ten usman had claimed that kid either needed a remedial arithmetic class or he was lying harvath felt pretty certain it was the latter he also wondered if the boy had been lying about delivering food to his flustricken relatives whatever the case harvath was suddenly glad he had taken asadoulahs advice and avoided the taliban buildings that dotted his original route you said you think you know where massoud and the russian may be replied harvath as he removed his map and spread it on the rug between himself and the elders please show me baseer studied the map and asked questions of the other members of the shura before responding here he said here is where massoud will be what is it asked harvath as he removed a pen and marked the location it is a high summer pasture for animal grazing very difficult to access especially this time of year there will still be much ice and snow there can you think of any place else massoud might have gone baseer smiled and swept his hands wide he has many subcommanders and many allies throughout afghanistan he could have left for pakistan the northwest frontier province the swat valley of course the old man was right massoud could be anywhere harvath massaged his eyes as he drew his fingers in to pinch the bridge of his nose his back was beginning to ache again and he wished hed brought more motrin with him but said the chief elder interrupting harvaths thoughts we dont think massoud went to any of those other places why not asked harvath because of the russian there are very few places the russian would be welcome without massoud the russian also was running a very big risk by taking the woman it was an act of desperation he needed to go someplace close someplace safe that he knew he could reach quickly it would have been someplace he knew that is why we believe he went to the pasture compound i thought you said it was very difficult to access difficult said baseer but not impossible if i was the russian it is where i would have gone daoud leaned over the map and after surveying it pointed just below where the pasture was located and added if this is where they went they would have passed through this village right here harvath studied the map again which means someone there would have noticed all of those vehicles passing through the interpreter nodded i know this village its not very big the people there definitely would have noticed for all harvath knew it could be a wildgoose chase but he was inclined to trust the intuition of the village elders whats more their read of how the russian would rationalize his moves made sense it was also the best lead they had harvath looked at gallagher do you have anything to add itd be great if the elders militia could escort us to where the cars are said baba g daoud translated the request and baseer was happy to oblige the men stood embraced and wished one another peace harvath gave baseer his afghan cell phone number and asked him to please call if he thought of or heard anything else about massoud the russian or most important julia gallo when they stepped out of the meeting room fayazs security detail snapped to their feet as they said goodbye and baseer told some of his men to escort the party back to their vehicles harvath could tell that the man hed locked eyes with earlier and who was calling for usman to cross the room and come to him was not happy but there was little he could do he had his orders and though harvath wanted to smirk or toss him a wink out of respect for the elders he kept his urge to be a smartass in check it was only a fleeting thought anyway his mind was already on where they were going and what he prayed theyd find there after putting their shoes on the group descended from the wooden structure and readied to head off toward the vehicles gallagher placed asadoulah close to his side harvath looked for usman but he was nowhere to be seen harvath figured that the kid had already run home to spin the story of being held at knifepoint into a saga of how he had singlehandedly fought off an entire battalion of bloodthirsty us soldiers after his father and brothers knocked the crap out of him for stretching the truth theyd run out and tell their friends this story but by then the american force would be upgraded to brigade strength at least that was of course if the men in usmans house didnt beat him unconscious for the shame he had brought upon them in accosting the american woman whod been even as a prisoner under mullah massouds protection however it happened harvath hoped the kid got a topnotch asskicking as they moved out of the copse of trees harvath pretended to be talking to gallagher as he raised fontaine over the radio convoy this is convoy do you read me loud and clear said the canadian were on our way down to the vehicles whats your position im in a hide about thirty meters from the trucks i already swept them no bombs theyre clean anything we need to be on the lookout for asked harvath its all quiet down here good what about the welcome wagon crew we laid out i got some cell phones said fontaine thats it no maps no radios nope none of that one of them had a couple of naughty pictures that looked like they were from an old playboy magazine though harvath marveled at the hypocrisy ancient statues of the buddha bad pictures of ms april not bad i can see you guys coming now said the former jtf operative ill hold here until everyone has mounted up dont go driving away without me dont worry said harvath the group entered the small clearing on the very edge of the village where gallaghers land cruiser and the two other vehicles had been parked with no need to deal with checkpoints on the way out of the village the vehicle assignments were changed the battered pickup truck was the lead vehicle and carried a mixture of elders and their security fayaz and asadoulah rode in the middle vehicle with the rest of the security team and harvath fontaine gallagher and daoud in the rear position once everyone was in their respective truck and the small column started moving harvath radioed fontaine and told him to come out and hop in as a precaution harvath stood next to the land cruiser with his weapon out and at the ready though he hadnt seen anyone hed felt eyes all over him since they had left the jirga and begun their walk down to the trucks if someone was going to try something now would be the time fontaine appeared out of the darkness on the other side of the makeshift parking lot and made his way to the land cruiser we all good he asked as he stood up on the running board and prepared to hop in back next to daoud harvath took one final look around and said i think so then lets roll sliding into the front passenger seat harvath closed the door but left it unlocked rolling his window down he balanced the suppressor of his mp on the windowsill and tried to twist his body in such a way that the seat wouldnt be jabbing into his sore back youre going to waste all of my heat said gallagher as he put the truck in gear and pressed on the gas to catch up with the vehicles in front of him its just until we clear the area so said fontaine how was the party did they serve tea for a moment harvath forgot about the throbbing in his lower back and the cold wind blowing through the window onto his face and he laughed yeah they did they also served up a nice juicy lead i think we may know where massoud and the russian took dr gallo thats excellent news replied fontaine are we going to go check it out or do you want to hand this thing off to the higherups harvath turned around to look into the backseat that depends on mr daoud wed need his help for a little bit longer fontaine put his muscular arm around the pudgy afghan what do you say it could be fun i most certainly disagree about it being fun said the interpreter but that does not mean we cannot come to some sort of an arrangement a diplomat and a capitalist said fontaine you ought to think about running for office harvath smiled as he turned back around in his seat and thought about rolling up his window suddenly he heard the distinct pressurized sound of gas releasing as a rocketpropelled grenade was launched he had barely yelled the words rpg when everyone in the land cruiser saw the lead vehicle explode in a roiling fireball chapter the white house washington dc i know its hard for female agents to get dates but please tell me that things havent gotten so bad that youve resorted to seeing hutch after her meeting with hutchinson elise had walked over to the white house to check the secret service duty roster and see if she could arrange for a couple more days off right now with so many unanswered questions she didnt feel that she could rejoin the presidents detail and do her job effectively turning around to see who was talking to her elise campbell discovered matthew porter a fortyyearold agent on terry aldens detail he was a decent guy with two kids and an attorney wife at the doj who processed fisa warrants what are you talking about asked elise dont bullshit me campbell said porter as he smiled and shook his head its written all over your face i dont know what youre talking about cmon i saw you two canoodling in lafayette park me and hutch stated elise youre crazy besides who even uses the term canoodling anyway whatever it was said porter it looked pretty

a dozen guys we could set you up with elise looked him right in the eyes so hed know she was serious matt theres nothing going on between me and hutch we were talking shop sure said porter as he made quotation marks in the air with his fingers talking shop without being crude that guyll nail anything that moves news flash matt that was crude porter shrugged you know what youre right its none of my business thank you i just have to admit i dont know what women see in him especially girls like you girls like me repeated campbell what is that supposed to mean i mean women who are not only out of hutchs league but out of his planet system it was an interesting remark and since porter had brought it up one that elise felt worth pursuing women like the first lady porter had a coffee cup in his hand and had made the mistake of just taking a sip though he tried to hold it in he coughed the coffee back into his cup are you fucking kidding me he laughed as he picked up a paper towel to wipe his mouth hutch and mrs alden now that would be incredible campbell looked around at the moment there was no one else in earshot so what did you mean then she asked i meant very goodlooking women like you porter replied awkwardly not that the first lady isnt attractive shes just elise put up her hand to stop him setting aside the first lady for the moment what other women were you referring to when you alluded to girls like me i feel like im getting grilled by my wife dont change the subject porter all right all right wow you dont have to be so touchy im not touchy replied elise i was just talking about some of the hot women hutch has managed to land i meant it as a compliment who are we talking about anyone id know what are we girlfriends all of a sudden asked porter i didnt come in here to gossip i just want some coffee porter you started this hey you were the one in the park with the guy and if youve got something going with him thats cool just be careful careful said elise porter dumped his coffee out and reached for a new cup the last hot chick hutch hooked up with ended up drinking herself into a stupor and slamming her car into oncoming traffic campbell knew hutchinson had been lying to her but she still had trouble believing what she was hearing are you talking about nikki hale she said her voice barely above a whisper yeah i am said porter and why are we whispering was she a friend of yours elise shook her head no she wasnt good for a second there i thought maybe id really put my foot in it how do you know he hooked up with her because i saw the two of them the night of the accident together asked elise no they were down on the beach doing semaphore of course together come on campbell elise grabbed hold of porters lapel and led him further away from the other agents in the room i want you to tell me everything you saw right now you know what said the agent as he removed his colleagues hand from his jacket i shouldnt have said anything i actually feel for the guy short of turning a woman gay i cant think of a worse thing that could happen lets just forget i said anything okay hutch has been through enough he hasnt even come close replied campbell not yet not by a long shot twenty minutes later elise campbell had finished her conversation with porter left the white house and was headed west on e street her blackberry pressed to her ear thats exactly why i called you she said elise you saw the whole file replied rita klees from her office in east hampton why would we screen a drunk driving victim to see if they had sex before they died especially with the budget cuts weve suffered we dont do that not without a reason and in this case there was no reason so pull an inspection report out of one of your other files or better yet get me a blank one i can fill in myself okay im hanging up now damn it rita help me out here elise what youre asking me for is began the detective trust me said campbell ill explain later just get that stuff for me please before klees could respond elise had already hung up though she hadnt yet figured out how she was going to navigate the minefield she was about to enter something in the back of her mind told her that she might have made a decent detective after all chapter nangarhar province afghanistan bullets began slamming into the land cruiser before the lead vehicle that had been hit by the rpg had even come back to the ground opening the driversside door gallagher grabbed his rifle and dumped out with harvath right on his heels fontaine leaped out the rear passenger door pulling the interpreter with him harvath was trying to identify the firing positions of their attackers when all of a sudden gallagher who had been crouched behind the tire right next to him yelled cover me over the din of heavy machinegun fire and ran for the middle vehicle as soon as he took off green tracer rounds began chewing up the dirt behind him it was as if someone had a phosphorescent marker and was trying to draw a line to him angry as hell at his friend but left with no other choice harvath rolled out from behind the left front tire of the land cruiser and began firing based on the tracer fire harvath could make out two distinct positions from which the beltfed machine guns were being fired when gallagher had made it to the second vehicle harvath rolled back behind the tire pulled out his nods and powered them up he could tell by where the rounds were hitting that their attackers knew they were hiding behind the tires on the opposite side of the land cruiser but because their attackers were higher up the hillside all they could do was shoot down they couldnt shoot through the tires or underneath the truck normally harvath would have seen that as a good thing the only problem was that they had taken out the lead vehicle with an rpg two more and they could take out the middle vehicle as well as the land cruiser the men had to do something fast sliding his nods on harvath looked at fontaine who had already done the same and nodded in unison both men rolled out from behind their tires and began firing at their attackers this time harvath had the advantage of his night vision goggles and could see what they were up against in the green glow of his nods the steep slope on the other side of the road looked like an anthill swarming with fighters armed with kalashnikovs there were at least seventy of them maybe even eighty these had to be massouds men and baseers count had been right on the money harvath also figured he knew who had tipped them off if that little shitbird usman suddenly stood up on the hillside and waved it wouldnt have surprised harvath at all firing the last round in his magazine he rolled back behind his tire they were pinned down they needed to get away from the vehicles to a more defensible position harvath glanced over at gallagher who was pressed up against the rear of fayazs suv with asadoulah and the chief elder pressed up right behind him as the two afghans took advantage of the limited cover provided by the rear passenger tire of the suv gallagher balanced his larue sniper rifle on the trucks back bumper and raked the hillside as far as harvath could tell none of the other people in the vehicle had survived we need to get the hell away from these trucks harvath yelled to fontaine if theyve got any more rpgs up there were going to get smoked fontaine nodded what do you want to do about thirty meters down on this side of the road is an old mud hut i saw it when we came in its not perfect but its a hell of a lot better than this all right said the canadian as he readied the interpreter to run ill stay here and provide cover fire no replied harvath as he inserted a fresh magazine into his mp youre not getting paid enough to bring up the rear then how about a raise the afghan capitalist got the rest of my money now take him and get over to gallaghers position ill cover you roger that said fontaine who after signaling to gallagher what he was about to do grabbed hold of the interpreter when i say go i want you to stay low and run as fast as you can to that other truck over there do you understand daoud nodded okay one two three go as the two men took off running harvath rolled back out and began firing again from fayazs suv gallagher did the same thing paying special attention to the two heavy machinegun positions when he had once again exhausted his ammo he rolled back behind the tire ejected the spent magazine and inserted a fresh one it didnt take a military strategist to realize that even with very carefully placed shots they were still going to need more ammo after checking to make sure fontaine and daoud had made it safely harvath moved to the land cruisers rear passenger door and flung it open even on this side it was riddled with the holes of bullets that had passed straight through from the other side the seats were shredded their springs visible in many spots harvath pulled the release and tried to flip down the seat nearest him but it wouldnt budge leaping back from the truck as another barrage of fire literally made it rock back and forth harvath hid behind the tire and questioned how much he was willing to risk to get that extra ammunition it wasnt a tough decision gallaghers truck was a bullet magnet if he climbed in there again to reach over the seats to get what he needed hed be cut to ribbons and if the threat of another rpg hit wasnt bad enough harvath had just been given another very compelling reason to get the hell away from the land cruiser the gas tank had been ruptured and he could now smell gasoline moving up to the front tire harvath motioned to gallagher and fontaine that he was ready to roll with his mp slung over his shoulder he waited for their signal and when it came harvath sprinted out from behind the cover of gallaghers suv and ran faster than he had ever run before in his life despite the cover fire being laid down for him the dusty road exploded in a hail of enemy gunfire throwing rock chips and clumps of dirt high into the air as the bullets snapped and whistled around him harvath could almost feel the heat from the tracer rounds chasing him like a lit fuse as he skidded to a stop behind fayazs suv it sounded like the worlds largest hornets nest had been stirred all of the enemy gunfire was now being focused on this one rapidly deteriorating piece of cover though harvath was out of breath he knew they needed to move now he looked at fayaz daoud and asadoulah and saw that they had stripped the dead security men in the suv of their weapons and were now all armed three more guns in the fight he hoped they were good shooters with their limited supply of ammo now was not the time to spray and pray they were going to have to be deadon tackdrivers looking at gallagher harvath said you and fontaine take the afghans and get moving for that hut i dont think thats such a good idea gallagher said dont worry im going to create a diversion replied harvath as he nodded toward gallaghers chewedup land cruiser i hope your insurance is all paid up thats not what im talking about said gallagher pointing at his leg i think youre going to have to leave me here harvath flipped up his nods and looked down a bullet had torn through gallaghers upper thigh and blood was pumping out of the wound i need a tourniquet harvath yelled now theres no time said gallagher bullshit there isnt he replied fontaine right here replied the canadian as he appeared with a length of seatbelt he had cut out of the suv as they positioned gallaghers leg to get the makeshift device in position he leaned forward and harvath noticed that he had also taken a round through the top of his left shoulder gallagher must have seen the look on harvaths face as he leaned him back against the trucks rear tire what is it he asked nothing we need to get out of here harvath pulled out a spent magazine slid it through the seatbelt knot and used it to tighten down the tourniquet the old marine grimaced in pain but didnt make a sound within seconds the bleeding had stopped harvath helped gallagher lie down on his stomach for a superman carry he placed daoud between baba gs legs to carry them like a wheelbarrow and then motioned asadoulah and fontaine to each of his outstretched arms fontaine took gallaghers right arm because as he would be required to hook his left arm under it to help carry the man it would leave his right hand free for shooting shouldering his mp so he could use gallaghers larue harvath positioned himself against the suvs back bumper and gave the go command in unison the three men bent and picked up gallagher while harvath began firing at massouds men on the hillside with fayaz in the lead they began running toward the mud hut as they did harvath turned his attention away from their attackers and onto the leaking land cruiser when the lucky round finally found its mark the suv exploded sending a brilliant flash and a towering pillar of fire into the night chapter whether massouds soldiers knew where they were headed or not harvath and his team were dogged the entire way by wildly fired shots many of which came incredibly close winston churchills famous line notwithstanding there was absolutely nothing exhilarating about being shot at even if your enemy was missing the rundown mud brick hut the team finally took shelter in only had three pockmarked walls and was missing its roof but it was definitely a step up in the cover it afforded next to a stack of waterfilled jerry cans there was nothing better at blast attenuation in the middle of nowhere than a thick mud wall making gallagher as comfortable as possible harvath checked his wounds again so far the tourniquet on his leg was working it was the bullet through his shoulder he was most worried about gallaghers breathing had become labored and harvath was concerned that he had dropped a lung even so he sought to reassure his friend youre going to be okay he said in that case why dont you get me a beer as soon as the waitress comes back with my onion rings gallagher laughed and coughed up blood confirming harvaths worst fears if the man didnt get medical attention soon he wasnt going to make it leaving him in the care of the afghans harvath stepped over to fontaine who was keeping watch out of one of the crumbling windows theyre going to be on us any minute said the canadian i know replied harvath lets get hold of west and have his combat controller call in some close air support how are we going to mark our position ive got a couple of fireflies said harvath removing an infrared marking beacon from his pocket it was made by the same cejay company as his fingerlight and looked like a small plastic ice cube when snapped onto a ninevolt battery it emitted an infrared strobe so bright it could be picked up by overhead aircraft and even certain us government satellites everyone in the spec ops community used combat id marking beacons it didnt matter if you were american canadian british or whomever the goal was to help id your position so that you werent mistaken for the enemy they also allowed downed pilots and operators caught in unfriendly territory to be more easily located and rescued they were a great way to mark a structure you might want to come back to you could also use them to track a vehicle and harvath even had a small spool of trip wire he could use to set one off if someone crept inside his perimeter the fireflies were the swiss army knife of night operations and harvath was glad to have snatched a couple from the golden conex clicking the cubes onto their ninevolt batteries harvath placed one on top of the wall at each corner then he took up the watch while fontaine turned on his radio switched to the canadians frequency and tried to reach captain west i dont care if its a glider with water balloons fontaine said once he had reached the man and detailed their position and situation get hold of j air at bagram and tell them to send whatever theyve got tell them this is an emergency cas mission for roper six nine were also going to need a medevac ive got a man down multiple gsws west put fontaine on hold while he spoke with his combat controller and then radioed the operations and planning unit at bagram air base who were responsible for air support daoud walked over and stood on the other side of the window from harvath with one of the aks do you know how to use that thing asked harvath yes replied the interpreter good single shots only and choose them carefully we could be here a long time daoud nodded if you want mr gallaghers night vision goggles go ask hes not going to be using them the interpreter began to walk away but then stopped mr gallagher saved asadoulahs life the bullets that hit him were meant for the boy and would have killed him if mr gallagher had not acted fayaz too he is a brave man a good man like you youre mistaken mr daoud said harvath im not that brave and im not that good the interpreter smiled i think you are i also think that if we survive this i will help you find the woman you are looking for i dont need any more money from you you can give mine to mr fontaine dont worry about fontaine harvath replied as he tightened his grip on gallaghers rifle ill make sure he gets taken care of now go get those goggles i think i see movement out there as daoud walked back over to baba g harvath began to ask fontaine what the holdup was but the canadian motioned for him to hold on roger that he said over the radio weve got two ir strobes on top of our position theres at least seventyfive taliban along the face of the hill two hundred meters directly west of us in between us and them are three vehicles two of which are on fire after listening to the response fontaine replied copy that and turned back to harvath weve got a spectre gunship inbound how long until theyre on target fifteen mikes howd you get the call sign roper six nine asked harvath thats not my call sign said fontaine as he shook his head it belongs to someone i know on an american special operations team hes got highpriority access and well get bumped right to the top of the list for air support coopting someone elses call sign was the kind of outsidethebox thinking harvath could appreciate bringing fontaine along had absolutely been the right thing to do looking back out the window harvath detected movement again this time he was certain of it massouds men were closing in it was going to be the longest fifteen minutes of their lives what about the medevac for gallagher harvath asked as he flipped up his nods and focused his rifle on a group of taliban creeping forward there were only so many places he and his team could have run and harvath wasnt surprised at how quickly they had homed in on them west has permission to disengage and roll his company to our location theyre going to establish an lz at the bottom of the road a medevac bird is right behind the spectre lets do this then said harvath who chose the biggest taliban member in the approaching pack took aim exhaled and squeezed his trigger as the mans head exploded in a shower of blood bone and pink flesh his associates hit the ground and began firing their weapons the fight was back on chapter when harvath finally allowed the three afghans to start firing he and fontaine were running desperately low on ammo enemy tracer rounds lit up the night and the taliban machinegun fire had begun eating away at the little mud hut since they retreated to the structure massouds men had fired two rpgs at their position one had hit the side of the structure and failed to detonate and the other had just missed detonating against the sheer rock face behind them with a deafening blast and a shower of splintered rock the first of their weapons to run dry was gallaghers sniper rifle harvath was now down to half a mag for his mp and the ac gunship had yet to arrive massouds taliban soldiers had moved their heavy beltfed machine guns down from the hillside and had set up on top of the road not far from the burning trucks another contingent had split off in an attempt to flank them but harvath and fontaine had immediately put down that attack to his credit gallagher repeatedly asked to be propped up in the window so he could get in on the action he didnt like being sidelined when they were so outnumbered the first two times harvath told him no but at the third request he began to seriously consider it they were going to be down to fighting with their pistols very soon harvath would have given his entire fee for this assignment for a box of ammo or a couple of frag grenades as they began shooting the three afghans amazed harvath with both their discipline and their accuracy especially the chief elder this was obviously not fayazs first gun battle though they werent expert marksmen by any stretch of the imagination the trio had managed to inflict a respectable number of casualties even though it felt like they had been fighting for hours the afghans seemed to run out of ammunition way too soon one by one their weapons fell silent and the men stepped away from their firing positions and sat down whether they were simply trying to stay out of the way of harvath and fontaine who were still fighting or had resigned themselves to what they felt was the inevitable harvath had no idea then his own weapon fell quiet he leaned his mp in the corner next to him and switched to his glock fontaine continued to calmly relay their increasing need for close air support to the canadian combat controller in the armored column that was racing to get to their location outside the window harvath could see taliban crawling all over in another minute theyd be overrun raising his pistol harvath fired and nailed one of the soldiers in the throat dropping him gurgling to the ground one minute fontaine finally yelled when he got word the spectre gunship was almost on station we dont have one minute harvath yelled back suddenly there was the sound of a pistol being fired behind them harvath and fontaine spun to see that gallagher had drawn his taurus and capped two taliban who somehow despite the sheer rock wall their structures missing fourth wall opened up to had managed to breach the rear of their perimeter tell the waitress to hurry up with my beer gallagher managed to croak out before being overcome by a fit of bloody coughing fayaz tried to relieve gallagher of his pistol but the marine would have none of it get your own gun he said the red froth building at the corners of his mouth the chief elder seemed to understand the joke giving the injured man a small smile he sat down next to him and helped him support the weight of the weapon as they kept watch for any more taliban who might try to sneak up on them from behind thirty seconds yelled fontaine harvath surveyed the short distance that separated them from their enemy and doubletapping another approaching taliban he yelled back over the sound of gunfire this is going to be close fifteen seconds everyone take cover when the heavily armed ac spectre gunship joined the fight the effect was obvious and instantaneous specifically designed for ground attack the heavily armed aircraft was one of the most devastating pieces of weaponry that could be brought to bear on the battlefield when it came to what specific weapons were used it was dealers choice meaning that harvath was able to relay through fontaine and the canadian combat controller exactly what he wanted because the taliban were not only on the hillside but also rapidly encroaching on their position harvath was very precise though the spectres mm gatling gun could crank out eighteen hundred rounds a minute the fire could be wildly inaccurate harvath had been in this position before and he knew exactly what he wanted the thirteenperson crew of the spectre call sign flash announced their arrival to the party with two earsplitting mm m howitzer rounds fired directly into the top of the rocky hillside it had exactly the effect harvath had hoped fora rock slide that sent a mob of taliban tumbling assovereyelids downhill in a panicked hundredyard dash to get to safety when the taliban started running thats when harvaths second request was put into action in the space of thirty seconds the spectres rapidfire singlebarreled mm bofors cannon rained down a deadly hail of devastating rounds taliban soldiers were sliced in half their bodies left to peel off and collapse in two different directions limbs were scattered in multiple directions and the entire hillside as well as all of the earth up to only a few meters from the structure where harvath and his team were taking cover was completely shredded it looked like a stampede of ten thousand horses all shod with razor blades had come barreling through and had cut down everything in their path the only thing left behind was the smell of burnt earth and charred flesh hanging in the air high overhead the ac flew in a racetracklike orbit the spectre is going to stay on station right asked harvath as he crept back to the window with his glock and peered out with his nods are you kidding me said fontaine flash has a brandnew crew this is the first time theyve loosed any steel on the taliban half of them are probably uploading the video of that first volley to their myspace pages right now so were good for another rake we can have as many as we want tonight until they either run out of ammo or run out of fuel my moneys on their running out of ammo are you seeing anything out there i need to draw their attention to harvath strained his ears once more there are definitely people still alive out there im hearing voices just north of us roger that said fontaine as he went back to communicating with captain wests combat controller over the radio he repeated that they had danger close and that the spectre crew was clear to use their own night vision to engage any targets outside the mud brick building with the ir strobes atop fontaine then turned back and said thirty seconds harvath instructed everyone to take cover again and crawled away from the window when flash reengaged they did so once again with a vengeance from their bofors after the spectre ceased firing harvath retook his post at the window he couldnt hear or see anything moving outside fontaine spoke with the canadian combat controller again and then joined him flash says were the only thing they can still see moving but theyre going to remain on station for us he said good how about that helicopter asked harvath wests team is en route eta is less than five minutes theyll have the lz secured and the helo will be on the ground by the time we get to the bottom of the road theyre sending two lavs up to meet us with their medic right thats affirmative replied fontaine harvath looked at gallagher and said are you ready to rock and roll buddy baba g attempted a smile and flashed harvath a halfhearted thumbsup raising his arm caused him to start coughing pink froth again they didnt have a lot of time and while harvath didnt like the idea of moving him he liked the idea of wasting what little time gallagher might have even less with harvath covering him daoud crept out the back of the mud hut and retrieved the weapons of the two taliban gallagher had killed there was no comfortable way to carry gallagher with his collapsed lung all they could do for him was to try to get him back up to the road as quickly and as safely as possible harvath opted for the superman carry again but this time instead of fontaine manning baba gs right arm fayaz insisted it be him he considered it an honor harvath nodded and he and fontaine switched places while not exceptionally fast harvath figured the old man was probably up to the task and for the little amount of speed they were giving up they were gaining a lot more security having fontaine free to accurately fire one of the aks daoud had just retrieved instead of relying on his pistol while carrying gallagher would make a big difference removing his knife harvath cut two strips of fabric from asadoulahs patoo he then retrieved the two ir strobes and secured one to baba g and the other to daoud he wanted everyone especially the canadian troops and the american air force crew of flash to be able to see their party through their night vision devices and know that these were the good guys once everyone was ready fontaine radioed the canadian combat controller that they were about to move and then harvath gave the actual command to move out five meters outside the mud hut the carnage was instantly evident dead taliban were everywhere had flash taken even a few seconds more to get there harvath and his team would have been totally overrun as they moved toward the road harvath reminded himself to scan and breathe scan and breathe though he found it difficult to imagine that anyone could have survived two passes by the spectre it wasnt impossible when they finally reached the road the scent of burnt flesh and scorched earth was replaced by the smell of the exploded vehicles the noxious black smoke a stomachchurning mixture of charred metal flaming tires and burning gasoline was carried on the wind to the place where they now took cover how far out is west asked harvath as he tried to help position gallagher so he didnt have to breathe the fumes fontaine spoke into his radio and replied theyve got two lavs securing the lz and the other two coming up the road right now harvath collected both ir strobes and used one to mark their exact position he crept out from behind their cover and placed the second in the middle of the road less than a minute later he heard the roar of the enormous canadian lavs as they thundered up the road all of wests men were switched on and ready to fight the lav gunners watched for any sign of movement while the rest of the soldiers poured out onto the road and took up defensive firing positions a stretcher was rushed over and gallagher was placed upon it immediately the medic went to work assessing his injuries he then took his vitals while another canadian soldier started an iv the medic studied the makeshift tourniquet and as it was doing its job decided to leave it in place he then turned his attention to baba gs other wound cutting away gallaghers jacket and tunic they then removed his armor and the medic cut through his tshirt beneath fully exposing baba gs left side though his pulse was thready the medic gave him a couple of ccs of morphine anyway and then applied a topical anesthetic to the space between his ribs where he was going to need to open him up this is going to hurt he said to the marine and then asked harvath and fontaine as well as two other canadian soldiers to help hold him down when the medic used the scalpel to slice between gallaghers second and third ribs the mans body seized he was on minimal morphine and though the procedure was incredibly painful he didnt cry out the medic worked quickly inserting the chest tube and feeding it into gallaghers collapsed lung as soon as the tube was in place the medic began his line medevac procedure calling out the patient details to a radio operator who fed them to the inbound helicopter pilots over the medical freq and told them everything they needed to know about their landing zone as well as the patient they were going to be transporting once the medic had gallaghers lung reinflated he informed his superior that they were ready to move the patient the lavs were an extremely tight squeeze but they managed to get everyone inside and once the hatches were closed they took off for the landing zone at the bottom of the road sitting atop a marker panel with twin door gunners the two other canadian lavs and the balance of captain wests team for added security was a uhq black hawk its rotors were hot and its crew ready to transport gallagher to the trauma bay of the craig jointtheater hospital at bagram air base fontaine and harvath helped load gallagher aboard the bird as they did baba g opened his mouth and tried to speak harvath had trouble hearing him over the roar of the helicopter blades chopping up the night air he bent down so his ear was just above the mans mouth get asadoulah back to his village fayaz too said gallagher i will said harvath as he took his friends hand and gave it a squeeze baba g squeezed back and added dont be a cowboy if you cant get gallo out safely make the trade sir interrupted the flight medic addressing harvath we need to get going harvath let go of gallaghers hand and said to the medic you take care of him will do sir said the man harvath flashed gallagher a final thumbsup and stepped away from the chopper joining fontaine near one of the canadian lavs he watched as the black hawk medevac lifted off and headed toward bagram they never saw anyone else from the village no matter how honorable its inhabitants were they all knew better than to involve themselves in a taliban firefight once the chopper was clear captain west approached and pointing at harvath and fontaine said i dont know what the fuck is going on but unless you two have a phone number for a taliban taxi service youd better start talking or im going to leave both of your asses right here chapter washington dc elise campbell had several pieces of the puzzle but no matter how she spun them she still couldnt get them to fit together the night nikki hale died she might or might not have been drinking with the president whatever the case when she left according to max holland she didnt appear drunk todd hutchinson was the next to see her and he claimed the same thing she might have been a little flushed when she left but she didnt tumble down the stairs or weave on her way out the door so according to him he had no way of knowing if she was drunk this despite the fact that she had apparently been drinking with the first lady but the most inexplicable pieces of the puzzle were porters accusation that hutchinson and hale had something going on between them and the fact that hutchinson had looked elise right in the face and lied to her she was certain of it those microexpressions hadnt been a figment of her imagination porter claimed to have seen them groping each other by the garage that night just as nikki hale was leaving hed also seen them exchange a very intense kiss setting aside the fact that such behavior from a secret service agent especially while on duty was incredibly unprofessional if porter was telling the truth then hutchinson had to have known how wasted she was even so he still let her go that night why and what was the presidents role in all of this what had he done that stephanie gallo could threaten to bring down his presidency with somehow he had not been honest about the events of that night elise had hoped she could ferret out the information from witness statements in the police reports but with hale dead none had been taken elises attention then shifted to the people who could fill in the blanks as she couldnt directly confront the president she had approached max and he had pointed her toward hutch and because of that another piece of the puzzle had been set on the table by matt porter still elises intuition kept drawing her back to the president gallo had accused him of being involved in nikki hales death and participating in a coverup a coverup by definition was an attempt to obscure or divert attention from the facts in the absence of any statements made to the police there was only one other way elise could imagine the president might have attempted to conceal what had happened that night a fortyfiveminute meeting with nikki hale regardless of what they had been doing and even if they had been drinking would not be enough to lose alden the presidency and as damaging as an affairs becoming public might be it wouldnt be enough to force him from office to lose the presidency a crime would have to have been committed and even then it might not be enough to completely shove him out for that to happen the crime would have to be so scandalous that even someone as masterful with the press as alden was couldnt spin it but elise campbell still believed that president alden was a good man despite what people wanted to pin on him and the aspersions they loved to cast having an attractive woman in charge of your internet campaign wasnt a crime nor was having a beautiful and powerful donor cum media ally just because he had working relationships with attractive women didnt mean he was sleeping with them elise looked down at the telephone number christine de palma had texted her from east hampton along with it was a fiveword message hes waiting for your call highlighting the digits campbell selected the option to dial and waited three rings later herb coleman answered the phone at his home in naples florida mr coleman this is elise campbell christine de palma told you i would be calling yes she did said herb coleman he had a calm and relaxing voice id ask you what i can do for you but chris already explained everything to me i want to make sure that you also know that this is all off the record and you are under no obligation to speak with me but youre operating within your capacity as a secret service agent so this is somewhat official isnt it elise took a deep breath mr coleman i wouldnt blame you if you hung up on me right now ms de palma was very clear that your settlement agreement with mrs gallo and president ald senator alden corrected coleman he wasnt president yet when all of this happened correct he was not yet president when this happened nevertheless as part of your settlement youre required not to talk about the case in any way agent campbell im not going to the papers with any of this and from what i understand youve got your own reasons for playing things pretty close to the vest alden was under oath when he responded to those interrogatories at the beginning of our lawsuit against him if he lied in any of them then thats a felony thats pretty damn serious but from a court of public appearance perspective itll be a supernova if he did so to cover up what happened that night to our son our daughterinlaw and our two little grandchildren so youre prepared to read me the presidents answers to your interrogatories i am said herb coleman and i hope youre sitting down i think youre going to find this very interesting chapter nangarhar province afghanistan the name of the village they were headed to was dagar which in pashtu meant open space it also meant battlefield which harvath hoped wasnt going to turn out to be prophetic as per captain west it had been fontaines idea to mushroom him and as much as harvath regretted having to feed the guy so much bs and keep him in the dark they had no choice until julia gallo was recovered operational security was of primary importance this wasnt the first time harvath had lied to get what he needed it was just how the game worked if west had been in his shoes he would have done the same thing sometimes the ends did in fact justify the means it was the height of moral folly to play by a set of selfimposed rules when your enemy played by none whatsoever while harvath would readily admit that rules were important there were also times when they werent and this was one of them harvath stuck to the same story they had told west in the beginning and kept his embellishments as simple as possible from there while they did get their interpreter out of the first village he informed them the alqaeda bomber they were after had fled they had proceeded to massouds village to gather more info on the bomber and his taliban accomplice only to be ambushed on their way out now they wanted to hit dagar in the hopes of getting up to massouds summer grazing pasture to confirm that the bomber was there and either take the men into custody or call in another airstrike to make sure they never carried out another attack whether west fully believed harvath was beside the point wiping out seventyplus taliban fighters and helping to weaken a local taliban commander was a good thing regardless of who got the credit for it taking out forty or fifty more would only run up the score and make for a much better night west only wished his men could help understanding that he couldnt roll his armored column right through dagar and that even if he could hed have considerable difficulty actually getting his men to the final objective captain chris west proved that he and the canadians were true partners in the international war on terror by offering harvath anything else he needed harvath eagerly accepted the help west and his team transported them back to asadoulahs village where fayaz provided a toyota pickup truck and offered to send along as many armed men as the vehicle could carry while the idea of having extra men was appealing harvath declined he did though accept the truck and promised to have it returned as soon as he was done it was exceedingly generous of fayaz considering the fact that the village had just lost two vehicles in a firefight and would need to return to reclaim their dead from the canadians harvath took as much ammo for gallaghers sniper rifle the mps and his and fontaines pistols as could be spared he also changed out the batteries in their nods and was extragrateful when west handed them several fragmentation grenades daoud knew dagar so they let him drive the truck while harvath rode shotgun and fontaine sat in back so how do you know dagar asked harvath as they drove i have a friend there said the interpreter we grew up in the same refugee camp in pakistan we used to play cricket together would your friend be willing to help us he is a good man replied daoud he doesnt like alqaeda and he does not like the taliban he will help us i hope he can help us to some coffee fontaine added from the backseat harvath looked at his watch and then rubbed his eyes it was well after midnight his back was throbbing again and he was out of motrin baba gs med kit had gone up in flames with his land cruiser the only things he wanted as much as finding julia gallo were a hot shower a stiff drink and a soft bed in fact despite how grimy he was hed be glad to forgo the shower and move right to the drink and the bed in order not to focus on his fatigue he tried to envision again what julia gallo was going through the fact that she had scratched her initials into her previous cell meant that she had remembered her training that was a good sign harvath hoped she also remembered the part about keeping her spirits up and not allowing herself to slip into depression as she imagined the worst that might befall her it was an easy lesson to teach but much more difficult to actually put into practice as the truck with its wornout shocks bounced and jostled toward dagar harvath closed his eyes and allowed his mind to rest he knew all too well that the next couple of hours were going to be extremely tense and most likely extremely dangerous fontaine and daoud seemed to be thinking the same thing as both men were silent for the rest of the ride a deep pothole a kilometer outside the village drew harvaths mind back to the here and now im sorry about that said daoud i couldnt avoid it thats okay replied harvath are we close yes were very close now fontaine said harvath looking into the backseat you up no replied the canadian too bad i think i just saw a molson sign well when you see one for labatts well stop until then leave me alone harvath smiled turned back around and checked his weapon knowing full well fontaine was doing the same he was an exceptional operator and like harvath was now percent switched on turning to daoud harvath said are you ready to make the call the interpreter nodded and pulled out his phone scrolling through the address book as he balanced it on the steering wheel he found the number and connected the call within two rings his old cricket pal was on the other end and they were chatting as if daoud had called him in the middle of the day rather than the middle of the night at one point the chubby interpreter began laughing eventually he rang off and slid the phone back into his pocket is everything okay asked harvath fine said daoud with a smile he is waiting for us at his home harvath wondered if daoud had extended an apology for waking up his friends wife then he remembered where he was tia chapter daouds boyhood friend was a short whipthin man named reshteen he had widely set brown eyes a flat thick nose and a bushy beard dyed henna red he ushered his guests into his home and quickly shut the door behind them they removed their shoes and entered the living room where two of reshteens young sons were laying out small dishes of cold food and a pot of warm tea the room was lit by a small oil lamp which threw off just about as much heat as the old rusted stove in the corner they had come up considerably in altitude and harvath could feel the cold seeping right into his bones despite the clothing he was wearing daoud and reshteen spoke for several minutes while harvath studied their faces he could follow the direction of their conversation simply by their expressions he had always been good at reading people but his time at the secret service had taken him to a completely different level he could tell they were talking about massoud and the taliban now both men had become very serious daoud was doing most of the talking while reshteen seemed to respond only with oneor twoword answers turning to harvath daoud stated the men passed through here in two groups several hours apart but they all went to the same place the grazing pasture replied harvath the interpreter nodded flash had done a highaltitude pass on their way back to bagram and had relayed everything back over the radio to fontaine as they made their way to dagar if reshteen had said that the taliban werent here or that he hadnt seen anything then they would have had a problem so far so good did he see dr gallo an american woman with red hair in one of the first trucks that came through there were two women in burkas two women did the taliban have more than one female hostage had they brought along a woman to watch over dr gallo harvath doubted it watching julia was the job of massouds retarded brother zwak most likely the russian had put julia in a burka to disguise her appearance and had dressed up zwak or one of massouds other men in a burka as well that way theyd be a lot less obvious people would remember a bunch of taliban riding around with one woman but two was less suspicious especially when they were trying to make their getaway as discreetly as possible that was what harvath would do and he was willing to bet the russian thought along the same lines just for clarification harvath asked do the taliban normally bring women with them no they dont replied daoud they also never come at this time of year that was enough for harvath what he needed now was someone to guide them to a position where they could observe massouds camp without being discovered he put the question to daoud and waited for the man to speak with reshteen and translate his response he says it is impossible the interpreter finally responded the road passes through a narrow canyon and the pasture is surrounded by sheer cliffs there has got to be some way only if you come over the mountain from the other side but even then there are very few places to hide massoud chose the location very carefully the pasture abuts part of the tora bora cave complex offered harvath do any of the caves interconnect could we somehow approach that way the interpreter spoke with his friend after a brief exchange daoud reported some of the villagers know the caves but none of them will go into them for fear of booby traps they say only the alqaeda know which tunnels are truly safe on a whim harvath asked about the lake of broken glass and if reshteen had ever heard of it or seen anyone in the area with scuba equipment na the man answered harvath wasnt surprised it would have been the ultimate irony if massoud and the russian had gone to all this trouble only to discover theyd been sitting atop bin ladens pot of gold the entire time fontaine nudged harvath whats the lake of broken glass its a wives tale replied harvath something that might have to do with where bin laden hid his money whered you hear about it like i said its a wives tale replied harvath who despite all of fontaines help still had no desire to read him in on how he and gallagher had snatched mustafa khan from the afghan government changing the subject harvath ran through their options once more aloud now since theres only one road into massouds camp that doesnt sound like it is going to work for us the tunnels are too dangerous and we couldnt find a guide even if we wanted one theres only sparse cover on the rock faces around the pasture and to get to those weve got to come over the mountains from the other side at this point it sounds like that is our only option maybe not replied daoud who had been simultaneously translating as harvath spoke he waited for reshteen to finish saying something to him and then stated there may be a way you can use the road what do you mean reshteen spoke for several more moments and then daoud said as i told you my friend does not like the taliban or alqaeda neither do the people of his village but they are not stupid if he helps you he knows what could happen to him and the rest of the people in dagar please tell your friend that i dont like alqaeda or the taliban either and i am willing to make this worth his while but we have to keep this quiet i dont want to run this through his shura were too close now daoud smiled he does not want to run it through his shura either so what does he want he wants the summer grazing pasture does he want me to help buy it for him replied harvath because it is not mine to give daouds smile remained as he said i have told him of your relationship with massouds shura and in particular with the elder baseer this grazing pasture once belonged to reshteens grandfather but he lost it to the taliban when he couldnt pay his debts reshteens family still graze their flocks there in the summer but massoud charges very heavy fees for it after what you did to massouds men already this evening i have told reshteen that i have every confidence you can do so again if you defeat massoud you will be able to convince baseer to return the pasture to its rightful owner first of all said harvath pointing at his own eyes to emphasize the point i only want to go up there to look for the woman replied daoud exactly once we confirm that she is indeed there well consider our options and decide what our next move should be na na na replied reshteen as daoud translated whats wrong he says he has an idea but you would have to leave very soon something like this was extremely dangerous to rush into lets hear his idea first daoud spoke to reshteen and then listened as the man laid out his plan then he relayed the information to harvath there are many taliban up at massouds camp at least forty men they came in a hurry with very little supplies they have no fuel for cooking or heating the buildings there they have no food and no water a smile spread across harvaths face and let me guess he said they asked reshteen to gather these things and bring them to them daouds head bobbed from side to side and he turned his palms upward they asked reshteens cousins but it is the same thing reshteen will be one of the men traveling up to the camp to deliver the supplies will he take us with him asked harvath if you promise him you will take care of massoud and that he will get the pasture he will take you harvath who was sitting across from the afghans leaned forward and said once i have the girl i guarantee you i will take care of massoud and once that is done i will do everything in my power to get that grazing pasture returned to his family or i will buy him another even better pasture as daoud translated reshteen tugged at his red beard slowly a smile began to form at the edges of his lips when the man finally nodded indicating they had a deal harvath said now lets talk about how exactly reshteen is going to get us up there chapter annandale virginia elise campbell took a deep breath and knocked on todd hutchinsons faded front door when he didnt answer she began knocking louder finally a shadow passed behind the peephole and there was the scrape of the chain being undone followed by the sound of the dead bolt unlocking hutchinson must have been down in his basement working out campbell he said standing there in a pair of gym shorts and a tight tshirt what are you doing here elise had never before noticed how well built her colleague was we need to talk she said as she brushed past him and entered his home uninvited come on in i guess said hutch as he closed and locked the door behind her campbell had purposefully worked herself into a lather on the drive down from dc the more emotional she appeared the harder it would be for him to read her whyd you lie to me wait a second calm down what are you talking about im talking about you and nikki hale hutchinson was about to say something but then stopped himself abandoning his response he asked what about me and nikki hale do you think im stupid hutch did you think nobody was going to know know what demanded the man youre talking in circles the night nikki hale died you had sex with her no sooner had the accusation sprung from her lips than the microexpression campbell had witnessed in lafayette park was back on hutchinsons face youre out of your mind he stated really bluffed campbell removing the suffolk county medical examiners form from her pocket not only were you dumb enough to screw her you were dumb enough to leave your dna behind hutchinson snatched the form away from her thats insane let me see that ive got a witness that saw you playing grabass with her near the guesthouse who never mind who did you and nikki have an ongoing relationship or was this just a onenighter this is bullshit said hutchinson as he crumpled the mes form and tossed it across the room i want you to leave if this is all bullshit youve got nothing to lose by answering my questions do you whats the point youve already made up your mind the point is five people died that night and you know something youre not telling me if i have to drag your relationship with nikki hale into the light of day to get some answers believe me im going to do it hutchinson grabbed the back of his neck with his right hand and lowered his eyes to the floor youve got thirty seconds hutch said campbell it was a mistake he said walking over to his couch and sitting down she came on to me i guess that should have told me right there how wasted she was so you were with her said elise hutchinson nodded you left mrs alden alone no campbell remained standing and looked down at him youre not making any sense the presidents detail was with her how is that possible you said alden didnt show up at the guesthouse until after hale had left that night i lied her read of him had been right what else did you lie to me about hutchinson raised his eyes i dont want to lose my job elise right about now id say thats the least of your problems youre probably right tell me what happened that night hutchinson took a deep breath nikki hale had been upstairs at the guesthouse with the first lady drinking yes after a while things got heated and they began arguing right about then the president showed up what happened he went upstairs and the argument got worse nikki stormed out of the room she was mad as hell the first lady yelled at the president to make up his mind either nikki was history or she was so they were having an affair hutchinson nodded as nikki came down the stairs she had a few choice words for both of them alden had left his agents outside i was the only one in the guesthouse he saw me and told me to take hale to her car and make sure she got the hell off the estate did the president know she was drunk he and mrs alden both did but they didnt care they wanted her gone and you had an opportunity to take advantage of her said campbell the disdain evident in her voice no i wanted to find her a ride home hutchinson replied i was walking her back to the main house and the kiss just happened she was pissed off at alden and she wanted to get back at him i shouldnt have let it happen it was unprofessional about as unprofessional as putting a woman that intoxicated into her car and sending her off into the night said campbell i told you i was trying to find her a ride she didnt believe him he would have done anything the aldens asked him to and now she knew why hed been allowed to stay on the first ladys detail im serious hutchinson continued we were on our way to the main house when alden came up behind us nikki had left her purse behind alden was still fuming and he flung it at her they began arguing again i tried to tell him that we needed to get her a ride home and he told me to return to my post or hed have me fired and you chose to follow orders instead of stopping alden from sending that girl off drunk to kill herself and the coleman family once again hutchinson lowered his eyes to the floor there were a million things she wanted to say to the pathetic excuse for a man sitting in front of her but she couldnt bear the sight of him anymore besides he wasnt the one she needed to settle this with the man she needed to confront was president robert alden chapter nangarhar province afghanistan even though reshteen had lined the space with blankets harvath and fontaine lay in the bed of his truck freezing to death they were also dangerously close to running out of time for their plan to work they had to get in and get out of the camp before sunrise they had been hidden beneath a mountain of carefully stacked gear which had then been lashed down with ropes as the truck fishtailed up the icy roadway it hit pothole after pothole and harvath began to worry less about being discovered and executed by one of massouds soldiers and more about being crushed beneath the ton of taliban cargo swaying above them theirs was one of three trucks making the supply run up to massouds outpost the taliban commander had ordered up enough supplies for two weeks if they didnt take advantage of this opportunity it was unlikely theyd get another chance remembering the evil eye hed received from the old blackturbaned man in surobi he knew that no matter how authentic their clothing there was no way he and fontaine could pass close inspection as villagers from dagar coming in sight unseen was their only bet harvath prayed that massouds sentries would be like most soldiers standing post overnightcold bored and hungry the security setup along the road was similar to that leading into massouds village and involved two checkpoints when harvath felt the truck coming to a halt at the first stop his heart began to quicken and his hands tightened around his mp next to him he knew fontaine was readying himself as well neither dared speak and they both knew what they would have to do if they were discovered their bodies tense each of the men listened for any indication that suggested the sentries suspected something was wrong despite the bitter cold harvath could feel the sweat forming on his skin as the adrenaline dumped into his bloodstream he heard reshteen roll down his window and speak to the taliban sentries this was the first and one of the most dangerous hurdles harvath listened as the afghan did exactly what he had been told to do showing the sentries the box on the seat next to him he offered them some of the hot tea warm nan bread and kebabs he had prepared before leaving dagar there was a lull that seemed to last an eternity harvath couldnt tell if the sentries suspected a doublecross or were just examining the contents of the box trying to decide what they wanted while the optimist in him said the sentries would take the food and allow the trucks to pass without inspection the pessimist told him to get ready because all hell was about to break loose suddenly the voices resumed and there was laughter harvaths inner optimist had been correct he felt his tension dissolve but only by a matter of degrees while the optimist in him had been right this time it was by listening to the pessimist and always being ready for the worst to happen that one stayed alive one of the sentries pounded on the roof of the cab and the trucks were allowed to pass at the next checkpoint the scene was repeated hot tea was poured into cups bread and kebabs were handed out by reshteen and the supply trucks from the village were once more allowed to pass uninspected while harvath should have been relieved at the moment he didnt have that luxury they were about to roll into the middle of a snake pit harvath had given fontaine every excuse to stay behind in dagar with daoud but the canadian had refused in fact he had accused harvath of selfishly trying to hog all the fun for himself the remark had made harvath laugh forty to one odds was not what he would call fun forty to two was only slightly better the one thing they had on their side was that at least for now no one knew they were coming the truck bumped and jostled along for another five minutes before the steep road finally leveled off when it swung to the left stopped and then slowly reversed harvath once again tightened his grip around his mp and made ready they had arrived chapter reshteen backed his truck up to the door of the small mud brick building that functioned as the camps kitchen his two cousins parked their trucks on the opposite side to act as a screen and provide harvath and fontaine with as much concealment as possible climbing out from behind the wheel reshteen stretched and walked casually into the cookhouse to make sure it was empty pushing open its heavy wooden door he removed a box of matches and lit one of the oil lamps that hung inside the room was just as it had been left following the first heavy snow the year before stepping back outside reshteen called his cousins over and they set to work freeing harvath and fontaine from the bed of his truck when they had moved enough crates the men slipped out one at a time and disappeared into the cookhouse the cousins continued unloading supplies while reshteen set up two gas cook stoves and quickly warmed up more tea and nan bread filling his pockets with cups and wrapping the bread in a heavy cloth he exited the kitchen and set off to soften the ground for harvath and fontaine fifteen minutes later he returned motioning for harvath to hand him the sketch of the camp he had drawn back in dagar he marked on it where the camps interior guards were posted and how many of them there were in each group harvath counted three groups of three nine men the rest were still asleep harvath pointed at the small storage building that reshteen had said would be the best place to hold julia gallo and the afghan man nodded and drew a dark circle around it with his pencil that was still their primary target it also according to reshteen did not have a guard posted outside it considering the talibans habit of relying solely on a sturdy lockable door harvath wasnt surprised but nevertheless he pointed to all the guard positions on the piece of paper and then back at the storage hut and said na na taliban he replied that was all harvath needed to hear checking his weapons he tucked his mp beneath his patoo and with fontaine right behind him he stepped out of the cookhouse into the cold mountain air the two men walked with their heads down and mimicked the slow shuffling afghan gait the camp was not that large and all of the guards on duty were aware of the supply trucks arrival being greeted by reshteen with hot tea and warm nan was an act of hospitality that had not only put them somewhat at ease about the strangers in their midst but had given harvath and fontaine reason to get much closer to them than would normally have been allowed expanding upon the ruse they had used at the checkpoints reshteen visited each group of guards handing out tea and nan and promising to send men back with hot kebabs the hope was that if harvath and fontaine were seen it would be assumed they represented the kebab wagon making its rounds harvath and fontaine understood the limits of the ruse all too well they needed to act as quickly as possible reshteen had shown them on his sketch where the taliban normally set up their latrine it was a long trench on the side of the camp away from the buildings even though the fortyplus men had not been there long they didnt need a map to find it their noses led them right to it the trench from last year was still filled with ice and snow that had only partially melted that didnt seem to bother the taliban who simply urinated and defecated right there as if it was a perfectly suitable latrine harvath and fontaine tried to ignore the smell as they lay down next to it and readied themselves for the next step there had been no way to know how many guards massoud would have posted reshteen had said that massoud normally had men walking the camp but had never bothered to count how many he simply had had no reason to though harvaths original intent had been to come up and ascertain if julia gallo was here he had also decided that if she was and he could get her out thats what he was going to do if it meant he had to kill a few more taliban in the process he had no problem doing that harvath traded fontaine his mp for gallaghers sniper rifle and got comfortable while fontaine powered up his nods and slipped them on so he could function as a spotter flipping down the legs of the weapons bipod harvath then flipped up the scope covers wrapped his hand around the grip and got his shoulder comfortable against the stock ready when you are whispered fontaine are you getting enough light through the scope while harvath would have preferred engaging their targets at a much closer range the chance that someone might hear even the suppressed report of the rifle and raise the alarm was just too great the other problem was that they were not going to be able to get anywhere close to the building they hoped was holding gallo without encountering at least one set of guards and while harvath had no problem using a knife and getting his hands dirty the guards were all out in the open sneaking up on them would be next to impossible the lights good enough said harvath lets go fontaine guided harvath as best he could and when harvath was ready he exhaled and gently applied pressure to the trigger his first taliban target dropped like a stone and harvath quickly readjusted and took out his two colleagues the first man went down instantly as well but the next man took two shots before he fell to the ground fontaine tskd out loud over the need to take a second shot on the third taliban harvath ignored him group two he said as he adjusted his position and reoriented himself one shot one kill this time said fontaine harvath raised his middle finger and readjusted his shoulder against the stock call em he said fontaine did and harvath took the three men down in rapid succession all with bullets through their heads handing fontaine back the rifle harvath pulled out his nods powered them up and slipped them on once the men had their weapons hidden beneath their patoos they made a line straight for the storage building they were traversing open ground on what remained a relatively bright night if any of massouds men had decided to step outside for a breath of fresh air or a visit to their luxury toilet facilities that would have been the end of everything providence for the moment appeared to be on their side they made it across the open ground without being seen creeping up on the structure harvath saw it was windowless just as reshteen had said it was harvath took a step back and studied the outside of the door a heavy wooden peg held the lock in place with one hand still wrapped around the grip of his mp harvath leaned in toward the door and listened not a sound came from the other side reaching down he gently pulled the peg free as it came out harvath exposed his weapon fully and fontaine did the same and then just as they had done in massouds village fontaine positioned himself to open the door so harvath could immediately sweep inside harvath took a deep breath and then nodded fontaine drew back the handle pulled open the door and harvath weapon up and ready rushed in chapter the room was tiny so tiny in fact that julia gallo could not even stretch all the way out instead she sat on the dirt floor with her legs drawn up and her arms wrapped around them while she balanced her head upon her knees other than the two wool blankets zwak had brought her the only other item in the room was a plastic bucket she was expected to use for her bodily functions upon hearing the door slide open only her heart twitched the rest of her body was too sore to move julia said a voice in the darkness julia gallo julia was certain that she was dreaming either that or she was finally losing her mind besides zwak only one other person had been to see her and he had spoken english with a thick almost eastern european accent to ask her four very strange questions about her past the man had then asked her other questions about zwak and the boys who had accosted her but this was definitely not his voice this voice sounded american it sounded like home bending down harvath lifted the womans head from her knees and looked at her face even through his goggles with her hair wrapped in her hijab he could tell it was her julia he repeated my name is scot your mother sent us to get you were here to take you home home she didnt want to allow herself to believe it home she said the mens faces were disguised by something almost as if they were wearing masks yes replied harvath as he slipped a hand underneath her arm and helped her to stand are you okay can you walk gallo quickly realized that she wasnt dreaming this was in fact real yes she stammered i think so good you must remain absolutely quiet and do everything i tell you do you understand yes said julia harvath looked at fontaine who had slipped into the room behind him and closed the door were ready to go fontaine nodded and turned around and cracked the door glancing outside he quickly popped his head back in and said weve got a problem what is it asked harvath weve got one of massouds guys making a beeline straight for us what do you want to do maybe hes going to one of the other structures negative said fontaine hes on his way here and hes going to see that bolt is missing harvath unslung his mp handed it to fontaine and pulled out his knife ill take him when he comes in you protect dr gallo roger that replied fontaine as he gently maneuvered julia into the corner and then stood between her and the door no sooner had they done that than harvath heard footsteps outside there was the sound of a hand on the outside of the door and then silence whoever was out there had discovered that the peg that held the door closed was missing whether the person was hesitant or confused seconds passed and nothing happened finally the door began to creak open harvath tightened his grip on the knife and prepared to strike the door opened farther and as it did fading starlight and the dying rays of the moon spilled in as it opened more the figure of a man holding a rifle was cast in silhouette just a foot more thought harvath as he angled the blade of his knife the man moved cautiously and continued forward when the barrel of his rifle was within striking distance harvath lunged he grabbed the weapon and pulled the man off balance and into the tiny room wrenching the rifle from the mans hands he let it drop to the ground and slammed him up against wall with his hand covering the mans mouth harvath pulled the blade back and prepared to strike but then stopped he had felt something wrapped around the barrel of the mans weapon it had felt like tape baseer had said massouds brother carried an ak with its barrel wrapped with blue tape to let everyone know it wasnt a functioning firearm sheathing his knife harvath held the man tight against the wall and whispered for fontaine to close the door as the door closed julia said please hes mentally challenged dont hurt him he protected me looking over his shoulder at fontaine he said shred those blankets well tie him and gag him as fontaine used his knife to cut the blankets in strips harvath held zwak against the wall and kept his mouth covered the mans entire body was trembling harvath once again thought of the seal team that had been discovered by the afghan goatherds if he knew one thing about combat it was that you could never secondguess what another man had done unless youd been there with him he was thankful that he wasnt faced with the same predicament they were if they acted fast enough he hoped they could be gone before anyone noticed zwak was missing he had also given baseer the chief elder of massouds village his word that if he encountered zwak he would do everything he could to make sure no harm came to the man once they had zwak gagged they tied his hands behind his back and then laid him on the floor and hogtied him as they did zwak began crying julia gallo bent and stroked the side of his face she spoke reassuringly to him with her limited pashtu and thanked him once again once she had finished harvath took his mp back from fontaine clicked his ir strobe onto a battery and said lets get the hell out of here chapter mullah massoud akhund woke up earlier than usual to the sound of his stomach growling he rolled over and looked at the empty pallet on the floor beside him zwak must have gotten up to check on the american woman he was like a child with an injured bird and massoud feared he had grown too attached to her the taliban commander also feared that his brother was holding a grudge zwak had not said a word to him since he had arrived at the mountain camp massoud knew his brother was angry at him for taking away his basketball shoes but that was before the russian had explained what had really happened with elam badars son asadoulah even though massoud had promised to return the shoes once they were back home zwak still wouldnt speak to him but it wasnt just the loss of the shoes that had wounded his pride in order to cover their tracks simonov had insisted zwak wear a burka just like the american woman as they made the drive to the summer grazing pasture massoud understood the russians logic he also understood why zwak had felt emasculated some of the soldiers had teased zwak afterward and though the russian had reprimanded them harshly zwak felt ashamed and the stern rebuke of the soldiers did nothing to repair his bruised ego massoud wondered how much his brother had slept during the night if at all though he might have stepped outside to relieve himself he was most likely checking on the woman he was incredibly protective massoud wondered if his brother understood that he felt exactly the same way about him that was why he found so many important jobs for him to do whether he did or whether he did not reasoned the taliban commander allah knew rising from his thin bedroll mullah massoud stepped past the sleeping soldiers crammed one on top of the other quietly opened the door and slid outside they had much to do today and he knew he wouldnt be able to fall back asleep besides it was good for his men to see him up so early it would set a good example he walked toward the small hut they were using to hold the woman and looked for zwak except for when he slept or when he prayed he had not been far from the woman the entire time she had been their prisoner massoud walked around the building and not seeing his brother wondered if maybe he was inside with the woman he knew the two had developed a relationship and while he didnt think it was wise he found it difficult to discourage his brother from speaking with her he knew what his duty was and he also knew that no matter how much kindness she showed him she would never be able to charm zwak into setting her free he was all too aware of the shame that would bring on the entire family it was far beyond having your basketball shoes taken away or being forced to disguise yourself in a burka completing a full turn around the little outbuilding massoud stopped at the door wondering if zwak might be inside but then saw that the wooden peg that held the door locked was firmly in place zwak had to be either at the latrine or in the cookhouse trying to get something to eat before morning prayers feeling the urge himself to urinate massoud headed toward the trench if zwak was there he hoped that sleep had softened the stone in his heart and that he might be ready to talk one of the strange ironies of night was that it always seemed coldest right before the first rays of the sun pierced the darkness to touch the earth the taliban commander pulled his patoo tighter around his shoulders and readjusted the angle of his ak looking up as he walked he regarded the stars and almost believed he could see them twinkling out one at a time like tiny lamps being extinguished in the sky as daylight arrived to relieve them shifting his eyes away from the sky and back to the path he was walking he saw something though his mind raced for an alternative explanation he knew even from this distance what he was seeing dead bodies the fear that they had been discovered was surpassed by an even greater fear was one of them his brother abandoning all concern for his own life massoud charged toward the mass of corpses two of the bodies were face up with bullets through their heads and he could immediately see that neither was zwak though the third man was obviously too tall to be his brother massoud still bent and rolled him over the lifeless eyes of his lieutenant stared up past him where was zwak while the kitchen seemed an obvious place to look massouds instincts as a commander were starting to take over and his gut drew him back to the storage hut if the men from elam badars village had come to make war they could have begun by quietly taking out the sentries but thats not what was happening here this was about the woman it was a rescue attempt of some sort he could feel it and if he was right the moment she was safely away the skies would open and all kinds of hell would rain down upon them gripping his ak now massoud ran back to the hut pulled the peg from the lock and pushed open the door it took his eyes a moment to adjust and then he saw his brother bound and gagged on the floor the taliban commander bent down removed his brothers gag and set to work on the strips binding his wrists and feet behind his back no crying he ordered not now zwak what happened the admonition had no effect massoud withdrew a small knife and cut him loose helping zwak to his feet the taliban commander grabbed his brothers face in his hands and held it it is okay zwak no one is going to hurt you he said you need to show courage you need to be a warrior now and tell me where is the american woman the mentally challenged mans breaths came in short sharp stabs they took her he managed to choke out how many two the first thing that came to massouds mind was that he had been sold out someone in his organization had doublecrossed him so they could ransom the woman back themselves did they speak did you hear their language was it dari pashtu na said zwak they spoke her language english massouds heart began pounding even faster and he willed himself to calm down that could mean anything did you see their faces na repeated the mentally challenged man they had no faces only mouths he stammered as he pantomimed holding a pair of binoculars up to his eyes night vision goggles thought the taliban commander had he been sold out to an ana commando unit or worse had the americans somehow found them and sent in a special operations team as quickly as the thought entered his mind massoud pushed it away if this was the work of the americans he and his men would be dead by now once they recovered the woman they would have come into the camp and killed everything that moved that was another thing he had not heard any helicopter whoever had done this could have only come in via vehicle or by foot removing his cell phone massoud turned it on and stepped nearer to the doorway to get a signal though many new towers had been built in khogyani reception especially at the mountain camp could be spotty holding the phone outside he was finally able to lock on to a tower remaining in the shadow of the doorway he called down to his roadside checkpoint nearest the village a man named mohambar answered on the third ring the connection was terrible no the sentry shouted into his phone only the three trucks from dagar a half hour ago we have seen nothing since and where are those trucks now asked the commander please repeat where are those trucks now still at the camp with you that had to be it after ordering his men not to let anything pass massoud disconnected the call and slid the phone back into his pocket he didnt need to press his brother any further the bodies of the men outside were still warm considering the temperature they couldnt have been dead long whoever was behind this had to be connected to those trucks he had to act fast they couldnt be allowed to leave making zwak promise to stay put he rushed back to the building hed been sleeping in and woke four of his most trusted bodyguards together they moved quickly to the structure next door where the commander nudged the russian awake with the toe of his boot rubbing his eyes with the heels of his hands simonov sat up and said whats going on massoud signaled for him to be quiet and whispered we have a problem chapter reshteen and his cousins had already finished unloading and were busy assembling breakfast when harvath and fontaine swept julia gallo into the cookhouse time to leave said harvath as he pulled out another ir strobe attached it to its battery and tossed it to fontaine who walked outside to affix it to the top of reshteens truck harvath had tossed his other strobe onto the roof of the structure where zwak lay tied up taking him with them was out of the question the best harvath could do was to try to shield him from the impending airstrike julia gallo was looking longingly at the platters of fresh nan and hot kebab and reshteen gathered a bunch up and handed them to her as the care international doctor began hungrily eating harvath waved the afghans toward the door theres a mm hurricane headed this way and id like to beat the traffic all right by you guys he said though he knew the villagers didnt understand a word of english fontaine returned from taping the strobe to the top of reshteens truck and tossed harvath a heavy black nylon bag he then stepped back outside with his radio fishing out gallaghers bloodstained armor harvath said to gallo you need to put this on he helped her get ready and as he did reshteen and the afghans went outside to ready their vehicles fontaine remained at the door as a lookout harvath had finished cinching up gallos armor when fontaine stuck his head back into the room said look sharp and then went back to peering out the doorway whats up asked harvath companys just arrived more sentries negative im looking at a big bushy afghan with four bodyguards and either roman polanski is thinking of shooting his next film in khogyani or ive got eyes on our russian harvath finished tightening the straps on gallos armor and then pointed to where he wanted her to take cover joining fontaine near the door he asked what are they doing theyre having a discussion with reshteen and his cousins but theyre doing most of the talking i dont like it neither do i said harvath as he tucked the stock of his mp up tighter against his shoulder whats the plan lets just relax maybe theyre only interested in the breakfast menu i doubt that replied fontaine the two men held their position for several more moments until fontaine said okay the bodyguards just raised their weapons and pointed them at reshteen and the cousins theyre now moving them away from the vehicles toward a wall on the other side i think theyre going to execute them harvath swore under his breath the last thing they needed was another fullon firefight with the taliban especially now as they were in an even poorer position than they had been before are you sure he asked i could be wrong replied fontaine lets wait until they pass out the blindfolds and cigarettes harvath was in no mood for the canadians sarcasm if we open the door far enough for both of us to shoot can we engage all six targets fontaine studied the scene outside for a moment negative he replied at this point i can only see the bodyguards what happened to polanski and the bushy afghan theyve stepped out of my line of sight maybe they went for reinforcements said the canadian listen the bodyguards are seriously getting ready to wax reshteen and the cousins we need to take them out if we take them out you know what that means fontaine raised his nods and pressed his rifle against the door frame if youre trying to tell me that my application to the kandahar country club might hit a few bumps with the membership committee i can live with that just make sure you only hit the bad guys replied harvath as he joined fontaine in the doorway ill promise if you promise retorted the canadian harvath ignored him and gently slid the door open a few more inches you take the first two guys ive got three and four roger that whispered fontaine now said harvath four suppressed shots snapped through the earlymorning air in less than two seconds dropping all four of massouds bodyguards harvath waited for massoud and the russian to step out or return fire but they did neither maybe they had gone for reinforcements or maybe they knew what was going on and had wisely taken cover harvath didnt care either way lets go he said as he waved for julia gallo to join him what about mullah shithead and roman polanski asked fontaine we dont have the time to wait them out go and ill cover you reshteen and his cousins were shaken but had enough presence of mind to already be running for the trucks harvath admired their courage though he didnt speak pashtu he knew what massouds bodyguards had been interrogating them about and even though they surely must have known massouds men intended to kill them if they didnt get the answers they wanted none of the villagers from dagar had cracked the dignity and honor of the afghan people never ceased to amaze harvath with harvath covering them fontaine positioned julia gallo on the floor of the backseat of reshteens truck no matter what happens he warned stay down fontaine then got behind the wheel and fired up his truck as reshteen and his cousins scrambled into the other two vehicles and did the same harvaths nods were back down now and noticing movement off to the side of one of the buildings he let a volley of silenced rounds fly from his mp and then hopped into the passenger seat next to fontaine hold on advised the canadian as he ground the vehicle into gear and punched the accelerator the vehicles tires spun until they were finally able to take a bite out of the frozen road and the truck jerked forward as they did the staccato crack crack crack of automaticweapons fire filled the earlymorning air chapter harvath returned fire through his open window and then leaning back inside stated we need to call in that cas right now after conducting their highaltitude reconnaissance of massouds mountain camp flash had marked its location and had returned to bagram to refuel and ammoup seeing how many taliban were crawling around down below the spectres captain had guaranteed fontaine that they would be back for more no matter how things went down harvath had seen the air support as the worlds best insurance policy if he swept the camp and julia gallo wasnt there he could decide whether to call for a strike if julia was there and he could pinpoint her location he could designate it with a strobe and have the ac rake everything else and if they were lucky enough to take positive control of julia and needed somebody to kick the back door shut for them there wasnt anything the taliban had that could compete with heavily armed aircraft fontaine kept one hand on the steering wheel and lifted up his radio in the other im not getting anything he said nothing replied harvath looking back out the window knowing the taliban were going to be on their tails any second not on any of the channels flash had promised to be on station ready to shower steel at am thirteen minutes before sunrise nothing responded fontaine were surrounded by solid rock the radio isnt powerful enough to get out how about a phone said harvath as he pulled his afghan cell phone from his pocket do you have a direct number for j air fontaine rattled off the digits and harvath punched them into his phone he hit send but the call failed to connect the signal strength wasnt strong enough no joy said harvath as he punched the end button on his cell phone and tucked it back in his pocket whats going on asked julia from the floor behind them dont worry everythings going to be okay you picked a great night not to bring a sat phone said fontaine harvath was about to tell the canadian he had brought one but that it had been barbecued along with gallaghers land cruiser when two trucks came up on their threevehicle column from behind and begin firing the results were instantaneous weve lost the rear vehicle yelled harvath as he watched the truck one of reshteens cousins was driving slide to the side of the road and come to a stop we cant do anything for him now said fontaine as he kept his foot on the gas were almost at the first checkpoint get ready as the mp was an easier weapon to shoot onehanded harvath traded it to fontaine for gallaghers larue positioning the sniper rifle out the window harvath looked once more into his side mirror damn it he cursed reshteens going back for his cousins theres nothing we can do about that replied the canadian were going to have that checkpoint in sight in less than a minute underneath them their bald tires were skidding and slipping over the icy road go back said harvath are you fucking crazy replied fontaine there are at least forty taliban back there who are going to execute three men who risked everything to help us if we dont help them goddamn afghans fontaine growled as he stepped on the brakes and the truck fishtailed back and forth how the hell am i supposed to turn around they had just left the valley area of the pasture and entered the narrow canyon with its singlelane road that led down to the village reverse it ordered harvath the canadian shook his head and slammed the truck into reverse its tires spun until they finally caught and they went hurtling backward in the direction they had just come harvath jumped into the backseat opened the rear window and pushed the barrel of his rifle through pulling his afghan cell phone from his pocket he dropped it to julia gallo and said keep redialing the number on there and dont stop until you get through fontaine continued to speed backward thirty meters out harvath could see reshteens vehicle as well as that of his cousins he could also see the two taliban trucks just beyond which were closing fast and firing at them with everything they had what are we doing here scot yelled the canadian as errant rounds began pinging off their truck harvath took several shots at the approaching taliban vehicles as he quickly studied the situation although reshteens cousins wouldnt be happy about losing their trucks the way they were now parked side by side made them a perfect roadblock there was only one thing that could make them better stop yelled harvath as fontaine brought the vehicle to a halt harvath leaped out raised his weapon to engage their attackers and yelled for reshteen and his cousins to come to him the men ran right toward him and as harvath examined their vehicles he could see that both trucks had flat tires and were inoperable get in the truck he yelled as he pointed over his shoulder despite their inability to speak english they had no problem understanding him harvath continued to return fire until he got within a few meters of the trucks as he dropped to a knee he could see beyond the two taliban trucks rapidly approaching to an armada of headlights right behind them breaking off his assault harvath fished two fragmentation grenades from his coat pocket he pulled the pins pitched one underneath each of the disabled vehicles and yelled frag out as he ran back to his pickup leaping into the bed he slammed his fist against its side and yelled go go go immediately fontaine stepped on the gas and harvath ducked down when the frags detonated they lifted both of the disabled vehicles off the ground and sent a bright orange plume of flame into the air shrapnel pockmarked their tailgate and skipped across the roof of the cab they had been driving for only a few hundred feet when fontaine saw something up ahead and stepped on the brakes yet again before harvath could ask what it was the canadian yelled rpg he managed to grind the vehicle into reverse but ended up spinning the tires so fast that he couldnt get any traction harvath jumped from the bed yelling everyone out as he scrambled to make it to the passenger side door in time with no choice but to abandon ship fontaine did the same as the afghans and dr gallo poured out of the vehicle there was an earsplitting pop as the rpg was fired and hissed toward them grabbing julia gallo by the shoulder harvath pulled her behind a narrow outcropping of rock and yelled for everyone to take cover no sooner had he said the words than the rpg hit their truck and detonated sending another towering fireball into the sky harvath pressed gallo into the rock covering her body with his as the charred remains of the vehicle rained down around them it took what felt like a lifetime for the ringing in his ears to subside when it did he could hear fontaine calling out his name over here harvath yelled back and soon they were joined by the canadian and the three afghans fontaine was just about to speak when they all heard a tremendous crash from up the road theyre trying to ram their way through the trucks i fragged said harvath what are we going to do fight replied harvath who was suddenly interrupted by julia gallo its ringing she cried as she held the phone out fontaine took it from her as harvath leaned out toward the road and took aim after three attempts at ramming into the wreckage the men above them broke through at the same moment the sentries from the checkpoint below them pinpointed their position and they immediately began taking fire from both directions harvath very quickly burned through his magazine and yelled for fontaine to hand him another as he did the canadian relayed their situation to j air at bagram which patched him in to flash with their strobe gone all fontaine could do was give their approximate location in relation to their burning pickup as the string of taliban trucks came rushing down the road toward them harvath alternated trying to slow them down and engaging the sentries from the checkpoint who were now coming up the road there was a distinct clap as the final round in harvaths magazine was fired he had just called for a fresh mag when fontaine yelled for everyone to drop and take cover chapter mullah massoud grinned as he and simonov barreled down on the men who had stolen the american woman from him their vehicle had been destroyed but there were still survivors returning fire he prayed that he would find the woman there he didnt care if she was injured as long as she was alive he and the russian both had too much invested in her to allow her to slip through their hands as they drew closer the accuracy of the person shooting at them improved whoever it was he was very good with a rifle massoud pounded the roof of the truck and yelled at his soldier to make sure he didnt shoot the woman or their fellow taliban down below the commander was going to teach whoever this was a very painful lesson you didnt steal from a man like massoud akhund all he had to do now was to keep them pinned down until they ran out of ammunition then he and his men would move in simonov slowed their truck to a crawl to allow the soldiers from the checkpoint below to move up and apply pressure hot shell casings tinkled onto the roof of the cab as massoud leaned against the roll bar and kept firing in short bursts it was during a break in the shooting when the soldier ejected his spent magazine and fished for another that massoud realized that the marksman near the flaming wreckage below had stopped shooting at them it was also at that time that he heard an explosion from behind looking into his side mirror he saw the trucks behind him erupting in bright yellow flashes move move move he yelled at simonov the russian who had been transfixed by the spectacle behind them popped the clutch and leaped forward though neither of them could see any aircraft they knew they were under attack from above simonov pushed the truck as fast as it would go as the hand of death came racing up behind them both he and the taliban commander were so mesmerized by what was happening in their mirrors that they didnt realize how quickly they had closed with the burning hulk of the truck in front of them that had been rpged the russian tried to brake but lost control the truck bounced against the high rock wall on the right side of the road and then slammed into the flaming wreckage the last thing that went through sergei simonovs mind as he went through the windshield and was killed was his son sasha mullah massoud was ejected from the passenger window as the vehicle flipped over and rolled several hundred feet down the road he regained consciousness for only a moment blood poured from his nose and ears though his eyes refused to focus he thought he could see daylight off in the distance he heard his brother calling him to prayer as the suns rays grew brighter his body was beset by cold and grew numb zwaks voice seemed to move farther away as the life drained from his body standing above him were two shapes they were men with guns foreigners probably americans massoud akhund opened his mouth to tell them that they would never triumph in afghanistan the taliban commander wanted to mock them for their arrogance but nothing came nothing but deep impenetrable bottomless darkness chapter washington dc two days later carolyn leonard cleared white house security on west executive drive and then found a parking space it was one of those perfect dc dayswarm with a bright blue sky and barely a trace of humidity are you sure you want to do this she asked as she turned off the cars engine maybe you should take some more time to think about it elise campbell turned to her carolyn i didnt bring you along to talk me out of my decision i brought you for moral support leonard smiled ill be waiting right here when you come out thanks said campbell as she unbuckled her seatbelt and opened the door as she stepped out of the car she was greeted by the scent of magnolia blossoms drifting across the grounds max holland was waiting for her in front of the west wing entrance are you sure about this campbell elise nodded im sure okay he replied the president is waiting for you in the residence are you okay if we walk this way he asked pointing toward the north lawn its a nice day and id like to enjoy whats left of it that would be nice thank you as they walked holland said the night nikki hale drove off the estate id been on break when alden went to the guesthouse i never knew the details of what happened until you asked me to set up this meeting id like to think that if id been there that night things might have turned out differently me too replied elise they covered the rest of the distance in silence on the third floor of the executive residence campbell followed holland down the hallway to a carpeted ramp that branched off to their left at the top was a room most americans didnt know even existed the white house solarium constructed by william howard taft in the early part of the twentieth century as a sleeping porch it had originally been intended as a place to catch a cool breeze on hot nights and had been a favorite of first families ever since president eisenhower barbequed outside on its promenade while his wife mamie hosted bridge parties inside the kennedys used it as a kindergarten for caroline and other children president nixon gathered his family here to break the news of his resignation and president reagan spent weeks in the solarium recuperating from the assassination attempt on his life the president will be here in a minute said holland make yourself comfortable as he left elise took in the solarium it was an octagonal room composed almost entirely of windows the décor was bright and the tasteful furnishings plush and comfortableexactly what one would expect to find in a sun room meant for relaxed family gatherings its most striking feature was its view in the foreground was the washington monument and beyond that the jefferson memorial best view in all of washington said a voice from behind surprised campbell turned around hello mr president she said it was the first time she had ever seen him on time for any meeting much less early elise he said as he crossed the room to shake her hand i understand you were quite insistent about seeing me i was thank you mr president she replied as she accepted his hand alden pointed toward one of the overstuffed couches please sit down can i get you anything something to drink no thank you sir okay said the president taking a seat in the armchair just adjacent im all yours elise knew there would be no perfect segue or preamble for what she had come to say the only way to say it was to say it and when she did the color drained from aldens face mr president i wanted to tender my resignation to you personally excuse me i know what happened the night nikki hale killed the coleman family she had been drinking with both you and the first lady the three of you quarreled and despite the fact that she was drunk you insisted she get in her car and leave the estate then you lied about what happened that night under oath what are you talking about im talking about your answers to interrogatories in the civil suit you lied about everything that happened that night as if your involvement in hales death wasnt enough you perjured yourself in trying to cover it up you wait just a second snapped the president indignantly no you wait sir said elise cutting him off you lied to protect yourself and you lied to protect your candidacy and i cant work for you anymore standing up and buttoning his suit jacket alden said agent campbell you simply dont have your facts straight i dont know whats ailing you but i think you need to take some more time off and come back when youre feeling better i feel fine mr president and im not coming back said elise as she stood up as well where this goes now is up to you and for your information herb and janet coleman will be taking a very keen interest in what you decide to do going forward the colemans is that whos behind this said alden contemptuously i should have known yes you should have mr president lying under oath is a felony alden glared at her and tried to shift the blame so this is how divisive politics have become even when the people have spoken you wont stop until you find a reason to force the duly elected president of the united states out of office even if you have to make the reasons up this has nothing to do with me or politics i voted for you i believed in you but youre unworthy of your office i guess i made a mistake asking to have you assigned to my detail elise had had it with the mans arrogance you politicians want to blame everyone but yourselves when you screw up your mistake wasnt having me assigned to your detail your mistake was lying under oath in fact now youve got me talking like a politician lying under oath isnt a mistake its a reflection of a very deep character flaw the office of president and the people of the united states deserve better the colemans and i will be expecting you to announce your resignation shortly goodbye mr president elise left the president and exited the solarium max holland was waiting for her outside howd it go cmon max said elise youre telling me you heard none of that our jobs to protect the president not to eavesdrop on his conversations campbell was silent that said sometimes you cant help but hear things replied holland youre a good agent elise dont quit the service just because of him well get you reassigned in fact theres a position open on the first ladys detail hutch resigned holland nodded ten minutes ago removing her credentials she handed them over to him thanks max but ive got other plans holland knew better than to argue with her reluctantly he accepted her creds and slipped them into his pocket so what are you going to do max asked are you just going to give up on law enforcement elise smiled i think im going to become a detective youre going back to the virginia beach pd no ive been offered a job in east hampton chapter kabul afghanistan with the convoy of massouds soldiers taken care of as well as those he had posted along the road harvath knew it was safe to call daoud in to pick them up as a courtesy flash stayed on station until they were all safely back in dagar reshteen and his cousins mobilized the other men of their village arming themselves they established a perimeter around dagar just in case any stray taliban happened to wander down from the mountain camp or travel over from massouds village looking for revenge out of appreciation harvath had allowed the canadians to be credited with the success of the operation and the recovery of julia gallo he neither needed nor wanted the publicity but more than that the canadians had been integral to their success without them things could have turned out very differently they more than deserved the credit when captain west and his team arrived they helped reinforce the village and establish a secure lz twenty minutes later a uh blackhawk accompanied by two ah apaches landed to transport julia gallo to bagram once the helos had lifted off fontaine led captain west and his team back to massouds camp to gather as much intel as possible about the taliban commander and his russian counterpart in the truck that fayaz had loaned them earlier that night harvath and daoud followed most of the taliban vehicles were still smoldering as the column made its way up the narrow mountain pass though it took some doing the heavy lavs were able to clear a wide enough path for everyone to make it up without having to permanently dismount once they arrived the canadian forces swept the camp only one survivor was found mullah massoud akhunds brother zwak though zwak had been untied he had remained in the storage building beneath the protection of the ir strobe harvath had thrown on the roof though the man had no idea that it had been there it had saved his life daoud spoke to him quietly and tried to calm him down but zwak kept asking for his brother saying he wanted to go home with captain wests blessing harvath and daoud were granted permission to return the man to his village providing harvath didnt tip them that it was their next stop the canadians planned on taking massouds compound apart as well as all of the other houses that the taliban had been using harvath of course agreed harvath and daoud drove zwak home and remanded him into the care of baseer who thanked harvath for being a man of honor who kept his promises he also gave his assurance that he would deal with young usman personally harvath and daoud then drove to bagram on the outskirts of jalalabad and gallaghers shangrila guesthouse cum fortified compound there after arranging to get the truck back to fayaz and his village harvath paid the intrepid interpreter and though the man politely attempted to refuse gave him a significant bonus daoud had more than earned it harvath then took a long hot shower poured a stiff drink and popped a much overdue motrin he then slid into bed closed his eyes and didnt wake up for twelve hours when he awoke he checked the email account he was using for this assignment waiting for him was a twoword message from stephanie gallo it read simply thank you out of sheer curiosity he surfed over to his banks website and logged in mrs gallo had already deposited the balance of his fee she was a woman of her word and though he disagreed with much of her politics he had to give credit where credit was due while he didnt really care either way he couldnt help but wonder if maybe her opinion of people like him and the other brave men and women in the world who risked all to protect the innocent and take the fight to the bad guys had maybe now changed next he logged in to the personal account he used to communicate with tracy and found six emails all with photos of their dog bullet attached harvath smiled as he read through them but felt an odd sense of melancholy he loved his dog but a dog wasnt the same as having children there was no bond stronger than family and he was ready to start one of his own considering how much money hed just banked tracy couldnt argue that kids were too expensive and he wanted to have a ton of them his optimism returning harvath smiled and typed a quick reply to the last email she had sent done having fun wish i was there be home soon borrowing the shangrilas other land cruiser harvath drove himself back to kabul alone he slowed in surobi and hoped to see the little old man who sold the jackie collins book standing outside his shop but the store was closed it was prayer time and even in a village not officially controlled by the taliban repercussions for not strictly adhering to islamic laws could be harsh harvath did see though the same man with the same black taliban turban he had seen the last time he had passed through surobi the mans eyes were still filled with hate and he threw harvath the same bloodchilling stare fuck diplomacy thought harvath as he flipped the guy the finger he drove to the safe house in the shahre naw and called flower from his cell phone to come outside and open the gates mr scot i am not there he said my wife had the baby a beautiful little girl harvath was glad to hear flower so excited about having another girl congratulations i wish you and your family much health and happiness flower thanked him and said his cousin was at the house and he would call him and have him open the gates less than a minute after they hung up the gates opened harvath drove the land cruiser into the courtyard parked and entered the house the large plasma television was on in the living room hoyt was sitting on the couch with his back to him i hope you bought enough beer mei were going to have half of the ngo community here for this party tonight harvath was about to reply when hoyt turned around saw him and said or maybe not nice try hoyt smiled now that the jobs done youre finally lightening up better late than never hows midland fine and our guest mustafa special k khan still a creepy pain in the ass but on the right side of the grass which is only because i like you so much now that gallos safe mark wants to hang him from his ankles and beat him like a fucking piñata for what he did to his ear first things first said harvath who then glanced up at the tv what are you watching hoyt looked at the plasma and then back at harvath what you couldnt get a fucking newspaper in nangarhar alden just announced his resignation president alden said harvath as he stepped closer to the couch yup secondshortest presidency in us history william henry harrison is first he served for only thirtyfive days and also coincidentally gave the longest inaugural address guess who gave the secondlongest inaugural address alden hoyt nodded spooky huh why is he resigning nobody knows he made a brief statement and evaporated well something must have happened no one runs for office as hard as he did just to give it up replied harvath bringing his mind back to the work they still had to do weve gotta get khan ready to roll where are we taking him bagram hoyt smiled scot harvath arent you thoughtful what are you talking about next to cold beer theres nothing baba g loves more than a piñata party harvath smiled that reminds me i need you to pack a cooler chapter bagram air base afghanistan if this guys not at the gate said harvath into his cell phone im gonna cut khan loose seven thousand miles away in langley virginia cia operative aydin ozbek tried to put his friend at ease my guy is already there waiting for you dont worry hoyt motioned to the cooler on the backseat and nobody searches the car either added harvath for fucks sake scot youre driving onto an american military base in the middle of a war zone if they want to search your car they get to search your fucking car you know what oz youre right i dont know what i was thinking were going to turn around and hand khan over to the afghans all right all right no inspection ill let them know now are there any lastminute bites at the apple i need to bend over for asked ozbek let me think a minute said harvath considering how im giving you and by you i mean the agency one of the highestranking alqaeda operatives since khalid sheik mohammed whom i believe you stole from the afghan government ozbek clarified hey if you dont want him scot you know we want him we also know that the afghans didnt really catch him so we consider him fair game okay said harvath what happens after youre done with him when weve wrung him out like a damp dishcloth well arrange for the afghans to recapture him thats good enough for me that plus a months worth of drinks at a bar of my choosing in the dc area back at langley ozbek began laughing feel free to grab my dick and shake the money tree oz you and i both know youre going to jump at least two pay grades because of this if i want to drink macallan youre buying for a month youre out of youre fucking mind ill buy you a case of johnnie green and well call it even johnnie blue and i want it on my doorstep by the time i get home deal now drive onto that base and surrender that prisoner so i can go home and beg american express to raise my credit limit and all of the deals we made with the afghans get honored right yes said ozbek i will see to it personally im going to hold you to that oz said harvath these people risked everything for us if we dont live up to our end we deserve all the problems they can cause for us and believe me even small villages like theirs can cause problems dont worry oz these villages have lived with the taliban they know them and they can be huge treasure chests of intel dont let the failure factory fuck this up im going to make sure these villages get taken care of the projects they want are within the scope of the budgets that have been proposed for their province everything is good i gave them my word said harvath so i am going to make sure every single project happens scot said ozbek youve already blown half the budget for these projects on cell phone minutes would you just hump to bagram and dump the prisoner already ten minutes later hoyt drove the land cruiser up to a littleused gate on the far side of the air base can i help you gentlemen asked one of several american soldiers at the guard booth armed with very atypical weapons we seem to be a bit lost replied hoyt is this the road to sea world as the sentry smirked harvath leaned across his friend and using the front name for the agencys air transport unit said weve got a perishable cargo delivery for polar air the sentry nodded and stepping back inside the guardhouse raised the gate and lowered the bollards thanking the guards hoyt smiled and drove forward thirty yards inside the base they were greeted by a tall man with short dark hair in blue jeans and a tad gear jacket you must be norseman he said using harvaths call sign as harvath rolled down his window my name is jude harvath smiled nice call sign the patron saint of lost causes well it just so happens that i have someone who is a follower of a very major lost cause here with me im glad to hear that harvath pointed at hoyt and said he thinks the dolphins are definitely going to go to the super bowl this year the man in the blue jeans didnt laugh wheres the other guy oh that guy replied harvath weve got him wrapped up in a rug in the back opening the rear passenger door jude hopped in and said hang a left at the first road and keep going until i tell you to stop are we going to see shamu asked hoyt who loved to fuck with humorless intel people when jude didnt respond hoyt put the land cruiser in gear and started driving jude led them to a dark aircraft hangar where several men in blue jeans helped unload mustafa khan from the back of the suv dont forget to read him his miranda rights yelled hoyt when jude didnt respond he added on second thought fuck it who cares right harvath put his hand on hoyts shoulder and he drove the car out of the hangar and made his way across the tarmac and over to the craig jointtheater hospital parking the land cruiser he and harvath pulled out the enormous igloo cooler that had been spraypainted on the side with a red cross and the words rush human blood plasma as he was less than thirty miles north of kabul hoyt had already been to see gallagher multiple times since he had been admitted and knew exactly how to get to his room as he entered he identified the other soldiers in the room and said fell out of a jeep fell off a ladder changing a lightbulb slipped taking a piss and our own baba g who apparently broke off his dick jerking off a chorus of fuck you erupted in the room complete with multiple middlefinger salutes im sorry responded hoyt defiantly we only brought beer for warriors once again the fuck you chorus rose until hoyt waved his arms to calm the men down okay okay he admitted this isnt exactly the papercut ward there may be one or two warriors sucking up some easy medical leave within these four walls but as im not a guy to point fingers i aint saying nothing harvath bumped hoyt out of the way and introduced himself around the room meeting three army rangers and a green beret he blamed not having come to the hospital earlier on having to mop up after gallagher and killing another fortyplus taliban which roused cheers throughout the room tom i think all of these men deserve a beer said harvath upon which hoyt flipped open the lid of the cooler and delivered cold beer to everyone baba g smiled hows your back feeling he asked not great replied harvath you still taking those motrin even though i warned you to be careful ive upped it said harvath holding up his bottle of beer vitamin m and vitamin b gallagher pulled a plastic bag from beneath the pillow propping him up and said i had one of the nurses pick this up in px for you i should have guessed said harvath as he pulled a pez dispenser with a marine corps drill instructors head out of the bag now while youre frying your liver and kidneys you can think of me harvath laughed and opened his beer to a successful mission he said as he raised his bottle there was a television on in the corner running a story about president aldens resignation and the swearing in of the vp as the new commander in chief one of the army rangers raised his beer and said to the united states of america with that all of the men in the room raised their bottles and in unison said to the united states of
