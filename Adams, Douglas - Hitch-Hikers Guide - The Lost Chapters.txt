the lost chapters of hitchhikers guide to the galaxy by douglas adams chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter chapter the end prologue chapter whats happening asked ford emerging from a room with bolo and looking as dishevelled as everyone else much to his surprise we got hit during a space battle explained zaphod flicking on the scanner screen we spun out of control and crash landed on this planet and as you can see hundreds of its rather short looking inhabitants are flooding over the desert towards us what are we going to do asked fenchurch the monkey man is going out to talk to them said zaphod casually what yelled arthur i knew we should have got him a replacement brain said zaphod do you want to know where the tea is before you go zaphod you cant send arthur out there exclaimed trillian they could tear him to pieces zaphod declined to comment but grinned his teeth acted as a red rag to arthur he charged across the bridge intending to send zaphod flying but zaphod neatly side stepped and arthur flew past through a happy door that opened on seeing a body flying towards it and wished arthur a fruitful journey arthur rolled down some stairs and ended up by the main airlock which gladly hissed open arthur was confronted by hundreds of cheering dwarves hooray our seventh obu is dead long live our saviour they cheered arthur looked down and saw to his dismay two stumpy legs sticking out from under the heart of gold he rightly assumed they belonged to our seventh obu he didnt assume that she was the most infamous critic of our third entism and was widely hated for her outspoken comments if he had assumed this he would have again been right he didnt so he apologised dont apologise shouted latigid the chief stavromulan you have rid us of a blight to our land what is the name of our hero arthur dent said arthur and was astounded when the entire crowd fell to their knees causing a minor sandstorm he was joined by the rest of the party who too were astounded what did you say to them arthur asked ford i just told them my name the holy one shall wear the slippers of our seventh obu as protection and shall be carried on high to the holy theatre said latigid many dwarves rushed forward and put the red slippers from our seventh obus feet on arthurs feet they didnt fit but as he was picked up it didnt really matter what about my friends asked arthur they too shall be carried on high on high wasnt particularly high arthurs feet dragged along the ground but it was better than walking the road looked rough on the feet some one had obviously run ahead to spread the news as crowds began to line the brick road arthur could see a town ahead the crowds grew larger and arthur began to enjoy himself he waved at the crowds and they waved back oooh thats our third ent cried one woman beside herself with excitement which was quite a trick for a woman of her size hes much bigger than i thought he would be shouted another person one group wasnt cheering their sect believed in the second sitting but also believed that our third ent shouldnt have gone away in the first place they were very devout and probably one of the most boring offshoots of our third entism they didnt pursue the sexual rituals that most other sects did and didnt have any religious holidays they were the only sect that believed that our third ent should be punished on his return and the gun that was to exercise that punishment was aimed at arthurs head arthur oblivious to this and many other startling facts about this planet was having a great time people rushed from the crowd just to be touched by him something that had never happened on earth he wasnt particularly overjoyed by having his feet dragged along the ground and he could feel one of his slippers slipping off no matter how much he wriggled his toes it wouldnt stay on eventually he bent over and forced it back onto his foot at that moment a bullet whistled through the space that had previously contained his head continued its path and lodged itself firmly in the heart of someone standing in the crowd noone heard the shot because of all the cheering and those around him assumed the man had suffered a heart attack they were wrong because fate had deemed this to the man in a former life and for variety had opted for the bullet this time arthur saw none of this and could therefore feel no sorrow for agrajag arthur shouted ford this is all very nice but i imagine that the sirius cybernetics corporation will come looking for us soon but ford sighed zaphod lapping up the adulation even though it wasnt for him the heart of gold is one invalid improbability drive ship ah i know said ford a grin creeping onto his face but i found a back up improbability drive generator in our quarters all we need to do is fix the stabilisers and were history here i think arthur is already history on this planet said fenchurch proud of her man ford said zaphod still waving at the crowd we need an atomic vector plotter to connect the back up to the ship and i used the last one two weeks ago to unblock the toilet i knew there was something we forgot at the megamarket last week moaned trillian perhaps these people have one said bolo hopefully any race that looks up to a puny primate is hardly likely to have evolved up to atomic vector plotter level muttered zaphod unfortunately his bearers heard this they dropped him which didnt hurt then jumped on him which did blasphemer they yelled in no time at all zaphod was trussed up by the crowd and suspended from a pole held by his bearers hey guys he moaned cant you take a joke youve got as much humour as a vogon stag night the power of this statement was lost on the stavromulans as they had never even met a vogon let alone be subjected to the ugliness of a vogon bride serves you right said trillian you chose the wrong place to insult arthur arthur get them to put me down yelled zaphod letting his cool slip to lukewarm we will do with him as you wish said latigid leave him as he is until i decide said arthur gloating zaphod broke into a sob and marvin broke into the death march to cheer zaphod up the procession entered a long tunnel which arthur failed to gauge accurately and subsequently remembered this by having to endure a bump on the head and the accompanying pain the tunnel emerged into a large open air amphitheatre packed with stavromulans marvins bearers literally collapsed with joy as they reached the stage dont apologise said marvin knowing full well they had no intention of doing so i expect to be thrown about its all part of life he was barely heard over the roars of the crowd as arthur was introduced look argued zaphod the crowd have got what they want why dont you let me go latigid was unimpressed your arguments have become stale and boring stale me zaphod protested im so fresh my sell by date is light years away by nunk arthur ill get you for this arthur wasnt listening he was devouring all the adulation being thrust upon him he walked to the front of the stage and held his arms out this inspired more hysterical cheers from the crowd he cleared his throat to speak and a sudden hush fell over the crowd people he started he felt it was a strong opening seeing as he had no insight into their culture they hung on his every word i am arthur dent screams went up from the crowd but this time as a result of the robots from sirius appearing around the top of the amphitheatre the place emptied like a train full of lemmings at the white cliffs of dover weve caught up with you again said jeremy it wasnt even a good chase this time you killed off our scouts which was a bit unsporting and you waited here for us i think youve lost interest so if you cant be bothered well just kill you what is that robot doing with you i am not just that robot thank you very much snorted marvin you obviously have no conception of who i am he paused to beg the question then started again so soon as jeremy began to speak i am your prototype marvin the robots were stunned and amazed we were told you had been kidnapped whats the point of kidnapping me nobody wants me i just ended up going along for the ride enough of that why havent you given me the android salute i am your superior the robots looked at each other confused you stick you left arm in the right ear of the robot next to you didnt they programme you anything the robots obliged exploded and lit up the stavromulan sky with a firework display to rival the space battle seen but an hour before almost as stupid as you lot muttered marvin chapter we must be in zaphod beeblebroxs neighbourhood mused arthur thats the second time ive heard that name said fenchurch still shaking the rusty particles of an android with a brain the size of a planet from her clothes who or what is it zaphods just this guy he was president of the universe for a while he may still be look in the book he may be mentioned arthur got the guide out of his souvenir gods last message to his creation holdall fenchurch tapped in the code how long have we got asked fenchurch how long do you need the time it takes to read war and peace i think this says page one of pages and the rest of the page is taken up with references to other areas of the book where he is mentioned arthur took the guide and flipped to page two more references page three arthur was hardly turnedon by the sight of zaphod in a rather tacky pose and was not amused by the caption that read zaphod is not just a pretty face for he can ski and likes reading he can also outdrink and outcool anyone in the universe arthur keyed in another code and got what he wasnt sure he really wanted youve got all the time it takes me to salvage this poor robot and for us to hitchhike to that address arthur stabbed his finger purposely at the screen i want you to meet zaphod beeblebrox that way youll appreciate me even more ford prefect was indeed in a seedy bar trying to talk somebody into buying him a drink and only achieving success as a total failure in this venture the expression it is far better to give than receive referred only to physical violence in this bar after leaving arthur and fenchurch on their way to where they had just decided to leave he had decided to find the rather nice girl who offered a comforting service to rich men in han dold city ford couldnt shake her devastating smile from his mind he felt it would be a useful weapon by his side besides having seen arthur so happy with fenchurch so happy that ford couldnt irritate him as easily as usual and zaphod settling down with trillian ford decided the last thing he wanted to do was be unfashionable and stay single so ford had ventured to the bar where he came very close to being mutilated by an evil looking bird and an arm with a vicious streak and nothing else noticeable ford entered the bar was shocked stunned and then shocked again he was convinced this was the same bar but it was now reminiscent of a wine bar he had visited in hampstead gone were the evil overtones and murderous intents these had been replaced by old french posters and bamboo chairs the evil looking bird had been stuffed and put over the bar the arm was opening wine bottles and mixing cocktails oh its you said the barman who now looked unbearably smart youre the one to blame for this hi said ford still looking around im to blame for what your entry in the hitchhikers guide muttered the barman wasnt it accurate argued ford defensive of his life saving piece of prose wasnt it along the lines of wretched place with evil overtones and murderous intents or something thats it exactly that was enough to attract all the trendies who were desperate to find a place with atmosphere they pushed out all the regulars well could i change it offered ford apologetically nah i hate these people and their trendy talk but they dont argue about paying even though ive marked the prices up to silly levels so youd best leave it ford tried to listen to some of the conversations but there werent any there were plenty of opinions being offered about generally misunderstood subjects that bored everyone to tears but no actual conversations ford decided to leave and find where all the former regulars were hanging out at least he felt threatened and therefore relaxed in their company as he left he butted into one opinion with ah but you havent considered the vogons have you which enabled one rich young trendy to launch into his very personalised views on vogon sociology ford eventually found a suitably seedy bar which is where we find him but if you buy me a drink you can go around saying do you know who i bought a drink for the other night ford prefect thats who i wont mind i wont even charge you repeat fees for my name it didnt work his hapless victim had yelled something quite obscene at a slab of a creature in the hope that the slab would ask him to step outside and repeat it the slab obliged and fords victim changed hands fords attention switched to the large tv screen viewer on the wall between the alcohol stains a newsreader droned on about vogon riots apparently three squadrons of flying police had descended on the riots while media specialists debated the causes of the riots at great length all the old reasons were dusted off and injected with topical incidents to improve credibility no one asked the vogons who could have easily explained that it just seemed like a good idea at the time the newsreader handed over to the social editor who ford recognised as one of the greatest partygoers of all time that was enough to make ford listen what he heard would have made a pan galactic gargle blaster reach for something to steady itself and of course all the leading lights of the social galaxy are preparing themselves for possibly the greatest bash since eccentrica gallumbits the triplebreasted whore of eroticon six had her coming out in and many other permutations party yes the invites have been printed for zaphod beeblebroxs wedding ford tried to spin around on his barstool in an attempt to catch up with his head he then made his mind up to get wrecked in celebration zaphod would have wanted it that way he felt as though he wanted company during this hour of sorrow so he decided he would not get wrecked and look for the girl he would get totally sobered and look for the girl he walked outside over his former hapless victim and down the now peaceful street this was because the police wars that had ruined the area had ceased or at least a truce had been called it needed the combined efforts of the fighting fractions to impose on the spot fines on the rich young trendies as they staggered into their bourgemobiles to race home ford peered into every doorway and saw plenty of interesting things but not what he wanted just as he decided to get so wrecked he wouldnt care which girl he found he heard a familiar voice been paid for those two words yet it was backed up by the devastatingly shy but selfconfident smile that had his emotions screaming for mercy ive been looking for you was all ford could manage ive been looking for you too she exclaimed i owe you my deepest thanks apparently since you put in your entry about the bar this place has been inundated with rich people ive made enough to give it all up for something more worthwhile she was hitting all the right notes with ford good how do you fancy going to the society wedding of the omp sounds good to me wed better introduce ourselves then my name is bolo fords brain relayed that to all of its areas and innuendo came up with that reminds me of something from earth that kept my tongue occupied for many happy hours which his brain scrutinised and sent to common sense common sense tutted and passed it to character assessment for a second opinion character assessment complained as usual that it was overworked and couldnt say whether it would be well received or would result in a slapped face that would activate pain and the whole brain knew what trouble that caused common sense decided to send the thought skulking into memory to be held and used at a later date hopefully as a witty apres sex reflection im ford prefect she held out her hand and he shook it briskly admiring the soft touch and the firm grip on his heart how will we travel a glint formed in fords eye you are looking at one of the greatest hitchhikers in the galaxy ill get some money and a towel ford knew he had met the girl of his dreams chapter a wedding is a ritual which exists in most societies only at varying levels of involvement from a simple agreement to meet say once a year for dinner to the mutual exchanging of left limbs the latter does not apply to the quoquobuletes they are easily recognised as the male has legs which lead into the arms has a flat torso between the two is about a metre high and looks something like a capital h the female is the same shape only about metres high the marriage ceremony is not unusual with the supposed exchanging of tokens during the ceremony the male leaving his on the dressing table and blaming the best man however to certify the ceremony the marriage must be consummated within four hours now this although not a strict requirement in most marriages is usually enthusiastically pursued by most couples as a necessity as opposed to a requirement it is a different story for the quoquobuletes though hardly through not trying out of every quoquobulete marriages end in unconsummation or physical exhaustion those who are easily embarrassed by such matters should now skip to the next chapter for there now follows a description of the quoquobulete sexual act first of all it must be performed standing up as anything else is considered merely foreplay due to the obvious physical differences the male digs a small hole metres square and metres deep the female then stands metres back from the hole the male then takes a pole which can be bent under force without breaking and then resume its original straight axis the male takes a run at the female with the pole held horizontal to the ground aiming at the hole once the point of the pole makes contact with the hole the male continues running until the pole reaches its most springy point and propels him towards the female torso in a hope to cling on this usually results in the male flying past the female at great height or hitting the female so hard he knocks her over this is viewed as one of the saddest cases in the universe and also as another good reason why the earth was shunned for many years because they chose to ridicule the act with a sport called the pole vault another event associated with wedding is the stag night for the quoquobuletes it was a chance for a last minute training session to perfect technique but for most males it is a damn good excuse to get drunk insult people act offensively and generally be a nuisance as zaphod beeblebrox is a recognised expert in all of these fields his stag night promised to be a showstopper psychologists have many theories about the deep hidden reasons for a stag night such as striking a final blow for freedom or getting into a state where nothing after would be as bad but these have never been ratified as the last person you would invite on a stag night would be a psychologist so ford prefect was heading for zaphods for the sole purpose of being on the stag night and arthur dent was heading towards zaphods on a purely social visit which would end up as a stag night they would never forget chapter it says here that zaphods planet is a peaceful haven for the famous with glorious mountains which blend in beautifully with the tropical beaches it offers good skiing great libraries and plenty of people who think that they are cool and think they can drink sounds like something from the magrathean catalogue said arthur who are the magratheans asked fenchurch oh they were the galaxys equivalent of harrods they could build any sort of planet to your exact specification im afraid to say that the earth was built by them you mean to say that someone actually specified milton keynes no its a very long story but i dont think milton keynes was ever intended one day ill tell you about the golgafrincham b ark we should have time i think this is going to be a very long journey thats the trouble with this hitchhiking lark you get a lot of time on your hands fenchurch took his hand and squeezed it im glad im spending it with you arthur swallowed and tried to stop his palm from being so sweaty he had never felt so happy being so uncomfortable much as i appreciate the lift were getting i think this ship is the equivalent of a cv on earth arthur tried to think of a cv in desperation but his mind kept fighting back to fenchurchs warm hand in his he looked around for some form of distraction there werent many they were in the hold of a family cruiser belonging to some quoquobuletes who were on their first holiday to the sunny planet of beebles home of zaphod beeblebrox arthur and fenchurch had hitchhiked using their souvenir gods final message to his creation electronic thumb to a large space service station where lots of little creatures were charging around and adult creatures were stretching their arms legs and in some cases other extremities arthur bought some babel fish and had a lot of trouble convincing fenchurch that putting one in you ear was a really good idea they soon found out that conversations werent any different at this service station than they were on any service station on earth short cuts the lousy condition of the toilets and the cost compared with a local station were the general order of the day arthur had eventually found someone going to beebles and willing to give them a lift their travelling companions consisted of mr and mrs xoloho and their three children their holiday was being paid for by the quoquobulete government for being the first couple in quoquobulete history to produce more than two children mr xoloho walked if it could be called that into the hold the wifes getting a bit tired driving so im going to take over he explained well take the next turning off the hyperspace tract to fit the male driving adapter equipment if you could give my wife a hand it should be fitted in half an hour itll be my pleasure said arthur actually i was referring to your young lady said mr xoloho arthur almost got flustered then realised that mr xoloho had good reason to view the female as the dominant sex fenchurch laughed and arthur reconsidered being flustered but mr xoloho had gone theyre so nice arent they sighed fenchurch i never expected aliens to be so polite they are not all like that there were these creatures i once met called the vogons and they the ship lurched out of hyperspace and arthurs stomach lurched out of place he stood up but his body didnt want to leave before any of its vital organs and slumped down again i could do without that groaned fenchurch you should try matter transference or rather you shouldnt it makes coming out of hyperspace seem like coming out of a sauna remind me not to try matter transference ill do my best they gingerly stood up and went to the front of the ship the xoloho children had already disembarked and mrs xoloho was disentangling herself from the controls arthur walked out and into the ship park there were about two dozen ships of varying sizes parked arthur saw two people going from ship to ship hitchhikers thought arthur then he saw one of them wearing an irritating grin he couldnt believe it ford yelled arthur ford looked up grabbed bobs hand and ran over to arthur we meet again said arthur shaking fords free hand yes replied ford did you get to see cods final message we did and very i think its overrated interrupted ford grinning with the knowledge that he had irritated arthur we met marvin the paranoid android how is the old misery ive got some of whats left of him in this carrier bag arthur this is bolo ford modelled his flow of conversation on brownian motion principles hello polo is that like the mint with no its spelt with a b ford realised arthur was grinning it irritated him which was the precise reason why arthur was grinning fords grin slipped slightly arthur shook bobs hand and wanted to borrow her smile he could win friends and influence people with a smile like that what are you up to anyway asked ford irritated this time by the length of the handshake well i was going to visit zaphod with fenchurch shes in the ship over there doing some adapting of some sort said arthur casually pointing in the direction of half a dozen ships oh so youre off to zaphods wedding too asked bob arthurs jaw dropped and he looked at ford in disbelief arthurs brain took no responsibility for his jaw as it showed great indecision zaphod married to trillian he blurted out yes to all three ford was glad he had the upper hand again fenchurch joined them hello ford nice to see you again nice to see you sober as well fenchurch this is bob bob this is fenchurch could you go and get us some food ford said in his best could you please go and leave us alone so we can have a private talk voice they obliged zaphod arthur was speechless bar that one word didnt you know its the biggest news since eccentrica gallumbits the triplebreasted whore of eroticon opened her night club planet didnt you say they had some kids yeah hes going to do the decent thing grinned ford first time for everything im stunned arthur wasnt lying not as much as you will be ford looked over his shoulder to make sure the women were out of hearing range when i say wedding whats the first thing you think of rice down the back of my neck from a lousy shot no no before the wedding getting a present youre missing my point yelled ford he took a deep breath and continued what do the men do the night before a wedding go on a stag night arthur felt enlightened then thought of the other stag night he had been on true everyone got fairly drunk but he got separated from the crowd on the way to soho and ended up in waterloo station those who did make it to soho were arrested and missed the wedding and as arthur was the only one from the stag night to turn up all the guests took it out on him right and zaphods will go down in the guide as the greatest ever ford found himself doing a little dance in celebration mr xoloho came over to them well be ready in about five minutes he said to arthur could you take two more hitchhikers asked arthur ive known this one for countless years and i know he wont give you any trouble sure the more the merrier he turned and returned to the ship these are nice people so please behave pleaded arthur you know me ford played his winning stroke backed up by his best grin arthur made a mental note to try harder in future chapter zaphod lounged on the patio by the swimming pool his estate was right by the tropical sea but he had a swimming pool all the same status symbols only served their purpose if they were never used he turned a dial which raised his sun bed a further two inches off the ground and tilted it a few more degrees one of his heads drained a tropical drink as the other called for another a cocktail robot flitted over to him and filled the glass the robot was the only one of its kind to be programmed to mix a pan galactic gargle blaster the traditional way it had cost a fortune but zaphod felt it was worth it trillians sun bed floated along side his she had a beautiful tan are you going to the office today she asked without turning nah too nice a day every day here is the same i know great isnt it mellowed zaphod besides heart of gold is in for omp service how long will that take trillian actually turned her head i dont know the bastards have it overnight so they can do the galaxy try and impress some chicks with it recover give it a couple of kicks leave greasy fingerprints all over it and work out an extortionate bill it could take days why not take it somewhere else you kind of know where you stand with these guys theyre hoopy but theyll rip you off not this time i pulled a couple of wires if they miss them its curtains i told them who i am and what would happen if they didnt do a proper job blackmail its called good business if they do a good job theyll come out of it alright a small monitor flew from the house and hovered in front of zaphod he squinted and shaded his eyes hey weve got visitors beamed zaphod ford and the monkey man are here with some chicks freeooww you mean arthur said trillian firmly she waited arent you going to let them in not yet i want to see them ogle a little while longer chuckled zaphod i can almost hear them saying this cant be my place this cant be zaphods place arthur said disgusted by the fact that he knew it was he must have done pretty well for himself since the krikkit business said ford what was dont ask fenchurch snapped arthur its not something i want to be reminded of the door swung silently open no happy service or glad to be of service zaphod had made it big he stood in the doorway arms open hi hi hi guys good to see me isnt it no seriously hi ford arthur who are the chicks these ladies are fenchurch and bolo said arthur hi bolo nice to see you again you youve met spluttered ford yes zaphods the guy with the grey limo from han dold city explained bolo but dont mention it the soon to be wifes inside whispered zaphod come through to the patio trillian got off the sun bed to greet them after the formal introductions of fenchurch and bolo she put her arms around ford and arthur its great to see you guys again its been too long she said she had been explained to fenchurch and bolo to avoid any embarrassment a gesture like this would have caused and we got here just in time said ford rubbing his hands together whens the big night i mean day two days time we hoped you would make it wouldnt miss it for the planet ford winked at arthur nice place youve got here admired arthur it was meant to be admired the house sprawled lazily like a basking octopus over the entire beach which curved into a tropical bay beautiful snowy mountains rose majestically behind the house its not bad said trillian looking at zaphod its the only place we could find to accommodate zaphods ego what the house or the planet asked arthur hey guys what is this get at zaphod day or something exclaimed zaphod so what have you been up to zaphod to get all of this asked ford trillian sighed and took the women away to show them around the house im glad you asked pull up a sun bed is it going to take that long asked arthur no monkey man youre just looking a little peaky the suns will do you the world of good arthur ignored the insult and climbed on the sun bed he was immediately turned upside down turn the dial said ford climbing onto his sun bed arthur fiddled with the dial and eventually got himself into a position where the two suns beat down on either side of his face casting no shadows this is paradise he sighed no its beebles its got a much better ring to it said zaphod anyway after the krikkit lark the galactic police caught up with me but they just wanted to escort me to the galactic council they were still angry over the heart of gold but once i explained to them how i saved the universe from the krikkits they were fine but you didnt started arthur dont interrupt interrupted zaphod they said i couldnt really go back to being president but would be willing to give me any other job i wanted i didnt mess around guys i went for the big one guys you are now looking at the new owner editor for the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy he paused for effect with the platinum handshake i got i put down a deposit for a magrathean planet now ive got my planet and the magratheans have a full page advert for a year the rest is made up from the tourist trade so basically youre rolling in it said ford exactly said zaphod good you can pay me the money im owed for the coverage on earth ford held out his hand but i got it all put in instead of the edited version isnt that enough no i dont do this for the love you know you really find out who your friends are when you become their owner muttered zaphod owner shouted ford yeah apparently as a researcher your guide remains the property of megadodo publications which is the property of myself and your contract states that as you are in possession of the guide you are the property of megadodo publications which is in turn well you know the rest well heres fifty nine point nine nine alterian dollars said ford thrusting money in zaphods hand then took his researchers card out of his pocket and threw it in the swimming pool i quit nice to see you again ford beamed zaphod and you mate grinned ford they embraced realised how silly they looked and separated arthur got on with getting tanned so what about the stag night asked ford well i thought we could go to eccentrica gallumbits new night club planet its supposed to be wild great said ford are you in monkey man asked zaphod yes four eyes im in arthur dialled himself a greater angle screaming and hollering filled the air causing arthur to upend his sun bed and land too heavily on the floor two little kids hammered towards him leapt over his cowering body and into zaphods arms little brats he said grinning paternally ive named the oldest one phil after my earth name the nippers called trisha after trillians earth name arthur studied them closely they looked like normal kids maybe a bit too cute for his liking but still normal he breathed a sigh of relief to the fact that they had taken after their mother children this is uncle ford and uncle arthur zaphod had changed thought arthur the kids giggled and buried their faces in zaphod he shook his heads still grinning bless em arthur felt that bless em should be mentioned every time their names were said as an unofficial middle name he had a niece on earth called michaela and he always associated her name with bless her heart michaela bless her heart martin it had a nice ring to it and if you ever met her you would know how applicable it was by this time zaphod the kids and ford had gone inside arthur hurried into the house everyone was sitting around a magnificent table covered by a magnificent feast the last time arthur had seen food like this he had found mice on the table he checked before sitting down fenchurch took his hand and squeezed it this incredible she whispered in his ear i propose a toast shouted ford not knowing the acoustically perfect design of the room would swell his voice to that of a welsh male voice choir everyone lifted their glasses to zaphod trillian and the kids may your futbulions never cross and your buquabs never separate only zaphod appreciated this ancient betelgeuse toast but they all drank to it as they prepared to gorge themselves zaphod stood up did you get us a present zaphod said trillian through clenched teeth well theyre expected to bring a present still never mind if you havent ive enough presence for all of us zaphod was the only one to laugh as was usual for his attempts at humour actually we have said arthur mystifying everyone he rummaged through his carrier bag and produced some circuit boards sorry theyre not gift wrapped hey thank you falsified zaphod im touched were touched that you thought of us what are they marvin or at least whats worth keeping so thats where he got to exclaimed zaphod wheres my coat his demand went unanswered and the horrified looks from around the table demanded an explanation i sent him to the big bang burger bar to get my coat which i left behind perhaps i should have given him the return fare marvin is dead whispered trillian tears brimming in her eyes she only remembered the good times or to be more accurate the less than lousy times when marvin complimented her or at least was inoffensive towards her i think it would be fairer to say that marvin has rusted zaphods tact struck like nuclear missile in the bullseye of a dartboard trillian ran out of the room crying i think you should keep hold of marvin for the moment said ford arthur stuck marvin in his pocket chapter death could be defined as that which when mentioned over dinner could cause one person to leave the room crying and for all bar one to be put off their magnificent meal a very personalised definition admittedly but a very applicable one even though it is based on a situation with a major misunderstanding marvin did not die although it was what he dearly wished he ceased to function which had the desired effect albeit temporarily it has been asked why in addition to marvins ability to switch off at any time and with the knowledge that by sticking his left arm in his right ear he could electrocute himself marvin never finished himself off a long time ago apart from the fact that his programming wouldnt allow him he would miss out on the opportunity to continue being wretched which he did until his body could take it no longer there are those who feel that marvins end was untimely and a bit of an anticlimax considering his eventful life full of narrow escapes close shaves and apathetic encounters his escape from the disaster area stunt ship has never been fully documented and will not be disclosed here to remain within the legal boundaries that exist for that section of society with a furtive imagination nor can we forget the lengthy tale of how marvin eventually ended up minus one original leg on the planet squornshellous zeta however marvin has ceased to exist as before and will stay that way unless something really improbable happens it may please those who think that this is the very end of marvin to know that it is indirectly through marvin that zaphod ford and arthur not to mention trillian bolo and fenchurch are soon to be sent on their way to save the universe chapter the scruffy mechanic idled around by the door eventually zaphod opened it ive brought your ship back goes like a dream now said the mechanic wiping his hands on his greasy overalls achieving nothing it was going like a dream beforehand i was hoping for a little reality to creep back into its performance muttered zaphod very good sir the mechanic knew of zaphods position and wasnt going to jeopardise his by getting cocky we followed the service instructions down to the last detail no unnecessary work done we even changed the filters on the nutrimatic drinks synthesiser okay okay i had an estimate but lets see how it differs from the present tense expense what shee the bill you know the paper with all the big numbers all over it oh yes right the mechanic took out a sheet of paper accidentally on purpose smudging his greasy fingers across the sundries column which contained the tip for the waiter at an incredibly expensive restaurant he had taken his girlfriend and the heart of gold to on a test drive the replacement solar tiling and the money he lost playing eddie the shipboard computer at electronic halma zaphod signed his name twice against his editors expense account number on the bill as the second signature would be worth a bit in years to come and was cheaper than a tip thanks sir humbled the mechanic and you wont forget the mention in the guide will you sir well see after ive taken her for a spin ill be in touch zaphod shut the door im sure i get ripped off more than bog roll arthur was feeding all his details into the latest gizmo from the sirius cybernetics corporation the tailormatic the principle was very good by feeding in all bodily details such as height weight number of limbs etc the tailormatic would link up to the fashion mainframes around the universe to consult what the latest fashions were and then synthetically create an ideal outfit unfortunately it was programmed by the same man who programmed the nutrimatic machine and didnt always produce the goods so to speak arthur hit the enter button and the tailormatic shook into action eventually a cellophane wrapped package popped out once arthur had spent five minutes removing pins and cardboard he tried it on and this is fashionable he asked the machine rhetorically upon my life ive never seen anyone wear it so well chirped the machine its not too bright bright is in my boy you want to be noticed dont you yes but not to be ridiculed dont be silly i wish i could get away with wearing something like that im more worried about being put away and i suppose the motto share and enjoy applies to the clothes as well how many people am i supposed to share this with at one time its meant to be loose it flows so does wine but i wouldnt go out in it well i can take it in a touch but it would ruin the line dont bother ill get a second opinion fenchurch was trying on one of trillians dresses for the wedding arthur charged in muttered an embarrassed apology and walked out arthur she shouted he sheepishly put his head around the door come in i just wanted your opinion on this he held his arms out and turned around what the tailormatic had produced was a gold lame track suitlike outfit which hung on arthur like snow on a weeping willow fabulous embroidery covered the outfit and reflective prism strips had been sown in all over well youd look better hanging from the ceiling of the nightclub than on the dancefloor no its really quite different fenchurch had trouble suppressing a laugh its supposed to be fashionable in the better places in the universe when in rome do i think ill wear my jacket over it that way i wont feel like a walking laser light show fenchurch went over to him and put her arms around his waist promise me youll behave tonight i promise well probably just have a few drinks lied arthur he knew ford and zaphod had been undergoing strenuous body conditioning all day in preparation for a full frontal assault on as much alcohol as they could lay their lips on will you be alright here ill be fine the three of us havent stopped nattering there was a knock at the door ford popped his head around the door thought id find you in here he grinned were off ill see you later said arthur hoping that ford would disappear so he could kiss fenchurch goodbye but he had no chance enjoy yourself but not too much fenchurch kissed him on the cheek and patted his behind arthur followed ford down the stairs where zaphod was waiting his outfit made arthurs seem like funeral attire the suit shimmered and changed colour in splashes like a cinema screen before the film starts but without the nauseating effect bolts of harmless laser burst from the suit at random and the matching headband glowed luminously its on random at the moment buy ill turn it to synchro in the night club to keep time with the music said zaphod then watch out cos my suit will do the dancing for me thats good when you dance people clear a space in sympathy and for safety said ford hey cool it with the jibes im out for good vibes said zaphod remember this is my night im gonna do it just right are we going to get going or just talk about it asked arthur now theres someone straining at the leash said zaphod obviously a love hungry man well get going soon monkey man we wont use improbability drive no point in getting there too early we want to make a big entrance chapter eccentrica gallumbits nightclub planet looked no different from any other magrathean planet on approach only on closer inspection could you make out the glittering surface zaphod put the heart of gold into orbit around the planet to get a better look a huge complex covered a quarter of the planet with ship parks covering the remainder zaphod tuned the subetha radio into the planet and a bass line which sounded like it had been carved out of granite pounded the speakers now thats what i call a groove said zaphod tapping his heads together in time the planet suddenly burst into light as it was switched to sound to light the surface pulsated with the beat beats the hell out of a neon sign said arthur zaphod parked the heart of gold in a predominant position as usual they stepped out into the ship park a robot transporter pulled up and they climbed aboard the electricity bill must be phenomenal said arthur as the transporter weaved through the myriad of flashing lights all done with fibre optics no doubt said ford probably all runs off one light bulb and the beat went on the transporter had quadraphonic speakers to confirm that the lights werent going off at a tangent arthur could feel his heart trying to keep time with the music the transporter pulled up at the main entrance flash bulbs flashed cameras whirred reporters jostled with each other to get a good position are you still going through with it zaphod are you really giving up the wild life do you think marriage will interrupt your quest for ultimate coolness mr beeblebrox hey guys said zaphod lapping up the attention my future wife will hear about anything i say to you and you know how you take things i say out of context he stopped and posed briefly for photographers so i guess i ought to remain silent after several throwaway poses he went through the crowd to the door ford and arthur fought their way through to join him zaphod put his arms around them and grinned for the cameras one for the album my last night of freedom chapter eccentrica gallumbits the triple breasted whore of eroticon is universally famous as one of the best good times known to males part of her fame is due to a coffee cup being placed on a genetic engineers plan prior to her birth gallumbits an old inferno of zaphod beeblebrox has been the centre of many wild rumours such as her erogenous zones starting four miles from her body where in fact it has been statistically proven that even when she is in the mood the distance is at most two miles another rumour inaccurate again is that fortunate males whom we shall accurately call joyriders accompanying gallumbits on what we shall call an excursion experience a feeling akin to the planetmoonstarshipwaterbed moving professional observers positioned at a safe distance have observed that no such movement is apparent however as joyriders considerably outnumber professional observers this has yet to be proven any professional observers who have joined the growing ranks of joyriders in an attempt to measure any movement first hand usually drop all their necessary equipment in a frenzy at the appropriate moment she has been condemned by females repelled by an uncaring male population society as degrading to females and too stupid for words however gallumbits has proven to have one of the most brilliant female business minds of all time her three dimensional full size holoposter helped her retain her positively the most polpular pinup award for the tenth year running and boosted her earnings close to disaster area proportions her favourite saying i dont care if they are more interested in my body than my mind so long as they realise that i am more interested in their money than their body angered the frumps so much they sued gallumbits was acquitted by a male judge and an all male jury chauvinists on earth will be comforted by the fact that although chauvinism may be dying out on earth the traditions are still being upheld in other parts of the universe eccentrica gallumbits stood at the reception hot with anticipation another rumour states that she can be hot with boredom with disgust and while doing the dusting but only two of these can be genuinely vouched for she could see zaphod fighting his way to the door she curled her leg around a small tube supporting a drink the small tube dropped the drink in the excitement and ran over to his crowd of tubes in the bar to exaggerate what happened hey babe whats shaking said zaphod after a dramatic entrance that included kicking the door open only to slam in arthurs face same things as always said gallumbits seductively and gave a physical demonstration i heard the bad news on the sub etha had to happen one day said zaphod i suppose so sighed gallumbits as seductively as the ear would allow as she does everything seductively it can be safely assumed that although it will no longer be mentioned she is being seductive im wearing three black bands in memory of the sad day first time ive seen them worn there said ford fascinated little ford squealed gallumbits its been ages have you got over your little problem yet fords ogling was distracted what problems this little ford asked zaphod deciding to kick off the personal abuse for the evening whos this interrupted gallumbits oh this is just arthur dent hes a friend of trillian hell be alright if you can let him have some tea said zaphod verbally swinging his fist from ford to arthur the arthur dent squealed gallumbits she squealed a lot not this again yes the arthur dent said arthur gallumbits brushed past zaphod and ford exciting them more than a brush should legally be allowed to she put her arms on arthurs shoulders and kissed him ive heard a lot about you she smouldered but i dont think ive had the pleasure arthurs voice decided to go falsetto when he was hoping for a rich tenor his body was pleading for mercy and a cold shower i dont think we have he squeaked how do you do ive had no complaints so far well said arthur searching for inspirational conversation in a mind filled with other matters thats very good dont worry shes always after fresh blood said zaphod worried whos worried said arthur wondering if it was her perfume not me im not worried what have i got to be worried about nice place youve got here said ford glancing briefly at the decor before resuming gallumbits watching im proud of it said gallumbits sticking her chest out its taken a long time to get it how i wanted it but i think it will keep everyone happy arthur was swimming in a pool of ambiguity i hope it lives down to your reputation said zaphod ive worked hard enough to get it that way ive got to sort out some business affairs right now but you go and enjoy yourselves its all on the house tonight ill catch up with you later especially you arthur she touched all of them on the cheek with delicate fingers and disappeared behind a door into which arthur had assumed was the mens toilet because of the men queuing up outside it still looking good sighed ford and then some replied zaphod and plenty after that added arthur his voice edging down the scale to soprano well said zaphod snapping out of the trance lets observe and reserve what asked arthur lets pick out the suitable women explained zaphod its just as well im beyond having my style cramped but your getting married tomorrow protested arthur its because i m getting married tomorrow that we must pull tonight otherwise the marriage will be null and void its a condition that was one of the few good things i did as president of the universe and do we all have to pull asked arthur were supposed to but we may make an exception in your case it would be a shame to cancel the wedding because of you piped ford lets discuss this over a drink pleaded zaphod they headed into one of the bars that had been littered all over the complex the barman of this one stood proudly behind his bar polishing glasses ford reached the bar first do you serve pan galactic gargleblasters he asked and dont say we serve anyone with the money the barman reached over the bar and picked ford off the ground by the collar of his blazer i happen to be one of the most experienced pan galactic gargleblaster mixers in the universe muttered the barman in fords ear ford clapped his hand down on the barmans flattish head the smacking noise and the shock caused the barman to drop ford is that so said ford that is so said the barman well buddy boy im going to put you to the test said ford do you know who is in our party no zaphod beeblebrox thats who er really said the barman swallowing hard zaphod leaned against the bar smiled raised a hand and emitted his coolest hi so mix one up and well see what zaphod has to say said ford it wont take a minute mr beeblebrox flustered the barman zaphod placed all three hands on the bar and started breathing deeply he rolled his heads in opposite directions which caused a flutter of applause to come from the small crowd that had formed a small camera hovered above the bar transmitting the pictures to all the video screens in the nightclub zaphod started puffing and slapping his cheeks he decided to use his right head for the drinking and his left head for the observing he bent his knees and squatted down his hands still on the bar he blew loudly several times and stood upright he turned to his audience now quite large and jogged on the spot he thrust his arms up in a rocky type pose one he had been mastering in front of the mirror which started the applause again i will need a silver spoon preferably the one you used to make the drink a timing device a glass of water and a cloth said zaphod like a magician looking for volunteers the barman dutifully produced all of these items and nervously placed them in front of zaphod who was staring at him like a boxer the barman avoided zaphods eyes and put the drink down on the bar the barman stood back and rubbed his hands together anxiously zaphod sipped the glass of water swilled it around in his mouth gargled with it and spat it out his suit had sensed the atmosphere of the moment and displayed dark moody colours wait a minute cried the barman he ran over to the drink and dropped an olive in it i forgot the heat of the moment zaphods glare shut him up zaphod lifted the glass to the light and squinted at it he sniffed it as one would sniff smelling salts knowing full well what they smelt like he nodded and picked up the spoon he scooped up a drop of the drink and switched on the timing device fumes smoked away from the spoon and when a hole appeared in the spoon zaphod stopped the timing device he looked at the time and nodded again he wiped away the residue liquid from the bar with the cloth before it started eating its way through that zaphod rolled his heads again much to the delight of the crowd and started puffing again he took the glass in his hand looked at the ceiling looked at the barman looked at the drink and then while the left head watched closely downed the drink in one ford and arthur helped zaphod to his feet he shook his heads and steadied himself well barman said zaphod hoarsely that was good very good set up three for us the audience erupted the barman cried and arthur suddenly realised he was expected to drink one of these liquid stun guns dont worry said ford to arthur who was holding the glass as one would hold an anaconda take it in sips its quite pleasant arthur took a hesitant sip and screwed his face up in anticipation there was no pain it felt like slipping into a hot bath inside out not bad he said then found his body fulfilling an urgent desire to be horizontal itll take a while said ford helping arthur up perhaps we should get you a phodcaran hurenge chapter excuse me asked arthur the two dolphins stopped chattering and turned to face him this will probably sound very silly and you will almost certainly have no idea what im talking about but im from a planet called earth and youre not exclaimed one of the dolphins youre pulling my flipper surely squealed the other no i really am said arthur i was wondering if you could explain to me exactly what happened on earth you know why it reappeared and you disappeared well you are talking to the right people my name is etats and this is dilos said etats offering his flipper which arthur shook he fought the urge to throw etats a fish and blow a whistle we were behind the campaign to save the humans said dilos i got a bowl from you then said arthur it cant be they sang in unison let me guess said arthur but they didnt give him the chance you must be the arthur dent thats right out of vision man is this one meeting to remember said etats let me get you a drink said dilos he passed a container to arthur it was seethrough with a straw poking through the lid arthur sipped the straw and was pleasantly surprised to taste gin and tonic when he released the straw he quickly put his finger over it to prevent any water getting in being metres under and sitting around a submerged table dont worry said etats each cup has an artificial atmosphere in it to allow liquid out but not in how clever remarked arthur removing his finger now where shall we start said dilos we originally came from a planet called dolph it was a grotty planet really it was in the same dimension as those bastards who wanted the ultimate answer to life the universe and everything i know all about that said arthur terrible neighbours said etats we used to tap their information channels just to remind ourselves how lucky we were anyway deep thought decided that dolphins were to be part of the network they approached us with this proposition to spend time on earth and we accepted not because we wanted to help interrupted dilos oh no we couldnt give a jrevi wooc about them said etats no it just seemed like a good holiday spot so we decided that we would work to get our planet in decent living order and holiday on earth until the work was done we worked shifts half the workforce on dolph half on holiday we arrived just before the golgafrinchians the hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings hadnt arrived so we knew then it wasnt going to work still we werent going to tell them because the earth was far superior to dolph and we were having too much fun we loved the humans continued dilos once all the cavemen died the inbreeding of the golgafrinchians reduced them to babbling idiots how could you tell the difference asked arthur good point because the hyper intelligent pan dimensional beings couldnt laughed etats thats why they didnt abort the whole thing so modern man evolved from that time on the mice moulded them through the years unaware they were wasting their time no wonder you lot always seemed to be happy said arthur we were said dilos but we felt sorry for the humans because they treated us so well most of the time so when we found out about the vogon constructor fleet we tried to warn you but you didnt have babel fish so we started the campaign to save the humans noone was particularly interested and the psychiatrists gave us a lot of trouble they didnt believe us about the golgafrinchians they put it down to a childhood neurosis apart from saving the humans we didnt really fancy going back to dolph which was still in a pretty bad way then we had a stroke of luck said etats one of our great hobbies in the sea when we werent on the surface was what you called hacking on computers that how we found out about the vogons you had computers in the sea asked arthur yes not the sort you would have used but computers all the same said dilos sorry said arthur weve gone off track please continue with the story i m fascinated okay said etats we were hacking the databanks of the sirius cybernetics corporation and got hold of a provisional press release about the launch of a new product the planetcopier it was a device that could copy whole planets marvellous device but the marketing division had screwed up again noone needed it or could afford it but it was perfect for us we borrowed it on a ten day evaluation trial and took a perfect copy of the earth the second before it blew up unbelievable said arthur staggered the copy took a week to complete in which time you went to magrathea and made the earth mark redundant the magratheans opened shop again and put it on special offer they took dolph on part exchange and we put the earth mark directly opposite the copy of the earth so with the sun between us you wouldnt know we were there while the copy was being finished we sneaked back and left bowls to the three most important people on the earthyou for making the earth mark available a girl called fenchurch who was the poor soul chosen as the printout device i know her said arthur proudly how is she shaping up asked dilos part of the conditions we had to meet from the psychiatrists was wiping her mind of whatever answer she had awful shock for her shes okay now said arthur were travelling the universe together how nice said etats the final person was wonko the sane a good buddy who figured us out well that explains a lot sighed arthur i could die a happy man now now that could be arranged very easily said zaphod floating down you can t upset me said arthur everything is clear now whats that your brain scan asked zaphod bobbing gently anyone fancy playing some games asked etats hey theyve got a sirius cybernetics corporation terminal we could try some heavy duty hacking said dilos sounds good to me said zaphod i hear theyve introduced another level of security said etats they all floated to the surface and swam over to the terminal ford was lounging by the pool arthur joined him hows it going asked ford great the dolphins told me all about what really happened to the earth its amazing said arthur they took a copy of the earth with a sirius cybernetics corporation planetcopier oh ive heard of that said ford apparently they dropped the price by a few thousand alterian dollars renamed it the xt and sold it as an a photocopier theyre all over there trying to break into the sirius cybernetics computer banks old hat yawned ford a real achievement would be to fords eyes glazed over whats the matter asked arthur pan galactic relapse have you still got marvins bits in your pocket demanded ford yes i darent throw them away good good chuckled ford zaphod come here hold on yelled zaphod im on level ford grabbed arthur and pulled him over to the terminal zaphod was bashing away at the controls ford pulled the plug hey man shouted zaphod i hope you know a good genetic mechanic cos your body is going to need a complete overhaul once ive finished with it cool it said ford ive got a great idea it had better be good muttered zaphod everyone can break into the computer banks hell its the national pastime on some planets pretty boring planets ill grant you but you are running out of time interrupted zaphod what is supposed to be the most difficult place in the universe to break into my wallet answered zaphod no thats the second said ford the planet sirius home of the sirius cybernetics corporation keep talking said zaphod well we could get in there no trouble with the heart of gold and put marvin back together again for trillian ford held his hands out zaphod went quiet they reckon the planet is impossible to break into said etats i know said zaphod thinking thats why well do it you in arthur asked ford i dont think i have much choice replied arthur the minicab fare from here to zaphods must be staggering im in what about you guys zaphod asked the dolphins no wed be out of our depth said etats but well monitor your progress from here okay then men to the heart of gold ordered zaphod excitement adventure and really wild things look out here we come chapter the heart of gold was somewhat less than the service had been useful as the neutramatic machine would now deliver a damn near perfect cup of earl grey but the mechanics hadnt exactly been thorough all the standard points of the service manual had been covered but then the service manual didnt cover the possibility of the owner deliberately pulling a few wires so behind an innocent looking inspection panel the wires remained pulled they were actually part of the microprocessor controlled reverse interlock relay memory bank of the infinite improbability drive this device dumped all the necessary coordinates of the universe into the ships computer for processing this enabled the ship to assess current location against potential and possible location in relation to requested location the ships computer would then arrive in the requested location and dump all these details back with the coordinates of the ships latest position this meant that next time infinite improbability was used the computer couldnt update the current location in relation to its position in the universe as unfortunately this information would normally travel back through one of the pulled wires in laymans terms the next time infinite improbability drive was used the ship would arrive totally lost and unable to use infinite improbability drive until the wire was replaced and the coordinates reprogrammed chapter okay ford hit the improb button ordered zaphod lounging in his favourite chair ford obliged and the ship blinked out and into existence in a flash zaphod was in his least favourite chair ford had his blazer on and arthur was wearing something which by all accounts should have found its way to a jumble sale by now arthur i hate to tell you this old mate said ford realising he was now holding the remains of marvin i know said arthur his hands stuffed deep in his dressing gown pockets it was a little less shabby than when he last saw it but it was still very worn at the edges sides and generally all over i suppose travelling the universe wouldnt be the same without it well guys looks like were all dressed for the occasion said zaphod wondering where his great suit was now resting it was in fact not resting at all it was in orbit around a rather weak star and was trying to out do the stars solar flares arthurs suit had become an airport for a colony of flying frogs the improbability drive also caused arthurs watch to go backwards the rain forests of eeetneet to instantly dry out and for three people to be taken from the living room where they were perfectly happy to a locked room on a supposedly impregnable planet whats the big deal about this planet asked arthur i can tell you chirped eddie the shipboard computer but i really ought to tell you something quite important about the ship first put a cork in it eddie said zaphod we dont need to hear any more sales talk from you i think well get enough of that on the planet you see arthur began ford the sirius cybernetics corporation had a lot of trouble with people breaking into their computer systems trying to find out what new releases were on the way to steal the ideas asked arthur nah the ideas were so ridiculous it was just amusing to read them interjected zaphod so the scc changed all their documentation into paper records and moved their headquarters to this magrathean planet where the atmosphere was poisonous and acidic so no ship could get through unless it was travelling really fast so the acid couldnt get a grip on the ship however any ship travelling that fast would be smashed into oblivion because it couldnt pull up in time who would go to that trouble just to read some amusing sales brochures asked arthur no one as the scc found out to their loss said ford chuckling as there was no point hacking any more sales of scc computer terminals dropped universewide so the scc gave in and put the details back on computer but kept the planet as they had paid a fortune for it and couldnt write it off on the books but how can anything survive on the surface with all that acid asked arthur knowing full well he was expected to go out onto the surface shortly the bad atmosphere stops metres above the surface so its good clean air down here said ford the improbability drive dropped us right on the surface we just have to hope it doesnt rain is it safe asked arthur no way i hear that employees who dont come up to scratch get scratched from existence said ford with a gleam in his eyes perhaps we should go back said zaphod seeing a good idea fall apart no all weve got to do is pass the initiative test and were in said ford initiative test said arthur and zaphod in unison the sirius cybernetics corporation faced many problems when they moved to sirius such as getting employees getting them to sirius and keeping them there the third was not a major problem as they couldnt get off anyway but the first two caused many headaches the planet had been picked for its remoteness which didnt please the commuting employees especially when they found out what happened to their ships on entering the atmosphere so accommodation was provided on the planet with all possible amenities also made available the most popular of these were the sirius sex cybernauts the employees could chose the colour shape life form etc of the cybernauts to the extent of creating an exact replica of their partner or more generally someone elses partner after an initial programming bug which resulted in the cybernauts calling out the wrong name at the height of excitement was sorted out the cybernauts became very successful on sirius however the marketing division could see no potential in releasing the sex cybernauts for sale to the public one was given away in a spirit of the age competition but as there was no maintenance agreement it was never heard of again as soon as hackers found out about the cybernauts they realised the only way to get their hands on one would be to join the sirius cybernetics corporation to handle the large influx of job applicants the scc devised an initiative test to weed out those who were unsuitable the test took the form of a large number of logic test rooms where applicants had to solve a problem before passing on to the next room as scc logic is somewhat left field of everyone elses logic most people die horribly in their attempt to conquer all the rooms those who do get through could wander around until they found an empty desk and then have a go at anything that took their fancy which was generally a sex cybernaut how do the applicants get down here then said arthur gazing at the big doorway ahead of him marked applicants robot ships fly them through the atmosphere said ford they follow a precise route which avoids the acid clouds we ought to get hold of that route before we leave thats bound to be worth a fortune now you re talking my language said zaphod excitement adventure and really wild things are okay but clear tax free profit wins hands and feet down every time welcome to sirius the jolly voice came from behind them they turned around to see a gleaming android if it wasnt for the amiable aura of the robot it could have been marvin slouching there im so glad you have decided to try to be scc employees we dont want to be fords swift kick to arthurs shin was sufficient to temporarily disable arthurs vocal chords were glad we have the opportunity beamed ford any tips you can give us gladly rebeamed the robot emitting happy signals mind you all applicants are told this there is a store room just inside the entrance you may take any three objects you find in there your objective is to reach the offices of the sirius cybernetics corporation the robot let out a little fanfare a company offering useful employment job satifaction and an incredible perk should you require any help on your journey just shout help and a recorded message will play according to your position good luck the robot started to go one thing before you go said zaphod as the robot turned ford swung his satchel with all his might struck the robot on the head and watched as the robot toppled over zaphod leapt on the robot and flipped open its back panel he fumbled with the deactivate button until it came off in his hand great work said ford slapping zaphod heartily across one of his heads no panic said zaphod i should be able to reactivate him admittedly deactivation will be impossible but hey you have to compromise in a big universe like this okay arthur said ford nows you big chance to do something useful pop these memory boards of marvin into this robot yeh lets transplant marvin into this jovial junk pile added zaphod unnecessarily ill do my best said arthur well in that case grinned ford id better do it arthur snatched the boards from ford and sat on the robot he ripped out a couple of boards and slotted marvins boards in its all yours zaphod said arthur proudly lets see if you can switch it on again the pressure was back on zaphod after five minutes of forcing the broken switch back in its hole with a liberal dose of cursing and scraped knuckles a low buzzing came from the robot oooooohhhhhh no not again is it really you marvin old mate said zaphod of course its me moaned marvin and yes i may be old but i am not in any sense of the word especially in that which refers to the reproductive coupling derivitive which i might add would be a physical impossibility your mate hey it is you said zaphod hows the new body mmmm marvin paused a couple of new interfaces and a database connection to the mainframe lets try that he paused again this model came after me which is hardly sirius shattering seeing as i am the prototype it went into mass production they changed the personality to an amiable pleasant one the memory was reduced to prevent boredom not down to your simple level though no robot could function at that level you would be lucky to get a digital watch to function at that level just as well you brought my memory with me the logic boards have a sub etha link to the mainframe wretched isnt it why is it connected to the mainframe asked arthur it it you saddle me with this monstrosity of a body and im forced to be at minus one with it so dont you go calling me it groaned marvin i still got my sulking circuits sorry said arthur looking skywards why are you connected to the mainframe ill just interrogate it marvin paused i could translate every letter the complaints department received in the last millennium into rezxlibunslan in these response times he waited every sirius cybernetics corporation device in the universe has its logic boards connected to the mainframe for reprogramming i see said arthur for reprogramming the device into a killing machine which will form an army strong enough to let the sirius cybernetics corporation take over the universe said marvin blandly its due to take place tomorrow jumping zeon swimming kittens said zaphod that could ruin the wedding or even worse the reception thats all in the mainframe asked ford would i make it up replied marvin but how come no hackers have found out asked zaphod more people have been in that than in eccentrica gallumbits i was asked to design the security system while i was on trial here said marvin i devised twenty security levels each progressively more difficult than the last i say difficult but im talking about your sort of difficult you know how do i get the lid off this bottle of tablets each time something important needs to be stored in the mainframe a new level is added at the top end people spend a fortune trying to crack the top level which increases profit for the scc only a few can crack the top level but all they get is dummy information all the top secret information is under level one noone looks at that because they assume there is nothing of interest in there like the imbecilic fools they are ingenious sighed ford not really said marvin not if youve got a brain the size of can it marvin interrupted zaphod this is serious it looks like ive got the save the universe again chapter the management of the sirius cybernetics corporation were tired of having a monopoly of robotics and computers in the universe this had been achieved many many years ago despite the best efforts of the marketing division so when you reach the top where do you go many have suggested that when you reach the top there is only one way to go and that is down the sirius cybernetics corporation couldnt if they tried they had such a stranglehold on the market expendable sales alone ensured a frightening profit margin thanks to a clever remuneration strategy by the management salaries were kept low on the basis of a possible market attack by a fruit seller and as the majority of staff werent allowed to leave sirius any money paid out was soon returned through the shops and bars on the planet the salesmen were the only people allowed loose on the universe and they spent money like salesmen usually do but as all the best salesmen ended up as management back on sirius and had to account for and repay all their expenses as a condition of their new job package the status quo was maintained so the managements problem of great wealth and boredom meant there was only one route to take one challenge to meet one final bridge to cross universal domination the organisation and methods division came up with the idea of fitting interfaces into all devices in the guise of a remote diagnostics unit the director of o m almost rejected the idea on the basis that there were no job loses involved and his old o m colleagues would never buy him a drink again if they found out he was involved in a scheme that created jobs once he was reminded that his old colleagues never bought him a drink anyway because a time and motion study proved that there was no productivity gain he backed down and took the idea to the board this was passed unanimously at the board meeting the management getting excited about the prospect of doing something different to working out how many alterian dollars they were making per second chapter the treacherous trio and the soulful solo passed through the entrance of the initiative test a large panel slid over the entrance shutting them in large stark letters on the panel confirmed this with a smug theres no backing out now arthur felt a so this is it were going to die scramble up his throat but he fought it back to use when times really got bad he followed zaphod and ford into the storeroom okay guys ordered zaphod grab as much stuff as you can carry but the android said we could only take three things protested arthur his subconscious training to be an englishman a gentleman and most importantly of all a good sportsman backing him to the hilt nuts to the android said zaphod his subconscious cowardice backing him from a safe distance no excuses for the pun if it feels embarrassed it can excuse itself right lets see said ford damn ive left my satchel outside so asked zaphod rummaging through piles of weapons my towels in there exclaimed ford heartbroken something hit him on the back of the head there dont sulk said zaphod as ford picked the towel off the floor it wont be the same sulked ford it all seems junk to me said arthur what do you think marvin more than you could possibly imagine sighed marvin cheer up marvin said ford brighter after finding the towel impregnated with mopped up old janx spirit you must have lost the pain in all the diodes down your i brought it with me interrupted marvin haughtily life wouldnt be the same without it for gods sake dont start him off on life said arthur come on guys said zaphod testily the times they are achanging lets get a move on remember ive got a rather important appointment with megabillion viewers all of them waiting to see the numero uno get hitched i mean the advertising revenue alone will buy me a holiday planet somewhere and the commercial spin offs ive got trillian dolls which say i do when you dig them in the ribs zaphod dolls which say the same only you have to twist their arms presentation hitchhikers guide to the galaxy wedding covers which bear the inscription dont panic theres always divorce if i dont deliver the goods they dont either if you get my meaning i m glad to see the values of marriage havent been lost on you zaphod said arthur trying to decide between a mirror and a box of matches now this is the sort of thing ive been looking for said zaphod leaving his other head to ponder the expected turnover of his wedding this neutronbreaking desolation ray gun will do for a start i dont know why youre all bothering with this observed marvin zark off marvin said ford grabbing a bag of gold coins do something useful im going for a walk said marvin very useful thanks a bundle shouted arthur okay said zaphod ive got the ray gun the heat seeking davy knife the laser spear and that murder grenade over there if you could pass it to me ford sounds like youre about to embark on what the americans on earth used to call a peace keeping exercise said arthur ford threw the grenade to zaphod who held his hand out to catch it and was blown across the room on contact you can only carry three items came a synthesised voice okay okay said zaphod stunned i got your message ill leave the grenade behind im taking a towel a bag of gold coins and a blast gun said ford looking for the voice thats all honest i think ill take a blast gun as well plus a mirror said arthur and ive found a copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy here its helped me in all my travels so far very touching said zaphod ill sue the bastards for unlawful use of the guide without the editors permission are we going to save the universe or draw up a law suit against the sirius cybernetics corporation asked ford right troops said zaphod lets keep a tight formation arthur cover our backs ford watch for snipers okay wagons roll excuse me zaphod said ford as zaphod stuck his chest out in preparation for a nonexistent swell from an orchestra dont you think we should have a plan aw belgium man cried zaphod you ruined a great moment it was hardly mgm pointed out arthur none too happy about covering the back as the last man always got jumped by the indians okay okay guys said zaphod putting his heads together lets do some brainstorming wed be lucky if you could muster a light drizzle zaphod ford felt quite proud of that one shush said zaphod closing his eyes in a poor attempt to look like he was concentrating ideas guys ideas arthur well if we have to disable the computer he started unsure as to whether he would be able to finish when we reach the computer couldnt we just pull the plug come on arthur sighed ford were not dealing with a amp three pin here well you asked said arthur we all make mistakes said zaphod ford we could plug marvin into it offered ford get him to do his version of reasons to be miserable that would destroy anything possible back up but not spectacular enough mused zaphod how does this sound we enter the ventilation system and crawl through the pipes until we reach the computer suite then we swoop we swing down on ropes screaming in from the sun well fluorescent lighting then pow boom bang swoosh kerrang bash smash crunch a couple more pows and one final boom guns ablazing we destroy the databanks scorch the cpu and terminate the terminals now thats what i call debugging strategists will reenact it for eons to come zaphod computer killer kits will be available from all good stockists kids will walk around wearing tee shirts emblazoned with now thats what i call debugging and zaphod say debug dont do it ill make a fortune where do we get the ropes asked arthur i dont see any here and if we did have them where do we tie them to when we swoop furthered ford do we say excuse me computer suite guards could you just look the other way for five minutes while we tie our ropes up so we can do a surprise swooping attack very plausible boom pow no mercy death to the diodes murder those microchips zaphod paused stopped swiping his fist into the palm of one of his other hands looked at ford and arthur then dropped his heads he lowered his voice to its most disappointed level okay well use marvin where is he chapter marvin was wandering not a happy joyful stroll more a sort of morose meander nevertheless he had a purpose on the basis of the information he had gained from his limited conversation with zaphod ford and arthur he decided to do an improbability sum he knew where they had been due to a particle analysis test he ran on meeting them again to pass the time he knew where he was because he was that sort of robot he linked his mind modem into eddie on the heart of gold to assess the ships speed weight improbability velocity relative journey time in nanoseconds molecular reabsorbtion during flight and the general mood the ship was in during the trip to sirius to this he added his knowledge of improbability physics the space vector correlation wind factors quasisocial and semistructural effects data from previous flights and the general mood he was in to this he subtracted divided the remainder by the square root of l and related his answer to the floor layout of the initiative test he knew that the total opposite of calculated position was where he wanted to go the room to which marvin was heading was locked from the outside much to the annoyance of its occupants they had tried everything they could think of with the candle box of matches and blank piece of paper they had been left lighting the candle with the matches only lit the candle and trying to push the key out with the matches to catch on the piece of paper pushed under the door had no effect the key was a dud anyway trying to burn the door down showed desperation and was doomed from the start but supplied some excuse to vent anger the same applied to trying to kick down the door there must be a logical solution said fenchurch why asked bolo theres no logical explanation as to why we ended up here is there well its all very improbable sighed trillian so i imagine the men had something to do with it as they were using the heart of gold tonight why dont we try burning the matches and writing a note on the paper with the burnt sticks slip it under the door and perhaps someone will see it said fenchurch its worth a try said trillian no its not said marvin as the door slid open to a jovial happy service marvin cried trillian she flung her arms around him are we glad to see you no youre not sulked marvin we are said fenchurch we thought wed be stuck here for days how did you open the door asked trillian simple said marvin i said macaroni is that logical asked fenchurch look started marvin making it perfectly clear he didnt want to if you had held the paper over the candle lit by the matches then the word macaroni would have appeared i take it this is the marvin you told me about said bolo well it sounds like him said trillian marvin i thought you were er yes so did i moaned marvin come on weve got work to do chapter zaphod ford and arthur were in a long hallway with a door at the end and one either side of them their search for marvin had been fruitless where on betelgeuse is that robot asked ford perhaps hes behind one of these doors said arthur in his best ill offer a solution but someone else can follow it up type voice only one way to find out said zaphod as he raised his neutronbreaking desolation ray gun a roar reminiscent of a disaster area power chord overwhelmed fords cries of disagreement the door at the end of the corridor wasnt any longer however making quite an impressive replacement for it was a ravenous bugblatter beast of traal zaphod and arthur felt considerably more threatened by that than they did by the door zaphod disappeared through the door to fords right arthur through the door on fords left dont run yelled ford to two slammed doors he quickly threw his towel over his head having read many years ago in the guide that the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal is so stupid it assumes that if you cant see it it cant see you the beast brushed past ford disappointed at losing its prey so quickly ford thanked his lucky stars and galaxies that for once the guide wasnt hypocriful or wildly misleading arthur found himself in a long thin corridor above him were four huge green girders and above these was an ominous void arthur held his gun firmly in his hand or as firmly as his sweaty palms would allow he looked up between two of the girders and to his horror saw rows of coloured creatures forming above him in panic he took a pot shot at them and to his surprise he hit one the creature disappeared but there was another right on top of the recently created space arthurs pot shot obviously angered the creatures because they all started scuttling to the right in unison and firing back arthur dived under a girder drawing a deep breath he leapt between two girders and fired furiously at the creatures watching for the counter fire the creatures kept changing their direction and dropping closer to the girders arthur was so overjoyed at clearing a column he didnt notice the lightening bolt until it was too late he was sent flying as soon as he scrambled to his feet the creatures started firing again arthur noticed the bolts were eating into his protective girders and the creatures were getting lower he decided to give up on the passing space ships he had hit one by mistake and all that happened was that the number appeared in the void arthur didnt have the time to ponder the significance of this he just kept on firing zaphod meanwhile found himself in a zoo at least thats what he thought it was he was standing by a glass cage looking at four curious animals they looked like mutated octopi with short stubby tentacles that they used to move around on zaphod looked around no other animals he thought shoddy zoo really the rest of the area looked like a maze but an easy one because he could see no dead ends there was a weird underfloor lighting system that had lights about every two feet definitely a zonko designer and this awful music zaphod obviously touched someones nerve for the cage door sprang open and the animals streamed out after him his legs reacted faster than his brain having predicted the usual message zaphod was right about the zonko designer the underfloor lighting seemed to short each time one of zaphods feet pounded nearby he could only see two exits and headed for the nearest one only to find that the entrance to one was the exit to the other this was geometrically impossible as they were opposite to each other but zaphod didnt have time to let this concern him the animals were closing in on him like market researchers in the high street zaphod turned left at a tjunction by a wall only to find himself in a corner with two animals coming at him from each direction by the time he got his heatseeking davy knife out he was leapt upon by the animals which proceeded to kick the proverbial out of him with their stubby tentacles until he passed out when he came around he was outside the cage he stood up and rattled the animals cage which was enough for them to escape again zaphods legs went into automatic arthur was doing reasonably well he had been hit again but gamely got up and had reduced the creatures down in numbers to two these two had doubled their speed and were now skimming across the tops of the girders arthur stood under what was left of one girder and waited as they passed he leapt out blasted one and leapt back before the other one could fire back arthur now stood in the open one on one seemed a lot fairer he raised his gun slowly and pointed upwards the creature zoomed above as arthurs first shot disappeared into the void the second shot didnt miss the door at the end of the corridor swung open and light flooded in arthur blew away the imaginary smoke from the top of the gun and walked into the light zaphod was doing a bit better he had found some brighter lights that turned the animals blue with fear when he ran over them he could squash the animals when they were blue and took great pleasure in doing so this in turn made him a bit cocky he stood still and teased the animals running over a bright light just when they thought they had him pretty soon he had darkened the majority of the area and had even squashed some fruit some idiot had left in his path he had one light to go and stood by it proudly as the animals homed in on him once more sorry suckers he gloated as he stomped on the light the animals disappeared as did the cage and the inner walls all that was left was an open door ford walked through the doorway that once contained a very ambitious door this door had designs on becoming an mds door and had even made a few tentative enquiries about oak panelling however a triggerhappy zaphod had put paid to these aspirations and subjected the door to a lifetime career as sawdust some of which stuck to fords feet as he scattered the nest of the ravenous bugblatter beast of traal with a couple of hearty kicks although there was little logic to this as the stupid creature wouldnt be able to find its way back acting like a vandal paid off because a trap door was revealed ford opened the trap door and looked at the drop of about three metres it was fairly dark but as there were no other visible exits ford threw down his towel to cushion the fall and jumped down he felt his way around the wall until he found a light switch as he threw the switch a holographic recording of an old greyhaired acquaintance started in the middle of the room hello prospective employee i hope youre enjoying this initiative test said the recording as you can see you cannot return through the trap door because it is out of reach however you will be able to pass through the locked door behind you once you have said the password slartibartfast what are you doing here asked ford thats not the password said slartibartfast the image flickered we were asked to build this planet and as i designed this section and as i had experience at this sort of thing i was asked to do some recording how come you can answer me asked ford puzzled thats not the password the image flickered again interactive holography many many answers have been recorded and a computer selects an appropriate answer to any questions asked that must have taken ages said ford shaking his head thats not the password flicker weeks and weeks but the repeat fees are very good i suppose i ought to work out this password sighed ford let me pass thats not the password arthur was in a large cavernous hall it looked rather blocky and bland some of the blocks moved and fired at arthur he hid behind a column and looked around for anything useful a pair of spectacles was hanging on the pillar he picked them up and inspected them they looked ordinary enough apart for some etching on the side he looked closely and could just make out the inscription dfx he put them on and the blocky hall smoothed out beautifully the bland walls changed to realistically textured walls and the moving blocks became detailed marvin lookalikes arthur was so stunned by the detail that he almost took a hit hello we are so delighted to meet you what yelled arthur it is our pleasure to serve you you were trying to kill me well yes but it would have been our pleasure to serve you prior to death do you have to kill me serving me with pleasure sounds much better thats the rub we are programmed to serve with a happy disposition and cheery nature however the sirius cybernetics corporation miscalculated the demand and have had to stockpile us we have been asked to fill in here at the induction testing not really our forte service robots are not great killers we at least like things to be fair three against one is hardly sporting is it i may be able to help there said arthur rumplestiltskin said ford thats not the password magrathea rules okay thats not the password slartibartfast rules okay thats not the password oh why dont you get back to your fjords you senile old fool and open this door for me yelled ford thats the password and with that the hologram disappeared and the door opened zaphod was walking along a corridor poised and ready to run at the slightest sign of danger there were doors leading off both sides of the corridor but zaphod wasnt trying any he had his gun held high pointing towards the ceiling this looked very impressive and thats what zaphod wanted even though he didnt have anything to back it up with suddenly a door opened to his right his body reacted immediately and he passed out ford walked through the doorway and shook his head so you will get the other two and bring them back here no problem you just wait here and i will be back as soon as i can how do i get out of here down that slide over there you will be back soon wont you oh yes lied arthur as soon as i find the others arthur slipped into the slide careered down a dark winding tunnel and through a panel to land at the feed of ford and zaphod who passed out again chapter trillian bolo and fenchurch followed marvin into the storeroom should we take any of this stuff asked bolo its rubbish said marvin all of it youre supposed to stand in the centre of the room and say emases nepo a doorway appeared out of nowhere in the wall revealing a tunnel thats not logical is it exclaimed trillian you should try reading the sirius cybernetics corporate policy said marvin as grinding gears propelled him through the doorway so the men have gone the wrong way said fenchurch they can get through another way but that is so depressingly boring and stupid said marvin most people go that way i tried to warn them but they wouldnt listen nobody listens to me we listen to you said bolo she had studied mechanical stress and depression briefly as part of an engineering degree she kept very quiet about we will follow you as well and do what you want she looked at the others because we respect you and your opinions trillian had told me of your achievements and you deserve recognition marvin stopped walking he also stopped the calculation of retrospective analytical data on predictive inverted ancestry of an ant he had stepped on one million two hundred and thirty one thousand and two years ago he concentrated his considerable mental abilities on bolos words and however hard he tried he could find no trace of sarcasm or insincerity he ran it through one more time the girls waited who am i he said marvin said trillian confused thats all the recognition ive ever received and all i deserve said marvin and trundled off down the tunnel worth a shot said bolo nice effort said trillian i thought you had him for a second they chased after marvin this next room is one of the programming rooms said marvin i need to interface with the initiative test computer to find out where the others are dont get into too much trouble the room they entered wasnt like an aircraft hanger aircraft hangers had a cosy intimate feel compared with this room thousands of desks filled the room in perfect symmetry and behind every desk sat a programmer each busily keying into a terminal built into the desk the ergonomics of the room were appalling due to the fact that the recently formed department of ergonomic consideration had to be disbanded after a week because the cleaners wanted their broom closet back the perfect symmetry was broken by one programmer who stood up as he saw marvin go into the little robots room the programmer waved at the three girls and they made their way through the desks until they finally arrived at the desk of percival unha im percival unha he announced picking up a nameplate from his desk bearing the inscription unha p see do you know that robot the one that went in the interface room yes hes with us said trillian percivals voice sounded vaguely familiar to her whats his name asked percival his voice had all the tonal qualities of a bored foghorn thats the second time weve been asked that said bolo its marvin thats all the recognition he deserves moaned percival the girls looked at each other stunned i programmed that robot i built part of my personality into it is he a jolly robot not really said fenchurch not much of the time well to be perfectly honest never really not surprising said percival im not what you would call a bubbly person myself i was having a rough time when i was programming it i had one of the first sex cybernauts you see my android replica was playing up again its no joke i was terribly i dont know pissed off with the whole thing my heart wasnt in it that explains a lot said trillian your robot has taken depression to new depths i would really like to meet him said percival i never met him after initial programming he was whisked away to serve on a new ship the heart of gold ill get him for you said bolo running off to the interface room i never thought id get this opportunity said percival we dont get to see any finished products it was a shame i wasnt a bit more cheerful when i did marvin but i only recall being cheerful once and i didnt waste that on a stupid robot bolo brought marvin through the desks to percival marvin this is your creator percival unha said trillian proudly daddy stuttered marvin marvin said percival marvin moved forward and embraced percival tears welled up in everyones eyes marvin gripped percival tighter as percival sobbed on his shoulder it may have been a trick of the light but trillian was sure she saw a smile on marvins face just before he sent fifty thousand volts through percival thatll teach him to fuck around playing god said marvin as he trundled through the smouldering mess that was once percival chapter zaphod ford and arthur had now reached the final room of the initiative test they had just carefully circumnavigated a large pool of aggressive looking slime which was perfectly harmless apart from the smell if they had touched any part of the slime the smell would have stayed with them for life as most potential employees couldnt avoid the slime the marketing division came up with the slogan you may think our products stink but you should meet our employees as a possible replacement for share and enjoy the only reasons zaphod ford and arthur had reached this final room were luck bad taste and the fact that the initiative test wasnt designed for three people who spent more time arguing about what to do than doing anything at all most potential hazards got so bored waiting they went off to pester someone else the final room contained two exit doors a large screen and three weary hitchhikers so this is it said arthur were going to get out of here i told you id get you through said zaphod when asked ford earlier said zaphod didnt i well if i didnt i sure meant to you should have known you could rely on me rely on you exclaimed arthur thats a bit of a contradiction in terms its like saying flat pack easy assembly or military intelligence havent i given you guidance demanded zaphod guidance yelled ford climbing up the wall screaming slime slime dont let it touch me is not my idea of guidance hey get offa my case said zaphod wasnt it me who discovered the gravity walls around the slime i didnt like the look of that stuff said arthur it reminded me of stuff on earth that was put on hamburgers disguised as relish and i really relish the thought of getting outta here guys whined zaphod so can we please get a move on as zaphod spoke the large screen lit up an old balding head wearing glasses appeared he had the look of a traffic warden with piles totally humourless was a very generous description of the look on his face you have reached the final room of the initiative test began the face and your final test you must decide which of these two doors to pass through one being an exit door to the offices and the other is a true exit door off this mortal coil in a horrible fashion i can help you by answering one question about the doors but be warned i can only say one true sentence and the rest lies or one false sentence and the rest the truth terrific sighed ford the face remained motionless well asked zaphod lets have some help oh happy hologram i am an incredible liar stated the face which door is safe asked arthur the left door is perfectly safe said the face if he said he was a liar then that was the truth so the right door must be safe said arthur heading towards the door wait yelled ford im not sure if he lied about being a liar then the left door is perfectly safe lets make an effort to get our heads around this concept listen all i want to get my heads around is a stiff drink preferably served by a wench with obscene tendencies said zaphod let arthur go what shouted arthur i could die you could save the life of the editor of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy man retorted zaphod get your priorities right sheesh your grip of universal importance is as good as my grip on eccentrica gallumbits bits at this very moment in time we could both do with taking things in hand a bit more look petty infighting wont help us said ford trying to calm things down why not said arthur thats all this poor excuse for an intergalactic waste disposal unit in reverse seems to show any aptitude for listen pal if were talking about aptitude let me get a banana and see if you can manage to peel it without scratching your arse thinking about it snarled zaphod will you two just give it a rest pleaded ford lets just devote our energy to solving this problem now lets think chapter marvin trillian fenchurch and bolo had finally reached the main computer room an imposing oak door barred the way only executives are allowed to enter said marvin ill go into a interface room to get us in how asked bolo because hes got the brain the size of a planet said trillian beat you to it marvin i wasnt going to say it anyway said marvin i was going to say that the executives are as stupid as all other life forms a digital watch could get in without too much trouble he went into the interface room he seemed to cheer up a bit after he killed percival remarked fenchurch remember hes in a new body said trillian hes probably found a pleasure circuit and doesnt know what to do with it they all stared at the door nothing happened well that wasnt strictly true the high level of static acid given off by marvins attitude was eating its way into the door the acid gnawed and corroded the helpless door however as this was invisible to the naked or even half dressed eye and total corrosion would take million years it would be fair to say that as far as fenchurch bolo and trillian were concerned nothing happened trillian went over to the interface room opened the door and was shocked a female android was spreadeagled on a table with marvin perched precariously on top do you mind said marvin trillian muttered a very apologetic apology and shut the door she was tempted to open the door again just to prove to herself that reality hadnt gone awol after a minute marvin opened the door and shut it behind him havent you ever seen a robot interfacing before asked marvin trillian mouth was stuck in neutral but she managed to gesture a negative response id like to tell you about the bugs and the bytes and explain the difference between male and female interface plugs said marvin but its dead boring the doors open said fenchurch and life is dull said marvin why state the obvious what was not obvious to most life forms and could be considered one of the universes best kept secrets is the fact that robots and computers can enjoy a healthy sex life computers have often been connected together in the light of the improved performance this is not due to shared resources the truth of the matter being that they perform better because they are more relaxed and satisfied after a good bout of interfacing robots have often wondered why its never been taken up in life form work places in place of say a coffee break considering the poor quality of coffee available in such workplaces this has always been a mystery still the robots dont let on as it give them another reason to snigger as with most functions performed by computers and robots a complete set of jargon words have been devised to confuse the layman a basic translation list now follows interface sex terminals breasts twin floppy disks breasts joystick penis user defined function sexual act stand alone wanker cluster group sex replication conception firewall contraception handshaking foreplay baud rate level of boredom cursor device unwilling partner scsi easy lay usb mythological easy lay peek voyeurism poke sexually inquisitive gosub oral sex input down to business load really down to business full duplex frantic lovemaking syntax error premature ejaculation hyperbolic function male orgasm graphic display female orgasm the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy is proud to offer a confidential counselling service for all sexually frustrated or troubled devices interface with us and half your problems are solved arthur zaphod and fords problem wasnt solved look if the truth was that he wasnt a liar then he didnt lie about the left door being safe said ford uh was all zaphod could offer he was much more content trying to vandalise the screen no no argued arthur the right door is right right because the liar bit wasnt a lie was it just then what looked like trillian walked in hey babe whatcha doing here smoothed zaphod he had spent years working on his smoothing and had damn near perfected it im not your babe thank you very much my name is cis said cis i messed up in one of the rooms and ended up looking like this its all over shee said zaphod ill sue the bastards for copyright on my woman as well well cis it isnt over said ford if you go through the right door you will be changed back to what you were before great said cis he walked through the door and was disintegrated ford protested arthur look how do you know he wasnt a pile of dust before ford replied and walked through the left door chapter are you sure we are in the right place asked bolo looking around at the luscious forest surrounding them they were in an idyllic clearing by a small crystal clear pond this is the main computer room said marvin its a new concept in organic computers you mean this is a computer asked trillian its a lot better looking than eddie arthur would love it giggled fenchurch thinking of time spent in the wooded section of hyde park it is based on the fact that most life forms feel relaxed in these surroundings droned marvin they call it user friendly oh how i hate that term but how do we key in information asked trillian you dont snapped marvin and broke into song i talk to the trees but they dont listen to me a spectographic analysis of my voice is compared to countless voice patterns in memory on parity they listen to me the girls were stunned into silence well thats how the adverts were going to run said marvin almost ashamedly but they found they wouldnt be able to offer maintenance support something to do with there not being enough lumberjacks and gardeners qualified in computer engineering so they connected the only working model up here and the executives use it to talk to the computers give me the days when you could depress a key i think its romantic said fenchurch putting a daisy in her hair i wish we could have one on the heart of gold sighed trillian i wish i could throw up said marvin thank you marvin said trillian right weve got to stop this computer instructing the devices to overthrow the universe how do we do it marvin you want to do it you work out how to do it okay marvin if you want to be like that trillian turned her back on him i dont want to be like anything muttered marvin can you understand us shouted bolo look said fenchurch pointing to the pond the word yes appeared in the water are you connected up to every sirius cybernetics corporation device in the universe asked fenchurch the word yes reappeared and you can instruct them to take over the universe said bolo the word came back again if we gave you an irreversible instruction never to communicate with any device every again would you do it asked trillian the pond went blank as this was being considered i wouldn t have much choice i would eventually floated up okay you must never communicate with another sirius cybernetics corporation device again after you send not this instruction said trillian looking at the others instruct all devices never to carry out any instruction to overthrow the universe all devices instructed and all connections terminated floated up trillian didnt realise that she had just committed the computer to a lifetime of celibacy a bit of a giant blow to a computer with such an active sex life but she had just saved the universe dark clouds filled the sky and the distant rumblings of thunder echoed around the trees i think this would be a good time to leave said marvin this computer is only half as depressed as i am but its still contemplating suicide a bolt of lightening ripped a nearby tree in half the frantic charge towards the door suggested everyone agreed with marvin they slammed the door behind them that wasnt so difficult said trillian it was easy said marvin i knew the answer before i d even computed the question however most idiotic life forms would have resorted to mindless violence after failing to find any logical solution or even forget about the possibility of a second computer communicating with all the devices therefore i admit i am almost not loathed to say i could barely not be unimpressed by your approach oh marvin you say the sweetest things said trillian and kissed marvin on the cheek thats right try and rust me moaned marvin ford arthur and zaphod bounded up what are you doing here asked arthur furiously oh just saving the universe and that said trillian sweetly is that really you chick asked zaphod of course said trillian who else could it be a reconstructed pile of dust said ford grinning inanely weve disabled the main computer and prevented the scc from ever overthrowing the universe using their devices said fenchurch putting her daisy behind arthurs ear youd have liked it in there thats not the point flustered arthur we were going to save the universe yeh said zaphod a womens place is behind the cocktail cabinet in the living room we almost got killed in there exclaimed bolo well im all for equal opportunities said zaphod you have as much right to save the universe as we did even if we would have done it with more style look shouldnt we get a move on before they turn on the alarm and find us said bolo an alarm sounded in the background theyve turned on the alarm said fenchurch laser fire blasted a wall behind them theyve found us said arthur run they charged down endless corridors pursued by a bunch of jovial marvin lookalikes intent on killing them the robots were very pleasant about it all though apologising after each shot our heroes and heroines are of course perfectly safe both parties were subconsciously following the strict laws laid down regarding enemy pursuit these are many and varied but the main rules are pursuers must remain a safe distance from pursuees but must remain within reasonable shooting distance pursuers must be crack shots and may fire unlimited shots at walls doors and anything else around the pursuees but not directly at pursuees if a pursuee is shot by accident the pursuers are penalised by the time it takes for the shot pursuee to convince his partners to continue without him while he tries to hold off the pursuers as long as he can once the remaining pursuees have left their fallen partner he can be killed and the chase restarted in earnest the pursuees must not turn any corner until they have been shot at or at least indicated their direction the corridors must be endless generally formed in a loop to save on budget one member of the pursuees must suggest splitting up i suggest we split up yelled trillian if i get hit i will split up yelled zaphod this way yelled arthur to fenchurch grabbing her hand and pulling her through a doorway split up now yelled ford trillian and bolo dashed one way and ford and zaphod charged the other way all of them yelling another rule is that all participants must yell fenchurch pulled arthur through a doorway almost breaking his arm as he intended going the other way shhh she whispered three jovial robots trundled by we should be safe here for a while she eventually said hoping the robots didnt have super hearing i dont want to be safe for a while said arthur i want to be safe for good arent you enjoying it asked fenchurch my idea of enjoyment does not include being shot at by an jolly and helpful android i know what your idea of enjoyment is i find all this very exciting doesnt it turn you on she slipped her arms around his waist er not really he could hear the distant sounds of laser fire and apologies its all a bit distracting fenchurch did something wonderful to his ear arthur succumbed to the notion that if he was going to go this was the way to do it and fenchurch really knew how to do it what they didnt realise was that they were saving their lives as the robots had privacy circuits fitted which sensed arousal and caused the robots to seek another function far away zaphod and ford werent in any position to initiate any privacy circuits they were desperately dodging laser fire zaphod was throwing himself into somersaults crashing into walls and various other unnecessary actions that were good for effect he rounded a corner and saw a sight to warm his heart mouth and throat a neon sign saying bar hey was my navigation good or what he said as one of his heads almost got a parting from a laser he wouldnt be able to blow dry out quick said ford as if it was really necessary to instruct zaphod on how to enter a bar they crashed through the doors and into the bar they landed in a heap on the floor we usually end up like this when we leave a bar not when we enter said ford this is just like the good old days yeah adventure excitement and really wild things yeah being chased yeah the danger yeah risking life and limb yeah dont you kind of long for the good new days yeah they got up and went to the bar listen everyone shouted ford yeah listen reaffirmed zaphod a couple of robots will be coming through that door in a minute yeah two evil mothers the crowd listened intently well theyre not really evil theyre quite nice about it all they just want to kill us and do you know who i am demanded zaphod not now zaph old buddy ive almost got them on my side whispered ford he raised his voice again for the crowd they want to kill us and we dont want that no way said zaphod the gathering crowd seemed to agree so if you can stop them ford paused for effect my friend will buy you all a pan galactic gargle blaster yeah the pan galactic gargle blasters are onwhat ford the cheers from the crowd drowned zaphod protest the nice robots entered and were almost immediately destroyed by the thirsty drinkers they were all back at the bar before the first wisps of smoke from the robots reached the low ceiling zaphods back was slapped more times than an arcturan mega donkey in the betelgeuse grand national put it on the slate zaphod said to the frantic barmen making a mental note never to visit this bar again this was something zaphod had done all over the universe but not to the religious levels that arthur hadnt arthur and fenchurch having left the chase for a spot of uninhibited fun were now back in the thick of it a combination of luck instinct and improbability guided them outside they were just behind ford and zaphod whose straight line capability had been seriously undermined by the victory celebration in the bar bolo trillian and marvin were in the hatchway of the heart of gold come on yelled trillian seeing the robots closing in zaphod grabbed fords arm lets stand and fight these guys impress the chicks said zaphod i feel like mashing some metal zaphod flexed his sinews ford was so stunned he stopped running what are they doing asked bolo i wish i knew said trillian i know said marvin he looked at bolo and trillian then went back to looking at ford and zaphod well do you think you could tell us then said trillian trying to remain patient they are lifeforms trillian waited that isnt much help marvin said bolo look said marvin summing up every monotony circuit to help convey his message since of activities undertaken by lifeforms are stupid and or pointless the law of averages says that whatever they are doing is probably stupid and or pointless thanks marvin marvin was of course right not only were ford and zaphod unarmed they were also well on their way to being legless what the hell are you doing asked arthur as he approached the defiant duo standing our ground said ford but thats insane said arthur stopping fenchurch had no intention of stopping and every intention of breaking the metres record we can beat these metallic morons said zaphod if you stay here theyll become metallic murderers pleaded arthur arthur if you cant stand the heat go and join the women said ford if i had any sense i would sighed arthur and turned to face the oncoming robots this stunned the robots it wasnt in the rules and as there was no umpire handy to consult they were stumped they muttered amongst themselves then one stepped forward how do you do he started in a perfect english accent my name is jeremy and my colleagues have very kindly voted me spokesman howdy germy said zaphod er howdy to you too now we are a bit perplexed to say the least by your actions we have been programmed to kill you not our choice you see and we were having quite a jolly time chasing you and that spiffing fun wasnt it old chap chirped ford yes very exhilarating but it would be very unsporting of us to kill you in cold blood ill say shouted one robot from the back well they say the chase is better than the catch said arthur you are so right said jeremy well guys said zaphod holding his arms out youve been so nice about all this well give you a break well go to our ship take off and then you can come and chase us all this running is bad for the legs hear hear shouted the robots sounds like a grand idea to me said jeremy okay then thats settled said ford give us five minutes to get a head start then its tallyho away you go this started jeremy off leading the robots in three cheers for the lads and arthur thinking that they still hadnt quite got the programming right at the sirius cybernetics corporation look at those schmucks said zaphod as they turned to the heart of gold well improb out of here and they wont know where to start looking they got back to the ship with ford and arthur congratulating each other and zaphod congratulating himself the girls tried to compete by telling the guys how stupid they had been okay computer get us out of this wretched place said zaphod as he arrived at the bridge hi guys enthused eddiegreat to see you again im sorry i cant get you out of this but im sure we are going to have a great time instead what are you talking about computer asked ford use the improbability drive and get us out before some very sporting robots tear us limb from limb well theres the problem said eddie the improbability drive isnt working some clown pulled a wire on it anyone fancy a game of charades im not too good at acting them out but im a whizz at guessing them swutting mechanics growled zaphod did they pull the wire asked frod no i did admitted zaphod but thats not the point nice going zaphod sighed ford youve done some dumb things in your time and i thought i witnessed a classic just now outside but no this takes honours hey dont come down on me pleaded zaphod my hangovers are catching up with me if those robots catch up with you yelled arthur glad of the chance to let off some steam at zaphod youll have a hangover youll never forget or never remember according to where you end up i just hope i dont end up in the same place purgatory would be a great alternative is there no way off this planet without improbability drive asked bolo oh yes said ford dead easy way through the acid clouds only we dont know the coordinates i know the coordinates everyone turned to look at marvin he pretended to be interested in something else which as he had no interest in anything he didnt do very convincingly marvin old buddy old mate gushed zaphod looks like youve come through for us again i said i know the coordinates said marvin i didnt say i was going to tell you zaphod aimed a wild kick at marvin which only resulted in marvin not being dented and zaphod crawling about on the floor holding his foot and whimpering in pain and lack of sympathy look marvin said trillian softly please feed the coordinates into eddie im supposed to get married to zaphod later and you wouldnt want me to miss that would you marvin thought about this point for a long time before he gave his answer to everyone else he appeared to answer back immediately i dont really care about that but id rather not stay with those tiresome tin soldiers out there they bore me to tears where as you only bore me to distraction he made his way over to eddie hi marvin actually i am very low even robots like to be greeted in a friendly and cheerful manner well i dont so just shut up most robots seem to respond well to my pleasing tones and often remark about ouch i just jammed those coordinates right up his rectal information passage said marvin i like your style said ford okay eddie get us out of here okay fella said eddie but could you tell marvin to be a little more laid back about this the heart of gold leapt into a drunken dance through the clouds ford and bolo retired to their quarters to explore the hypothesis that sexual performance is affected detrimentally by stress and pressure there was also the theory of sex after death to evaluate if the situation arose it amounted to a lot of research to be crammed in which explained their eagerness to get on with it i dont know how they can muttered arthur perhaps if you ask them nicely theyll let you watch scowled zaphod arthur reverted his attention to the monitor he could see six small blobs gaining on the large blob that was the heart of gold cant we go into hyperspace or something asked fenchurch we could end up smack bang in the middle of a supernova said zaphod purposefully flicking a handful of switches the fact that he had only turned down the air conditioning wasnt important the main thing was that he was doing something the heart of gold screamed out of the acid clouds like archimedes out of the bath having sat on something come with me said zaphod pulling arthur along they went through the ship until they came to a ladder zaphod gestured arthur down as he started climbing up arthur found himself in a glass bowl on the side of the ship he looked up and saw zaphod in another bowl zaphod was seated and putting on a headset arthur followed suit and looked at the array of instruments in front of him it suddenly clicked these were the telecommunication rooms and he was going to act as a temporary telephonist to try and convince the robots they had the wrong number he tried a few practice good morning heart of gold which number please then took hold of one of the handles in front of him which he assumed was the spare telephone handset he turned the handle and the seat changed position he grabbed the other handle and found to his delight that he could move up down and side to side this is much better than the swivel chairs our telephonists had he yelled to zaphod zaphod was too busy looking out of his bowl here they come said trillian in arthurs headset six small robot fighters hurtled past the heart of gold guns a blazing arthur panicked and pressed the button on one of the handles a bolt of laser scorched into space he felt incredibly foolish he hid his embarrassment by trying to blast the robot ships our of the sky theyre coming in too fast he shouted to zaphod zaphod twisted around and shot ahead of a fighter the ship went straight into his line of fire and was blasted to pieces aha he yelled arthur tried to concentrate he watched one ship and tried to predict its flight he lined himself up and pressed the button to his complete surprise he hit the ship and knocked it out of existence i got one he yelled dont get cocky kid growled zaphod one fighter flew past zaphods bowl and blasted the shell of the heart of gold zaphod made him pay with a shot which knocked him into another fighter destroying them both top that he said to arthur the three remaining fighters were flying in formation out of range they dived down and did more damage to the heart of gold weve lost two stabilisers said trillian over the intercom dont worry replied zaphod shell hold together he looked at the ship you hear me ship hold together the three fighters were descending on another attack arthur took a deep breath and closed his eyes he shot and clipped the first ship which spun out of control into the other two there was an enormous explosion and debris showered the heart of gold unfortunately one large piece of debris smashed into the tail and with two stabilisers gone the ship spun hopelessly out of control round and round the heart of gold was mercilessly pulled towards the desert planet of stavromula beta where arthur was to receive the shock of his life because a lot of religious people he didnt know were waiting to meet him chapter according to the encyclopaedia galactica religion is an evolutionary stage most races go through as a stepping stone to peace of mind or enlightenment the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy describes religion as great fun if you pick the right one and goes on to recommend several religions based on fulfilment cheapness and extent of brainwashing the guide then goes on with the following description of the history of religion with a footnote to the effect that although the views expressed may not be those of the editor hell agree to put anything in which is supported by a large drink most religions follow the same basic path it starts as an excuse for something which defies explanation such as a nearby star fire or water as these things are understood the energy channelled into worshipping has to be redirected and as sophistication evolves so does religion to the extent of telling you what to do what not to do when to do it and at what time of year as this usually involves something fun being forbidden some people lose interest at this stage those who continue soon begin to lose sight of the original concept and diversification sets in to turn religion into what it is wanted to be rather than what was originally intended this leads to disillusionment and religion is generally given up put down as one of those phases we went through like teenage acne some people still follow religions one of the most famous people being looleel jegula he was a devout follower of the order of sanctonimity a particularly dull religious group who believed that three days a year should be devoted to lying in mud swamps to show how grateful they were to be alive this resulted in much ridiculing by nonbelievers until looleel announced that he was going to travel back in time to meet his maker thank him and return with proof of his existence he made a tearful farewell to his order stepped into his time bubble which promptly disappeared into time he returned moments later to declare that although he hadnt actually met his maker he had come across a no entry sign at the year zero which he claimed was proof that some holy person had been around to erect it the sign had in fact been put there by nonbelievers as a practical joke and when looleel was told a big row broke out about time travel and messing around with history looleel became very unreligious for one moment and thumped one of the nonbelievers which started an almighty war after politics and the babel fish religion is the third greatest cause of war ever known to the galaxy as for religious diversification a perfect example can be found on the desert planet of stavromula beta the stavromulans have a strange history which needs to be explored to understand their complex religious rituals the stavromulans are dwarflike nomads though this was not always the case they are also halfstupid which can be seen by the fact that although in certain areas they evolved very quickly in most areas they remain positively backwards for example newspapers started at the same time as writing and could have evolved into something very sophisticated but remained at the level of gutter press because of the inferior intelligence of the readers the most famous men in stavromulan history were journalists each week these twelve journalists would meet up to discuss the weeks stories and have a slap up meal for stavromulans they were very intelligent for they had vivid imaginations and created stories out of nothing normal stavromulans had no imagination and for example would name their offspring with one name then number any subsequent children the children being even more stupid would always get their names wrong because they would be introduced for example as our second bup the children would then call themselves our second bup instead of bup number two the journalists would generally create a few new stories over dinner and then whoever paid the bill would get the exclusive this was fine until one night when no news was bad news no stories came forth and there was noone to foot the bill then one bright journalist suggested creating a person to pay the bill this went down very well and all that was needed was a name silence fell over the table until one of those freak wormholes in space and time opened up and the name arthur dent fell out now as all stavromulan journalists were expert ventriloquists each journalist assumed someone else said it our benefactor shall be called our third ent declared one journalist and so this mystery character was created the journalists started leaving the restaurant telling the waiter that our third ent was paying and he was currently throwing up in the toilet the ruse worked and was continued for many weeks until after one meal a journalist called our first udaz was hard up for a story and decided to do an article on a mystery man called our third ent who was conning free meals out of restaurant owners the other journalists were furious and all started writing their own exclusive interviews with our third ent each defending his actions and trying to outdo each other this went on for weeks with things weve made up about our third ent articles and our third ent bingo all this exposure made our third ent a national hero when one journalist decided to end the saga by reporting that our third ent had gone away but would return one day all other papers gladly followed the story with confirmations as they were all tired of it as well however this wasnt the end the public were so caught up in the stories they believed that when our third ent returned he would save the world quite what was up with the world that it needed saving wasnt known but the newspaper articles had changed stavromulan history the economy disappeared overnight as everyone decided to follow our third ents example and not pay for anything the people became nomadic leaving before any bills arrived building mighty roads out of bricks made from the yellow sands of the deserts throwing up became a regular ritual so the foundations of stavromulan religion were laid but as everyone read different newspapers they all had different ideas of our third ents life on stavromula and what it would be like when he returned and so were the various religious sects formed some believed our third ent would bring sexual freedom on his return and this sect made love on three our third ent newspaper articles twice a month as a sign of faith others believed he would settle up all his bills then find a nice young girl to marry this sect would spend one day in every eighteen thrashing nice young single girls with a newspaper in preparation twelve sects were formed from the twelve newspapers and although they showed the faith in various ways all believed in what was widely known as the second sitting of our third ent chapter whats happening asked ford emerging from a room with bolo and looking as dishevelled as everyone else much to his surprise we got hit during a space battle explained zaphod flicking on the scanner screen we spun out of control and crash landed on this planet and as you can see hundreds of its rather short looking inhabitants are flooding over the desert towards us what are we going to do asked fenchurch the monkey man is going out to talk to them said zaphod casually what yelled arthur i knew we should have got him a replacement brain said zaphod do you want to know where the tea is before you go zaphod you cant send arthur out there exclaimed trillian they could tear him to pieces zaphod declined to comment but grinned his teeth acted as a red rag to arthur he charged across the bridge intending to send zaphod flying but zaphod neatly side stepped and arthur flew past through a happy door that opened on seeing a body flying towards it and wished arthur a fruitful journey arthur rolled down some stairs and ended up by the main airlock which gladly hissed open arthur was confronted by hundreds of cheering dwarves hooray our seventh obu is dead long live our saviour they cheered arthur looked down and saw to his dismay two stumpy legs sticking out from under the heart of gold he rightly assumed they belonged to our seventh obu he didnt assume that she was the most infamous critic of our third entism and was widely hated for her outspoken comments if he had assumed this he would have again been right he didnt so he apologised dont apologise shouted latigid the chief stavromulan you have rid us of a blight to our land what is the name of our hero arthur dent said arthur and was astounded when the entire crowd fell to their knees causing a minor sandstorm he was joined by the rest of the party who too were astounded what did you say to them arthur asked ford i just told them my name the holy one shall wear the slippers of our seventh obu as protection and shall be carried on high to the holy theatre said latigid many dwarves rushed forward and put the red slippers from our seventh obus feet on arthurs feet they didnt fit but as he was picked up it didnt really matter what about my friends asked arthur they too shall be carried on high on high wasnt particularly high arthurs feet dragged along the ground but it was better than walking the road looked rough on the feet some one had obviously run ahead to spread the news as crowds began to line the brick road arthur could see a town ahead the crowds grew larger and arthur began to enjoy himself he waved at the crowds and they waved back oooh thats our third ent cried one woman beside herself with excitement which was quite a trick for a woman of her size hes much bigger than i thought he would be shouted another person one group wasnt cheering their sect believed in the second sitting but also believed that our third ent shouldnt have gone away in the first place they were very devout and probably one of the most boring offshoots of our third entism they didnt pursue the sexual rituals that most other sects did and didnt have any religious holidays they were the only sect that believed that our third ent should be punished on his return and the gun that was to exercise that punishment was aimed at arthurs head arthur oblivious to this and many other startling facts about this planet was having a great time people rushed from the crowd just to be touched by him something that had never happened on earth he wasnt particularly overjoyed by having his feet dragged along the ground and he could feel one of his slippers slipping off no matter how much he wriggled his toes it wouldnt stay on eventually he bent over and forced it back onto his foot at that moment a bullet whistled through the space that had previously contained his head continued its path and lodged itself firmly in the heart of someone standing in the crowd noone heard the shot because of all the cheering and those around him assumed the man had suffered a heart attack they were wrong because fate had deemed this to the man in a former life and for variety had opted for the bullet this time arthur saw none of this and could therefore feel no sorrow for agrajag arthur shouted ford this is all very nice but i imagine that the sirius cybernetics corporation will come looking for us soon but ford sighed zaphod lapping up the adulation even though it wasnt for him the heart of gold is one invalid improbability drive ship ah i know said ford a grin creeping onto his face but i found a back up improbability drive generator in our quarters all we need to do is fix the stabilisers and were history here i think arthur is already history on this planet said fenchurch proud of her man ford said zaphod still waving at the crowd we need an atomic vector plotter to connect the back up to the ship and i used the last one two weeks ago to unblock the toilet i knew there was something we forgot at the megamarket last week moaned trillian perhaps these people have one said bolo hopefully any race that looks up to a puny primate is hardly likely to have evolved up to atomic vector plotter level muttered zaphod unfortunately his bearers heard this they dropped him which didnt hurt then jumped on him which did blasphemer they yelled in no time at all zaphod was trussed up by the crowd and suspended from a pole held by his bearers hey guys he moaned cant you take a joke youve got as much humour as a vogon stag night the power of this statement was lost on the stavromulans as they had never even met a vogon let alone be subjected to the ugliness of a vogon bride serves you right said trillian you chose the wrong place to insult arthur arthur get them to put me down yelled zaphod letting his cool slip to lukewarm we will do with him as you wish said latigid leave him as he is until i decide said arthur gloating zaphod broke into a sob and marvin broke into the death march to cheer zaphod up the procession entered a long tunnel which arthur failed to gauge accurately and subsequently remembered this by having to endure a bump on the head and the accompanying pain the tunnel emerged into a large open air amphitheatre packed with stavromulans marvins bearers literally collapsed with joy as they reached the stage dont apologise said marvin knowing full well they had no intention of doing so i expect to be thrown about its all part of life he was barely heard over the roars of the crowd as arthur was introduced look argued zaphod the crowd have got what they want why dont you let me go latigid was unimpressed your arguments have become stale and boring stale me zaphod protested im so fresh my sell by date is light years away by nunk arthur ill get you for this arthur wasnt listening he was devouring all the adulation being thrust upon him he walked to the front of the stage and held his arms out this inspired more hysterical cheers from the crowd he cleared his throat to speak and a sudden hush fell over the crowd people he started he felt it was a strong opening seeing as he had no insight into their culture they hung on his every word i am arthur dent screams went up from the crowd but this time as a result of the robots from sirius appearing around the top of the amphitheatre the place emptied like a train full of lemmings at the white cliffs of dover weve caught up with you again said jeremy it wasnt even a good chase this time you killed off our scouts which was a bit unsporting and you waited here for us i think youve lost interest so if you cant be bothered well just kill you what is that robot doing with you i am not just that robot thank you very much snorted marvin you obviously have no conception of who i am he paused to beg the question then started again so soon as jeremy began to speak i am your prototype marvin the robots were stunned and amazed we were told you had been kidnapped whats the point of kidnapping me nobody wants me i just ended up going along for the ride enough of that why havent you given me the android salute i am your superior the robots looked at each other confused you stick you left arm in the right ear of the robot next to you didnt they programme you anything the robots obliged exploded and lit up the stavromulan sky with a firework display to rival the space battle seen but an hour before almost as stupid as you lot muttered marvin chapter the stavromulans helped to repair the heart of gold and agreed to let arthur go to zaphods wedding to give trillian away on the provision that he didnt stay away as long as he did before the emergency back up improbability drive generator was hooked up using the old atomic vector plotter held together with arthurs dressing gown cord even though he had offered to get them home by clicking his heals together twice ford got on the sub etha radio and relayed the coordinates of the entry route to sirius to etats and dilos on eccentrica gallumbits planet even though they were legless they still managed to relay the message universewide within hours sirius was overrun by consumers the marketing division were put up against a wall and shot strategic planning experts were brought in and the sirius cybernetics corporation became a cooperative of the people the revolution had arrived two weeks before a rival company put in a bid making a fortune for the cooperative wealth in the universe was great for merchandising causing a slight delay in plans the scene was set for a perfect wedding chapter arthur charged around in a panic fenchurch charged after him in a beautiful dress her intention was to get him into morning dress she had found a doityourself mode on the tailormatic and although the machine protested she produced an acceptable morning suit arthur was worried about what he had to do to give trillian away fenchurch was worried about arthur going out without any clothes on wheres ford he cried he must know arthur will you put your clothes on ordered fenchurch what oh alright but im not going out unless i know what ive got to do sulked arthur youll really enjoy yourself said fenchurch pulling his trousers up ill be there to give you support she didnt realise that arthur would be wearing a support trillian came in the room looking incredible if arthur wasnt so in love with fenchurch he would have asked trillian to give up zaphod and run away with him you look lovely trillian he said instead what a beautiful dress said fenchurch it was indeed beautiful every cut stitch and hem was beautiful the whole dress radiated beauty and tanned arthur the tailormatic ran it up said trillian it is rather nice trillian what have i got to do asked arthur im worried stiff in case i mess up your big day dont worry said trillian just wear this she held out a grey cummerbund arthur took it and put it on that doesnt really put my mind at rest said arthur its a gravity support harness explained trillian all you have to do is take your place next to fenchurch after you land land said fenchurch we fly down to the altar said trillian i didnt know you could fly said arthur i dont need to said trillian ive got a gravity support harness as well a team of marriage technicians handles all the moves for us all weve got to do is relax and enjoy it arthur couldnt relax and was sure he wasnt going to enjoy himself he was standing by the control room with trillian they technicians were sitting in front of an overwhelming bank of controls and monitor screens check on one cue three for laser entry sequence magnetic field generator operational all vocal octogrids locked into octophonic harmonic positions audience cameras homed in and ready to roll red leader to base ive been hit bride and monkey in position arthur came away are you ready asked trillian holding arthurs hand ready for what said arthur i cant tell whether theyre planning a wedding or a rock concert i think its a bit of both grinned trillian you know zaphod hes hired in a team of crying groupies to make me feel lucky he doesnt deserve you said arthur tell him that said trillian hes giving me an entry in the guide as the luckiest woman in the universe a large ugly creature beckoned them towards him his hat declared he was a veteran of a disaster area tour the eyes of the universe are now watching he said with a far away look in his eye the other eye was watching for the cue he stood holding a curtain closed a magnificent noise came from the other side a green light flashed above the curtain youre on he opened the curtain and pushed them out they floated in a massive black arena they were high in the air and in the distance could make out a platform supporting the specially invited guests spotlights picked out arthur and trillian as a strong vocal choir burst into glorious song arthur looked around for the choir but couldnt see them the octogrid vocal choir was there in voice if not in body the octogrid vocal choir was the most successful choir in the universe they contained the best voices ever heard that was because some bright spark called ip thought what a waste it was when singers died and so indulged in some grave digging he rescued the vocal chords of some great singers and stretched them across an octagonal shaped grid he used a computer to stretch and contract the grid and spun the grid on its axis so air passed through the vocal chords to create sound ip built up his collection until he had enough to create eight grids of eighty voices and created an octophonic choir this was fine until it was found that one singer had copyrighted his voice which prevented its use after the owners death a long arduous and extremely profitable court case followed which eventually ended up being settled out of court by murdering the lawyers the copyright firm signed up the choir giving ip a massive settlement which he used to put himself through law school and later successfully sued the school for malpractice the octogrids had been bordered by reflective strips which caught the spotlights and scattered them all over suddenly arthur and trillian took flight and flew around the arena at a frightening speed lighting gantries exploded into light and the choir spun themselves into a frenzy arthur and trillian dive bombed the platform and landed with great delicacy besides zaphod nice entrance he whispered you should have been here for mine the lights dimmed and the choir settled down a bit from above a shower of diamond shaped metal plates came down the spotlights dancing through them the plates stopped above the platform held there by a magnetic field the technicians tweeked the field generator and the plates revolved lasers burst out from nowhere into the magnetic field deflecting everywhere it put even the largest glitterball to shame the choir whipped themselves up again as a priest floated down in front of the altar they reached an orgasm of sound and fell silent cameras locked in on the priest as he beckoned the couple forward well he said okay said trillian why not followed zaphod the choir erupted again as did the lights and the lasers the ceremony was over chapter the reception was a loud brash affair at zaphods home the swimming pool was filled with old janx spirit and ford was one of the first to dive in bolo dived in to save him when he tried to drain the pool orally arthur and fenchurch stood by the food trying to identify something that looked appetising and edible it was a long fruitless search i wouldnt say it was the most romantic wedding ive ever been to said arthur it was certainly one of the best gigs ive been to laughed fenchurch still i suppose the priest could do it another way if you asked him said arthur probably not that i was thinking of asking him of course not arthur looked deeply into a kopwilsilus dip arthur lets get married arthur looked up what why did you have to say that it seemed like you were having trouble youve ruined all my plans i was just building up to a big speech arthur looked back at the dip which seemed to look back im sorry pretend i never said it well its a bit difficult now arthur ask me fenchurch will you marry me ill have to think about it arthur picked up the dip in mock anger ive thought about it i will ill get the priest i dont want to get married here i want to get married on earth but thats omps away from here well im sure zaphod or ford will lend you a towel and youve still got your copy of the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy we can leave after the party she paused you know im really getting into this hitchhiking lark the end prologue space like a second sentence can be big confusing and needs going through twice to really understand it one of the few ways to comprehend how big space can be is to be subjected to the total perspective vortex but as this usually leads to death unless your ego is as large as say zaphod beeblebroxs it is just as well to accept everyones word that it is distances can therefore become ridiculously large large enough for those tired with light years to invent new exciting words for inexorably large distances a kirpcatorno is now widely accepted as a pretty long way and an omp is about twice as far as a kirpcatorno however to prevent distances getting too conceited about their sizes ships such as the heart of gold or the starship bistromath were designed to sprint through space fast enough to make distances go into a corner and sulk so for arthur dent to say we must be in zaphod beeblebroxs neighbourhood when it is in fact omps away is not entirely unreasonable for a good hitchhiker to recap arthur dent having found a wonderful companion in fenchurch had visited gods last message to his creation only to have marvin die in his arms ford prefect had resumed his job as a researcher for that truly wonderful book the hitchhikers guide to the galaxy with new vigour and was probably skulking around some seedy bar trying to talk somebody into buying him a drink zaphod beeblebrox had settled down with trillian to raise kids and have a peaceful time not saving the universe in fact although saving the universe again was the furthest thought from all their minds it was preparing to renew its acquaintance with them quite shortly
