the hollows insider a book in the rachel morgan series even before the turn vampires have held a place in literature as figures of power and terror lusting after both our blood and will theyre capable of horrific actions with no sense of remorse instilling humans and inderlanders alike with a healthy respect born in fear but even more dangerous than a hungry vampire is trying to confront one in ignorance it is with this in mind that i agreed to put on paper the distinctions that separate the bigbadugly wannabes from the really bigbaduglies both can kill you but if you know their limits and liabilities this very powerful manipulative branch of the inderland family can be understood and handled in a successful manner and if that fails shoot em until they stop moving living vampires are either highbloodvampires conceived within a living vampire and therefore having an inactive vampire virus fixed into their fetal genome to modify their development or lowbloodhumans bitten by an undead and existing in a tenuous halfwayturned status only an undead vampire has the active form of the virus that can infect a human the virus happily settles itself within cells of the bloodproducing bone marrow of its new host and immediately goes dormant very little of the vampires abilities or liabilities are imparted to the hapless human bitten humans halfturned are at the bottom of the vampiric rung constantly currying the favor of their undead sires for a chance to ingest more of his or her blood in the hopes of achieving a higher level of vampire characteristics with their human teeth human frailties and lacking any blood lust but in their imaginations theyre little more than a willing source of blood to the undead and an object of hidden ridicule to the rest of inderland lowblood vampires rightly live in fear that the undead who feed on them will become careless and accidentally kill them conveniently forgetting to finish the job and bring them back as an undead and whereas a highblood vampire is born with status that he or she carries into vampiric death lowblood vampires must fight for theirs they can be very dangerous if they start to overcompensate becoming ruthless to measure up to their sires expectations just punch them in the gut and theyll fall like any other human the other extreme of the vampiric existence are the true undead these are the soulless alluring vampires who exist only to satisfy their carnal urges and its their incredible strength coupled with their utter disregard for life that makes them such a threat they experience no compassion or empathy yet retain all their memories they remember ties of love but they dont remember why they love its a dead emotion and in my limited experience it brings untold grief to the living they interact with and once cared for the liabilities of the undead are few and while they have lost their souls many dont consider that a drawback but a blessing if sanctified crosses can inflict real damage on undead tissue but its a charm that causes the hurt not a religious belief bringing out a cross will most likely only irritate a vampire not get him or her to back down so have something more potent to follow it up with in theory the charm to burn undead flesh can be put into any bit of redwood or silver but the magic is older than agriculture and those that craft the spellbe they human or witchinsist the charm wont stick to anything but a cross personally i wouldnt trust anything but a sanctified cross to distract a vampire in a tight situation ive found that unblessed artifacts of any religion are little more than a bother ticking off the undead with the reminder that because their soul has already moved on there will be nothing to carry their awareness to a higher plane when their body fails again undead vampires are intimately aware that if their body dies not only will their spark of life cease but that it will be as if it had never existed a thought intolerable to the immortalityseeking vampires its with the undead that light becomes a liability the virus that allows vampires to continue his or her existence after the loss of their soul is rendered inactive by light and they will undergo a sadly undramatic death however if the bigbadugly falls to the ground in anything less than full sunlight shoot em before you go see if he or she is really down theyll move if theyre still conscious trust me on thisdamn the paperwork and just shoot them twice only the undead are capable of bespelling an unwilling person luring them into a state of bliss by way of sophisticated pheromones this is perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the undead and should be treated with the utmost caution dont bother averting your eyes it wont help and only pushes a hungry vampires buttons fear is a blood aphrodisiac try not to make things worse fortunately unless you have pissed the undead off or are quivering in terror they will likely ignore you as a source of blood the undead are fastidious in choosing their blood partners and will generally target living vampires to avoid legal battles with humans a word of caution luring and betraying humans to their ruin with false promises gives the undead a feeling of lustful domination that stirs them almost as much as the blood try not to get involved the newly undead can be very cruel to those they dont fear or once loved but with time they regain a veneer of morality most attaining elegant social skills to beguile and charm its all the better to eat you with my dear so be careful a good rule of thumb is the nicer a vampire is the more depraved he or she can be as their sophistication grows an undead vampires lust for domination mixes equally with their desire for blood making the blood of the betrayed far sweeter than the blood of the merely stupid the older the vampire the longer and more emotionally devastating the hunt can be on the hunted the long hunt is a skill that even living vampires unconsciously practice caught between the living and the undead are the highblood living vampires existing in a state of grace most other vampires envy they embody the best of both worlds and are the cherished living children of the undead both protected and plagued loved and abused warped manipulated and coddled by the undead who hunt and feed upon them highblood living vampires are not bitten but born with the vampire virus already having molded them into a state of inbetween as a result highblood living vampires possess an increased strength and reflexes better hearing and an incredible sense of smell all of which fall between normal human and an undead vampire even more telling is that they can bespell the willing becoming deadly if their lust for blood overrides their other emotions fortunately the blood lust in a living highblood vampire doesnt kick in until puberty and even though they dont need blood to remain sane as the undead do the dormant virus does impart a craving for it you can spot living vampires by their magnetic personality and their sharp canines but dont rely on the teeth as they can be capped because the virus is fixed into their dna living highblood vampires are guaranteed to become an undead even if they die with every last drop of blood in them if you accidentally kill a living vampire be responsible and call an ambulance before the sun comes up they have the right to settle their affairs even if they might want to take you out later chances are good that if you apologize they may thank you for ending their first life living vampires possess rank based on bloodlines both living and dead sometimes stretching back generations this gives many of the more affluent living vampires a prince in waiting status honored by all wise vampires and should be honored by you a blood sire often charts the path of his living children with the careful study of breeding thoroughbreds so if you insult a living vampire you may hear about it from their master whether you agree with their lifestyle or not you should respect someone who was around at the signing of the declaration of independence through the generations living and undead vampires have evolved many ways to capture and keep a ready supply of companionship and blood most of which hinge on pheromones both consciously and unconsciously emitted supporting the pheromones is a veritable cocktail of neurotransmitters and endorphininducing compounds in the saliva of a vampire with any bite the compounds settle into the tissue surrounding the wound and when stimulated even years later may cause pain to be recognized as pleasure dont be fooled its a trap with experience a vampire can sensitize the bite so that they are the only vampire able to stimulate the scar effectively preventing easy poaching from another vampires stable the person is mentally bound to the vampire and is called a shadow a shadow belonging to a living vampire is generally cared for though theres a significant loss of will if bitten and left unbound theres no dependency upon any particular vampire and life can soon return to normal however if enough vampire saliva has been introduced into the wound the victim is left in a dangerous state where they are highly susceptible to vampire pheromones without the usual loss of will these unbound shadows are almost irresistible to a vampires blood lust and if not under a strong vampires protection theyre taken as fair game for any vampire unclaimed shadows have a very short life expectancy passed from vampire to vampire until they lose first their individuality and then their vitality dying alone and unmourned for better or worse vampires are here living among us but forever apart when on the streets knowledge is the ultimate weapon and its up to you to protect yourself from the dangers engendered by contact with vampires they will always be ready to play upon our desire for perfect love and the dangers that seeking out that perfect love in ignorance can lead to your death or worse i hope that i have frightened you enough to be careful and given you enough knowledge to realize that vampires are the ultimate predator of mind and body the danger lies in that theyre more human than human and for that they deserve our respect and understanding pixies and fairies yes there is a difference published in conjunction with cincinnatis fib inderland department fib inderlander handbook issue by rachel morgan pixies and fairies have lived among humans for longer than any other inderland group but less is known about them than any of their larger kin for ages artists and poets have tried to capture the distinctions between them gained in glimpses ultimately falling short as both branches worked to preserve the truth of their existences now that they live among us openly its time to recognize the differences in these two highly inventive groups of citizens so that we may treat them with the respect they deserve to the uninformed pixies and fairies might be considered the same species with minor changes in size and wings nothing could be further from the truth and the easiest way to incur the anger of either of these resilient peoples is to say so pixies especially have an incredible culture and understanding this will lead to a greater appreciation of what motivates them pixies have dragonflylike wings and are slightly smaller than their fairy kin coming in at about four inches their faster metabolism and hard wings make them wickedly fast necessitating a diet of mainly nectar and pollen supplementing it with the odd bit of meat before hibernation a sustained temperature below fortyfive degrees fahrenheit will drop them into a torpid state that is unwise to break until spring they invariably marry for love and are said to die of heartache when their spouse passes on their life span is fifteen to twenty years largely hinging upon their living conditions children are born in twos or threes gestation being about six months depending on the season and the availability of food big families are indicative of a good provider and a nurturing mother giving the entire pixy clan status since it takes a large plot of land to support many children its not uncommon for the first year or two of children to be lost because of bad conditions and the inability to defend against encroaching fairies death during hibernation is another constant threat to the very young and very old but a pixy can expect a healthy life once they make it past the first few years tradition dictates that children are named after their father the eldest having short names the youngest given longer more elaborate titles children leave to start their own gardens when about nine shortly after puberty though if a parent is ailing an older child may assume responsibility of a successful garden when lured into paying jobs pixies use their natural talents to excel in surveillance camera maintenance and general sneaking around they will not work as gardeners for anyone but themselves though loyal and honest to a fault with those they respect will lie like the devil to those they dont and friendships mean more to them than life itself silver will burn pixies skin acting like a poison should it get into their blood system whereupon the survival rate drops to almost nil pixy dust is still much of an enigma but shedding dust is a sign of high emotions and can act as an irritant on human and inderland skin much like poison ivy a lesserknown aspect of pixy dust is its ability to clot blood an adaptation necessary for swordtoting gardeners who can afford little blood loss before going comatose most pixies live in the country since gardens sophisticated enough to support a growing clan are understandably scarce within city limits but once established an elaborate city garden is safer than one in the country and vigorously defended its the rare pixy who is attracted to the danger and excitement of living among people a hundred times larger than they are but the safety found within the city is often lure enough to risk starvation even cityliving pixies avoid people generally existing on the fringes as citizens without rights or responsibilities to the point where theyre actually considered an expense not an employee when working for the is they cannot hold property and have no legal rights its a situation that pixies promote preferring to swallow the indignities heaped upon them by their fellow inderlanders and humans so they can remain free to settle their much more pressing differences with fairies using a sword rather than in the humaninderlandrun courts pixies are in constant conflict for territory with the larger more aggressive fairies if you see a pixy wearing red theyre out of their territory and not looking for trouble its a sign of truce dont ask them to violate it youll likely get pixed and spend the rest of the day with a bad case of hives despite their small size and funloving peaceful appearance pixies will not hesitate to kill fairies in defense of people they care for or to defend their territory and theyre good at it their natural skills of subterfuge quickness and their mindset of putting their own beliefs above the law could lend itself to a life of crime but a pixy is at his or her best in the garden they could rule the world through fear if they wished but all a pixy desires is a small plot of land and the right to defend it ive never heard of a pixy harming a person other than making their life miserable in retaliation for a slight or insult in their minds were simply below notice not worth the risk of attracting a human or inderland court and changing the status quo fairies also keep to themselves but theyre far more likely to hire out for questionable jobs for large pay their small size and inwarddirected morals make them very effective assassins so dont mistake small with harmless they have butterflylike wings and a slower metabolism but their ability to float high unseen for long periods seems to be a good tradeoff for the faster but more calorically expensive flying that pixies are capable of fairies tend to shun cities as well but adolescents of both sexes will brave the streets to set up packs in parks or green spaces looking for adventure and a chance to prove themselves and earn the right to start a family might makes right is their mentality compared to the individual morals guiding pixies decisions being insectivores fairies often vie for the same space as pixies bringing the two species into conflict they could exist peacefully on the same territory but for a fairys tendency to ruin an area in search of food the balance of power is fairly equal with fairies being largercoming in at about six inchesbut slower fairies share pixies allergic reaction to silver and they migrate to mexico with monarch butterflies for the winter instead of hibernating not much is known about their home life as usually all but young males shun contact with anyone larger than they despite their small size pixies and fairies are potentially dangerous and can cause untold grief when insulted or slighted treat them with respect and these deservedly proud intelligent members of inderland will respond with professionalism and grace music as my inspiration okay a little explanation might be in order my muse exists in music logic maps the story but music gives it its soul and sends my characters in directions that surprise even me what im left with is an eclectic handful of songs thatin my thoughtsrelate to certain scenes or more typically relationships between characters some authors cast their books with popular actors or actresses which i do have some ideas about by the way but id rather cast the music as it connects more directly to my creative process below are a few of the songs i think suit the hollows rachel the songs ive found that i feel relate to rachel cover a wonderfully wide span most recently i found save yourself from stabbing westward passive off a perfect circles emotion is a good one too though im torn yet as to whom else it relates to a reader named dash suggested magic carpet ride by steppenwolf and though he didnt mention rachel i think it fits her pretty well id be willing to make it her theme song for a while grin as her story progresses nine inch nails down in it has a special meaning as does kinda i want to and sin suicide note by johnette napolitano on the underworld soundtrack has begun to cast shadows on ivy and rachels everevolving complex relationship and thinking of you by a perfect circle has whispers of rachel in it but as to whom she is surrendering she hasnt told me yet there are so many choices that woman has to make so many paths she could walk as she finds herself pulled deeper into the hollows underworld fields of innocence by evanescence seems to fit more and more ivy ivys character is one of the most complex ive ever tried to sketch with my pen and shes claimed a correspondingly large portion of music i understand her motivations but she remains a mystery to even me at times a confusing mix of human vulnerabilities and vampiric drives most recently mooncat introduced me to a wonderful band stabbing westward and their track what do i have to do is scrumptious at nailing ivys inner dilemma faint by linkin park silhouettes by smile empty soul and everybodys fool were all suggested by readers and now that ive had a chance to get a good listen i wholeheartedly agree recently a reader named jane introduced me to kip wingers music and though almost the entire disc songs from the ocean floor has shadows of the hollows in it faster has ivy all over it nins terrible lie sanctified and something i can never have are good matches to the plot lines too gravity by a perfect circle is a good fit too but its a bit too collected its not quite confused enough and though it wont make much sense until you read the second book evanescences away from me gave me chills at how close it fit ivys predicament dash suggested mary janes last dance by tom petty and the heartbreakers as bringing to mind ivy a relation i agree with ivys eventual fall from grace i first heard in duran durans save a prayer okay now youre laughing at me or sitting there with a puzzled look wondering who duran duran is i told you it was an eclectic stack of music and i saw who pushed her into falling after hearing evanescences going under jenks track ten on the oceans eleven soundtrack planting the seed fits jenks flitting about as a gardener thanks to tim from tennessee i found peter gunn done by henry mancini it fits fantastically think the blues brothers jenkss son jax gets into trouble thanks to redtape from agent provocateur which is also on the underworld soundtrack though we wont see that for ages and please dont write to tell me the song isnt really about little thieves inspiration is where you find it kisten thinking of you by a perfect circle seems to fit kisten whether this means he will end up with rachel or whether she is going to remain one of kistens unresolved conquests i honestly dont know yet also from a perfect circle is weak and powerless right now the song is simply simmering in the back of my head but im sure its going to fit somewhere with kisten sigh im starting to like the guy despite my better judgment but the best fit for him ive found so far is never say never from queens of the stone age off the punisher soundtrack the depth of that piece is hidden by the egotestical attitude of the refrainjust like kistens depth is shrouded under a carefully constructed front to disarm and beguile nins the only time fits a plot line that kisten is wiggling his way into trent thanks to a reader who simply identified himself as a fan from the southeast i have found a piece of music off the queen of the damned soundtrack that i think fits trent kalamack fairly well especially the lyrics that stephanie mckay sings try track excess by tricky if trent believes in anything its people guilty by gravity kills is good too i think dash brought that one to my attention the american way by the crystal method fits well thanks beyari for suggesting i listen to that one piscary a fellow music aficionado suggested sympathy for the devil by the rolling stones and after playing it to death i realized it cast wonderful shadows on piscary one of cincinnatis master vampires pet and lullaby by a perfect circle strike close to home with piscary as well piscarys restaurant after kisten assumes management we wont see this for some time but it happensbrings to mind rob zombies living dead girl think linedancing vampires yes linedancing vampires i only hope rob will forgive me nick it took a while but im finally nailing down a few pieces of music that i can relate to nick from kip winger comes sure was a wildflower and crash the wall thats what i get from nin works really well too seduction as the plotlines progress im finding myself collecting a few pieces of music of seduction and in the spirit of avoiding spoilers im not saying yet to whom they relate dipping waaaay back i found stings i burn for you which has a hidden thread of evil in it and a crystalline purity that makes it a delicious threat kip winger has one here too with two lovers stand as does evanescence with even in death which is terribly tragic but i have yet to find a more seductive piece of music than new years prayer by jeff buckley off his sketches for my sweetheart drunk you may have heard it before as its used as the beginning music for the dead zone but the real thing is ohsomuch more languorous stretch seductive also from jeff buckley is you and i and lilac wine which has all the markings of an old jazz song the everafter i found thanks to theguyintheleatherjacket a piece of music that just about blew me away with how close it sounds to my idea of the everafter a perfect circles remake of lennons imagine think of a redsmeared sky and a broken city skyline and just try not to shiver final notes i recently ran into an entire album that just about blew me away in how many tracks related to story lines i was developing it also made me a nin fan something i really didnt expect the entire album pretty hate machine has found a place in the hollows for me and every song but the last easily relates to a developing or crumbling relationship from my books almost the entire soundtrack for underworld seems to have found a place in the hollows r e v by puscifer speaks to me of kistens longago relationship with ivy before she met rachel and went on the wagon so to speak when they are pulling the last job at the end of dead witch walking brings to mind rehumanize yourself from sting and since im tripping down the paths of good s music whenever i hear phil collinss long long way to go all i see is rachel driving across the bridge into cincinnati the sun going down with the sky all pink and blue the wind in her hair and the concern for an entire city in her eyes on a last note my immortal by evanescence is figuring into the grand scheme of things even i cant see yet how all my characters relationships will be built before they can fall apart from tragic stupidity and pride but the power and depth of that piece of music has left a mark on me and wont let go twas the night of the solstice by kim harrison twas the week before christmas and up in the hollows solstice bonfires were burning to toast the marshmallows the pixies were snug in their stump even jenks who claimed he was tired and needed some winks so i in my parka and ivy in her boots were toasting the season with thirtyyear hooch when out in the street there came such a crash i thought that it had to be coons in our trash away to the gate i trudged through the snow while ivy just said if its kist say hello i lifted the latch and peered to the street my face went quite cold we were in it thigh deep twas a demon who stood in the headlamps quite bright with his coat of green velvet and his uncommon height his eyes how they glittered his teeth how they gnashed his voice how he bellowed his tongue how it lashed the street wasnt holy so on big al came as he bellowed and shouted and called me by name morgan you witch youre a pain in my side get out of your church theres no place to hide like hells fury unleashed he strode to my door where he hammered and cursed like a cheap jilted whore but ivy and i we circled round back to stand in the street and prepare for attack you loser i shouted im waiting for you and the demon he spun taking on a red hue ivy stood ready and i whispered okay if he wants to get rough im ready to play with nary a word us two girls got to work putting foot into gut of the soulsucking jerk i circled him quick with a few words of latin while ivy distracted him with lots of good wackin get back i yelled out when my trap was complete and ivy somersaulted right over the creep my circle sprang up entrapping him surely al fussed and he fumed like a demonic fury the neighbors all cheered and came out of their houses where theyd watched the whole thing like little house mouses so ivy and i we both bowed real low then banished big al in an overdone show but i heard al exclaim ere he poofed from our sight you won this time witch but ill get you one night kim harrison december th
