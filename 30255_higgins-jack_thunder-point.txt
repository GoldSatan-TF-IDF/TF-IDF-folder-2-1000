jack higgins thunder point the second book in the sean dillon series for my daughter hannah whether reichsleiter martin bormann head of the nazi party chancellery and secretary to adolf hitler the most powerful man in germany after the führer actually escaped from the führer bunker in berlin in the early hours of may or died trying to cross the weidendammer bridge has always been a matter of conjecture josef stalin believed him to be alive jacob glas bormanns chauffeur swore that he saw him in munich after the war and eichmann told the israelis he was still alive in simon wiesenthal the greatest nazi hunter of them all always insisted he was alive and then there was a spaniard who had served in the german ss who insisted that bormann had left norway in a uboat bound for south america at the very end of the war prologue berlin the führer bunker april the city seemed to be on fire a kind of hell on earth the ground shaking as shells exploded and as dawn came smoke drifted in a black pall in the eastern half of berlin the russians were already formally in control and refugees carrying what they could of their belongings moved along wilhelmstrasse close to the reich chancellery in the desperate hope of somehow reaching the west and the americans berlin was doomed everyone knew that and the panic was dreadful to see close by the chancellery a group of ss was stopping everyone they saw in uniform unless such individuals could account for themselves they were immediately accused of desertion in the face of the enemy and hung from the nearest lamp post or tree a shell screamed in fired at random by russian artillery there were cries of alarm and people scattered the chancellery itself was battered and defaced by the bombardment particularly at the rear but deep in the earth protected by thirty meters of concrete the führer and his staff still worked on in a subterranean world that was totally selfsupporting still in touch by radio and radiotelephone with the outside world the rear of the reich chancellery was also damaged pockmarked by shell fire and the once lovely gardens were a wilderness of uprooted trees and the occasional shell hole one blessing there was little air activity low cloud and driving rain having cleared the sky of aircraft for the moment the man who walked in that ruined garden on his own seemed curiously indifferent to what was happening didnt even flinch when another shell landed on the far side of the chancellery as the rain increased in force he simply turned up his collar lit a cigarette and held it in cupped hand as he continued to walk he was not very tall with heavy shoulders and a coarse face in a crowd of laborers or dock workers he would have faded into the background nothing special not memorable to the slightest degree everything about him was nondescript from the shabby anklelength greatcoat to the battered peaked cap a nobody of any importance that would have been the conclusion and yet this man was reichsleiter martin bormann head of the nazi party chancellery and secretary to the führer the most powerful man in germany after hitler himself the vast majority of the german people had never even heard of him and even fewer would have recognized him if they saw him but then he had organized his life that way deliberately choosing to be an anonymous figure wielding his power only from the shadows but that was all over everything was finished and this was the final end of things the russians could be here at any moment hed tried to persuade hitler to leave for bavaria but the führer had refused had insisted as he had publicly declared for days that he would commit suicide an ss corporal came out of the bunker entrance and hurried toward him he gave the nazi salute herr reichsleiter the führer is asking for you where is he in his study good ill come at once as they walked toward the entrance several shells landed on the far side of the chancellery again debris lifting into the air bormann said tanks im afraid so herr reichsleiter less than half a mile away now the ss corporal was young and tough a seasoned veteran bormann clapped him on the shoulder you know what they say everything comes to he who waits he started to laugh and the young corporal laughed with him as they started down the concrete steps when bormann knocked on the study door and went in the führer was seated behind the desk examining some maps with a magnifying glass he glanced up ah bormann there you are come in we dont have much time i suppose not my führer bormann said uncertainly unsure of what was meant theyll be here soon bormann the damned russians but they wont find me waiting stalin would like nothing better than to exhibit me in a cage that can never be my führer of course not i shall commit suicide and my wife will accompany me on that dark journey he was referring to his mistress eva braun whom he had finally married at midnight on the twentyeighth i had hoped that even now you would reconsider whether or not to make a break for bavaria bormann told him but more for something to say than anything else no my mind is made up but you my old friend you have work to do hitler stood up and shuffled round the table the man who only three years previously had controlled europe from the urals in the east to the english channel now his cheeks were sunken his jacket appeared too large and when he took bormanns hands his own shook with palsy and yet the power was there still and bormann was moved anything my führer i knew i could depend on you the kamaradenwerk action for comrades hitler shuffled back to his chair that is your task bormann to see that the national socialism survives we have hundreds of millions in switzerland and elsewhere in the world in gold in numbered accounts but you have details of those yes my führer hitler reached under his desk and produced a rather strangelooking briefcase dull silver in appearance bormann noted the kriegsmarine insignia etched in the top righthand corner hitler flicked it open the keys are inside along with a number of items which will prove useful to you over the years he held up a buff envelope details of similar accounts in various south american countries and the united states we have friends in all those places only waiting to hear from you anything else my führer hitler held up a large file i call this the blue book it contains the names of many members of the british establishment both in the ranks of the aristocracy and parliament who are friendly to our cause a number of our american friends are there also and last but not least he passed another envelope across open it the paper was of such quality that it was almost like parchment it had been written in english in july in estoril in portugal and was addressed to the führer the signature at the bottom was that of his royal highness the duke of windsor it was in english and the content was quite simple he was agreeing to take over the throne of great britain in the event of a successful invasion the windsor protocol hitler said simply can this be true bormann asked in astonishment himmler himself vouched for it he had the duke approached by his agents in portugal at the time or said that he had bormann told himself that devious little animal had always been capable of anything he replaced the document in its envelope and handed it to the führer who replaced it and the other items in the briefcase this is standard issue to the uboat captains at the moment completely selfsealing water and fireproof the führer pushed it across to bormann yours now he gazed in space for a moment in reverie what a swine himmler is to try and make a separate peace with the allies and now i hear that mussolini and his girlfriend were murdered by partisans in northern italy strung up by their ankles a mad world bormann waited for a moment then said one point my führer how do i leave we are now surrounded here hitler came back to life quite simple you will fly out using the eastwest avenue as you know field marshal ritter von greim and hannah reitsch got away in an arado just after midnight yesterday i spoke personally to the commander of the luftwaffe base at rechlin he glanced at a paper on his desk a young man a captain neumann volunteered to fly in a feiseler storch during the night he arrived safely and is now waiting your orders but where my führer bormann asked in that huge garage at goebbels house near the brandenburg gate from there he will fly you to rechlin and refuel for the onward flight to bergen in norway bergen bormann asked from where you will proceed by submarine to south america venezuela to be precise youll be expected one stop on the way youll be expected there too but all the details are in here he handed him an envelope youll also find my personal signed authorization in there giving you full powers in my name and several false passports so i leave tonight bormann asked no you leave within the next hour hitler said calmly because of the driving rain and low clouds there is no air cover at the moment captain neumann thinks he could achieve total surprise and i agree i have every confidence you will succeed there could be no arguing with that and bormann nodded of course my führer then there only remains one more thing hitler said youll find someone in the bedroom bring him in the man bormann found in there wore the uniform of a lieutenant general in the ss there was something familiar about him and bormann felt acutely uncomfortable for some reason my führer the man said and gave hitler a nazi salute note the resemblance bormann hitler asked it was then that bormann realized why hed felt so strange it was true the general did have a look of him not perfect but it was undeniably there general strasser will stay here in your place hitler said when the general breakout occurs he will leave with the others he can stay out of the way until then in the confusion and darkness of leaving its hardly likely anyone will notice theyll be too concerned with saving their own skins he turned to strasser you will do this for your führer with all my heart strasser said good then you will now exchange uniforms you may use my bedroom he came round the desk and took both of bormanns hands in his i prefer to say goodbye now old friend we will not meet again cynical as he was by nature bormann felt incredibly moved i will succeed my führer my word on it i know you will hitler shuffled out the door closed behind him and bormann turned to strasser right lets get started precisely half an hour later bormann left the bunker by the exit into hermann goering strasse he wore a heavy leather military overcoat over his ss uniform and carried a military holdall which held the briefcase and a change of civilian clothes in one pocket he carried a silenced mauser pistol and a schmeisser machine pistol was slung across his chest he moved along the edge of the tiergarten aware of people everywhere mainly refugees crossed by the brandenburg gate and arrived at goebbels house quite quickly like most properties in the area it had suffered damage but the vast garage building seemed intact the sliding doors were closed but there was a small judas gate which bormann opened cautiously it was dark in there and a voice called stay where you are hands high lights were switched on and bormann found a young man in the uniform of a captain in the luftwaffe and a flying jacket standing by the wall a pistol in his hand the small feiseler storch spotter plane stood in the center of the empty garage captain neumann general strasser the young man looked relieved and holstered his pistol thank god ive been expecting ivans ever since i got here you have orders of course rechlin to refuel and then bergen a distinct pleasure actually do you think we stand a chance of getting away theres nothing up there to shoot us down at the moment filthy weather only ground fire to worry about he grinned is your luck good general always excellent ill start up you get in and well taxi across the road to the brandenburg gate from there ill take off toward the victory column they wont be expecting that because the wind is in the wrong direction isnt that dangerous bormann asked absolutely neumann climbed up into the cabin and started the engine there was broken glass and rubble in the street and the storch bumped its way along passing many astonished refugees moved across the brandenburg gate and turned toward the victory column in the distance the rain was driving down neumann said here we go and boosted power the storch roared down the center of the road here and there people fleeing before it and suddenly they were airborne and turning to starboard to avoid the victory column bormann was not even aware of any ground fire you must live right herr reichsleiter the young pilot said bormann turned to him sharply what did you call me im sorry if ive said the wrong thing neumann said but i met you at an award ceremony once in berlin bormann decided to leave it for the moment dont worry about it he looked down at the flames and smoke below as berlin burned the russian artillery keeping up a constant bombardment truly a scene from hell twilight of the gods reichsleiter neumann said all we need is wagner to provide suitable music and he took the storch up into the safety of the dark clouds it was the second part of the journey which was particularly arduous cutting across the east coast of denmark and then up across the skagerrak refueling at a small luftwaffe base at kristiansand for the final run it was pitchdark when they reached bergen and cold very cold a little sleet mixed with the rain as they landed neumann had contacted the base half an hour earlier to notify their arrival there were lights in the control tower and the buildings a poor blackout the german occupying forces in norway knew that the end was near that there was no possibility of an allied invasion it simply wasnt necessary an aircraftsman with a torch in each hand guided them to a parking place then walked away bormann could see a kubelwagen driving toward them it stopped on the other side of the parked aircraft of which there were several neumann switched off so we made it herr reichsleiter rather different from berlin you did well bormann said youre a fine pilot let me get your bag for you bormann got down to the ground and neumann passed him the bag bormann said such a pity you recognized me and he took the silenced mauser from his greatcoat pocket and shot him through the head the man standing beside the kubelwagen was a naval officer and wore the whitetopped cap affected by uboat commanders he was smoking a cigarette and he dropped it to the ground and stamped on it as bormann approached general strasser thats right bormann told him korvettenkapitän paul friemel friemel gave him a halfsalute commanding u bormann tossed his bag into the rear of the kubelwagen and eased himself into the passenger seat as the other man got behind the wheel the reichsleiter said are you ready for sea absolutely general good then well leave at once at your orders general friemel said and drove away bormann took a deep breath he could smell the sea on the wind strange but instead of feeling tired he was full of energy and he lit a cigarette and leaned back looking up at the stars and remembering berlin only as a bad dream just before midnight it started to rain as dillon pulled in the mercedes at the side of the road switched on the interior light and checked his map klagenfurt was twenty miles behind which meant that the yugoslavian border must be very close now there was a road sign a few yards further on and he took a torch from the glove compartment got out of the car and walked toward it whistling softly a small man no more than five feet four or five with hair so fair that it was almost white he wore an old black leather flying jacket with a white scarf at his throat and dark blue jeans the sign showed fehring to the right and five kilometers further on he showed no emotion simply took a cigarette from a silver case lit it with an oldfashioned zippo lighter and returned to the car it was raining very heavily now the road badly surfaced mountains rising to his right and he switched on the radio and listened to a little night music occasionally whistling the tune until he came to gates on the left and slowed to read the sign it badly needed a fresh coat of paint but the inscription was clear enough fehring aero club he turned in through the gates and followed a track lurching over potholes until he saw the airfield below he switched off his lights and paused it seemed a poor sort of place a couple of hangars three huts and a rickety excuse for a control tower but there was light streaming out from one of the hangars and from the windows of the end hut he moved into neutral eased off the brake and let the mercedes run down the hill silently coming to a halt on the far side of the runway from the hangars he sat there thinking about things for a moment then took a walther ppk and black leather gloves from the attaché case on the seat next to him he checked the walther slipped it into his waistband at the rear then pulled on the gloves as he started across the runway in the rain the hangar was old and smelled of damp as if not used in years but the airplane that stood there in the dim light looked well enough a cessna conquest with twin turboprop engines a mechanic in overalls had the cowling on the port engine open and stood on a ladder working on it the cabin door was open the stairs down and two men loaded boxes inside as they emerged one of them called in german were finished doctor wegner a bearded man emerged from the small office in one corner of the hangar he wore a hunting jacket the fur collar turned up against the cold all right you can go as they walked away he said to the mechanic any problems tomic no big deal herr doctor just finetuning which wont mean a thing unless this damn man dillon turns up as wegner turned a young man came in the woollen cap and reefer coat he wore beaded with rain hell be here wegner told him i was told he could never resist a challenge this one a mercenary the young man said thats what weve come down to the kind of man who kills people for money there are children dying over there wegner said and they need whats on that plane to achieve that id deal with the devil himself which youll probably have to not kind dillon called in excellent german not kind at all and he stepped out of the darkness at the end of the hangar the young man put a hand in his pocket and dillons walther appeared fast plain view son plain view dillon walked forward swung the young man round and extracted a mauser from his righthand pocket would you look at that now you cant trust a soul these days wegner said in english mr dillon mr sean dillon so they tell me dillon slipped the mauser into his hip pocket took out his silver case onehanded still holding the walther and managed to extract a cigarette and who might you be me old son his speech had the hard distinctive edge to it that was found only in ulster and not in the republic of ireland i am dr hans wegner of international drug relief and this is klaus schmidt from our office in vienna he arranged the plane for us did he now thats something to be said in his favor dillon took the mauser from his hip pocket and handed it back doing good is all very fine but playing with guns when you dont know how is a mugs game the young man flushed deeply took the mauser and put it in his pocket and wegner said mildly herr schmidt has made the run by road twice with medical supplies then why not this time dillon asked slipping the walther back in his waistband because that part of croatia is disputed territory now schmidt said theres heavy fighting between serbs and moslems and croats i see dillon said so im to manage by air what you cant by road mr dillon its a hundred and twenty miles to sabac from here and the airstrip is still open believe it or not but the phone system still works quite well over there im given to understand that this plane is capable of more than three hundred miles an hour that means you could be there in twenty minutes or so dillon laughed out loud would you listen to the man its plain to see you dont know the first thing about flying a plane he saw that the mechanic high on his ladder was smiling ah so you speak english old son a little tomic is a croatian dr wegner said dillon looked up what do you think tomic said i was in the airforce for seven years i know sabac its an emergency strip but a sound asphalt runway and the flight well if youre just some private pilot out here to do a bit of good in this wicked world you wont last twenty miles dillon said softly lets just say ive seldom done a good thing in my life and im not that kind of pilot whats the terrain like mountainous in parts heavily forested and the weather forecast stinks i checked it myself earlier but its not only that its the airforce they still patrol the area regularly mig fighters dillon asked thats right tomic slapped the wing of the conquest with one hand a nice airplane but no match for a mig he shook his head but maybe youve got a death wish thats enough tomic wegner said angrily oh its been said before dillon laughed but lets get on id better look at the charts as they moved toward the office wegner said our people in vienna did make it plain your services are purely voluntary we need all the money we can raise for the drugs and medical supplies understood dillon said they went into the office where a number of charts were spread across the desk dillon started to examine them when would you leave wegner asked just before dawn dillon told him best time of all and least active i hope the rain keeps up schmidt genuinely curious said why would you do this i dont understand a man like you he seemed suddenly awkward i mean we know something of your background do you now dillon said well as the good doctor said i find it hard to resist a challenge and for this you would risk your life ah sure and i was forgetting dillon looked up and smiled and an astonishing change came to his face nothing but warmth and great charm there i should also mention that im the last of the worlds great adventurers now leave me be like a good lad and let me see where im going he leaned over the charts and started to examine them intently just before five the rain was as relentless as ever the darkness as impenetrable as dillon stood in the entrance of the hangar and peered out wegner and schmidt approached him the older man said can you really take off in weather like this the problem is landing not taking off dillon called to tomic how are things tomic emerged from the cabin jumped to the ground and came toward them wiping his hands on a rag everything in perfect working order dillon offered him a cigarette and glanced out and this tomic peered up into the darkness itll get worse before it gets better and youll find ground mist over there especially over the forest mark my words ah well better get on with it as the thief said to the hangman dillon crossed to the conquest he went up the steps and examined the interior all the seats had been removed and it was stacked with long olivegreen boxes each one was stenciled in english royal army medical corps schmidt who had joined him said as you can see we get our supplies from unusual sources you can say that again whats in these see for yourself schmidt unclipped the nearest one removed a sheet of oiled paper to reveal box after box of morphine ampoules over there mr dillon they sometimes have to hold children down when they operate on them because of the lack of any kind of anesthetic these prove a highly satisfactory substitute point taken dillon said now close it up and ill get moving schmidt did as he was told then jumped to the ground as dillon pulled up the steps wegner said god go with you mr dillon theres always that chance dillon said its probably the first time ive done anything hed approve of and he closed the door and clamped it in place he settled into the lefthand pilots seat fired the port engine and after that the starboard the chart was next to him on the other seat but he had already pretty well committed it to memory he paused on the apron outside the hangar rain streaming from his windscreen did a thorough cockpit check then strapped in and taxied to the end of the runway turning into the wind he glanced across to the three men standing in the hangar entrance raised a thumb then started forward his engine roar deepening as he boosted power within a second or two he had disappeared the sound of the engines already fading wegner ran a hand over his face god but im tired he turned to tomic has he a chance tomic shrugged quite a man that one who knows schmidt said lets get some coffee were going to have a long wait tomic said ill join you in a minute i just want to clear my tools away they crossed toward the end hut he watched them go waited until theyd gone inside before turning and swiftly crossing to the office he picked up the telephone and dialed a lengthy series of numbers as the good doctor had said the telephone system still worked surprisingly well over there when a voice answered he spoke in serbocroatian this is tomic get me major branko there was an instant response branko here tomic im at the airfield at fehring and ive got traffic for you cessna conquest just left destination sabac here is his radio frequency is the pilot anyone we know name of dillon sean dillon irish i believe small man very fair hair late thirties id say doesnt look much nice smile but the eyes tell a different story ill have him checked out through central intelligence but youve done well tomic well give him a warm welcome the phone clicked and tomic replaced the receiver he took out a packet of the vile macedonian cigarettes he affected and lit one pity about dillon hed rather liked the irishman but that was life and he started to put his tools away methodically and dillon was already in trouble not only thick cloud and the constant driving rain but even at a thousand feet a swirling mist that gave only an intermittent view of pine forest below and what in the hell are you doing here old son he asked softly what are you trying to prove he got a cigarette out of his case lit it and a voice spoke in his earphones in heavily accented english good morning mr dillon welcome to yugoslavia the plane took station to starboard not too far away the red stars on its fuselage clear enough a mig the old fishbed probably the soviet jet most widely distributed to its allies outdated now but not as far as dillon was concerned the mig pilot spoke again course onetwofour mr dillon well come to a rather picturesque castle at the edge of the forest kivo its called intelligence headquarters for this area theres an airstrip there and theyre expecting you they might even arrange a full english breakfast irish dillon said cheerfully a full irish breakfast and who am i to refuse an offer like that onetwofour it is he turned onto the new course climbing to two thousand feet as the weather cleared a little whistling softly to himself a serbian prison did not commend itself not if the stories reaching western europe were even partly true but in the circumstances he didnt seem to have any choice and then a couple of miles away on the edge of the forest beside a river he saw kivo a fairytale castle of towers and battlements surrounded by a moat the airstrip clear beside it what do you think the mig pilot asked nice isnt it straight out of a story by the brothers grimm dillon answered all we need is the ogre oh we have that too mr dillon now put down nice and easy and ill say goodbye dillon looked down into the interior of the castle noticed soldiers moving toward the edge of the airstrip preceded by a jeep and sighed he said into his mike id like to say its been a good life but then there are those difficult days like this morning for instance i mean why did i even get out of bed he heaved the control column right back and boosted power climbing fast and the mig pilot reacted angrily dillon do as youre told or ill blast you out of the sky dillon ignored him leveling out at five thousand searching the sky for any sign and the mig already on his tail came up behind and fired the conquest staggered as cannon shell tore through both wings dillon dont be a fool the pilot cried ah but then i always was dillon went down fast leveling at two thousand feet over the edge of the forest aware of vehicles moving from the direction of the castle the mig came in again firing his machine guns now and the conquests windscreen disintegrated wind and rain roaring in dillon sat there hands firm on the control column blood on his face from a glass splinter now then he said into his mike lets see how good you are he dropped the nose and went straight down the pine forest waiting for him below and the mig went after him firing again the conquest bucked the port engine dying as dillon leveled out at four hundred feet and behind him the mig no time to pull out at the speed it was doing plowed into the forest and fireballed dillon trimming as best he could for flying on one engine lost power and dropped lower there was a clearing up ahead and to his left he tried to bank toward it was already losing height as he clipped the tops of the pine trees he cut power instantly and braced himself for the crash in the end it was the pine trees which saved him retarding his progress so much that by the time he hit the clearing for a belly landing he wasnt actually going all that fast the conquest bounced twice and came to a shuddering halt dillon released his straps scrambled out of his seat and had the door open in an instant he was out headfirst rolling over in the rain and on his feet and running his right ankle twisting so that he fell on his face again he scrambled up and limped away as fast as he could but the conquest didnt burst into flame it simply crouched there in the rain as if tired there was thick black smoke above the trees from the burning mig and then soldiers appeared on the other side of the clearing a jeep moved out of the trees behind them top down and dillon could see an officer standing up in it wearing a winter campaign coat russianstyle with a fur collar more soldiers appeared some of them with dobermans all barking loudly and straining against their leashes it was enough dillon turned to hobble into the trees and his leg gave out on him a voice on a loudhailer called in english oh come now mr dillon be sensible you dont want me to set the dogs on you dillon paused balanced on one foot then he turned and hobbled to the nearest tree and leaned against it he took a cigarette from his silver case the last one and lit it the smoke tasted good as it bit at the back of his throat and he waited for them they stood in a semicircle soldiers in baggy tunics guns covering him the dogs howling against being restrained the jeep rolled to a halt and the officer a major from his shoulder boards stood up and looked down at him a goodlooking man of about thirty with a dark saturnine face so mr dillon you made it in one piece he said in faultless public school english i congratulate you my name by the way is branko john branko my mother was english is i should say lives in hampstead is that a fact dillon smiled a desperate bunch of rascals youve got here major but cead míle fáilte anyway and what would that mean mr dillon oh thats irish for a hundred thousand welcomes what a charming sentiment branko turned and spoke in serbocroatian to the large brutallooking sergeant who sat behind him clutching an ak assault rifle the sergeant smiled jumped to the ground and advanced on dillon major branko said allow me to introduce you to my sergeant zekan ive just told him to offer you a hundred thousand welcomes to yugoslavia or serbia as we prefer to say now dillon knew what was coming but there wasnt a thing he could do the butt of the ak caught him in the left side driving the wind from him as he keeled over the sergeant lifted a knee in his face the last thing dillon remembered was the dogs barking the laughter and then there was only darkness when sergeant zekan took dillon along the corridor someone screamed in the distance and there was the sound of heavy blows dillon hesitated but the sergeant showed no emotion simply put a hand between the irishmans shoulder blades and pushed him toward a flight of stone steps and urged him up there was an oaken door at the top banded with iron zekan opened it and pushed him through the room inside was oak beamed with granite walls tapestries hanging here and there a log fire burned in an open hearth and two of the dobermans sprawled in front of it branko sat behind a large desk reading a file and drinking from a crystal glass a bottle in an ice bucket beside him he glanced up and smiled then took the bottle from the ice bucket and filled another glass krug champagne mr dillon your preferred choice i understand is there anything you dont know about me dillon asked not much branko lifted the file then dropped it on the desk the intelligence organizations of most countries have the useful habit of frequently cooperating with each other even when their countries dont do sit down and have a drink youll feel better dillon took the chair opposite and accepted the glass that zekan handed him he emptied it in one go and branko smiled took a cigarette from a packet of rothmans and tossed it across help yourself he reached out and refilled dillons glass i much prefer the nonvintage dont you its the grape mix dillon said and lit the cigarette sorry about that little touch of violence back there branko told him just a show for my boys after all you did cost us that mig and it takes two years to train the pilots i should know im one myself really dillon said yes cranwell courtesy of your british royal air force not mine dillon told him but you were born in ulster i understand belfast is that not so and belfast as i understand it is part of great britain and not the republic of ireland a debatable point dillon said lets say im irish and leave it at that he swallowed some more champagne who dropped me in it wegner or schmidt he frowned no of course not just a couple of dogooders tomic it would be tomic am i right a good serb branko poured a little more champagne how on earth did you get into this a man like you you mean you dont know ill be honest mr dillon i knew you were coming but no more than that i was in vienna for a few days to sample a little opera im partial to mozart bumped into a man id had dealings with over the years in the bar during the first interval told me hed been approached by this organization who needed a little help but were short on money ah i see now branko nodded a good deed in a naughty world as shakespeare put it all those poor little children crying out for help the cruel serbs god help me major but you have a way with the words a sea change for a man like you i would have thought branko opened the file sean dillon born belfast went to live in london when you were a boy father a widower a student of the royal academy of dramatic art at eighteen even acted with the national theatre your father returned to belfast in and was killed by british paratroopers you are well informed you joined the provisional ira trained in libya courtesy of colonel qaddafi and never looked back branko turned a page you finally broke with the ira some disagreement as to strategy bunch of old women dillon reached across and helped himself to more krug beirut the plo even the kgb you really do believe in spreading your services around branko laughed suddenly in a kind of amazement the underwater attack on those two palestinian gunboats in beirut in you were responsible for that but that was for the israelis i charge very reasonable rates dillon said fluent german spanish and french oh and irish we mustnt forget that reasonable arabic italian and russian branko closed the file is it true you were responsible for the mortar attack on no downing street during the gulf war when the british prime minister john major was meeting with the war cabinet now do i look as if id do a thing like that branko leaned back and looked at him seriously how do you see yourself my friend gun for hire like one of those old westerns riding into town to clean things up singlehanded to be honest major i never think about it and yet you took on a job like this present affair for a bunch of wellmeaning amateurs and for no pay we all make mistakes you certainly did my friend those boxes on the plane morphine ampoules on top stinger missiles underneath jesus dillon laughed helplessly now who would have thought it they say you have a genius for acting that you can change yourself totally become another person with a look a gesture no i think that was laurence olivier dillon smiled and in twenty years youve never seen the inside of a cell true not any longer my friend branko opened a drawer took out a twohundred pack of rothmans cigarettes and tossed them across youre going to need those he glanced at zekan and said in serbocroatian take him to his cell dillon felt the sergeants hand on his shoulder pulling him up and propelling him to the door as zekan opened it branko said one more thing mr dillon the firing squad operates most mornings here try not to let it put you off ah yes dillon said ethnic cleansing isnt that what you call it the reason is much simpler than that we just get short of space sleep well they went up a flight of stone steps zekan pushing dillon ahead of him he pulled him to a halt outside an oak door on the passageway at the top took out a key and unlocked it he inclined his head and stood to one side and dillon entered the room was quite large there was an army cot in one corner a table and chair books on a shelf and incredibly an old toilet and in a cubicle in one corner dillon went to the window and peered through bars to the courtyard eighty feet below and the pine forest in the near distance he turned this must be one of your better rooms whats the catch then realized he was wasting his time for the sergeant had no english as if perfectly understanding him zekan smiled showing bad teeth took dillons silver case and zippo lighter from a pocket and laid them carefully on the table he withdrew closing the door and the key rattled in the lock dillon went to the window and tried the bars but they seemed firm too far down anyway he opened one of the packs of rothmans and lit one one thing was certain branko was being excessively kind and there had to be a reason for that he went and lay on the bed smoking his cigarette staring up at the ceiling and thinking about it in aware of the growing problem of terrorism and its effect on so many aspects of life at both political and national level the british prime minister of the day ordered the setting up of a small elite intelligence unit known simply by the code name group four it was to handle all matters concerning terrorism and subversion in the british isles known rather bitterly in more conventional intelligence circles as the prime ministers private army it owed allegiance to that office alone brigadier charles ferguson had headed group four since its inception had served a number of prime ministers both conservative and labour and had no political allegiance whatsoever he had an office on the third floor of the ministry of defence overlooking horse guards avenue and was still working at his desk at nine oclock that night when there was a knock at the door come in ferguson said stood up and walked to the window a large rather untidylooking man with a double chin and untidy gray hair who wore a baggy suit and a guards tie as he peered out at the rain toward victoria embankment and the thames the door opened behind him the man who entered was in his late thirties wore a tweed suit and glasses he could have been a clerk or even a schoolmaster but detective inspector jack lane was neither of these things he was a cop not an ordinary one but a cop all the same and after some negotiating ferguson had succeeded in borrowing him from special branch at scotland yard to act as his personal assistant got something for me jack fergusons voice was ever so slightly plummy mainly routine brigadier the word is that the director general of the security services is still unhappy at the prime ministers refusal to do away with group fours special status good god dont they ever give up those people ive agreed to keep them informed on a needtoknow basis and to liaise with simon carter the deputy director and that damned mp the one with the fancy title extra minister at the home office sir francis pamer sir yes well thats all the cooperation theyre going to get out of me anything else lane smiled actually ive saved the best bit till last dillon sean dillon ferguson turned what about him had a signal from our contacts in yugoslavia dillon crashed in a light plane this morning supposedly flying in medical supplies only they turned out to be stinger missiles theyre holding him in that castle at kivo its all here he passed a sheet of paper across and ferguson put on halfmoon spectacles and studied it he nodded in satisfaction twenty years and the bastard never saw the inside of a prison cell well hes in one now sir ive got his record here if you want to look at it and why would i want to do that no use to anyone now you know what the serbs are like jack might as well stick it in the deadletter file oh you can go home now good night sir lane went out and ferguson crossed to his drinks cabinet and poured a large scotch heres to you dillon he said softly and you can chew on that you bastard he swallowed the whisky down returned to his desk and started to work again east of puerto rico in the caribbean are the virgin islands partly british like tortola and virgin gorda across the water are st croix st thomas and st john proudly american since when the united states purchased them from the danish government for twentyfive million dollars st john is reputed to have been discovered by columbus on his second voyage to the new world in and without a doubt is probably the most idyllic island in the entire caribbean but not that night as a tropical storm the tail end of hurricane able swept in across the old town of cruz bay stirring the boats at anchor in the harbor driving rain across the roof tops the sky exploding into thunder to bob carney fast asleep in the house at chocolate hole on the other side of great cruz bay it was the sound of distant guns he stirred in his sleep and suddenly it was the same old dream the mortars landing everywhere shaking the ground the screams of the wounded and dying hed lost his helmet flung himself to the ground arms protecting his head was not even aware of being hit only afterwards as the attack faded and he sat up there was pain then in both arms and legs from shrapnel wounds blood on his hands and then as the smoke cleared he became aware of another marine sitting against a tree both legs gone above the knees he was shaking had a hand outstretched as if begging for help and carney cried out in horror and sat bolt upright in bed awake now the same lousy old dream vietnam and that was a long time ago he switched on the bedside lamp and checked his watch it was only twothirty he sighed and stood up stretching for a moment then padded through the dark house to the kitchen switched on the light and got a beer from the icebox he was very tanned the blond hair faded both from regular exposure to sea and sun around five foot eight he had an athletes body not surprising in a man who had been a ships captain and was now a master diver by profession fortyfour years of age but most people would have taken seven or eight years off that he went through the living room and opened a window to the veranda rain dripped from the roof and out to sea lightning crackled he drank a little more of his beer then put the can down and closed the window better to try and get a little more sleep he was taking a party of recreational scuba divers out from caneel bay at ninethirty which meant that as usual he needed his wits about him plus all his considerable expertise as he went through the living room he paused to pick up a framed photo of his wife karye and his two young children the boy walker and his daughter little wallis theyd departed for florida only the previous day for a vacation with their grandparents which left him a bachelor for the next month he smiled wryly knowing just how much hed miss them and went back to bed at the same moment in his house on the edge of cruz bay at gallows point henry baker sat in his study reading in the light of a single desk lamp he had the door to the veranda open because he liked the rain and the smell of the sea it excited him took him back to the days of his youth and his two years service in the navy during the korean war hed made full lieutenant had even been decorated with the bronze star could have made a career of it in fact theyd wanted him to but there was the family publishing business to consider responsibilities and the girl hed promised to marry it hadnt been a bad life considering no children but he and his wife had been content until cancer took her at fifty from then on hed really lost interest in the business had been happy to accept the right kind of deal for a takeover which had left him very rich and totally rootless at fiftyeight it was a visit to st john which had been the saving of him hed stayed at caneel bay the fabulous rock resort on its private peninsula north of cruz bay it was there that hed been introduced to scuba diving by bob carney and it had become an obsession hed sold his house in the hamptons moved to st john and bought the present place his life at sixtythree was totally satisfactory and worthwhile although jenny had had something to do with that as well he reached for her photo jenny grant twentyfive face very calm wide eyes above high cheekbones short dark hair and there was still a wariness in those eyes as if she expected the worst which was hardly surprising when baker recalled their first meeting in miami when shed tried to proposition him in a car park her body shaking from the lack of the drugs shed needed when shed collapsed hed taken her to the hospital himself had personally guaranteed the necessary financing to put her through a drug rehabilitation unit had held her hand all the way because there was no one else it was the usual story she was an orphan raised by an aunt whod thrown her out at sixteen a fair voice had enabled her to make some kind of living singing in saloons and cocktail lounges and then the wrong man bad company and the slide had begun hed brought her back to st john to see what the sea and sun could do the arrangement had worked perfectly and on a strictly platonic basis he was the father she had never known she was the daughter he had been denied hed invested in a cafe and bar for her on the cruz bay waterfront called jennys place it had proved a great success life couldnt be better and he always waited up for her it was at that moment he heard the jeep drive up outside there was the sound of the porch door and she came in laughing a raincoat over her shoulder she threw it on a chair and leaned down and kissed his cheek my god its like a monsoon out there itll clear by morning youll see he took her hand good night very she nodded a few tourists in from caneel and the hyatt gosh but im bushed id get to bed if i were you its almost three oclock sure you dont mind of course not i may go diving in the morning but i should be back before noon if i miss you ill come down to the cafe for lunch i wish you wouldnt dive on your own jenny im a recreational diver no decompression needed because i work within the limits exactly as bob carney taught me and i never dive without my marathon diving computer you know that i also know that whenever you dive theres always a chance of some kind of decompression sickness true but very small he squeezed her hand now stop worrying and go to bed she kissed him on the top of his head and went out he returned to his book carrying it across to the couch by the window stretching out comfortably he didnt seem to need so much sleep these days one of the penalties of growing old he imagined but after a while his eyes started to close and sleep he did the book sliding to the floor he came awake with a start light beaming in through the venetian blinds he lay there for a moment then checked his watch it was a little after five and he got up and went out on to the veranda it was already dawn light breaking on the horizon but strangely still and the sea was extraordinarily calm something to do with the hurricane having passed perfect for diving absolutely perfect he felt cheerful and excited at the same time hurried into the kitchen put the kettle on and made a stack of cheese sandwiches while it boiled he filled a thermos with coffee put it in a holdall with the sandwiches and took his old reefer coat down from behind the door he left the jeep for jenny and walked down to the harbor it was still very quiet not too many people about a dog barking in the distance he dropped into his inflatable dinghy at the dock cast off and started the outboard motor threaded his way out through numerous boats until he came to his own the rhoda named after his wife a thirtyfivefoot sport fisherman with a flying bridge he scrambled aboard tying the inflatable on a long line and checked the deck he had four air tanks standing upright in their holders hed put them in the day before himself he opened the lid of the deck locker and checked his equipment there was a rubber and nylon diving suit which he seldom used preferring the lighter threequarterlength one in orange and blue fins mask plus a spare because the lenses were correctional according to his eye prescription two buoyancy jackets gloves air regulators and his marathon computer carney training he said softly never leave anything to chance he went round to the prow and unhitched from the buoy then went up the ladder to the flying bridge and started the engines they roared into life and he took the rhoda out of harbor toward the open sea with conscious pleasure there were all his favorite dives to choose from the cow amp calf carval rock congo or there was eagle shoal if he wanted a longer trip hed confronted a lemon shark there only the previous week but the sea was so calm he just headed straight out there was always frenchmans cap to the south and west and maybe eight or nine miles a great dive but he just kept going heading due south pushing the rhoda up to fifteen knots pouring himself some coffee and breaking out the sandwiches the sun was up now the sea the most perfect blue the peaks of the islands all around a breathtakingly beautiful sight nothing could be better my god he said softly its a damn privilege to be here what in hell was i doing with my life all those years he lapsed into a kind of reverie brooding about things and it was a good thirty minutes later that he suddenly snapped out of it and checked on his position christ he said i must be twelve miles out which was close to the edge of things and that awesome place where everything simply dropped away and it was two thousand feet to the bottom except for thunder point and that he knew was somewhere close but no one ever dived there the most dangerous reef in the entire region even carney didnt dive there strong currents a nightmare world of fissures and channels carney had told him that years before an old diver had described it to him a hundred and eighty feet on one side then the ridge of the reef at around seventy and two thousand feet on the other the old boy had hit bad trouble had only just made it to the surface had never tried again few people even knew where it was anyway and the sea out there was generally so turbulent that that in itself was enough to keep anyone away but not today it was a millpond baker had never seen anything like it a sudden excitement surged in him and he switched on his fathometer seeking the bottom throttling back the engines and then he saw it the yellow ridged lines on the black screen he killed the engine and drifted checking the depth reading until he was certain he was above the ridge of the reef at seventy feet then scrambled round to the prow and dropped the anchor after a while he felt it bite satisfactorily and worked his way round to the deck he felt incredibly cheerful as he stripped pulled on the orange and blue nylon diving suit then quickly assembled his gear clamping a tank to his inflatable he strapped the computer to the line of his air pressure gauge then eased himself into the jacket taking the weight of the tank strapping the velcro wrappers firmly across his waist and hooking a net diving bag to his weight belt as he always did with a spotlight inside in case he came across anything interesting he pulled on a pair of diving gloves then sat with his feet on the platform at the stern and pulled on his fins he spat on his mask rinsed it adjusted it to his face then simply stood up and stepped into the water it was incredibly clear and blue he swam round to the anchor rope paused then started down following the line the sensation of floating in space was as always amazing a silent private world sunlight at first but fading as he descended the reef where the anchor was hooked was a forest of coral and sea grass fish of every conceivable description and suddenly a barracuda that was at least five feet long swerved across his vision and paused turning toward him threateningly which didnt bother baker in the slightest because barracuda were seldom a threat to anyone he checked his dive computer it not only indicated the depth he was at but told him how long he was safe there and constantly altered its reading according to any change in depth he made during the dive he was at this point at seventy feet and he turned and headed over to the lefthand side where the reef slid down to a hundred and eighty he went over the edge then changed his mind and went up again it was amazing how much an extra ten or fifteen feet reduced your bottom time there was a reasonably strong current he could feel it pushing him to one side he imagined what it must be like when conditions were bad but he was damned if that was going to stop him having a look at the big drop the edge of the reef over there was very clearly defined he paused holding on to a coral head and peered over looking down the cliff face into a great blue vault that stretched into infinity he went over descended to eighty feet and started to work his way along it was interesting he noted a considerable amount of coral damage large sections having obviously been torn away recently presumably the result of the hurricane although they were on a fault line here and earth tremors were also common some distance ahead there was a very obvious section where what looked like an entire overhang had gone revealing a wide ledge below and there was something there perched on the ledge yet part of it hanging over baker paused for a moment then approached cautiously it was then that he received not only the greatest thrill of his diving career but the greatest shock of a long life the object which was pressed on the ledge and partly sticking out over two thousand feet of water was a submarine during his naval service baker had done a training course in a submarine when based in the philippines no big deal just part of general training but he remembered the lectures the training films theyd had to watch mainly second world war stuff and he recognized what he was looking at instantly it was a type vii uboat by far the most common craft of its kind used by the german kriegsmarine the configuration was unmistakable the conning tower was encrusted with marine growth but when he approached he could still discern the number on the side the attack and control room periscopes were still intact and there was a snorkel he recalled having heard that the germans had gradually introduced that as the war progressed a device that enabled the boat to proceed under water much faster because it was able to use the power of its diesel engines approximately twothirds of it rested stern first on the ledge and the prow jutted out into space he glanced up aware of a school of horseeyed jacks overhead mixed with silversides then descended to the top of the conning tower and hung on to the bridge rail aft was the high gun platform with its mm cannon and forward and below him was the deck gun encrusted as was most of the surface with sponge and coral of many colors the boat had become a habitat as with all wrecks fish everywhere yellowtail snappers angel and parrot fish and sergeantmajors and many others he checked his computer on the bridge he was at a depth of seventyfive feet and he had only twenty minutes at the most before the need to surface he drifted away a little distance to look the uboat over obviously the overhang which had recently been dislodged had provided a kind of canopy for the wreck for years protecting it from view and at a site which was seldom visited it had been enough that uboats had worked the area during the second world war was common knowledge hed known one old sailor whod always insisted that crews would come ashore on st john by night in search of fresh fruit and water although baker had always found that one hard to swallow he swung over to the starboard side and saw what the trouble had been instantly a large ragged gash about fifteen feet long in the hull below the conning tower the poor bastards must have gone down like a stone he descended holding on to a jagged coralencrusted edge and peered into the control room it was dark and gloomy in there silverfish in clouds and he got the spotlight from his dive bag and shone it inside the periscope shafts were clearly visible again encrusted like everything else but the rest was a confusion of twisted metal wires and pipes he checked his computer saw that he had fifteen minutes hesitated then went inside both the aft and forward watertight doors were closed but that was standard practice when things got bad he tried the unlocking wheel on the forward hatch but it was immovable and hopelessly corroded there were some oxygen bottles even a belt of some kind of ammunition and the most pathetic thing of all a few human bones in the sediment of the floor amazing that there was any trace at all after so many years suddenly he felt cold it was as if he was an intruder who shouldnt be here he turned to go and his light picked out a handle in the corner very like a suitcase handle he reached for it the sediment stirred and he found himself clutching a small briefcase in some kind of metal encrusted like everything else it was enough and he went out through the gash in the hull drifted up over the edge of the reef and went for the anchor he made it with five minutes to spare stupid bastard he told himself taking such a chance and he ascended just by the book one foot per second one hand sliding up the line the briefcase in the other leaving the line at twenty feet to swim under the boat and surface at the stern he pushed the briefcase on board then wriggled out of his equipment which was always the worst part youre getting old henry he told himself as he scrambled up the ladder and turned to heave his buoyancy jacket and tank on board he schooled himself to do everything as normal stowing away the tank and the equipment following his usual routine he toweled himself dry changed into jeans and a fresh denim shirt all the time ignoring the briefcase he opened his thermos and poured some coffee then went and sat in one of the swivel chairs in the stern drinking and staring at the briefcase encrusted with coral the encrusting was superficial more than anything else he got a wire brush from his tool kit and applied it vigorously and realized at once that the case was made of aluminium as the surface cleared the eagle and swastika of the german kriegsmarine was revealed etched into the top righthand corner it was secured by two clips and there was a lock the clips came up easily enough but the lid remained obstinately down obviously locked which left him little choice he found a large screwdriver forced it in just above the lock and was able to prize open the lid within a few moments the inside was totally dry the contents a few photos and several letters bound together by a rubber band there was also a large diary in red moroccan leather stamped with a kriegsmarine insignia in gold the photos were of a young woman and two little girls there was a date on the back of one of them at the start of a handwritten paragraph in german august the rest made no sense to him as he didnt speak the language there was also a faded snap of a man in kriegsmarine uniform he looked about thirty and wore a number of medals including the knights cross at his throat someone special a real ace from the look of him the diary was also in german the first entry was april and he recognized the name bergen knew that was a port in norway on the flyleaf was an entry he did understand korvettenkapitän paul friemel u obviously the captain and owner of this diary baker flicked through the pages totally frustrated at being unable to decipher any of it there were some twentyseven entries sometimes a page for each day sometimes more on some occasions there was a notation to indicate position and he had little difficulty in seeing from those entries that the voyage had taken the submarine into the atlantic and south to the caribbean the strange thing was the fact that the final entry was dated may and that didnt make too much sense henry baker had been sixteen years of age when the war in europe had ended and he recalled the events of those days with surprising clarity the russians had reached berlin and reduced it to hell on earth and adolf hitler holed up in the führer bunker at the reich chancellery had committed suicide on may the st at pm along with his wife of a few hours only eva braun that was the effective end of the third reich and capitulation had soon followed if that were so what in the hell was u doing in the virgin islands with a final log entry dated may if only he could speak german and the further frustrating thing was that he didnt know a soul in st john who did on the other hand if he did would he want to share such a secret one thing was certain if news of the submarine and its whereabouts got out the place would be invaded within days he flicked through the pages again paused suddenly and turned back a page a name jumped out at him reichsleiter martin bormann bakers excitement was intense martin bormann head of the nazi party chancellery and secretary to the führer had he escaped from the bunker at the end or had he died trying to escape from berlin how many books had been written about that he turned the page idly and another name came out at him the duke of windsor baker sat staring at the page his throat dry and then he very carefully closed the diary and put it back in the case with the letter and photos he closed the lid put the case in the wheelhouse and started the engines then he went and hauled in the anchor whatever it was it was heavy had to be he had a uboat that had gone down in the virgin islands three weeks after the end of the war in europe a private diary kept by the captain which mentioned the most powerful man in nazi germany after hitler and the duke of windsor my god what have i got into he murmured he could go to the authorities of course the coast guard for example but it had been his find that was the trouble and he was reluctant to relinquish that but what in the hell to do next and then it came to him and he laughed out loud garth travers of course and he pushed up to full throttle and hurried back to st john in as a lieutenant in the us navy baker had been assigned as liaison officer to the british royal navy destroyer persephone which was when he had first met garth travers a gunnery officer travers was on the fast track had taken a degree in history at oxford university and the two young officers had made a firm friendship cemented by five hours in the water one dark night off the korean coast which theyd spent hanging on to each other after a landing craft on which theyd been making a night drop with royal marine commandos had hit a mine and travers had gone on to great things had retired a rear admiral since then hed written several books on naval aspects of the second world war had translated a standard work on the kriegsmarine from the german which bakers publishing house had published in the last year hed been in the business travers was the man no doubt about it he was close inshore to st john now and saw another sport fisherman bearing down on him and he recognized the sea raider bob carneys boat it slowed turning toward him and baker slowed too there were four people in the stern dressed for diving three women and a man bob carney was on the flying bridge morning henry he called out early where you been french cap baker didnt like lying to a friend but had no choice conditions good excellent millpond out there fine carney smiled and waved take care henry the sea raider moved away and baker pushed up to full power and headed for cruz bay when he reached the house he knew at once that jenny wasnt there because the jeep had gone he checked his watch ten oclock something must have come up to take her out he went into the kitchen got a beer from the icebox and went to his study carrying the briefcase in one hand he placed it on the desk pulled his phone file across and leafed through it onehanded while he drank the beer he found what he was looking for soon enough and checked his watch again ten after ten which meant ten after three in the afternoon in london he picked up the telephone and dialed in london it was raining drumming against the windows of the house in lord north street where rear admiral garth travers sat in a chair by the fire in his booklined study enjoying a cup of tea and reading the times when the phone rang he made a face but got up and went to the desk who am i talking to garth its henry henry baker travers sat down behind the desk good god henry you old sod are you in london no im calling from st john sounds as if youre in the next room garth ive got a problem i thought you might be able to help ive found a uboat youve what an honesttogod uboat out here in the virgins on a reef about eighty feet down oneeighty was the number on the conning tower its a type seven travers own excitement was extreme im not going to ask you if youve been drinking but why on earth has no one discovered it before garth there are hundreds of wrecks in these waters we dont know the half of it this is in a bad place very dangerous no one goes there its half on a ledge which was protected by an overhang or i miss my guess theres a lot of fresh damage to the cliff face weve just had a hurricane so what condition is she in there was a gash in the hull and i managed to get in the control room i found a briefcase in there a watertight job in aluminium with a kriegsmarine insignia engraved in the top righthand corner thats right standard issue fireproof and waterproof all that sort of thing what did you say the number was oneeighty hang on a minute and ill look it up ive got a book on one of my shelves that lists every uboat commissioned by the kriegsmarine during the war and what happened to them okay baker waited patiently until travers returned weve got a problem old son youre certain this was a type seven absolutely well the problem is that oneeighty was a type nine dispatched to japan from france in august fortyfour with technical supplies she went down in the bay of biscay is that so baker said well how does this grab you i found the personal diary of a korvettenkapitän paul friemel in that briefcase and the final entry is dated may twentyeighth nineteen fortyfive but ve day in europe was may the eighth travers said exactly so what have we got here a german submarine with a false number that goes down in the virgins three weeks after the end of the bloody war it certainly is intriguing travers said you havent heard the best bit old buddy remember all those stories about martin bormann having escaped from berlin of course i do well i cant read german but i sure can read his name and its right here in the diary and another little bombshell for you so is the duke of windsors travers loosened his tie and took a deep breath henry old son i must see that diary yes thats what i thought baker said theres the british airways overnight flight leaving antigua around eight this evening our time i should be able to make it last time i used it we got into london gatwick at nine oclock in the morning maybe you could give me a late breakfast ill be looking forward to that travers said and replaced the receiver the professional association of diving instructors of which henry was a certificated member has strict regulations about flying after diving he checked his book of rules and discovered that he should wait at least four hours after a single nodecompression dive at eighty feet that gave him plenty of leeway especially if he didnt fly down to antigua until the afternoon which was exactly what he intended first he rang british airways in san juan yes they had space in the firstclass cabin on ba flight leaving antigua at hours he made the booking and gave them one of his gold card numbers next he rang carib aviation in antigua an airtaxi firm hed used before yes they were happy to accept the charter theyd send up one of their partenavias early afternoon to st thomas if they left for the return trip to antigua at fourthirty theyd be there by six at the latest he sat back thinking about it hed book a water taxi across to charlotte amalie the main town on st thomas forty minutes thats all it would take fifteen at the most by taxi to the airport plenty of time to pack and get himself ready but first he had to see jenny the waterfront was bustling when he walked down into cruz bay this time it was a picturesque little town totally charming and ever so slightly rundown in the way of most caribbean ports baker had fallen in love with the place the first time hed seen it it was everything youd hope for he used to joke that all it needed was humphrey bogart in a sailors cap and denims running a boat from the harbor on mysterious missions jennys place was slightly back from the road just before mongoose junction there were steps up to the veranda a neon sign above the door inside it was cool and shaded two large fans revolving in the low ceiling there were several booths against the walls a scattering of marbletopped tables across a floor of black and white tiles there were high stools at the long mahogany bar bottles on glass shelves against the mirrored wall behind a large handsome black man with graying hair was polishing glasses billy jones the barman he had the scar tissue around the eyes and the slightly flattened nose of a professional fighter his wife mary was manager he grinned hi there mr henry you looking for jenny thats right went down the front with mary to choose the fish for tonight they shouldnt be too long can i get you something just a coffee billy ill have it outside he sat in a cane chair on the veranda drinking the coffee and thinking about things was so much within himself that he didnt notice the two women approach until the last minute youre back henry he looked up and found jenny and mary jones coming up the steps mary wished him good morning and went inside and jenny sat on the rail her figure very slim in teeshirt and blue jeans she frowned is something wrong ive got to go to london he told her to london when this afternoon her frown deepened and she came and sat beside him what is it henry something happened when i was diving this morning something extraordinary i found a wreck about eighty or ninety feet down you damn fool she was angry now diving at that kind of depth on your own and at your age where was this although not a serious diver she did go down occasionally and knew most of the sites he hesitated it was not only that he knew she would be thoroughly angry to know that hed dived a place like thunder point and it certainly wasnt that he didnt trust her he just wanted to keep the location of the submarine to himself for the moment certainly until hed seen garth travers all i can tell you jenny is that i found a german uboat from nineteen fortyfive her eyes widened my god i managed to get inside there was a briefcase an aluminum thing watertight i found the captains diary inside its in german which i cant read but there were a couple of names i recognized such as martin bormann and the duke of windsor she looked slightly dazed henry whats going on here thats what id like to know he took her hand remember that english friend of mine rear admiral travers the one you served in the korean war with of course you introduced me to him the year before last when we were in miami and he was passing through i phoned him earlier hes got all sorts of records on the german kriegsmarine he checked on the boat for me oneeighty thats whats painted on the conning tower but oneeighty was a different type boat and it went down in the bay of biscay in nineteen fortyfour she shook her head in bewilderment but what does it all mean there were stories for years about bormann dozens of books all saying he didnt die in berlin at the end of the war that he survived people had sightings of him in south america or so they said and the duke of windsor god knows he shook his head all i know is this could be important and i found the damn boat jenny me henry baker christ i dont know whats in the diary but maybe it changes history he got up and walked to the rail gripping it with both hands she had never seen him so excited got up herself and put a hand on his shoulder want me to come with you hell no theres no need for that billy and mary could run things here he shook his head ill be back in a few days four at the most fine she managed a smile then wed better get back to the house and ill help you pack his flight in the carib aviation partenavia was uneventful except for strong headwinds that held them back a little so that the landing was later than hed anticipated around sixthirty by the time hed passed through customs collected his luggage and proceeded to the british airways desk it was seven oclock he went through security into the departure lounge and the flight was called ten minutes later the service in british airways first class was as superb as usual he had carried korvettenkapitän friemels case through with him and he accepted a glass of champagne from the stewardess opened the case and browsed through it for a while not just the diary but the photos and the letters strange because he didnt understand a word it was the photo of the kriegsmarine officer that really intrigued him presumably friemel himself the face of the enemy only baker didnt feel like that but then seamen of all nations even in war tended to have a high regard for each other it was the sea after all which was the common enemy he closed the case and put it in the locker overhead when takeoff was announced and spent his time reading one or two of the london newspapers which were in plentiful supply the meal was served soon after takeoff and after it had been cleared away the stewardess reminded him that each seat had its own small video screen and offered him a brochure which included a lengthy list of videos available baker browsed through it it would at least help pass the time and then he shivered a little as if someone had passed over his grave there was a film there hed heard about a german film das boot in english the boat from all accounts a harrowing story of life in a uboat at the worst time in the war against his better judgment he ordered it and asked for a large scotch the cabin crew went round pulling down the window blinds so that those who wished to might sleep baker inserted the video put on the earphones and sat there in the semidarkness watching he called for another scotch after twenty minutes and kept watching it was one of the most disturbing films of its kind he had ever seen an hour was enough he switched off tilted his seat back and lay there staring through the darkness thinking about korvettenkapitän paul friemel and u and that final ending on thunder point wondering what had gone wrong after a while he slept it was ten oclock when the doorbell rang at the house in lord north street garth travers answered the door himself and found henry baker standing there in the rain the briefcase in one hand his overnight case in the other he had no raincoat and the collar of his jacket was turned up my dear chap travers said for gods sake come in before you drown he turned as he closed the door youll stay here of course if that suits old buddy its good to hear that description of me again travers told him ill show you to your room later lets get you some breakfast my housekeepers day off so youll get it navy style coffee would be fine for the moment baker said they went to the large comfortable kitchen and travers put the kettle on baker placed the briefcase on the table there it is fascinating travers examined the kriegsmarine insignia on the case then glanced up may i thats why im here travers opened the case he examined the letters quickly these must be keepsakes dated at various times in nineteen fortythree and four all from his wife from the looks of things he turned to the photos knights cross holder must have been quite a boy he looked at the photos of the woman and the two little girls and read the handwritten paragraph on the back of one of them oh dear what is it baker asked it reads my dear wife lottie and my daughters ilse and marie killed in a bombing raid on hamburg august the eighth nineteen fortyfour dear god baker said i can check up on him easily enough i have a book listing all holders of the knights cross it was the germans highest award for valor you make the coffee and ill get it travers went out and baker found cups a tin of instant milk in the icebox had just finished when travers returned with the book in question he sat down opposite baker and reached for his coffee here we are paul friemel korvettenkapitän joined the german navy as an officer cadet after two years studying medicine at heidelberg travers nodded outstanding record in uboats knights cross in july fortyfour for sinking an italian cruiser they were on our side by then of course after that he was assigned to shore duties at kiel he made a face oh dear mystery piles on mystery it says here he was killed in a bombing raid on kiel in april nineteen fortyfive like hell he was baker said exactly travers opened the diary and glanced at the first page beautiful handwriting and perfectly legible he riffled the pages some of the entries are quite short cant be more than thirty pages at the most your german is fluent as i recall baker said like a native old boy my maternal grandmother was from munich ill tell you what ill do an instant translation into my word processor should take no more than an hour and a half you get yourself some breakfast ham and eggs in the refrigerator sorry icebox to you bread bin over there join me in the study when youre ready he went out and baker relaxed now that everything was in hand busied himself making breakfast aware that he was hungry he sat at the table to eat it reading travers copy of that mornings london times while he did so it was perhaps an hour later that he cleared everything away and went into the study travers sat at the word processor watching the screen his fingers rippling over the keyboard the diary open and standing on a small lectern on his righthand side there was a curiously intent look on his face baker said cheerfully hows it going not now old boy please baker shrugged sat by the fire and picked up a magazine it was quiet only the sound of the word processor except when travers suddenly said my god and then a few minutes after that no i cant believe it for heavens sake what is it garth baker demanded in a minute old boy almost through baker sat there on tenterhooks and after a while travers sat back with a sigh finished ill run it through the copier does it have anything interesting to say interesting travers laughed harshly thats putting it mildly first of all i must make the point that it isnt the official ships log its essentially a private account of the peculiar circumstances surrounding his final voyage maybe he was trying to cover himself in some way who knows but its pretty sensational the thing is what are we going to do about it what on earth do you mean read it for yourself ill go and make some more coffee travers said as the copier stopped he shuffled the sheets together and handed them to baker who settled himself in the chair by the fire and started to read bergen norway april i paul friemel start this account more because of the strangeness of the task i am to perform than anything else we left kiel two days ago in this present boat designated u my command is in fact a craft that was damaged by bombing while under construction at kiel in nineteen fortythree we are to my certain knowledge carrying the number of a dead ship my orders from grand admiral doenitz are explicit my passenger will arrive this evening from berlin although i find this hard to swallow he will carry a direct order in the führers own hand i will learn our destination from him there was a gap here in the diary and then a further entry for the evening of the same day i received orders to proceed to the airstrip where a feiseler storch landed after a few minutes an officer in the uniform of an ss general appeared and asked if i was korvettenkapitän friemel he in no way identified himself although at that stage i felt that i had seen him before when we reached the dock he took me to one side before boarding and presented me with a sealed envelope when i opened it i found it contained the order from the führer himself which had been mentioned in grand admiral doenitzs personal order to me it ran as follows from the leader and chancellor of the state reichsleiter martin bormann acts with my authority on a matter of the utmost importance and essential to the continuance of the third reich you will place yourself under his direct authority at all times remembering your solemn oath as an officer of the kriegsmarine to your führer and will accept his command and authority as he sees fit and in all situations i recall now having seen bormann once at a state function in berlin in few people would recognize the man for of all our leaders i would conclude he is the least known he is smaller than i would have thought rough featured with overlong arms frankly if seen in working clothes one would imagine him a docker or laborer the reichsleiter enquired as to whether i accepted his authority which having little option i have agreed to do he instructed me that as regards my officers and the crew he was to be known as general strasser may although the officers area is the most spacious on board it only caters for three with one bunk lashed up i have taken this for myself and given the reichsleiter the commanding officers compartment on the port side and aft of what passes for a wardroom in this boat it is the one private place we have though only a felt curtain separates his quarters from the wardroom as we left bergen on the evening tide the reichsleiter joined me on the bridge and informed me that our destination was venezuela may as the boat has been fitted with a snorkel i am able to contemplate a voyage entirely underwater though i fear this may not be possible in the heavy weather of the north atlantic i have laid a course underwater by way of the icelandfaroes narrows and once we have broken into the atlantic will review the situation may have received by radio from bergen the astonishing news that the führer has died on the st of may fighting valiantly at the head of our forces in berlin in an attempt to deny the russians victory i conveyed the melancholy news to the reichsleiter who accepted it with what i thought to be astonishing calm he then instructed me to pass the news to the crew stressing that the war would continue an hour later we received word over the radio that grand admiral doenitz had set up a provisional government in schleswigholstein i doubt that it can last long with the russians in berlin and the americans and british across the rhine baker was more than fascinated by this time and quickly passed through several pages which at that stage were mainly concerned with the ships progress may we received an order from uboat command that all submarines at sea must observe a ceasefire from this morning at hours the order is to return to harbor i discussed this with the reichsleiter in his quarters who pointed out that he had the führers authority to continue still and asked me if i queried it i found this difficult to answer and he suggested that i consider the situation for a day or two may we received this evening by radio the message i have been expecting total capitulation to the enemy germany has gone down to defeat i again met with the reichsleiter in his quarters and while discussing the situation received a ciphered message from bergen instructing me to return or to continue the voyage as ordered the reichsleiter seized upon this and demanded my obedience insisting on his right to speak to the crew over the intercom he disclosed his identity and the matter of his authority from the führer he pointed out that there was nothing left for any of us in germany and that there were friends waiting in venezuela a new life for those who wanted it the possibility for a return to germany for those who wanted that it was difficult to argue with his reasoning and on the whole my crew and officers accepted it may continued south and this day received general signal from canadian navy in nova scotia to any uboat still at sea demanding we report exact situation surface and proceed under black flag failure to do so apparently condemning us to be considered as pirate and liable to immediate attack the reichsleiter showed little concern at this news may the snorkel device is in essence an air pipe raised above the surface when we run at periscope depth in this way we may run on our diesel engines underwater without using up our batteries i have discovered considerable problems with the device for if the sea is rough and nothing is rougher than the atlantic the ball cock closes when this happens the engines still draw in air which means an instant fall in pressure in the boat and this gives the crew huge problems we have had three cases of ruptured eardrums but proceeding with the aid of the snorkel does make it difficult for us to be detected from the air may so far into the atlantic are we now that i feel our risk of detection from the air to be minimal and decided from today to proceed on the surface we carve through the atlantics heavy seas continually awash and our chances of encountering anyone in these latitudes are slim may the reichsleiter has kept himself to himself for much of the trip except for eating with the officers preferring to remain on his bunk and read today he asked if he could accompany me when i was taking my watch he arrived on the bridge in foul weather gear when we were barreling through fifteen and twentyfoot waves and thoroughly enjoyed the experience may an extraordinary night for me the reichsleiter appeared at dinner obviously the worse for drink later he invited me to his quarters where he produced a bottle of scotch whisky from one of his cases and insisted i join him he drank freely talking a great deal about the führer and the final days in the bunker in berlin when i asked him how he had escaped he told me they had used the eastwest avenue in the center of berlin as a runway for light aircraft at this stage he had finished the whisky pulled out one of his duffel bags from under the bunk and opened it he took out an aluminium kriegsmarine captains briefcase like my own and put it on the bunk then found a fresh bottle of whisky by now he was very drunk and told me of his last meeting with the führer who had charged him with a sacred duty to continue the future of the third reich he said an organization called the odessa line had been set up years before by the ss to provide an escape line in the event of temporary defeat for those officers of ss and other units essential to the continuance of the struggle then he moved on to the kamaradenwerk action for comrades an organization set up to continue national socialist ideas after the war there were hundreds of millions salted away in switzerland south america and other places and friends in every country at the highest level of government he took his aluminium case from the bunk opened it and produced a file he called it the blue book he said it listed many members of the english aristocracy many members of the english parliament who had secretly supported the führer during the nineteenthirties and also many americans he then took a paper from a buff envelope and unfolded it before me he told me it was the windsor protocol a secret agreement with the führer signed by the duke of windsor while resident at estoril in portugal in after the fall of france in it he agreed to ascend the throne of england again after a successful german invasion i asked him what value such a document could be and how could he be sure it was genuine he became extremely angry and told me that in any event there were those on his blue book list who would do anything to avoid exposure and that his own future was taken care of i asked him at that point if he was certain and he laughed and said you could always trust an english gentleman at this point he became so drunk that i had to assist him on to the bunk he fell asleep instantly and i examined the contents of the briefcase the names in his blue book list meant nothing to me but the windsor protocol looked genuine enough the only other thing in the briefcase was a list of numbered bank accounts and the führer order and i closed it and placed it under the bunk with his other luggage baker stopped at this point put the diary down got up and walked to the window as garth travers entered travers said heres the coffee thought id leave you to get on with it have you finished just read what bormann told him on the twentyfirst of may the best is yet to come old boy ill be back and travers went out again may miles north of puerto rico i envisage using the anegada passage through the leeward islands into the caribbean sea with a clear run to the venezuelan coast from there may the reichsleiter called me to his quarters and informed me that it was necessary to make a stop before reaching our destination and requested to see the chart for the virgin islands the island he indicated is a small one samson cay southeast of st john in the american virgin islands but in british sovereign waters being a few miles south of norman island in the british virgin islands he gave me no indication of his reason for wishing to stop there may surfaced off the coast of samson cay at hours a dark night with a quarter moon some lights observed on shore the reichsleiter requested that he be put ashore in one of the inflatables and i arranged for petty officer schroeder to take him before leaving he called me to his quarters and told me that he was expecting to meet friends on shore but as a precaution against something going wrong he was not taking anything of importance with him he particularly indicated the briefcase which he left on the bunk and gave me a sealed envelope which he said would give me details of my destination in venezuela if anything went wrong and the name of the man i was to hand the briefcase to he told me to send schroeder back for him at hours and that if he was not on the beach i was to fear the worst and depart he wore civilian clothes and left his uniform travers came back in at that moment still at it im on the final entry the admiral went to the drinks cabinet and poured scotch into two glasses drink that he said passing one to baker youre going to need it may midnight i have just been on the bridge and noticed an incredible stillness to everything quite unnatural and like nothing i have experienced before lightning on the far horizon and distant thunder the waters here in the lagoon are shallow and give me concern i write this at the chart table while waiting for the radio officer to check for weather reports there was a gap here and then a couple of lines scrawled hurriedly radio report from st thomas indicates hurricane approaching fast we must make for deep water and go down to ride it out the reichsleiter must take his chance only the poor buggers didnt ride it out travers said the hurricane caught them when they were still vulnerable must have ripped her side open on the reef where you found her im afraid so baker said then i presume the current must have driven her in on that ledge under the overhang where she remained all these years strange no one ever discovered her before not really baker said its a bad place no one goes there its too far out for people who dive for fun and its very dangerous another thing if the recent hurricane hadnt broken away the overhang i might well have missed it myself you havent actually given me the location yet travers remonstrated yes well thats my business baker said travers smiled i understand old boy i understand but i really must point out that this is a very hot potato what on earth are you getting at number one wed appear to have positive proof after all the rumor and speculation for nearly fifty years that martin bormann escaped from berlin so baker said more than that theres the blue book list of hitlers sympathizers here in england not only the nobility but members of parliament plus the names of a few of your fellow countrymen worse than that this windsor protocol what do you mean baker asked according to the diary bormann kept them in a similar survival case to this he tapped the aluminium briefcase and he left it on the bunk in the commanding officers quarters now just consider this according to friemels final entry he was in the control room at the chart table entering the diary when he got that final radio report about the hurricane he shoves the diary in his briefcase and locks it only a second to do that then gets on with the emergency that would explain why you found the briefcase in the control room ill buy that baker agreed no youre missing the real point which is that the case survived so what are you getting at these things were built for survival which means its almost certain bormanns is still in the commanding officers quarters with the blue book the windsor protocol and hitlers personal order concerning bormann even after all these years the facts contained in those documents would cause a hell of a stink henry especially the windsor thing i wouldnt want to cause that kind of trouble baker told him i believe you i know you well enough for that but what if someone else found that submarine i told you no one goes there you also told me you thought an overhang had been torn off revealing it i mean somebody could dive there henry just like you did the conditions were unusually calm baker said its a bad place garth no one goes there i know believe me another thing the commanding officers compartment is forward and aft of the wardroom on the port side thats what friemel said in the diary thats right i was shown over a type vii uboat the navy had one or two they took over after the war the captains cabin socalled is across from the radio and sound rooms quick access to the control room that was the point yes well my point is that you cant get in there the forward watertight hatch is closed fast well youd expect that if they were in trouble hed have ordered every watertight hatch in the boat closed standard procedure i tried to move the wheel corroded like hell the door is solid no way of getting in there theres always a way henry you know that travers sat there frowning for a moment then said look id like to show the diary to a friend of mine who are we talking about brigadier charles ferguson weve known each other for years he might have some ideas what makes him so special he works on the intelligence side of things runs a highly specialized antiterrorist unit responsible only to the prime minister and thats privileged information by the way i wouldnt have thought this was exactly his field baker said just let me show him the diary old boy travers said soothingly see what he thinks okay baker said but the location stays my little secret of course you can come with me if you want no i think ill have a bath and maybe go for a walk i always feel like hell after a long jet flight i could see this brigadier ferguson later if you think it necessary just as you like travers said ill leave you to it you know where everything is baker went out and travers looked up fergusons personal phone number at the ministry of defence and was speaking to him at once charles garth travers here my dear old boy havent seen you in ages travers came directly to the point i think you should see me at your soonest moment charles a rather astonishing document has come into my hands ferguson remained as urbane as ever really well we must do something about that youve been to my flat in cavendish square of course i have ill see you there in thirty minutes ferguson sat on the sofa beside the fireplace in his elegant drawing room and travers sat opposite the door opened and fergusons manservant kim an exghurka corporal entered immaculate in snowwhite jacket and served tea he withdrew silently and ferguson reached for his cup of tea and continued reading finally he put the cup down and leaned back quite bizarre isnt it you believe it then the diary good god yes i mean you obviously vouch for your friend baker he isnt a hoaxer or anything certainly not we were lieutenants together in korea saved my life he was chairman of a highly respected publishing house in new york until a few years ago hes also a multimillionaire and he wont tell you the location oh thats understandable enough hes like a boy again hes made this astonishing discovery travers smiled hell tell us eventually so what do you think i know its not really in your line but thats where youre wrong garth i think its very much in my line because i work for the prime minister and i think he should see this there is one point travers said if bormann landed on this samson cay place there had to be a reason i mean who in the hell was he meeting perhaps he was to be picked up by somebody a fast boat and a passage by night you know the sort of thing i mean he probably left the briefcase on board as a precaution until he knew everything was all right but we can find out easily enough ill get my assistant detective inspector lane on to it regular bloodhound he slipped the papers comprising the diary back into their envelope give me a moment im going to send my driver round with this to downing street eyes of the prime minister only then ill see how soon he can see us ill be back he went out to his study and travers poured another cup of tea it was cold and he walked restlessly across to the window and looked outside it was still raining a thoroughly miserable day as he turned ferguson came back cant see us until two oclock but i spoke to him personally and hes going to have a quick look when the package arrives you and i old son are going to have an early luncheon at the garrick ive told lane well be there in case he gets a quick result on samson cay umbrella weather travers said how i loathe it large gin and tonic will work wonders old boy ferguson ushered him out they had steak and kidney pie at the garrick sitting opposite each other at the long table in the dining room and coffee in the bar afterwards which was where jack lane found them ah there you are jack got anything for me ferguson demanded nothing very exciting sir samson cay is owned by an american hotel group called samson holdings they have hotels in las vegas los angeles and three in florida but samson cay would appear to be their flagship ive got you a brochure strictly a millionaires hideaway he passed it across and they examined it there were the usual pictures of white beaches palm trees cottages in an idyllic setting garden of eden according to this ferguson said they even have a landing strip for light aircraft i see and a casino sir cant be too big as casinos go travers pointed out they only cater for a hundred people isnt the numbers that count old boy ferguson said its the amount of cash across the table what about during the war jack there was always a hotel of some sort in those days it was owned by an american family called herbert who were also in the hotel business remember samson cay is in the british virgin islands which means it comes under the control of tortola as regards the law customs and so forth i spoke to their public record office according to their files the hotel stayed empty during the war the occasional fishermen from tortola a couple caretaking the property and thats all doesnt help but thanks jack youve done a good job it might help if i knew what it was about sir later jack later off you go and make britain a safer place to live in lane departed with a grin and ferguson turned to travers right old boy downing street awaits the prime minister was sitting behind his desk in his study when an aide showed them in he stood up and came round the desk to shake hands brigadier prime minister ferguson said may i introduce rear admiral travers of course do sit down gentlemen he went and sat behind his desk again an incredible business this an understatement prime minister ferguson replied you were quite right to bring it to my attention the royal aspect is what concerns me most the phone rang he picked it up listened then said send them up as he replaced the receiver he said i know youve had your problems with the security services brigadier but i feel this to be one of those cases where we should honor our agreement to keep them informed about anything of mutual interest you recall you agreed to liaise with the deputy director simon carter and sir francis pamer i did indeed prime minister i called both of them in immediately after reading the diary theyve been downstairs having a look at it themselves theyre on their way up a moment later the door opened and the aide ushered in the two men simon carter was fifty a small man with hair already snowwhite never a field agent he was an exacademic one of the faceless men who controlled britains intelligence system sir francis pamer was fortyseven tall and elegant in a blue flannel suit he wore a guards tie thanks to three years as a subaltern in the grenadiers and had a slight smile permanently fixed to the corner of his mouth in a way that ferguson found intensely irritating they all shook hands and sat down well gentlemen the prime minister said always assuming it isnt a hoax pamer said a fascinating story it would explain many aspects of the bormann legend simon carter put in arthur axmann the hitler youth leader said he saw bormanns body lying in the road near the lehrter station in berlin that was after the breakout from the bunker it would seem now that what he saw was someone who looked like bormann travers said so it would appear carter agreed that bormann was on this uboat and survived would explain the numerous reports over the years of sightings of him in south america simon wiesenthal the nazi hunter always thought him alive pamer said before eichmann was executed he told the israelis that bormann was alive why would a man faced with death lie all well and good gentlemen the prime minister told them but frankly i think the question of whether martin bormann survived the war or not purely of academic interest it would change history a little and the newspapers would get some mileage out of it and a damn sight more out of this blue book list thats mentioned members of parliament and the nobility carter shuddered the mind boggles my dear simon pamer told him there were an awful lot of people around before the war who found aspects of hitlers message rather attractive there are also names in that list with a washington base yes well their children and grandchildren wouldnt thank you to have their names mentioned and what in the hell was bormann doing at this samson cay theres a resort there now one of those rich mans hideaways ferguson said during the war there was a hotel but it was closed for the duration we checked with public records in tortola owned by an american family called herbert what do you think bormann was after there pamer asked one can only guess but my theory runs something like this ferguson said he probably intended to let u proceed to venezuela on its own i would hazard a guess that he was to be picked up by someone and samson cay was the rendezvous he left the briefcase as a precaution in case anything went wrong after all he did give friemel instructions about its disposal if anything happened to him a pretty scandal i agree gentlemen the whole thing but imagine the furor it would cause if it became known that the duke of windsor had signed an agreement with hitler the prime minister said personally i feel it more than likely that this socalled windsor protocol would prove fraudulent pamer told him thats as may be but the papers would have a field day and frankly the royal family have had more than their share of scandal in this past year or so the prime minister replied there was silence and ferguson said gently are you suggesting that we attempt to recover bormanns briefcase before anyone else does prime minister yes that would seem the sensible thing to do do you think you might handle that brigadier it was simon carter who protested sir i must remind you that this uboat lies in american territorial waters well i dont think we need to bring our american cousins into this ferguson said they would have total rights to the wreck and the contents imagine what theyd get for the windsor protocol at auction carter tried again i really must protest prime minister group fours brief is to combat terrorism and subversion the prime minister raised a hand exactly and i can think of few things more subversive to the interests of the nation than the publication of this windsor protocol brigadier you will devise a plan do whatever is necessary and as soon as possible keep me informed and also the deputy director and sir francis so the matter is entirely in my hands ferguson asked total authority just do what you have to the prime minister got up and now you really must excuse me gentlemen i have a tight schedule the four men walked down to the security gates where downing street met whitehall and paused at the pavement carter said damn you ferguson you always get your way but see you keep us informed come on francis and he strode away francis pamer smiled dont take it to heart brigadier its just that he hates you good hunting and he hurried after carter travers and ferguson walked along whitehall looking for a taxi and travers said why does carter dislike you so because i succeeded too often where hes failed and because im outside the system and only answerable to the prime minister and carter cant stand that pamer seems a decent enough sort so ive heard hes married i suppose as a matter of fact no apparently much in demand by the ladies one of the oldest baronetcies in england i believe hes the twelfth or thirteenth has a wonderful house in hampshire his mother lives there so what is his connection with intelligence matters the prime minister has made him a junior minister at the home office extra minister i believe his title is a kind of roving trouble shooter as long as he and carter keep out of my hair ill be well pleased and henry baker do you think hell tell you where u is lying of course he will hell have to ferguson saw a taxi and waved it down come on lets get moving and well confront him now after his bath baker had lain on his bed for a moment a towel about his waist and tired from the amount of traveling hed done fell fast asleep when he finally awakened and checked his watch it was shortly after two oclock he dressed quickly and went downstairs there was no sign of travers and when he opened the front door it was still raining hard in spite of that he decided to go for a walk as much to clear his head as anything else he helped himself to an old trenchcoat from the cloakroom and an umbrella and went down the steps he felt good but then rain always made him feel that way and he was still excited about the way things were going he turned toward millbank and paused looking across to victoria tower gardens and the thames in st john for obscure reasons people drive on the lefthand side of the road as in england and yet on that rainy afternoon in london henry baker did what most americans would do before crossing the road he looked left and stepped straight into the path of a london transport bus coming from the right westminster hospital being close by an ambulance was there in minutes not that it mattered for he was dead by the time they reached the casualty department in st john it was just after ten oclock in the morning as jenny grant walked along the waterfront to the cafe and went up the steps and entered the bar billy was sweeping the floor and he looked up and grinned a fine soft day you heard from mr henry yet five hours time difference she glanced at her watch just after three oclock in the afternoon there billy theres time mary jones appeared at the end of the bar telephone call for you in the office london england jenny smiled instantly henry no some woman you take it honey and ill get you a cup of coffee jenny brushed past her and went into the office and mary poured a little water into the coffee percolator there was a sharp cry from inside the office billy and mary glanced at each other in alarm then hurried in jenny sat behind the desk looking dazed clutching the phone in one hand and mary said what is it honey tell mary its a policewoman ringing me from scotland yard in london jenny whispered henrys dead he was killed in a road accident she started to cry helplessly and mary took the phone from her hello are you still there yes a neutral voice replied im sorry if the other lady was upset theres no easy way to do this sure honey you got your job to do could you find out where he was staying in london hang on mary turned to jenny she wants to know the address he was staying at over there so jenny told her it was just before five and travers in response to a telephone call from ferguson asking him to meet him waited in the foyer of the mortuary in the cromwell road the brigadier came bustling in a few minutes later sorry to keep you garth but i want to expedite things there has to be an autopsy for the coroners inquest and we cant have that unless hes formally identified ive spoken to the young woman who lives with him jenny grant shes badly shocked but intends to fly over as soon as possible should be here tomorrow yes well i dont want to hang about ferguson took a folded paper from his inside breast pocket ive got a court order from a judge in chambers here which authorizes rear admiral garth travers to make formal identification so lets get on with it a uniformed attendant appeared at that moment is one of you gentlemen brigadier ferguson thats me ferguson told him professor manning is waiting this way sir the postmortem room was lit by fluorescent lighting that bounced off the whitelined walls there were four stainlesssteel operating tables bakers body lay on the nearest one his head on a block a tall thin man in surgeons overalls stood waiting flanked by two mortuary technicians travers noted with distaste that they all wore green rubber boots hello sam thanks for coming in ferguson said this is garth travers manning shook hands could we get on charles i have tickets for covent garden of course old boy ferguson took out a pen and laid the form on the end of the operating table do you rear admiral travers formally identify this man as henry baker an american citizen of st john in the american virgin islands i do sign here travers did so and ferguson handed the form to manning there you go sam well leave you to it and he nodded to travers and led the way out ferguson closed the glass partition in his daimler so the driver couldnt hear what was being said a hell of a shock travers said it hasnt sunk in yet leaves us in rather an interesting situation ferguson commented in what way the location of u has it died with him of course travers said i was forgetting on the other hand perhaps the grant girl knows i mean she lived with him and all that not that kind of relationship travers told him purely platonic i met her just the once i was passing through miami and they happened to be there lovely young woman well lets hope this paragon of all the virtues has the answer to our problem ferguson said and if not then ill just have to think of something i wonder what carter will make of all this ferguson groaned i suppose id better bring him up to date keep the sod happy and he reached for his car phone and dialed inspector lane at precisely the same time francis pamer having made a very fast trip indeed from london in his porsche cabriolet to his country home at hatherley court in hampshire was mounting the grand staircase to his mothers apartment on the first floor the house had been in the family for five hundred years and he always visited it with conscious pleasure but not now there were more important things on his mind when he tapped on the door of the bedroom and entered he found his mother propped up in the magnificent fourposter bed a uniformed nurse sitting beside her she was eightyfive and very old and frail and lay there with her eyes closed the nurse stood up sir francis we werent expecting you i know how is she not good sir doctor was here earlier he said it could be next week or three months from now he nodded you have a break i want to have a little chat with her the nurse went out and pamer sat on the bed and took his mothers hand she opened her eyes how are you darling he asked why francis what a lovely surprise her voice was very faded i had some business not too far away mother so i thought id call in that was nice of you dear pamer got up lit a cigarette and walked to the fire i was talking about samson cay today oh are you thinking of taking a holiday dear if you go and that nice mr santiago is there do give him my regards of course im right arent i it was your mother who brought samson cay into the family yes dear her father george herbert gave it to her as a wedding present tell me about the war again mother he said and samson cay well the hotel was empty for most of the war it was small then of course just a little colonialstyle place and when did you go there you never really talked about that and i was too young to remember march nineteen fortyfive you were born in july the previous year and those terrible german rockets kept hitting london vs and vs your father was out of the army then and serving in mr churchills government as a junior minister just like you dear he was worried about the attacks on london continuing so he arranged passage on a boat to puerto rico for you and me we carried on to samson cay from there now i remember it was the beginning of april when we got there we went over from tortola by boat there was an old man and his wife black people very nice jackson that was it may and joseph her voice faded and he went and sat on the bed and took her hand again did anyone visit mother can you remember that visit she opened her eyes only mr strasser such a nice man your father told me he might be coming he just appeared one night he said hed been dropped off in a fishing boat from tortola and then the hurricane came it happened the same night terrible we were in the cellar for two days i held you all the time but mr strasser was very good such a kind man then what happened he stayed with us for quite a while until june i think and then your father arrived and strasser he left after that he had business in south america and the war in europe was over of course so we came back to england mr churchill had lost the election and your father wasnt in parliament anymore so we lived down here darling the farms were a great disappointment she was wandering a little pamer said you once told me my father served with sir oswald mosley in the first world war in the trenches thats true dear they were great friends remember mosleys black shirts mother the british fascist party did father have any connection with that good heavens no poor oswald he often spent the weekend here they arrested him at the beginning of the war said he was progerman ridiculous he was such a gentleman the voice trailed away and then strengthened such a difficult time we had goodness knows how we managed to keep you at eton how lucky we all were when your father met mr santiago what wonderful things they did together at samson cay some people say its the finest resort in the caribbean now id love to visit again i really would her eyes closed and pamer went and put her hands under the cover you sleep now mother it will do you good he closed the door gently went downstairs to the library got himself a scotch and sat by the fire thinking about it all the contents of the diary had shocked him beyond measure and it was a miracle that he had managed to keep his composure in front of carter but the truth was plain now his father a british member of parliament a serving officer a member of government had had connections with the nazi party one of those who had eagerly looked forward to a german invasion in the involvement must have been considerable the whole business with martin bormann and samson cay proved that francis pamers blood ran cold and he went and got another scotch and wandered around the room looking at the portraits of his ancestors five hundred years one of the oldest families in england and he was a junior minister now had every prospect of further advancement but if ferguson managed to arrange the recovery of bormanns briefcase from the uboat he was finished no reason to doubt that his fathers name would be on the blue book list of nazi sympathizers the scandal would finish him not only would he have to say goodbye to any chance of a high position in government he would have to resign his parliamentary seat at the very least then there would be the clubs he shuddered it didnt bear thinking about but what to do the answer was astonishingly simple max max santiago max would know he hurried to the study looked up the number of the samson cay resort phoned through and asked for carlos prieto the general manager carlos francis pamer here sir francis what a pleasure what can i do for you are you coming to see us soon i hope so carlos listen i need to speak to señor santiago urgently would you know where he is certainly staying at the ritz in paris business i understand then he returns to puerto rico in three days bless you carlos pamer had never felt such relief he asked the operator to get him the ritz in paris and checked his watch fivethirty he waited impatiently until he heard the receptionist at the ritz in his ear and asked for santiago at once be there max be there he murmured a voice said in french santiago here who is this thank god max this is francis i must see you somethings happened something bad i need your help calm yourself francis calm yourself where are you hatherley court you could be at gatwick by sixthirty your time i think so good ill have a charter waiting for you we can have dinner and you can tell me all about it the phone clicked and he was gone pamer got his passport from the desk and a wad of travelers checks then he went upstairs opened his mothers door and peered in she was sleeping he closed the door gently and went downstairs the phone sounded in his study he hurried in to answer it and found simon carter on the line there you are been chasing you all over the place bakers dead just heard from ferguson good god pamer said and then had a thought doesnt that mean the location of u died with him well he certainly didnt tell travers but apparently his girlfriend is flying over tomorrow a jenny grant ferguson is hoping that she knows anyway ill keep you in touch pamer went out frowning and the nurse entered the hall from the kitchen area leaving sir francis urgent government business nellie give her my love he let himself out got in the porsche and drove away at garth travers in lord north street the admiral and ferguson finished searching bakers suitcase you didnt really expect to find the location of that damned reef hidden amongst his clothes did you travers asked stranger things have happened ferguson said believe me they went into the study the aluminium briefcase was on the desk this is it is it yes travers told him lets have a look the admiral opened it ferguson examined the letter the photos and glanced through the diary you copied this on your word processor here i presume oh yes i typed the translation straight out of the top of my head so the disk is still in the machine yes get it out theres a good chap and stick it in the case also any copy you have i say charles thats a bit thick after all ive done and anyway it was bakers property in the legal sense of the word not any more it isnt grumbling travers did as he was told now what happens nothing much ill see this young woman tomorrow and see what she has to say and then i dont really know but frankly it wont concern you from here on in i thought youd say that ferguson slapped him on the shoulder never mind meet me in the piano bar at the dorchester at eight well have a drink he let himself out of the front door turned down the steps and got into the rear of the waiting daimler as the citation jet lifted off the runway at gatwick francis pamer got himself a scotch from the bar box thinking about max santiago cuban he knew that one of the landed families chased out by castro in nineteen fiftynine the max bit came from his mother who was german that he had money was obvious because when he had struck the deal with old joseph pamer to develop samson cay resort in nineteen seventy he already controlled a number of hotels how old would he be now sixtyseven or eight all francis pamer knew for sure was that he had always been a little afraid of him but that didnt matter santiago would know what to do and that was all that was important he finished his scotch and settled back to read the financial times until the citation landed at le bourget airport in paris half an hour later santiago was standing on the terrace of his magnificent suite at the ritz an impressively tall man in a dark suit and tie his hair still quite black in spite of his age he had a calm imperious face the look of a man who was used to getting his own way and dark watchful eyes he turned as the room waiter showed pamer in my dear francis what a joy to see you he held out a hand a glass of champagne you need it i can tell his english was faultless you can say that again pamer said and accepted the crystal glass gratefully now come and sit down and tell me what the trouble is they sat on either side of the fire pamer said i dont know where to begin why at the beginning naturally so pamer did just that when he was finished santiago sat there for a while without saying a word pamer said what do you think unfortunate to say the least i know i mean if this business ever got out bormann on the island my mother my father oh your mother didnt have the slightest idea who bormann was santiago said your father did of course i beg your pardon pamer was stunned your father dear old joseph was a fascist all his life francis and so was my father and a great friend of general franco people like that were how shall i put it connected your father had very heavy links with nazi germany before the war but then so did many members of the english establishment and why not what sensible person wanted to see a bunch of communists take over look what they have done to my own cuba are you saying you knew my father had this connection with martin bormann of course my own father in cuba at that time was also involved let me explain francis the kamaradenwerk action for comrades the organization set up to take care of the movement in the event of defeat in europe was still is a worldwide network your father and my father were just two cogs in the machine i dont believe it francis how do you think your father was able to hang on to hatherley court your education at eton your three years in the grenadier guards where did the money come from your father didnt even have his salary as an mp after he lost his seat to the bloody labour party pamer said bitterly of course but over the years he was allowed to shall we say assist with certain business dealings when my own family left cuba because of that animal castro there were funds made available to us in the united states i built up the hotel chain was able to indulge in certain illegal but lucrative forms of traffic pamer had always suspected some kind of drug involvement and his blood ran cold look i dont want to know about that you do like spending the money though francis santiago smiled for the first time the development of samson cay suited us very well a wonderful cover a playground for the very rich and behind that facade perfect for the conducting of certain kinds of business and what if someone investigated it why should they samson holdings is as the name implies a holding company its like a russian doll francis one company inside another and the name of pamer appears on none of the boards and youd have to go some way back to find the name of santiago but it was my grandmothers family who originally owned it the herbert people that was a long time ago francis look your mothers name was vail her mothers maiden name was herbert i admit but i doubt that any connection would be made you mentioned that ferguson had checked with public records in tortola who told him the hotel was unoccupied during the war yes i wonder how they made the mistake quite simple a clerk nearly forty years later looks in the file and sees a notation that the hotel was unoccupied for the duration which it was francis your mother didnt turn up with you until april fortyfive only four or five weeks before the end of the war in any case its of no consequence ill have my people check the records office in tortola if theres anything there well remove it you can do that pamer said aghast i can do anything francis now this rear admiral travers whats his address lord north street good ill get someone to pay him a call although i shouldnt imagine he has the diary in his possession any longer or the translation from the sound of ferguson theyll be careful your people pamer said i mean we dont want a scandal thats exactly what you will have if we dont get in first on this thing ill get one of my people to check out this young woman what was her name jenny grant ill have flights checked to see when shes arriving simple enough shell be on either the puerto rico or antigua flight and then what santiago smiled why well have to hope that shell be able to tell us something wont we pamer felt sick look max they wont hurt her or anything poor old francis what a thoroughly spineless creature you are santiago propelled him to the door and opened it wait for me in the bar i have telephone calls to make then well have dinner he pushed him out into the corridor and closed the door the piano bar at the dorchester was busy when garth travers went in and there was no sign of ferguson he was greeted warmly by one of the waiters for it was one of his favorite watering holes a corner table was found and he ordered a gin and tonic and relaxed ferguson arrived fifteen minutes later and joined him got to do better than that the brigadier told him and ordered two glasses of champagne i love this place he looked up at the mirrored ceiling quite extraordinary and that chap at the piano plays our kind of music doesnt he which is another way of saying were getting on travers said youre in a good mood anything happened yes lane did a check through british airways at gatwick shes on flight departing antigua at twentyten hours their time arriving at gatwick at five past nine in the morning poor girl travers said will you ask her to stay with you of course i thought you might ferguson nodded under the circumstances i think it would be better if you picked her up my driver will have the daimler at your place at seventhirty i know its early but you know what the traffic is like thats fine by me do you want me to bring her straight to you oh no give her a chance to settle shell be tired after her flight i can see her later ferguson hesitated theres a strong possibility that shell want to see the body is it still at the mortuary no at a firm of undertakers we use on department matters cox and son in the cromwell road if she asks to go take her there theres a good chap he waved to a waiter and ordered two more glasses of champagne and travers said what about the uboat the diary all that stuff do i say anything to her no leave that to me ferguson smiled now drink up and ill buy you dinner and in antigua when she went up the steps to the firstclass compartment jenny grant felt as if she were moving in slow motion the stewardess who greeted her cheerfully had the instinct that comes from training and experience that told her something was wrong she took her to her seat and helped her get settled would you like a drink champagne coffee actually i could do with a brandy a large one jenny told her the stewardess was back with it in a moment there was concern on her face now look is there something wrong can i help not really jenny said ive just lost the best friend i ever had to a road accident in london thats why im going over the young woman nodded sympathetically theres no one sitting next to you only six in the cabin this trip nobody to bother you she squeezed jennys shoulder anything you need just let me know ill probably try to sleep through the whole trip probably the best thing for you the stewardess went away and jenny leaned back drinking her brandy and thinking about henry all the kindness all the support hed saved her life that was the truth of it and the strange thing was that try as she might for some reason she couldnt remember his face clearly and tears welled up in her eyes slow and bitter the daimler arrived just before seventhirty travers left a note for his housekeeper mrs mishra an indian lady whose husband kept a corner store not too far away explaining the situation hurried down the steps to fergusons limousine and was driven away passing a british telecom van parked at the end of the street the van started up moved along the street and parked outside travers house a telephone engineer in official overalls got out with a toolbox in one hand he had the name smith printed on his lefthand breast pocket he went along the flagged path leading to the back of the house and the rear courtyard he went up the steps to the kitchen door punched a gloved hand through the glass pane reached in and opened it a moment later he was also opening the front door and another telecom engineer got out of the van and joined him the name on his overalls pocket was johnson once inside they worked their way methodically through the admirals study searching every drawer pulling the books from the shelves checking for signs of a safe and finding none finally smith said waste of time it isnt here go and get the van open he unplugged the admirals word processor and followed johnson out putting it in the back of the van they went back inside and johnson said what else see if theres a television or video in the living room then take this typewriter johnson did as he was told when he returned to the living room smith was screwing the head of the telephone back into place youre tapping the phone why not we might hear something to our advantage is that smart i mean the kind of people were dealing with intelligence people theyre not rubbish look to all intents and purposes this is just another hitandrun burglary smith told him anyway mr santiago wants a result on this one and you dont screw around with him believe me now lets get moving mrs mishra the admirals housekeeper didnt normally arrive until nine oclock but the fact that shed had the previous day off meant there was laundry to take care of so she had decided to make an early start as she turned the corner of lord north street and walked toward the house an overcoat over her sari against the early morning chill she saw the two men come out of the house she hurried forward is there a problem they turned toward her smith said urbanely not that i know of who are you love mrs mishra the housekeeper problem with one of the telephones weve taken care of it youll find everythings fine now they got in the van johnson behind the wheel and drove away johnson said unfortunate that no big deal shes indian isnt she were just another couple of white faces to her smith lit a cigarette and leaned back enjoying the view of the river as they turned into millbank mrs mishra didnt notice anything was amiss because the study door was halfclosed she went into the kitchen put her bag on the table and saw the admirals note as she was reading it she became aware of a draft turned and saw the broken pane in the door oh my god she said in horror she quickly went back along the passage and checked the living room noticed the absence of the television and video at once the state of the study confirmed her worst fears and she immediately picked up the phone and dialed for the police emergency service travers recognized jenny grant at once as she emerged into the arrival hall at gatwick pushing her suitcase on a trolley she wore a threequarterlength tweed coat over a white blouse and jeans and she looked tired and strained dark circles under her eyes jenny he said as he approached do you remember me garth travers of course i do admiral she tried a smile and failed miserably he put his hands lightly on her shoulders you look bushed my dear come on lets get out of here ive got a car waiting let me take your case the driver put the case in the boot of the daimler and travers joined her in the rear as they drove away he said i expect you to stay with me naturally if thats all right youre very kind will you do something for me she was almost pleading will you tell me exactly what happened from what witnesses have told the police he simply looked the wrong way and stepped in front of a bus what a bloody stupid way to go there was a kind of anger in her voice now i mean here we had a sixtythreeyearold man who insisted on diving every day sometimes to a hundred and thirty feet in hazardous conditions and he has to die in such a stupid and trivial way i know lifes a bit of a bad joke sometimes would you care for a cigarette as a matter of fact i would i gave up six months ago started again on the plane coming over last night she took one from the packet he offered and accepted a light theres something else id like and before we do anything else whats that to see him she said simply i thought you might garth travers said thats where were going now the undertakers was a pleasant enough place considering what it was the waiting room was panelled and banked with flowers an old man in black suit and a tie entered may i help you mr cox im admiral travers and this is miss grant you were expecting us i believe of course his voice was a whisper if you would come this way there were several rooms off a rear corridor with sliding doors open revealing coffins standing on trestles and flowers everywhere the smell quite overpowering mr cox led the way into the end one the coffin was quite simple made of mahogany as i had no instructions i had to do the best i could cox said the fittings are gold plastic as i assumed cremation would be the intention he slid back the lid and eased the gauze from the face henry baker looked very calm in death eyes closed face pale jenny put a hand to his face slightly dislodging the gauze cox carefully rearranged the gauze i wouldnt miss she was bewildered for a moment and travers said there was an autopsy my dear had to be its a court requirement theyll be holding a coroners inquest you see day after tomorrow she nodded it doesnt matter hes gone now can we leave please in the car he gave her another cigarette are you all right absolutely she smiled suddenly he was a smashing fella admiral isnt that what they say in england the dearest kindest man i ever knew she took a deep breath where to now my house in lord north street youd probably like a bath rest up a little and so on yes that would be nice she leaned back and closed her eyes the surprise at lord north street was the police car the front door stood open and travers hurried up the steps jenny behind him he went into the hall and found the chaos in his study instantly followed the sounds of voices and found mrs mishra and a young policewoman in the kitchen oh admiral mrs mishra said as he entered such a terrible thing they have stolen many things the television your word processor and typewriter the study is such a mess but i saw their names on their overalls admiral travers the policewoman said typical daytime robbery im afraid sir they gained access through that door she indicated the hole in the glass travers said the bloody swine they were in a telecom van mrs mishra said telephone engineers i saw them leave imagine such a thing thats a common ploy during the day sir the policewoman said to pass themselves off as some kind of workmen i dont suppose theres much chance of catching them either travers inquired i doubt it sir i really do now if i could have full details about whats missing yes of course just give me a moment he turned to jenny sorry about this mrs mishra this is miss grant shell be staying for a while tell the driver to take her case up and show her to her room of course admiral mrs mishra ushered jenny out and travers said to the policewoman theres a chance there could be more to this than meets the eye officer ill just make a phone call and ill be with you directly smith and johnson ferguson said thats a good one seems like a runofthemill daytime robbery sir lane said all the usual hallmarks they only took the kind of portable items that convert to quick cash the television video and the rest rather sophisticated i would have thought having their very own telecom van probably stolen sir well run a check rather fortunate i relieved travers of the diary and the translation software hed made from it if they were looking for something more important than television sets you really think it could have been that sir all i know is that i learned a long time ago to suspect coincidence jack i mean how often does garth travers leave the house at seventhirty in the morning they must have seen him go and you think taking the runofthemill kind of stuff was just a blind perhaps but how would they know about the existence of the diary sir yes well that is the interesting point ferguson frowned ive had a thought jack go to lord north street get one of your old friends from special branch someone who specializes in bugging devices to do a sweep you really think i dont think anything jack im merely considering all the options now on your way lane went out and ferguson picked up the phone and rang lord north street and spoke to travers hows your guest fine bearing up remarkably well ferguson looked at his watch bring her to my place in cavendish square at about twelvethirty we might as well get on with it but dont say a word leave it all to me you can rely on me travers put the phone down and went into the living room where jenny sat by the fire drinking coffee sorry about all this he said a hell of an introduction not your fault he sat down well go out soon for a spot of lunch but id like to introduce you to an old friend of mine brigadier charles ferguson she was an astute young woman and sensed something at once did he know henry not directly but this is something to do with henry he reached across and patted her hand all in good time my dear just trust me santiago was still at his suite at the ritz when the man who called himself smith phoned through from london not a thing guv certainly nothing like you described hardly surprising but it was worth checking santiago said a nice clean job i trust sure guv just made it look runofthemill i tapped the phone just in case you wanted to listen in you did what santiago was coldly angry i told you these are intelligence people involved in this one the kind of people who check everything sorry guv i thought i was doing the right thing never mind its too late now just drop any other commissions you have at the moment and wait to hear from me and santiago put the phone down in the living room at cavendish square jenny sat beside the fire opposite ferguson and travers stood by the window so you see miss grant ferguson said there will have to be a coroners inquest which is set for the day after tomorrow and i can have the body then well that is really a matter for the next of kin she opened her handbag and took out a paper which she unfolded and passed to him henry took up serious diving a year or so ago rather old for that i should have thought ferguson said yes well he had a nearmiss one day ran out of air at fifty feet oh he made it to the surface okay but he immediately went to his lawyer and had him draw up a power of attorney in my name ferguson looked it over that seems straightforward enough ill see that its passed to the coroner he reached down at the side of the sofa and produced friemels aluminium briefcase have you seen this before she looked puzzled no or this he opened it and took out the diary no never she frowned what is this ferguson said did mr baker tell you why he was coming to london she looked at him then turned to glance at travers then she turned back why do you think he came here brigadier because he discovered the wreck of a german submarine somewhere off st john miss grant did he tell you about that jenny grant took a deep breath yes brigadier he did tell me he said hed been diving and that hed discovered a submarine and a briefcase this case he said with this diary inside what else did he tell you well it was in german which he didnt understand but he did recognize the name martin bormann and here she paused ferguson said gently and the duke of windsor she said lamely look i know it sounds crazy but not crazy at all my dear and where did mr baker find this uboat ive no idea he wouldnt tell me there was a pause while ferguson glanced at travers he sighed you are absolutely certain of that miss grant of course i am he said he didnt want to tell me for the time being he was very excited about his find she paused frowning look what are you trying to tell me brigadier whats going on here does this have something to do with henrys death no not at all he said soothingly and nodded to travers the admiral said jenny poor old henrys death was a complete accident we have plenty of witnesses he stepped into the path of a london transport bus the driver was a sixtyyearold cockney who won the military medal for gallantry in the korean war in nineteen fiftytwo as an infantry private just an accident jenny so youve no idea where the uboat lies ferguson asked again is it important yes it could be she shrugged i honestly dont know if you want my opinion it would have to be somewhere far out far out what do you mean most of the dive sites that tourists use from st thomas and st john are within reasonable distance there are plenty of wrecks around but the idea that a german uboat had remained undiscovered since the end of the war she shook her head thats nonsense it could only happen if it was somewhere remote and far out further out to sea thats right and youve no idea where no im not much of a diver im afraid youd need to go to an expert and is there such a person oh sure bob carney ferguson picked up his pen and made a note bob carney and who might he be he has the watersports concession at caneel bay resort i mean he spends most of his time teaching tourists to dive but hes a real diver and quite famous he was in the oil fields in the gulf of mexico salvage work all that stuff theyve done magazine articles about him really ferguson said hes the best diver in the virgin islands then in the whole caribbean brigadier she said really ferguson glanced at travers and stood up good many thanks for your cooperation miss grant i appreciate this is not a good time but you must eat perhaps youll allow me to take you and admiral travers out for a meal tonight she hesitated and then said thats kind of you not at all ill send my car to pick you up at seventhirty he ushered them to the outside door take care he nodded to the admiral ill be in touch garth he was having a cup of tea and thinking about things half an hour later when lane arrived the inspector dropped a hard black metal bug on the coffee table you were right sir this little bastard was in the living room telephone so ferguson said picking it up the plot thickens look sir baker knew about the diary because he found it the girl knew because he told her the admiral knew you know the pm had a copy the deputy director of the intelligence services knew sir francis pamer knew he paused youre missing yourself out jack yes sir but who the hell was it who knew who would go to the trouble of knocking off admiral travers pad there you go again jack police jargon ferguson sighed its like a spiders web there are lots of lines of communication between all those people you mention god knows how many so what are you going to do sir i mean we dont even know where the bloody uboat is on top of that weve all sorts of dirty work going on underneath things burglary illegal phonetapping youre right jack the whole thing assumes a totally new dimension it might be better to bring intelligence in on it sir hardly although when you get back to the office you may phone simon carter and sir francis and tell them the girl says she doesnt know the site but then what sir im not sure well have to send someone out there to find out for us someone who knows about diving sir thats a thought but if there is skulduggery afoot someone whos just as big a villain as the opposition ferguson paused correction someone who is worse sir lane looked bewildered ferguson suddenly started to laugh helplessly my dear jack isnt life delicious on occasions i spend simply ages getting someone i positively detest banged up the cell door locked tight and suddenly discover hes exactly what i need in the present situation i dont understand sir you will jack ever been to yugoslavia no sir good a new experience for you well leave at dawn have them get the learjet ready tell admiral travers ill have to postpone dinner with him and the young lady and the destination sir the air strip at kivo castle jack tell them to clear it with the serbian high command i dont think theyll have a problem dillon was dozing on his bed at kivo when the sound of a plane circling overhead awoke him he lay there for a moment listening aware of the change in the engine note that indicated a landing was being made a jet by the sound of it he went to the barred window and peered out it was raining hard and as he looked out across the walls he saw a learjet come in out of low cloud and make an approach to the airstrip it landed perfectly then taxied forward so that he could see there were no markings it disappeared from view and he went and got a cigarette wondering who it could be a shouted command drifted up and there was a crackle of rifle fire he went back to the window but he could only see part of the courtyard below one or two soldiers appeared and laughter drifted up presumably the general clearing out the cells again and he wondered how many poor bastards had ended up against the wall this time there was more laughter and then an army truck crossed his line of vision and disappeared youre in a mess this time my old son he murmured softly a hell of a bloody mess and he went and lay on the bed finishing his cigarette and thinking about it in paris santiago was about to leave his suite for a lunch appointment when the phone rang it was francis pamer i tried to catch you earlier but you were out pamer told him business francis thats why im here what have you got for me carter had a word with me he spoke to ferguson he said the girl doesnt know the location of the uboat he said that she knew about it that baker had told her about his discovery before he left but that he hadnt told her where the damned thing is does ferguson believe her apparently pamer told him at least that was the impression carter got and whats ferguson up to now i dont know he just told carter that hed keep him posted what about the girl where is she staying santiago asked him with admiral travers at lord north street theres the coroners inquest tomorrow once thats over fergusons agreed she can have the body i see santiago said what do you think max about the girl you mean i dont know she could be telling the truth on the other hand she could be lying and theres only one way to find that out what do you mean why by asking her francis in the proper way of course a little persuasion gentle or otherwise works wonders for gods sake max pamer began and santiago cut him off just do whats necessary keep me posted as regards fergusons plans and ill have the girl taken care of i had intended to return to puerto rico tomorrow but ill hang on for another day or two here in the meantime ill speak to my people in san juan tell them to get the maria blanco ready for sea the moment we know for definite that ferguson intends some sort of operation in the virgins ill sail down to samson cay and use it as a base pamer said christ max i dont know whether im coming or going with this thing if it comes out im finished but it wont francis because ill see that it doesnt ive always anticipated seeing you in the cabinet very useful to have a friend whos a british cabinet minister ive no intention of allowing that not to happen so dont worry santiago put the phone down thought about it for a moment then picked it up again and rang his house in san juan on the island of puerto rico dillon was reading a book head propped up against the pillow when the key rattled in the lock the door opened and major branko entered ah there you are he said dillon didnt bother getting up and where else would i be that sounds a trifle bitter branko told him after all youre still with us cause for a certain amount of gratitude i should have thought what do you want dillon asked ive brought someone to see you hardly an old friend but id listen to what he has to say if i were you he stood to one side dillon swung his legs to the floor was starting to get up and ferguson entered the room followed by jack lane holy mother of god dillon said and branko went out and closed the door behind him dear me dillon but you are up the creek without a paddle arent you ferguson dusted the only chair with his hat and sat weve never actually made it face to face before but i imagine you know who i am brigadier charles bloody ferguson dillon said head of group four and this is detective inspector jack lane my assistant on loan from special branch at scotland yard so he doesnt like you lanes face was like stone he leaned against the wall arms folded and dillon said is that a fact look at him jack ferguson said the great sean dillon soldier of the ira in his day master assassin better than carlos the jackal some say i am looking at him sir and all i see is just another killer ah but this one is special jack the man of a thousand faces could have been another olivier if he hadnt taken to the gun he can change before your very eyes mind you he cocked up his attempt to blow up the prime minister and the war cabinet at number ten during the gulf war as nobody knows better than you jack by god you gave us a hard time on that one dillon a pleasure but youre behind walls now lane said ferguson nodded twenty years jack twenty years without getting his collar felt once and where does he end up he looked around the room you must have been out of your mind dillon medical supplies for the sick and the dying you we all have our off days stinger missiles as well so you didnt even check your cargo properly you must be losing your touch all right the shows over dillon told him what do you want ferguson got up and went to the window theyve been shooting croatians down there in the courtyard we heard them as we drove over from the airstrip they were clearing the bodies away in a truck as we drove in he turned itll be your turn one of these fine mornings dillon unless youre sensible of course dillon got a cigarette from one of the rothmans packets and lit it with his zippo you mean i have a choice he asked calmly you could say that ferguson sat down again you shoot guns rather well dillon fly a plane speak a number of languages but the thing im interested in at the moment was that underwater job you did for the israelis it was you wasnt it who blew up those plo boats off beirut do you tell me dillon said sounding very irish oh for gods sake sir lets leave the bastard to rot lane said come on man dont be stupid was it you or wasnt it ferguson demanded as ever was dillon told him good now heres the situation i have a job that requires a man of your peculiar talents a crook he means lane put in ferguson ignored him im not sure exactly whats going on at the moment but it could demand a man who can handle himself if things get rough what i am certain of is that it would require at the right moment considerable diving skills and where would all this take place the american virgin islands ferguson stood up the choice is yours dillon you can stay here and be shot or you can leave now and fly back to london in the learjet we have at the airstrip with the inspector and me and what will major branko have to say about it no problem there nice boy his mother lives in hampstead hes had enough of this yugoslavian mess and who can blame him im going to arrange political asylum for him in england dillon said is there nothing you cant do not that i can think of dillon hesitated im a wanted man over there in the uk you know that slate wiped clean my word on it which disgusts inspector lane here but thats the way it is of course it also means youll have to do exactly as youre told of course dillon picked up his flying jacket and pulled it on yours to command i thought youd see sense now lets get out of this disgusting place and ferguson rapped on the door with his malacca cane dillon finished the diary and closed it lane was dozing his head on a pillow and the irishman passed the diary to ferguson who sat on the other side of the aisle but facing him very interesting dillon said is that all youve got to say the irishman reached for the bar box found a miniature of scotch poured it into one of the plastic cups provided and added water what do you expect me to say all right henry bakers death was unfortunate but he died happy by god finding u must have been the biggest thing that ever happened to him you think so every divers dream brigadier to find a wreck thats never been discovered before preferably stuffed with spanish doubloons but if you cant have that the wreck on its own will do really youve never dived dillon laughed a silly question its another world down there a special feeling nothing quite like it he swallowed some of his whisky so this woman you mentioned this jenny grant she says he didnt tell her where the uboat is located thats right do you believe her ferguson sighed im afraid i do normally i dont believe in anyone but theres something about her something special falling for a pretty face in your old age dillon said always a mistake that dont be stupid dillon the brigadier replied sharply shes a nice girl and theres something about her thats all i mean you can judge for yourself well have dinner with garth travers and her this evening all right dillon nodded so if she doesnt know where the damn thing is what do you expect me to do go to the virgin islands and find it thats what i expect you to do dillon its no great hardship i assure you i visited st john a few years back lovely spot for a holiday you wont be on holiday only pretending youll earn your keep brigadier dillon said patiently the sea is a hell of a big place have you any idea how difficult it is to locate a ship down there on the bottom even in caribbean waters with good visibility you could miss seeing it at a hundred yards youll think of something you always do dillon isnt that your special talent jesus but you have the most touching faith in me all right lets get down to brass tacks bakers death are you sure that was an accident absolutely no question there were witnesses he simply looked the wrong way and stepped into the path of the bus the driver i might add is beyond reproach all right so what about the burglary at this admiral travers house the bug in the telephone ferguson nodded a smell of stinking fish there all the hallmarks of an opportunistic housebreaking but the bug says otherwise who would it be god knows dillon but all my instincts tell me theres someone out there and theyre up to no good but what dillon said thats the point im sure youll come up with an answer so when do you want me to go out to the virgins im not sure two or three days well see ferguson eased a pillow behind his head and where do i stay while im hanging around in london dillon enquired ill arrange for you to stay with admiral travers in lord north street for the moment you can earn your keep by keeping an eye on the girl ferguson told him now shut up theres a good chap i need a spot of shuteye he folded his arms and closed his eyes dillon finished his scotch and leaned back thinking about it ferguson murmured oh dillon just one thing and what would that be dr wegner and that young fool klaus schmidt the people you dealt with at fehring wellintentioned amateurs but the man you bumped into in vienna who put you in touch with them farben he was acting for me i got him to set you up then got someone who works for me to shop you to the serbs believe it or not brigadier but something of the sort had occurred to me i presume the stinger missiles were your idea wanted to see you behind bars you see ferguson said if i couldnt get you one way he shrugged mind you this present business has got nothing to do with it lucky for you the situation arose or youd have left me to rot not really theyd have shot you sooner or later ah well what does it matter now dillon said you might say its all come out in the wash when you think about it and he closed his eyes and dozed himself at lord north street just before six it was still raining as dillon sat at the kitchen table and watched jenny grant make the tea he had only just been introduced for ferguson was closeted in the study with travers she turned and smiled would you like some toast or anything not really would you mind if i smoked not at all she busied herself with the tea things youre irish but you sound different north of ireland he said what you would call ulster and others the six counties ira country thats right he told her calmly she poured the tea and what exactly are you doing here mr dillon would i be correct in assuming the brigadier wants you to keep an eye on me and why would you think that she sat opposite and sipped some of her tea because you look like that kind of man and how would you be knowing that sort of person miss grant jenny she said and i used to know all sorts of men mr dillon and they were usually the wrong kind she brooded for a moment but henry saved me from all that she looked up and her eyes glistened and now hes gone another cup he reached for the pot and what do you do in st john she took a deep breath and tried hard i have a cafe and bar called jennys place you must visit some time you know what dillon smiled i might just take you up on that and he drank some more of his tea in the study travers was aghast good heavens charles ira im truly shocked you can be shocked as much as you like garth but i need the little bugger i hate to admit it but hes very very good i intend to send him out to st john once ive got things sorted in the meantime he can stay here and act as your minder just in case anything untoward happens all right travers said reluctantly if the girl asks ive told him to tell her hes a diver ive brought in to help with this thing do you think shell believe that i find her rather a smart young woman i dont see why not he is a diver amongst other things ferguson got up by the way you had a man from my department earlier who replaced the bug in your phone and gave you a cellular telephone didnt he thats right ferguson led the way out and they went in the kitchen where jenny and dillon sat at the table ferguson said right you two im off well all meet for dinner at eight the river room at the savoy i think he turned to dillon that suit you dillon said a jacketandtie job that and heres me with only the clothes im standing up in all right dillon you can go shopping tomorrow ferguson said wearily and turned to travers good thing youre as small as he is garth you can fix him up with a blazer im sure see you later the front door banged behind him and dillon smiled always in a hurry that man travers said reluctantly all right youd better come with me and ill show you where youre sleeping and find you something to wear he led the way out and dillon winked at jenny and followed him not too far away the fake telephone engineer who had called himself smith turned into an alley where an old van was parked and knocked on the rear door it was opened by johnson and smith joined him inside there were various items of recording equipment and a receiver anything smith asked not a thing its been on all day housekeeper ordering groceries asking for a repair man for the washing machine the admiral phoned the london library to order a book and the army and navy club about a function next month bit of a bore the whole thing what about you i was watching the house a short while ago and ferguson turned up you sure oh yes definitely him the photos on the file mr santiago has supplied are very good he had a guy with him any ideas no small very fair hair black leather flying jacket he stayed ferguson left so what do we do now leave the recorder on i can do a sweep in the morning and listen to anything interesting ill watch the house while you take some time off if they go out ill follow and speak to you on the car phone okay johnson said ill catch up with you later they got out of the van he locked it and they went their separate ways ferguson hadnt arrived when the admiral dillon and jenny reached the savoy and went to the river room the table had been ordered however and the headwaiter led them to it i suppose we might as well have a drink travers said dillon turned to the wine waiter bottle of krug nonvintage he smiled amiably at travers i prefer the grape mix do you indeed the admiral said stiffly yes dillon offered jenny a cigarette she was wearing a simple white blouse and black skirt youre looking rather nice his voice had changed and for the moment he was the perfect english gentleman publicschool accent and all are you ever the same for five minutes together she asked jesus and wouldnt that be a bore lets dance he reached for her hand and led her to the floor you know youre not looking too bad yourself she said well the blazer fits but i find the navy tie a bit incongruous ah i see it now you dont like institutions not totally true the first time i came to the river room i belonged to a famous institution the royal academy of dramatic art youre kidding me she said no i was a student there for one year only and i was offered a job with the national theatre i played lyngstrand in ibsens lady from the sea the one who was coughing his guts up all the time and after that oh there were family commitments i had to go home to ireland what a shame what have you been doing lately he told the truth for once ive been flying medical supplies into yugoslavia oh youre a pilot some of the time ive been a lot of things butcher baker candlestick maker diver a diver she showed her surprise really youre not having me on no why should i she leaned back as they circled the floor you know i get a funny feeling about you what do you mean well it may sound crazy but if someone asked me to speculate about you for some totally illogical reason id say you were a soldier dillons smile was slightly lopsided now what gave me away im right then she was delighted with herself you were once a soldier i suppose you could put it that way the music stopped he took her back to the table and excused himself im just going to see what cigarettes they have in the bar as he went away the admiral said look my dear no sense in getting too involved with him you know not your sort oh dont be an old snob admiral she lit a cigarette he seems perfectly nice to me hes just been flying medical supplies into yugoslavia and he used to be a soldier travers snorted and came right out with it soldier of the bloody ira she frowned you cant be serious infamous character travers said worse than carlos theyve been after him for years all over the place only reason hes here is because charles has done a deal with him hes going to help out with this thing go to st john find the submarine and so on apparently the damned mans also a diver i cant believe it as dillon came out of the bar he met ferguson arriving and they came down to the table together youre looking well my dear ferguson said to jenny the coroners inquest is at tenthirty tomorrow by the way no need for you to go as garth here made the formal identification but id prefer to be there she said very well if thats what youd like how soon after that can we arrange cremation that is what you want his ashes yes she said calmly im not expecting a service henry was an atheist really ferguson shrugged well if youre happy to use our people they could do it virtually straightaway tomorrow afternoon i suppose so good if you would arrange that id be grateful if youre ordering id like caviar to start a steak medium rare and a salad on the side would you now ferguson said its called celebrating life she reached for dillons hand and id like to dance again she smiled its not often i get the chance to do the foxtrot with an ira gunman there were no more than five or six people in the small oakpaneled court in westminster the following morning jenny sat at the front bench with travers and ferguson and dillon stood at the back near the court usher once more in his flying jacket there was a brief pause while one of the people sitting at the front approached the bench and received some sort of warrant from the clerk of the court as he went out smith and johnson came into the court and sat on a bench on the other side of the aisle from dillon they were both respectably dressed in jacket and tie but one look was enough for dillon twenty years of entirely the wrong kind of living had given him an instinct for such things the clerk of the court got things started rise for her majestys coroner the coroner was old with very white hair and wore a gray suit jenny was surprised shed expected robes he opened the file before him this is an unusual case and i have taken note of the facts placed before me and have decided that in consequence the presence of a jury is not necessary is brigadier charles ferguson in court ferguson stood up yes sir i see you have served a d notice in this matter on behalf of the ministry of defence and this court accepts that there must be reasons for doing so affecting national security i accept the order and will have it entered into these proceedings i will also at this point make it clear to any member of the press present that it is an offense punishable by a term of imprisonment to report details of any case covered by a d notice thank you sir ferguson sat down as the witnesses statements given to the police in this unfortunate matter seem perfectly straightforward i only need official identification of the deceased to be able to close these proceedings the clerk of the court nodded to travers who got up and went to the stand the coroner glanced at his papers you are rear admiral garth travers i am sir and your relationship with the deceased a close friend of many years on vacation from st john in the american virgin islands staying with me at my house in lord north street and you made the official identification travers nodded is miss jennifer grant in court she stood awkwardly and he said i have a power of attorney here in your name you wish to claim the body i do sir so be it and so ordered my clerk will issue the necessary warrant you have the sympathy of the court miss grant thank you as she sat the clerk called rise for her majestys coroner they all did so and the coroner went out travers turned to jenny all right my dear fine she said but her face was pale lets go he said charles is just getting the warrant hell catch us up they passed dillon and went out smith and johnson got up and filed out with the other people while ferguson busied himself with the clerk of the court it was sunny outside and yet jenny shivered slightly and drew her collar about her throat its cold you could probably do with a hot drink travers said concerned dillon was standing on the top step as ferguson joined him smith and johnson had paused a little distance away by the bus stop for smith to take out a cigarette and johnson was lighting it for him dillon said to ferguson do you know those two why should i the brigadier asked at that moment a bus stopped smith and johnson and a couple of other people boarded it and it pulled away brigadier ive lasted all these years by trusting my instincts and they tell me weve got a couple of bad guys there what were they doing at the inquest anyway perhaps youre right dillon on the other hand there are many people who view court proceedings of any sort as free entertainment is that a fact now the daimler drew in to the pavement at the bottom of the steps and jack lane got out and joined them everything go off all right sir yes jack ferguson handed him the court order give that to old cox tell him wed like the cremation carried out this afternoon he glanced at jenny three oclock suit you she nodded paler than ever now no problem ferguson turned to lane you heard there were a couple of men in court by the way dillon had his doubts about them how could he tell lane asked ignoring the irishman were they wearing black hats jesus would you listen to the man dillon said such wit in him lane scowled took an envelope from his pocket and held it out to ferguson as you ordered sir give it to him then lane pushed it into dillons hand a damn sight more than you deserve what have we got here then dillon started to open the envelope you need clothes dont you ferguson said theres a charge card for you in there and a thousand pounds dillon took the rather handsome piece of plastic out it was an american express platinum card in his own name sweet joseph and mary isnt this going a little over the top even for you brigadier dont let it go to your head its all part of a new persona im creating for you youll be told at the right time good dillon said then ill be on my way ill get spending and dont forget a couple of suitcases dillon ferguson said youre going to need them lightweight clothing its hot out there at this time of year and if its not too much trouble try and look like a gentleman wait for me jenny called and turned to the other two men ill go with dillon nothing else to do and it will help me kill time ill see you back at the house admiral she went down the steps and hurried after dillon what do you think travers asked oh she has depths that girl shell make out ferguson said now lets get moving and he led the way down to the car as the daimler was driving along whitehall toward the ministry of defence the car phone sounded lane sitting on the pulldown seat his back to the chauffeur answered then glanced up at ferguson a hand over the receiver the deputy director brigadier he says hed like an updating on how things are going wonders whether you could meet him and sir francis at parliament afternoon tea on the terrace the cremation is at three ferguson said you dont need to be there travers told him ill see to it but id like to be there ferguson said its the civilized thing to do the girl needs our support he said to lane fourthirty to five best i can do lane confirmed the appointment and travers said very decent of you charles me decent ferguson looked positively wicked ill take dillon along and introduce him just imagine sean dillon the carlos of our times on the terrace of the houses of parliament i cant wait to see simon carters face and he started to laugh helplessly dillon and jenny made for harrods try and look like a gentleman thats what the man said he reminded her what do you suggest a decent suit for general purposes gray flannel perhaps and a blazer a nice loose linen jacket and slacks it really does get hot in st john at this time of the year really hot im yours to command he assured her they ended up in the bar upstairs with two suitcases filled with his purchases strange having to buy an entire wardrobe she said socks shirts underwear what on earth happened to you lets say i had to leave where i was in a hurry he called over a waiter and ordered two glasses of champagne and smoked salmon sandwiches you like your champagne she said dillon smiled as a great man once said there are only two things that never let you down in this life champagne and scrambled eggs thats ridiculous scrambled eggs go off very quickly anyway what about people cant you rely on them i never had much of a chance of finding out my mother died giving birth to me and i was her first so no brothers or sisters then i was an actor few friends there your average actor would shoot his dear old granny if he thought it would get him the part you havent mentioned your father is he still around no he was killed back in seventyone in belfast he got caught in the crossfire of a firefight shot dead by a british army patrol so you joined the ira something like that guns and bombs you thought that would be an answer there was a great irishman called michael collins who led the fight for irish freedom back in the early twenties his favorite saying was something lenin once said the purpose of terrorism is to terrorize its the only way a small country can hope to take on a great nation and have any chance of winning theres got to be a better way she said people are fundamentally decent take henry i was a tramp dillon drugged up to my eyeballs and working the streets in miami any man could have me as long as the price was right and then along came henry baker a decent and kindly man he saw me through the drug unit helped me rehabilitate took me to st john to share his house set me up in business she was close to tears and he never asked me for a thing dillon never laid a hand on me isnt that the strangest thing a life spent mainly on the move and one step ahead of trouble had left dillon with little time for women they were there on occasions to satisfy an urge but no more than that and hed never pretended otherwise but now sitting there opposite jenny grant he felt a kind of warmth and sympathy that was new to him jesus sean dont go falling for her now theres a good lad he thought but reached over and put a hand on one of hers it will pass girl dear everything does the one sure thing in this wicked old life now have a sandwich itll do you good the crematorium was in hampstead a red brick building reasonably functional looking but surrounded by rather pleasant parkland there were poplar trees beds of roses and other flowers of every description the daimler arrived with dillon sitting up front beside the chauffeur and ferguson travers and the girl in the rear old mr cox was waiting for them at the top of the steps discreetly dressed in black as youve asked for no kind of service ive already had the coffin taken in he said to ferguson presumably the young lady would like a final look thank you jenny said she followed him travers with a hand on her arm and ferguson and dillon brought up the rear the chapel was very plain a few rows of chairs a lectern a cross on the wall the coffin stood on a velvetdraped dais pointing at a curtained section of the wall music played faintly from some hidden tape recorder dreary anodyne stuff it was all very depressing would you care to see the deceased again mr cox asked jenny no thank you i just wanted to say goodbye let him go now she was totally dryeyed as cox pressed a button on a box in the wall and the coffin rolled forward parting the curtains and disappeared whats through there she asked the furnace room cox seemed embarrassed the ovens when can i have the ashes later this afternoon what would your needs be in that direction of course some people prefer to strew the ashes in our beautiful garden but we do have a columbarium where the urn may be displayed with a suitable plaque no ill take them with me that wont be possible at the moment it takes time im afraid travers said perhaps you could have the ashes delivered to my house in lord north street in a suitable receptacle he was embarrassed cox said of course he turned to jenny i presume youll be flying back to the caribbean miss grant we do provide a suitable container thank you can we go now she asked ferguson travers and jenny got into the daimler and dillon paused at the top of the steps there was a car parked close to the entrance to the drive and smith was standing beside it looking across at them dillon recognized him instantly but in the same moment smith got in the car and it shot away as ferguson emerged from the chapel dillon said one of those two men i saw at the inquest was standing over there a moment ago just driven away really did you get the number didnt have a chance to see it the angle the car was at blue renault i think you dont seem too worried why should i be ive got you havent i now get in the car theres a good chap as they drove away he patted jennys hand are you all right my dear yes im fine dont worry ive been thinking ferguson told her if henry didnt tell you the exact location of the submarine can you think of anyone else he might have spoken to no she said firmly if he didnt tell me then he didnt tell anyone no other diver maybe i mean he must have friends who dive as well or another diver who might be able to help well theres always bob carney she said the diver i told you about he knows the virgin isles like the back of his hand so if anybody could help it would most likely be he ferguson asked i suppose so but i wouldnt count on it theres a lot of water out there the daimler turned into lord north street and stopped travers got out first and reached a hand to jenny ferguson said dillon and i have work to do well see you later dillon turned in surprise whats this ive an appointment to meet the deputy director of the security services simon carter and a junior minister called sir francis pamer on the terrace at the houses of parliament im supposed to keep them informed of my plans and i thought it might be amusing to take you along after all dillon simon carters been trying to get his hands on you for years holy mother of god dillon said but youre a wicked man brigadier ferguson picked up the car phone and dialed lane at the ministry of defence jack american called bob carney resident st john presently a diver everything you can get the cia should help he put the phone down and dillon said and what are you up to now you old fox but ferguson made no reply simply folded his hands across his stomach and closed his eyes the house of commons has sometimes been referred to as the most exclusive club in london mainly because of the amenities which together with the upper chamber the house of lords include twentysix restaurants and bars each providing subsidized food and drinks there is always a queue waiting to get in supervised by policemen composed not only of tourists but of constituents with appointments to see their members of parliament and everyone has to take their turn no matter who which explained why ferguson and dillon waited in line moving forward slowly at least you look respectable ferguson said taking in dillons doublebreasted blazer and gray flannels thanks to your amex card dillon told him they treated me like a millionaire in harrods really ferguson said dryly you do realize thats a guards brigade tie youre wearing sure and i didnt want to let you down brigadier wasnt the grenadiers your regiment cheeky bastard ferguson said as he reached the security checkpoint it was manned not by the security guards usually found at such places but by very large policemen whose efficiency was in no doubt ferguson stated his business and produced his security card wonderful dillon said they all looked about seven feet tall just like coppers used to do they came to the central lobby where people with an appointment to see their mp waited it was extremely busy and ferguson moved on through a further corridor and down more stairs finally leading the way out through an entrance on to the terrace overlooking the thames once again there were lots of people about some with a glass in their hand enjoying a drink westminster bridge to the left the embankment on the far side of the river a row of tall rather victorianlooking lamps ran along the parapet the synthetic carpetlike covering on the ground was green but further along it changed to red a distinct line marking the difference why the change in color dillon asked everything in the commons is green ferguson said the carpets the leather of the chairs red for the house of lords that part of the terrace up there is the lords jesus but you english do love your class distinction brigadier as dillon lit a cigarette with his zippo ferguson said here they are now behave yourself theres a good chap ill do my best dillon said as simon carter and sir francis pamer approached there you are charles carter said we were looking for you people all over the place pamer said like a damned souk these days now whats happening brigadier where are we at with this business well lets go and sit down and ill tell you dillon heres going to handle things at the sharp end all right pamer said what do you fancy afternoon tea a drink would be more to my taste ferguson told him and im pressed for time pamer led the way along to the terrace bar and they found seats in the corner he and carter ordered gin and tonics ferguson scotch dillon smiled with total charm at the waiter ill have an irish and water bushmills if you have it he had deliberately stressed his ulster accent and carter was frowning dillon did you say i dont think weve met before no dillon said amiably although not for want of trying on your part mr carter sean dillon carters face was very pale now and he turned to ferguson is this some sort of practical joke not that im aware of carter shut up as the waiter brought the drinks and as soon as he had gone continued sean dillon is he who i think he is as ever was dillon told him carter ignored him and youd bring a damned scoundrel like this here to this particular place ferguson a man that the intelligence services have hunted for years that may be ferguson said calmly but hes working for group four now all taken care of under my authority so lets get on with it shall we ferguson you go too far carter was seething yes im told that often but to business to give you a résumé of whats happened there was a burglary at lord north street which may or may not have been genuine however we did discover a bug in the telephone which could indicate some kind of opposition have you any agents working the case he asked carter certainly not id have told you interesting when we were at the inquest on baker this morning dillon noticed two men who gave him pause for thought he noticed one of them again later when we were at the crematorium carter frowned but who could it be god knows but its another reason for having dillon on the job the girl still insists she doesnt know the site of the submarine do you believe her pamer put in i do dillon said shes not the sort to lie and you would know of course carter said acidly dillon shrugged why should she lie about it what would be the point but she must know something pamer said at the very least she must have some sort of a clue who knows ferguson said but at this stage of the game we must proceed on the assumption that she doesnt so what happens next carter demanded dillon will proceed to st john and take it from there the girl mentioned a diver a man named carney bob carney who was a close friend of baker apparently he knows the area like the back of his hand the girl can make a suitable introduction persuade him to help but theres no guarantee he can find the damned thing pamer said well just have to see wont we ferguson looked at his watch well have to go he stood and led the way outside they paused by the wall on the edge of the terrace carter said so thats it then yes ferguson told him dillon and the girl will probably leave for st john tomorrow or the day after well i cant say i like it no one is asking you to ferguson nodded to dillon lets get moving he moved away and dillon smiled at the two of them with all his considerable charm its been a sincere sensation but one thing mr carter he leaned over the parapet and looked down at the brown water of the thames only fifteen feet id say maybe less when the tides up all that security at the front door and nothing here id think about that if i were you twoknot current out there pamer said not that i can swim myself never could should be enough to keep the wolves at bay dillon walked away and carter said it makes my skin crawl to think of that little swine walking around here a free man ferguson must be crazy pamer said yes i see your point but what do you think about the girl do you believe her im not sure carter said and dillon has a point why would she lie so were no further forward i wouldnt say that she knows the area she knew baker intimately the kind of places he went to and so on even if she doesnt know the actual location she may be able to work it out with this carney fellow to help her the diver and dillon of course yes well i prefer to forget about him and under the circumstances what i could do with is another drink and carter turned and led the way into the bar at his suite in paris max santiago listened patiently while pamer gave him details of the meeting on the terrace astonishing he said when pamer had finished if this dillon is the kind of man you describe he would be a formidable opponent but what about the girl i dont know francis well have to see ill be in touch he put the phone down momentarily picked it up again and rang smith in london and when he answered told him exactly what he wanted him to do it was just after six and dillon was in the study reading the evening paper by the fire when the doorbell sounded he went and opened it and found old mr cox standing there a hearse parked at the curb he was holding a cardboard box in his hands is miss grant at home yes ill get her for you dillon told him no need cox handed him the box the ashes theyre in a traveling urn inside give her my best respects he went down to the hearse and dillon closed the door the admiral had gone out to an early evening function at his club but jenny was in the kitchen dillon called to her and she came out what is it he held up the box mr cox just left this for you and turned and went into the study and put it on the table she stood beside him looking at it then gently opened the lid and took out what was inside it wasnt really an urn just a square box in dark patterned metal with a clasp holding the lid in place the brass plate said henry baker she put it down on the table and slumped into a chair thats what it all comes down to at the final end of things five pounds of gray ash in a metal box she broke then and started to cry in total anguish dillon put his hands on her shoulders for a moment only just let it come itll do you good ill make you a cup of coffee and he turned and went along to the kitchen she sat there for a moment and it was as if she couldnt breathe she had to get out needed air she got up went into the hall took the admirals old trenchcoat down from the stand and pulled it on when she opened the door it had started to rain she belted the coat and hurried along the pavement and smith sitting in the van with johnson saw her pass the entrance to the alley perfect he said lets get on with it and he got out and went after her johnson at his heels dillon went along the hall to the study the cup of coffee in his hand and was aware first of the silence he went into the study put down the cup and went back to the hall jenny he called and then noticed that the door was slightly ajar for gods sake he said took down his flying jacket and went out putting it on there was no sign of her the street deserted hed have to take a chance turned left and ran along the pavement toward great peter street it was raining very hard now and he paused on the corner for a moment looking left and then right and saw her at the far end where the street met millbank she was waiting for a gap in the traffic saw her chance and darted across to victoria tower gardens by the river and dillon also saw something else smith and johnson crossing the road behind her at that distance he didnt actually recognize them but it was enough he swore savagely and started to run it was almost dark as jenny crossed to the wall overlooking the thames there was a lamp about every twenty feet rain slanting in a silver spray through a yellow light and a seagoing freighter moved downstream its red and green navigation lights plain she took a few deep breaths to steady herself and felt better it was at that moment she heard a movement behind her turned and found smith and johnson standing there she knew she was in trouble at once what do you want she demanded and started to edge away no need to panic darling smith said a little conversation is all we need a few answers she turned to run and johnson was on her like a flash pinning her arms and forcing her back against the wall jenny isnt it he asked and as she struggled desperately he smiled i like that do it some more leave off smith told him cant you ever think of anything except whats in your pants johnson eased away but moved round to hold her from the rear and smith said now about this uboat in the virgin islands you dont really expect us to believe you dont know where it is she tried to struggle and johnson said go on answer the man or ill give you a slapping a voice called put her down i mean she doesnt know where youve been does she she might catch something dillons zippo lighter flared as he lit the cigarette that dangled from the corner of his mouth he walked forward and smith went to meet him you want trouble youve got it you little squirt and he swung a tremendous punch dillon swayed to one side reaching for the wrist twisted it so that smith cried out in agony falling to one knee dillons clenched fist swung down in a hammer blow of tremendous force across the extended arm snapping the forearm smith cried out again fell over on his side johnson said you little bastard he threw jenny to one side and took an automatic pistol from his lefthand raincoat pocket dillon moved in fast blocking the arm to the side so that the only shot johnson got off went into the ground at the same time the irishman halfturned throwing the other man across his extended leg ramming his heel down so hard that he fractured two of johnsons ribs johnson writhed on the ground in agony and dillon picked up the automatic it was an old italian beretta small caliber somewhere close to a pointtwotwo womans gun dillon said but itll do the job he crouched down beside johnson who do you work for sonny dont say a word smith called who said i was going to johnson spat in dillons face get fucked suit yourself dillon rolled him over put the muzzle of the gun against the back of his left knee and fired johnson gave a terrible cry and dillon took a handful of his hair and pulled his head back do you want me to do the other one ill put you on sticks if you like no johnson moaned we work for santiago max santiago really dillon said and where would i find him he lives in puerto rico but lately hes been in paris and you did the burglary at lord north street yes good boy see how easy it was you stupid bugger smith said to johnson youve just dug your own grave dillon tossed the beretta over the wall into the thames id say hes been very sensible westminster hospitals not too far from here firstclass casualty department and free even for animals like you thanks to the national health service he turned and found jenny staring at him in a daze and he took her arm come on love lets go home as they walked away smith called ill get you for this dillon no you wont dillon said youll put it down to experience and hope that this max santiago feels the same way they emerged from the gardens and paused at the pavement edge waiting for a gap in the traffic dillon said are you all right my god she said wonderingly what kind of man are you sean dillon to do that theyd have done worse to you my love he took her hand and ran with her across the road when they reached the house she went straight upstairs and dillon went into the kitchen and put the kettle on thinking about things as he waited for it to boil max santiago progress indeed something for ferguson to get his teeth into there he was aware of jenny coming down the stairs and going into the study made the coffee put the cups on a tray as he went to join her he realized she was on the phone british airways whats the last flight to paris tonight there was a pause ninethirty can you reserve me a seat grant jennifer grant yes ill pick it up at reservations yes terminal four heathrow she put the phone down and turned as dillon entered he put the tray on the desk doing a runner are you i cant take it i dont understand whats going on ferguson you and now those men and that gun i cant get it out of my mind i was going away anyway but im going to get out now while i can to paris he said i heard you on the phone thats just a jumpingoff point theres someone i have to see someone i want to take this to she picked up the black metal box containing the ashes henrys sister sister dillon frowned im probably about the only person left who knows he had one there are special reasons for that so dont ask me and dont ask me where im going after paris i see she glanced at her watch seven oclock dillon and the flights at ninethirty i can make it only dont tell ferguson not until ive gone help me dillon please then dont waste time in talking about it he said go and get your bags now and ill ring for a taxi will you dillon honestly ill go with you myself she turned and hurried out and dillon sighed and said softly you daft bastard whats getting into you and he picked up the phone it was very quiet in the waiting room of the small private nursing home in farsley street smith sat in an upright chair against the wall his right forearm encased in plaster and held in a sling the half hour after their encounter with dillon had been a nightmare they couldnt afford to go to a public hospital because that would have meant the police so hed had to go and get the van from the alley by lord north street from where hed driven onehanded to victoria tower gardens to retrieve johnson the trip to farsley street had been even worse dr shah emerged from the operating theater a small grayhaired pakistani in green cap and gown a mask hanging around his neck how is he smith asked as well as can be expected with a split kneecap hell limp for the rest of his life that fucking little irish bastard smith said you boys can never stay out of trouble can you does mr santiago know about it why should he smith was alarmed nothing to do with him this one i thought it might thats all he phoned me from paris the other day on business so i knew he was around no not his bag this smith got up ill get myself off home ill be in to see him tomorrow he went out of the glass front door shah watched him go then walked past the reception desk empty at that time of night and went into his office he always believed in covering himself he picked up the phone and rang santiago at the ritz in paris the traffic at that time in the evening was light and they were at heathrow by eight oclock jenny picked up her ticket at the reservation desk and went and booked in for the flight she put her case through but carried the traveling urn time for a drink dillon suggested why not she seemed in better spirits now and waited for him in the corner of the bar until he returned with an irish whisky and a glass of white wine youre feeling better i can tell he said its good to be on the move again to get away from it all what will you tell ferguson nothing about you until the morning youll tell him i flew to paris no point in not doing hed find that out in five minutes from a check on british airways passenger computer that doesnt matter ill be well on my way by then what about you st john next stop tomorrow or the day after see bob carney she said tell him i sent you and introduce yourself to billy and mary jones theyre

know where ill be staying its easy to find someone in st john the flight was called and they finished their drinks went down to the concourse and he accompanied her to the security entrance im sorry if ive made trouble for you with the brigadier she said entirely my pleasure he assured her youre quite a guy dillon she kissed him on the cheek frightening mind you but thank god youre on my side ill see you dillon watched her go then turned and made his way to the nearest row of telephones took out a card with telephone numbers which ferguson had given him and rang the cavendish square number kim answered the phone and informed him that the brigadier was dining at the garrick club dillon thanked him went out to the rank and took the first cab in the line london he said the garrick club you know where that is certainly guv the driver examined dillons opennecked shirt in the rearview mirror wasting your time there guv dressed like that they wont let you in jacketandtie job members and their guests only well have to see wont we dillon told him just take me there when they reached the garrick the driver pulled in at the curb and turned shall i wait guv why not ill be straight out again if what you say is true dillon went up the steps and paused at the desk the uniformed porter was civil enough can i help you sir dillon put on his finest publicschool accent im looking for brigadier charles ferguson i was told he was dining here tonight i need to see him most urgently im afraid i cant allow you upstairs sir we do require a jacket and tie but if you care to wait here ill have a message sent to the brigadier what was the name sir dillon the porter picked up the telephone and spoke to someone he put the phone down hell be with you directly sir dillon moved forward into the hall admiring the grand staircase the oil paintings that covered the walls after a while ferguson appeared up there looked over the rail at him and came down the stairs what on earth do you want dillon im halfway through my dinner oh jesus your honor dillon stepped effortlessly into the stage irishman its so good of you to see me the grand man like yourself and this place so elegant the porter looked alarmed and ferguson took dillon by the arm and propelled him outside to the top of the steps stop playing the fool my steak will be quite ruined by now bad for you at your age red meat dillon lit a cigarette the zippo flaring ive found out who the opposition is good god who a name thats all i have santiago max santiago he lives in puerto rico but recently hes been in paris by the way they also did the burglary how did you find this out i had a runin with our two friends from the coroners court ferguson nodded i see i hope you didnt have to kill anyone now would i do a thing like that ill leave it with you brigadier i feel like an early night he went down the steps to the cab and got in i told you guv the cabby said oh well dillon said you cant win them all take me to lord north street and he leaned back and looked out at the london night scene jack lane only recently divorced lived alone in a flat in west end lane on the edge of hampstead he was cooking a frozen pizza in his microwave oven when the phone rang and his heart sank jack ferguson here dillon had a runin with those two suspicious characters who were at the coroners court and the crematorium theyve been working for a max santiago resident of puerto rico recently in paris is that all sir its enough get yourself down to the office see if french intelligence has anything on him then try the cia the fbi anybody you can think of he must be on somebodys computer did you get anything on this bob carney fellow the diver yes sir an interesting man in more ways than one right you can brief me in the morning but get cracking on this santiago thing now five hours earlier than us in the states remember ill try to sir lane put the phone down with a groan opened the microwave oven and looked with distaste at the pizza what the hell hed nothing better to do and he could always pick up some fish and chips on the way to the ministry at his flat smith was on his second large scotch his right forearm in plaster and held by a sling he felt terrible and it was beginning to hurt a great deal he was pouring another scotch when the phone rang santiago said have you anything for me not yet mr santiago smith searched wildly for something to say maybe tomorrow shah has been on the phone johnson shot and you with a broken arm fucking little irish bastard i believe that was the phrase you used presumably dillon well yes mr santiago we did have a runin with him wed got the girl see and he managed to jump us he had a gun did he really santiago commented dryly and what did you say when he asked you who your employer was smith answered instinctively not a bloody thing it was johnson who he stopped dead and santiago said carry on tell me the worst all right mr santiago the stupid bastard did give dillon your name there was silence for a moment and then santiago said im disappointed in you my friend most disappointed the phone clicked and the line went dead smith knew what that meant more frightened than he had ever been in his life he packed a suitcase onehanded retrieved a thousand pounds mad money he kept in a sugar tin in the kitchen and left two minutes later he was behind the wheel of the van and driving away onehanded he had an old girlfriend in aberdeen whod always had a weakness for him scotland that was the place to go as far away from johnson as possible at the nursing home shah sat behind his desk the phone to his ear after a while he put it down sighed heavily and went out he went into the small pharmacy at the side of the operating theater fitted a syringe together and filled it from a phial he took from the medicine cupboard when he opened the door at the end of the corridor johnson was sleeping linked to a drip shah stood looking down at him for a moment then bared the left forearm and inserted the needle johnson sucked in air very deeply for about five times then stopped altogether shah checked for vital signs found none and went out he paused at the reception desk picked up the phone and dialed a voice said deepdene funeral service how may we serve you shah here i have a disposal for you ready now yes well be there in half an hour thank you shah replaced the receiver and went back to his office humming to himself it was almost eleven when travers returned to lord north street and found dillon sitting in the study reading a book jennifer gone to bed travers asked more than an hour ago she was very tired not surprising been through a hell of a lot that girl fancy a nightcap dillon cant offer you irish but a good single malt perhaps fine by me travers poured it into two glasses gave him one and sat opposite cheers what are you reading epictetus dillon held the book up he was a greek philosopher of the stoic school i know who he was dillon travers said patiently im just surprised that you do he says here that a life not put to the test is not worth living would you agree to that admiral as long as it doesnt mean bombing the innocent in the name of some sacred cause or shooting people in the back then i suppose i do god forgive you admiral but i never planted a bomb in the way you mean or shot anyone in the back in me life god forgive me indeed dillon because for some obscure reason im inclined to believe you travers swallowed his whisky and got up good night to you he said and went out things had gone better than smith had expected and he soon had the hang of handling the wheel onehanded just the fingers of his right hand touching the bottom of the wheel the rain wasnt helping of course and beyond watford he missed a turning for the motorway and found himself on a long dark road no other vehicles in sight and then headlights were switched on behind and a vehicle came up far too fast it started to overtake him a large black truck and smith cursed frightened to death knowing what this was and he frantically worked at the wheel the truck swerved in knocking him sideways and with nowhere to go the van spun off the road smashed through a fence and turned over twice on its way down a seventyfoot bank it came to a crumpled halt and smith still conscious as he lay on his side in the cab could smell petrol as the fractured tank spilled its contents there was the noise of someone scrambling down the bank and footsteps approached help me smith moaned im in here someone struck a match it was the last thing he remembered one final moment of horror as it was flicked toward him through the darkness and the petrol fireballed in paris at charles de gaulle airport it was almost midnight by the time jenny grant had retrieved her suitcase and she walked out into the concourse quickly and found an avis car rental desk youre still open thank goodness she said as she got her passport and driving license out but of course the young woman on duty replied in english we always wait until the final arrival of the day even when there is a delay how long will you require the car for mademoiselle perhaps a week im not certain but ill be returning here thats fine the girl busied herself with the paperwork and took a print from her charge card follow me and ill take you to the car ten minutes later jenny was driving out of the airport sitting behind the wheel of a citroën saloon and headed west normandy the destination the traveling urn was on the passenger seat beside her she touched it briefly then settled back to concentrate on her driving she had a long way to go would probably have to drive through the night but that didnt matter because london and the terrible events of the last few days were behind her and she was free dillon rose early was in the kitchen cooking bacon and eggs at seventhirty when travers entered in his dressing gown smells good the admiral said jenny about yet well to be honest with you admiral shes not been about for some time dillon poured boiling water into a china teapot there you go a nice cup of tea never mind that what are you talking about well drink your tea like a good lad and ill tell you it began with her getting upset and going for a walk dillon worked his way through his bacon and eggs while he related the events of the previous night when he was finished the admiral just sat there frowning you took too much on yourself dillon shed had enough admiral dillon told him its as simple as that and i didnt see any reason to stop her and she wouldnt tell you where she was going first stop paris thats all i know after that to some unknown destination to see bakers sister shes taking the ashes to her thats obvious yes i suppose so travers sighed wearily ill have to tell ferguson he wont like it wont like it one little bit well its time he discovered what an unfair world it is dillon told him and opened the morning paper travers sighed heavily again gave up went to his study and sat at the desk only then did he reluctantly reach for the phone it was just after nine when jenny grant braked to a halt outside the convent of the little sisters of pity in the village of briac five miles outside bayeux she had driven through the night was totally drained iron gates stood open she drove inside and stopped in a graveled circular drive in front of the steps leading up to the door of the beautiful old building a young novice a white working smock over her robes was raking the gravel jenny got out holding the traveling urn id like to see the mother superior its most urgent ive come a long way the young woman said in good english i believe shes in chapel well see shall we she led the way through pleasant gardens to a small chapel which stood separate from the main building the door creaked when she opened it it was a place of shadows an image of the virgin mary floating in candlelight and the smell of incense was overpowering the young novice went and whispered to the nun who knelt in prayer at the altar rail then returned shell be with you in a moment she went out and jenny waited after a while the mother superior crossed herself and stood up she turned and came toward her a tall woman in her fifties with a sweet serene face i am the mother superior how may i help you sister maria baker thats right she looked puzzled do i know you my dear im jenny jenny grant henry told me hed spoken to you about me sister maria baker smiled but of course so youre jenny and then she looked concerned theres something wrong i can tell what is it henry was killed in an accident in london the other day jenny held out the traveling urn ive brought you his ashes oh my dear there was pain on sister maria bakers face and she crossed herself then took the urn may he rest in peace it was so kind of you to do this thing yes but it wasnt just that i dont know which way to turn so many awful things have happened jenny burst into tears and sat down in the nearest pew sister maria baker put a hand on her head what is it my dear tell me when jenny was finished it seemed very quiet in the chapel sister maria baker said mystery upon mystery here only one thing is certain henrys unfortunate discovery of that submarine is of critical importance to many people but enough of that now i know jenny said and ill have to go back to st john if only to help sean dillon hes a bad man sister i know that and yet so kind to me isnt that strange not really my dear sister maria baker drew her to her feet i suspect that mr dillon is no longer so certain that what he longed for was right but all that can wait you need a few days of total rest a time to reflect and thats doctors orders i am a doctor you know were a nursing order now lets find you a room and they went out together leaving the chapel to the quiet when dillon and travers were shown into the flat at cavendish square just before noon ferguson was sitting by the fire going over a file jack lane was standing by the window looking out dillon said god save all here ferguson glanced up coldly very amusing dillon well the correct reply is god save you kindly dillon said but well let it pass what in the hell were you playing at she wanted to go brigadier shed had enough for the moment it was as simple as that the attack by those two apes in victoria tower gardens finished her off so you just decided to go along with her not her her needs brigadier dillon lit a cigarette she told me she wanted to see bakers sister and begged me not to ask her where that would be said there were special reasons she didnt want to divulge would you be interested to know that lane has run a check and cant find any mention of baker having a sister not at all jenny said she was probably the only person who knew he had one some dark family secret perhaps so she flew to paris and took off for god knows where lane cut in we did a check at charles de gaulle she hired a car at the avis desk and after that who the hell knows ferguson was coldly angry dillon said i told you shed had enough but we need her god dammit shell return to st john when shes ready in the meantime well have to manage dillon shrugged you cant have everything in life not even you ferguson sat there glaring at him thoroughly angry then said at least we have some sort of a lead tell him jack lane said max santiago hes the driving force behind a hotel group in the states home in puerto rico hotels in florida vegas various other places and a couple of casinos is that a fact dillon said yes my first break was with the fbi their highly illegal sensitive red information file its highly illegal because it lists people who cant be proved to have broken the law in any way and why would santiago be on that suspicion of having contacts with the colombian drug cartel really dillon smiled the dog it gets worse samson cay holding company registered in the usa and switzerland goes backwards through three other companies until you get to santiagos name samson cay dillon leaned forward now that is interesting a direct link but why lane said santiagos sixtythree old aristocratic family born in cuba father a general and very involved with batista the family only got out by the skin of their teeth in nineteen fiftynine when castro took over given asylum in america and eventual citizenship but according to the fbi file the interesting thing is they had not much more than the clothes they stood up in i see dillon said so how did good old max develop a hotel chain that must be worth millions the drug connection cant explain that all that colombian drug business is much more recent the plain answer is nobody knows travers had been sitting listening to all this looking bewildered so what is the connection to samson cay and u martin bormann all that stuff well the fbi file took me to the cia lane said they have him on their computer too but for a different reason apparently santiagos father was a great friend of general franco in spain an absolutely rabid fascist which could be the link with nineteen fortyfive the end of the war in europe and martin bormann ferguson said dillon nodded i see it now the kamaradenwerk action for comrades could be the brigadier nodded more than likely just take one aspect santiago and his father reach america flat broke and yet mysteriously manage to get their hands on the very large funds necessary to go into business we know for a fact that the nazi party salted away millions all over the world to enable their work to keep going he shrugged all conjecture but it makes sense except for one thing dillon said and whats that how santiago knew about baker finding u i mean how did he know about him coming to london staying at lord north street with the admiral jenny me he does seem singularly wellinformed brigadier i must say dillons got a point travers put in ferguson said the point is well taken and well find the answer in time but for the moment well just have to get on with it youll leave for the caribbean tomorrow just as we planned dillon said exactly british airways to antigua then onwards to st john dillon said would you think it likely that max santiago will turn up there hes had his fingers in everything else so far well just have to see as i said lane interrupted he has a home in puerto rico and thats very convenient for the virgin islands apparently he runs one of those multimilliondollar motor yachts he looked at his file its called the maria blanco captain and a crew of six if he turns up youll just have to do the best you can ferguson said thats what youre going to be there for youll have your platinum card and travelers checks for twentyfive thousand dollars your cover is quite simple youre a wealthy irishman god save us i didnt know there was such a thing dont be stupid dillon ferguson told him youre a wealthy irishman with a company in cork general electronics computers and so on weve provided a nice touch for you when you arrive in antigua therell be a seaplane waiting you can fly a seaplane i presume i could fly a jumbo if i had to brigadier but then you knew that so i did what kind of plane did you say it was jack a cessna sir lane turned to dillon apparently its got floats and wheels so you can land on sea or on land i know the type dillon said ive flown planes like it the center of things in st john is a town called cruz bay the inspector carried on on occasions theyve had a commercial seaplane service round there so theres a ramp in the harbor facilities and so on ferguson passed a folder across the documents department have done you proud two passports irish and british in your own name being born in belfast youre entitled to those caa commercial pilots license with a seaplane rating they think of everything dillon said youll also find your tickets and travelers checks in there youll be staying at caneel bay one of the finest resorts in the world stayed there once myself some years ago paradise dillon youre a lucky chap paradise on a private peninsula not too far from cruz bay dillon opened the file and leafed through some of the brochures situated on its own private peninsula seven beaches three restaurants he read aloud it sounds my kind of place its anyones kind of place ferguson said the two best cottages are e and d ambassadors stay there dillon film stars i believe kissinger was in e once also harry truman im overwhelmed dillon said it will all help with your image one thing lane said its an old tradition there that there are no telephones in the cottages there are public telephones dotted around but weve arranged for you to have a cellular portable phone theyll give it to you when you check in dillon nodded so i get there then what do i do thats really up to you ferguson said we hoped the girl would be there to assist but thanks to your misplaced gallantry that isnt on for the moment however i would suggest you contact this diver she mentioned this bob carney he runs a firm called paradise watersports based at caneel bay theres a brochure there teaches tourists to dive lane said dillon found the brochure and glanced through it it was attractively set out with excellent underwater photos but the most interesting one was of captain bob carney himself seated at the wheel of a boat goodlooking tanned and very fit jesus dillon said if you wanted an actor to play that fella youd have trouble finding someone suitable at central casting ferguson said an interesting man this carney chap tell him jack lane opened another file born in mississippi in nineteen fortyeight but he spent most of his youth in atlanta wife karye a boy of eight walker girl aged five named wallis he did a year at the university of mississippi then joined the marines and went to vietnam did two tours in sixtyeight and sixtynine i always heard that was a bad time dillon said toward the end of his service he was with the nd combined action group he was wounded received two purple hearts the vietnamese cross of valour and was recommended for a bronze star that one got lost in channels and afterwards he took to diving not at first he went to georgia state university courtesy of the marine corps and did a bachelors degree in philosophy did a year in a graduate school in oceanography is there anything else lane consulted the file he has a captains ticket up to sixteen hundred tons ran supply boats in the mexican gulf to the oil rigs was a welder and diver in the oilfields went to st john in seventynine lane closed the file so theres your man ferguson said youve got to get him on our side dillon offer him anything money no object within reason that is dillon smiled im surprised at you brigadier money is never number one on the list to men like carney thats as may be ferguson got up thats it then ill see you again before you leave in the morning what time is his plane jack nine oclock sir gets into antigua just after two in the afternoon their time then i certainly wont see you ferguson sighed i suppose i must see you off in the right style bring him to the garrick for dinner at seventhirty garth but now you must excuse me hes all heart isnt he dillon said to the admiral as they emerged onto the pavement never would have thought of describing him in quite that way travers said and raised his umbrella at a passing cab it was perhaps an hour later that ferguson met simon carter in the snug of a public house called the st george not too far from the ministry of defence he ordered a gin and tonic thought id better bring you up to date he said theres a lot happened tell me carter said so ferguson did the attack on jenny by smith and johnson santiago jennys flight everything when he finished carter sat there thinking about it the santiago thing thats very interesting your chap lane may have a point the fascist angle general franco and all that it would certainly fit but dillons right none of it explains how santiago seems to be so well informed so what do you intend to do about him nothing i can do officially ferguson said hes an american citizen a multimillionaire businessman and in the eyes of the world highly respected i mean that stuff on the fbi and cia files is confidential and there is the fact that we dont want to involve the americans in this in any way carter pointed out heaven forbid the last thing we want so were in dillons hands the deputy director said i know and i dont like it one little bit ferguson stood up youll let pamer know where were at of course carter told him perhaps this carney chap the diver you mentioned can give dillon a lead ill keep you posted ferguson said and went out in paris santiago who was going to a blacktie dinner at the american embassy was adjusting his tie in the mirror when the phone rang it was pamer and santiago listened while he brought him up to date so they know your name max pamer was very agitated and all thanks to those damned men who were working for you forget them santiago said theyre yesterdays news whats that supposed to mean dont be stupid francis youre a big boy now try to act like one pamer was horrified all right max but what are we going to do they cant lay a finger on me francis im an american citizen and they wont want to include the american government in this thing in fact ferguson is acting quite illegally in sending dillon to operate in another countrys sovereign territory the uboat is in american waters remember so what will you do ill fly to puerto rico in the morning then sail down to samson cay and operate from there dillon must stay at either the hyatt or at caneel bay if he uses a hotel and a simple phone call will confirm that i suspect caneel bay if he wishes to cultivate the diver this carney i suppose so a pity about the girl shell turn up eventually though and i still feel she could be the key to this thing she could know more than she realizes lets hope so for your sake particularly i hope so too francis dillon suitably attired in his blazer and a guards tie followed travers up the imposing stairway at the garrick club jesus theyve got more portraits here than the national gallery he said and followed travers through to the bar where ferguson waited ah there you are he said im one ahead of you thought wed have a spot of champagne dillon just to wish you bon voyage you prefer krug as i recall they sat in the corner and the barman brought the bottle over in an ice bucket and opened it he filled three glasses and retired ferguson thanked him then took an envelope from his pocket and passed it across just in case things get rough theres the name of a contact of mine in charlotte amalie thats the main town in st thomas what you might call a dealer in hardware hardware travers looked bewildered what on earth would he need with hardware dillon put the envelope in his pocket youre a lovely fella admiral and long may you stay that way ferguson toasted dillon good luck my friend youre going to need it he emptied his glass now lets eat there was something in his eyes something that said there was more to this much more had to be dillon told himself but he got up obediently and followed travers and the brigadier out of the bar and at briac at the convent of the little sisters of pity jenny sat alone in the rear pew of the chapel resting her arms on the backrest of the pew in front of her gazing at the flickering candlelight at the altar and brooding the door creaked open and sister maria baker entered there you are you should be in bed i know sister but i was restless and wanted to think about things sister maria baker sat down beside her such as dillon for one thing hes done many terrible things he was a member of the ira for example and when those two men attacked me last night she shivered he was so coldly savage so ruthless and yet to me he was kindness itself and so understanding so jenny turned to her im not a good christian in fact when henry found me i was a very great sinner but i do want to understand god i really do so whats the problem why does god allow violence and killing to take place at all why does he allow the violence in dillon the simplest thing to answer my child what god does allow is free will he gives us all a choice you me and the dillons of this world i suppose so jenny sighed but i will have to go back to st john and not just to help dillon but somehow for henry too why do you feel so strongly because henry really didnt tell me where he discovered that uboat which means the secret must have died with him and yet i have the oddest feeling that it didnt that the information is back there in st john but i just cant think straight it wont come sister she was distressed again and sister maria baker took her hands thats enough you need sleep a few days rest will work wonders youll remember then what you cant now i promise you now lets have you in bed she took jenny by the hand and led her out fergusons daimler picked dillon up at seventhirty the following morning to take him to gatwick and travers insisted on accompanying him the journey out of town at that time in the morning with all the heavy traffic going the other way was relatively quick and dillon was ready to go through passport control and security by eightthirty theyve already called it i see travers said so it seems look here dillon travers said awkwardly well never see eyetoeye you and me i mean the ira and all that stuff but i want to thank you for what you did for the girl i liked her liked her a lot and so did i travers shook dillons hand take care this santiago sounds bad news ill try admiral another thing travers sounded more awkward than ever charles ferguson is a dear friend but hes also the most devious old sod ive ever known in my life watch yourself in the clinches there too i will admiral i will dillon said watched the admiral walk away then turned and went through a nice man he thought as the jumbo lifted off and climbed steadily a decent man but nobodys fool and he was right there was more to all this than the surface of things nothing was more certain than that and ferguson knew what it was devious old sod an apt description ah well i can be just as devious dillon murmured and accepted the glass of champagne the stewardess offered the flight to antigua took a little over eight hours thanks to a tailwind and they arrived just after two oclock local time it was hot really hot very noticeable after london dillon felt quite cheered and strode ahead of everybody else toward the airport building wearing black cord slacks and a denim shirt his black flying jacket over one shoulder when he reached the entrance a young black woman in a pale blue uniform was standing there with a board bearing his name dillon paused im dillon she smiled im judy mr dillon ill see you through immigration and so on and then take you to your plane you represent the handling agents he asked as they walked through thats right i need to see your pilots license and there are a couple of forms to fill in for the aviation authority but we can do that while were waiting for the luggage to come through twenty minutes later she was driving him out to the far side of the runway in a courtesy bus an engineer called tony in white overalls sitting beside her the cessna was parked beside a number of private planes slightly incongruous because of its floats with wheels protruding beneath shouldnt give you any problems tony said as he stowed dillons two suitcases flies as sweet as a nut of course a lot of people are nervous about flying in the islands with a single engine but the beauty about this baby is you can always come down in the water or something like that dillon said tony laughed reached into the cabin and pointed theres an air log listing all the islands and their airfields and charts our chief pilot has marked your course from here to cruz bay in st john very straightforward around two hundred and fifty miles takes about an hour and a half he glanced at his watch you should be there by fourthirty its american territory but customs and immigration are expecting you theyll be waiting at the ramp at cruz bay when youre close enough call in to st thomas and theyll let them know youre coming oh and there will be a selfdrive jeep waiting for you judy smiled i think thats about it thanks for everything dillon gave her that special smile of his with total charm and kissed her on the cheek judy youve been great he shook tonys hand many thanks a moment later he was in the pilots seat closing the door he strapped himself in adjusted his earphones then fired the engine and called the tower there was a small plane landing and the tower told him to wait they gave him the good word and he taxied to the end of the runway there was a short pause then the go signal and he boosted power roared down the runway and pulled back the column at exactly the right moment the cessna climbing effortlessly out over the azure sea it was an hour later that max santiago flew into san juan where he was escorted through passport control and customs with a minimum of fuss by an airport official to where his chauffeur algaro waited with the black mercedes limousine at your orders señor he said in spanish good to see you algaro santiago said everything is arranged as i requested oh yes señor ive packed the usual clothes took them down to the maria blanco myself this morning captain serra is expecting you algaro wasnt particularly large five foot seven or eight but immensely powerful his hair cropped so short that he almost looked bald a scar running from the corner of the left eye to the mouth combined to give him a sinister and threatening appearance in spite of the smart gray chauffeurs uniform he wore he was totally devoted to santiago who had saved him from a life sentence for the stabbing to death of a young prostitute two years previously by the liberal dispensing of funds not only to lawyers but corrupt officials the luggage arrived at that moment and while the porters stowed it santiago said good you neednt take me to the house ill go straight to the boat as you say señor they drove away turned into the traffic of the main road and algaro said captain serra said you asked for a couple of divers in the crew its taken care of excellent santiago picked up the local newspaper which had been left on the seat for him and opened it algaro watched him in the mirror is there a problem señor santiago laughed youre like an animal algaro you always smell trouble but thats what you employ me for señor quite right santiago folded the newspaper selected a cigarette from an elegant gold case and lit it yes my friend there is a problem a problem called dillon may i know about him señor why not youll probably have to how shall i put it take care of him for me algaro santiago smiled so listen carefully and learn all about him because this man is good algaro very good indeed it was a perfect afternoon the limitless blue sky with only the occasional cloud as dillon drifted across the caribbean at five thousand feet it was pure pleasure the sea constantly changing color below green and blue the occasional boat the reefs and shoals clearly visible at that height he passed the islands of nevis and st kitts calling in to the local airport moved on flying directly over the tiny dutch island of saba he had a brisk tailwind and made good time better than he had expected found st croix on his port side on the horizon no more than an hour after leaving antigua soon after that the main line of the virgins lifted out of the heat haze to greet him st thomas to port the smaller bulk of st john to starboard tortola beyond he checked the chart and saw peter island below tortola and east of st john norman island south of it and south of there was samson cay dillon called in to st thomas airport to notify them of his approach the controller said cleared for landing at cruz bay await customs and immigration officials there dillon went down low turning to starboard found samson cay with no difficulty and crossed over at a thousand feet there was a harbor dotted with yachts a dock cottages and a hotel block grouped around the beach amidst palm trees the airstrip was to the north no control tower just an air sock on a pole there were people lounging on the beach down there some stood up and waved he waggled his wings and flew on found cruz bay fifteen minutes later and drifted in for a perfect landing just outside the harbor he entered the harbor and found the ramp with little difficulty there were several uniformed officials standing there and one or two other people all black he taxied forward let the wheels down and ran up onto the ramp killed the engine one of the men in customs uniform held a couple of wedgeshaped blocks by a leather strap and he came and positioned them behind the wheels dillon climbed out lafayette we are here everyone laughed genially and the immigration people checked his passport perfectly happy with the irish one while the customs men had a look at the luggage everything was sweetness and light and they all departed with mutual expressions of goodwill as they walked away a young woman in uniform rose pink this time who had been waiting patiently at one side came forward ive got your jeep here as ordered mr dillon if you could sign for me and show me your license you can be on your way thats very kind of you dillon said and carried the suitcases across and slung them on the backseat as he signed she said im sorry we didnt have an automatic in at the moment i could change it for you tomorrow ive got one being returned no thanks i prefer to be in charge myself he smiled can i drop you somewhere thats nice of you she got in beside him and he drove away about three hundred yards further on as he came to the road she said this is fine there was an extremely attractive looking development opposite whats that he asked mongoose junction our version of a shopping mall but much nicer theres also a super bar and a couple of great restaurants ill look it over sometime she got out turn left follow the main road caneel bays only a couple of miles out theres a car park for residents from there its a short walk down to reception youve been very kind dillon told her and drove away the maria blanco had cost santiago two million dollars and was his favorite toy he preferred being on board to staying at his magnificent house above the city of san juan particularly since the death of his wife maria from cancer ten years earlier dear maria his maria blanco the one soft spot in his life of course this was no ordinary boat had every conceivable luxury needed a captain and five or six crew members to man her santiago sat at a table on the upper deck enjoying the sun and a cup of excellent coffee algaro standing behind him the captain julian serra a burly blackbearded man in uniform sat opposite he like most of santiagos employees had been with him for years had frequently taken part in activities of a highly questionable nature so you see my dear serra we have a problem on our hands here the man dillon will probably approach this diver this bob carney when he reaches st john wrecks are notoriously difficult to find señor serra told him ive had experts tell me theyve missed one by a few yards on occasions its not easy theres a lot of sea out there i agree santiago said i still think the girl must have some sort of an answer but she may take her time returning in the meantime well surprise mr dillon as much as possible he smiled up at algaro think you can handle that algaro with pleasure señor algaro said good santiago turned back to serra what about the crew guerra first mate solona and mugica as usual and ive brought in two men with good diving experience javier noval and vicente pinto and theyre reliable absolutely and were expected at samson cay yes señor i spoke to prieto personally you wish to stay there i think so we could always drop anchor off paradise beach at caneel of course ill think about it santiago finished his coffee and stood up right lets get moving then dillon took to caneel from the moment he got there he parked the jeep and carrying his own bags followed the obvious path there was a magnificent restaurant on a bluff up above him circular with open sides below it was the ruins of a sugar mill from the old plantation days the vegetation was extremely lush palm trees everywhere he paused noticing a gift shop on the left and set back more important the smaller shop next to it said paradise watersports carneys place he remembered that from the brochure and went and had a look as he would have expected there were diving suits of various kinds on display but the door was locked so he carried on and came to the front desk lobby there were three or four people being dealt with at the desk before him so he dropped his bags and went back outside there was a very large bar area open at the sides but under a huge barnlike roof a vital necessity in a climate where instant heavy rain showers were common beyond was caneel bay he knew that from the brochure boats of various kinds at anchor a pleasant palmfringed beach beside another restaurant people still taking their ease in the early evening sun one or two windsurfers still out there dillon glanced at his watch it was almost fivethirty and he started to turn away to go back to the front desk when he saw a boat coming in it was a foot sport fisherman with a flying bridge sleek and white but what intrigued dillon were the dozen or so airtanks stacked in their holders in the stern and there were four people moving around on deck packing their gear into dive bags carney was on the flying bridge handling the wheel in jeans and bare feet stripped to the waist very tanned the blond hair bleached by the sun dillon recognized him from the photo in the brochure the name of the boat was sea raider he saw that as it got closer moved to the end of the dock as carney maneuvered it in one of the dive students tossed a line dillon caught it and expertly tied up at the stern then he moved along to the prow where the boat was bouncing against its fenders reached over and got the other line dillon lit a cigarette his zippo flashing and carney killed the engines and came down the ladder thanks he called dillon said my pleasure captain carney and he turned and walked away along the dock one of the receptionists from the front desk took him out to his cottage in a small courtesy bus the grounds were an absolute delight not only sweeping grassland and palm trees but every kind of tropical plant imaginable the entire peninsula is private she said as they followed a narrow road we have seven beaches and as youll notice most of the cottages are grouped around them ive only seen two restaurants so far he commented yes sugar mill and beach terrace theres a third at the end of the peninsula turtle bay thats more formal you know collar and tie and so on its wonderful for an evening drink you look out over the windward passage to dozens of little islands carval rock whistling cay of course a lot further away youll see jost van dyke and tortola but theyre in the british virgins it sounds idyllic he said she braked in a turned circle beside a twostoried flatroofed building surrounded by trees and bushes of every description here we are cottage seven there were steps up to the upper level it isnt all one then dillon asked she opened the door into a little vestibule people do sometimes take it all but up here its divided into two units seven d and seven e the doors faced each other she unlocked d and led the way in there was a superb shower room a bar area with a spare icebox the bedroomcumsitting room was enormous and very pleasantly furnished with tiled floor and comfortable chairs and a sofa and there were venetian blinds at the windows two enormous fans turning in the ceiling is this all right she asked i should say so dillon nodded at the enormous bed jesus but a man would have to be a sprinter to catch his wife in that thing she laughed and opened the double doors to the terrace and led the way out there was a large seating area and a narrow part round the corner that fronted the other windows there was a grassy slope trees and a small beach below three or four large yachts of the oceangoing type at anchor some distance from shore paradise beach she said there was another beach way over to the right with a line of cottages behind it whats that he asked scott beach and turtle bay is a little further on you could walk there in fifteen minutes although there is a courtesy bus service with stops dotted round the grounds there was a knock at the door she went back inside and supervised the bellboy leaving the luggage dillon followed her she turned i think thats everything there was the question of a telephone dillon said you dont have them in the cottages i understand my but i was forgetting that she opened her carrying bag and took out a cellular telephone plus a spare battery and charger she put it on the coffee table with a card your number and instructions are there she laughed now i hope that really is everything dillon opened the door for her youve been very kind oh one more thing our general manager mr nicholson asked me to apologize for not being here to greet you he had business on st thomas thats all right im sure well catch up with each other later i believe hes irish too she said and left dillon opened the icebox under the bar unit discovering every kind of drink one could imagine including two halfbottles of champagne he opened one of them poured a glass then went out and stood on the terrace looking out over the water well old son this will do to take along he said softly and drank the champagne with conscious pleasure in the end of course the sparkle on the water was too seductive and he went inside unpacked hanging his clothes in the ample wardrobe space then undressed and found some swimming trunks a moment later he was hurrying down the grass bank to the little beach which for the moment he had entirely to himself the water was incredibly warm and very clear he waded forward and started to swim there was a sudden swirl over on his right an enormous turtle surfaced looked at him curiously then moved sedately away dillon laughed aloud for pure pleasure then swam lazily out to sea in the direction of the moored yachts turning after some fifty yards to swim back behind him the maria blanco came round the point from caneel bay and dropped anchor about three hundred yards away santiago had changed his mind about samson cay only after captain serra had brought him a message from the radio room an enquiry by shiptoshore telephone had confirmed that dillon had arrived at caneel bay hes booked into cottage seven serra said interesting santiago told him thats the best accommodation in the resort he thought about it tapping his fingers on the table and made his decision i know it well it overlooks paradise beach well anchor there serra for tonight at least as you say señor serra went back to the bridge and algaro who had been standing by the stern rail poured santiago another cup of coffee santiago said i want you to go ashore tonight take someone with you theres the landrover serra leaves permanently in the car park at mongoose junction hell give you the keys what do you require me to do señor call in at caneel see what dillon is up to if he goes out follow him do i give him a problem algaro asked hopefully a small one algaro santiago smiled nothing too strenuous my pleasure señor algaro said and poured him another cup of coffee dillon didnt feel like anything too formal wore only a soft white cotton shirt and cream linen slacks both by armani as he walked through the evening darkness toward caneel beach he carried a small torch in one pocket provided by the management for help with the dark spots it was such a glorious night that he didnt need it the terrace restaurant was already doing a fair amount of business but then americans liked to dine early he knew that he went to the front desk cashed a travelers check for five hundred dollars then tried the bar he had never cared for the usual caribbean liking for rum punches and fruit drinks settled for an old fashioned vodka martini cocktail which the genial black waitress brought for him quite rapidly a group of musicians were setting up their instruments on the small bandstand and way out across the sea he could see the lights of st thomas it really was very pleasant too easy to forget he had a job to do he finished his drink signed for it and went along to the restaurant where he introduced himself to the head waiter and was seated the menu was tempting enough he ordered grilled sea scallops a caesar salad followed by caribbean lobster tail no krug but a very acceptable halfbottle of veuve clicquot completed the picture he was finished by nine oclock and wandered down to reception algaro was sitting in one of the leather armchairs looking at the new york times the girl on duty was the one whod taken dillon to the cottage she smiled everything okay mr dillon perfect tell me do you know a bar called jennys place i sure do its on the front just past mongoose junction on your way into town they stay open late i presume usually till around two in the morning many thanks he moved away and walked along the dock lighting a cigarette behind him algaro went out and hurried along the car park by sugar mill laughter drifting down from the people dining up there he moved past the taxis waiting for customers to where the landrover waited felipe guerra the maria blancos mate sat behind the wheel algaro got in beside him and guerra said did you find him i was within touching distance he was asking about that bar jennys place you know it on the front in cruz bay sure lets take a look from the sound of it he intends to pay the place a visit maybe we can make it interesting for him guerra said and drove away dillon drove past mongoose junction located jennys place then turned and went back to the junction car park he walked along the front of the harbor through the warm night went up the steps glanced up at the red neon sign and entered the cafe side of things was busy mary jones taking orders while two waitresses one white the other black worked themselves into a frenzy as they attempted to serve everybody the bar was busy also although billy jones seemed to be having no difficulty in managing on his own dillon found a vacant stool at the end of the bar and waited until billy was free to deal with him irish whisky whatever youve got and water he noticed bob carney seated at the other end of the long bar a beer in front of him talking to a couple of men who looked like seamen carney was smiling and then as he turned to reach for his beer became aware of dillons scrutiny and frowned billy brought the whisky and dillon said youre billy jones the other man looked wary and who might you be dillons the name sean dillon im staying at caneel jenny told me to look you up and say hello jenny did billy frowned when you see miss jenny in london i went to henry bakers cremation with her you did billy turned and called to his wife woman get over here she finished taking an order then joined them this is my wife mary tell her what you just told me i was with jenny in london dillon held out his hand sean dillon i was at bakers funeral not that there was much doing she said he was an atheist so all we did was attend the crematorium mary crossed herself god rest him now but he did think that way and jenny what about her where is she she was upset dillon said she told me baker had a sister mary frowned and looked at her husband we never knew that are you sure mister oh yes he had a sister living in france jenny wouldnt say where simply flew off to paris from london wanted to take his ashes to the sister and when is she coming back all she said was she needed a few days to come to terms with the death and so on as i happened to be coming out here she asked me to say hello well i thank you for that mary said weve been so worried a customer called from one of the tables ill have to go ill see you later she hurried away and billy grinned im needed too but hang around man hang around he went to serve three clamouring customers and dillon savoured his whisky and looked around the room algaro and guerra were drinking beer in a corner booth they were not looking at him apparently engaged in conversation dillons eyes barely paused passed on and yet he recognized him from the reception at caneel the cropped hair the brutal face the scar from eye to the mouth judas iscariot come to life dillon murmured and whats your game son for he had learned the hard way over many years never to believe in coincidence the two men carney had been talking to had moved on and he was sitting alone now the stool next to him vacant dillon finished his drink moved along the bar through the crowd do you mind if i join you carneys eyes were very blue in the tanned face should i dillon sean dillon dillon eased on to the stool im staying at caneel cottage seven jenny grant told me to look you up you know jenny i was just with her in london dillon said her friend henry baker was killed in an accident over there i heard about that jenny was over for the inquest and the funeral dillon nodded to billy jones who came over ill have another irish give captain carney whatever he wants ill have a beer carney said did jenny bury him in london no dillon told him cremation he had a sister in france i never knew that jenny told me few people did it seems he preferred it that way said she wanted to take the ashes to her last i saw of her she was flying to paris said shed be back here in a few days billy brought the whisky and the beer and carney said so youre here on vacation thats right i got in this evening would you be the guy who came in the cessna floatplane flew up from antigua dillon nodded on vacation something like that dillon lit a cigarette the thing is im interested in doing a little diving and jenny suggested i speak to you said you were the best thats nice of her she said you taught henry thats true carney nodded henry was a good diver foolish but still pretty good why do you say foolish it never pays to dive on your own you should always have a buddy with you henry would never listen he would just up and go whenever he felt like it and thats no good when youre diving regularly accidents can happen no matter how well you plan things carney drank some more beer and looked dillon full in the face but then id say youre the kind of man who knows that mr dillon he had the slow easy accent of the american southerner as if everything he said was carefully considered dillon said well in the end it was an accident that killed him in london he looked the wrong way and stepped off the pavement in front of a london bus he was dead in a second carney said calmly you know the old arab saying everybody has an appointment in samarra you miss death in one place hell get you in another at least for henry it was quick thats a remarkably philosophical attitude dillon told him carney smiled im a remarkably philosophical fellow mr dillon i did two tours in vietnam everything has been a bonus since so you want to do some diving thats right you any good i manage dillon told him but im always willing to learn okay ill see you at the dock at caneel at nine oclock in the morning ill need some gear no problem ill open the shop for you fine dillon swallowed his whisky ill see you then he hesitated tell me something you see the two guys in the booth in the far corner i particularly mean the ugly one with the scar do you happen to know who they are sure carney said they work on a big motor yacht from puerto rico that calls in here now and then its owned by a man called santiago its usually based at samson cay thats over on the british side of things the younger guy is the mate guerra the other is a real mean son of a bitch called algaro why do you say that he halfkilled a fisherman outside one of the bars here about nine months ago he was lucky to get away without doing some prison time they laid a real hefty fine on him but his boss paid it so i heard hes the kind of guy to step around ill certainly remember that dillon got up tomorrow then and he walked out through the crowd billy came down the bar you want another beer bob what i need is something to eat my wife being away and all carney said what did you make of him dillon he said he was in london with jenny happened to be coming down here and she told him to look us up well that sure was a hell of a coincidence carney reached for his glass and noticed algaro and guerra get up and leave he almost got up and went after them but what the hell it wasnt his problem whatever it was and in any case dillon was perfectly capable of looking after himself hed never been more certain of anything in his life dillon drove out of cruz bay changing down to climb the steep hill up from the town thinking about carney hed liked him straightaway a calm quiet man of enormous inner strength but then remembering his background that made sense he breasted the hill remembering that in st john you kept on the lefthand side of the road just like england was suddenly aware of the headlights coming up behind him very fast he expected to be overtaken wasnt and as the vehicle behind moved right in on his tail knew he was in trouble he recognized it as a landrover in his rearview mirror an instant before it bumped him put his foot down hard and pulled away driving so fast that he went straight past the turning to caneel bay the landrover had the edge and suddenly it swerved out to the righthand side of the road and moved alongside he caught a brief glimpse of algaros face illuminated in the light from the dashboard as he gripped the wheel and then the landrover swerved in and dillon spun off the road into the brush bounced down a shallow slope and came to a halt dillon rolled out of the jeep and got behind a tree the landrover had stopped and there was silence for a moment suddenly a shotgun roared pellets scything through the branches overhead there was silence and then laughter a voice called welcome to st john mr dillon and the landrover drove away dillon waited until the sound had faded into the night then he got back into the jeep engaged fourwheel drive reversed up the slope onto the road and drove back toward the caneel turning in london it was threethirty in the morning when the phone rang at the side of charles fergusons bed in his flat at cavendish square he came awake on the instant and reached for it ferguson here dillon stood on the terrace a drink in one hand the cellular telephone in the other its me he said ringing you from the tranquil virgin islands only theyre not so tranquil for gods sake dillon do you know what time it is yes time for a few questions and hopefully some answers a couple of goons just tried to run me off the road old son and guess who they were crewmen off santiagos yacht the maria blanco they also loosed off a shotgun in my direction ferguson was immediately alert sat up and tossed the bedclothes aside are you certain of course i am dillon was not particularly angry but made it sound as if he were listen you devious old sod i want to know whats going on ive only been in the damned place a few hours and yet they know me by name id say they were expecting me as theyre here too and how could that be brigadier i dont know ferguson told him thats all i can say for the moment youre settled in all right brigadier i have an insane desire to laugh dillon told him but yes im settled in the cottage is fine the view sublime and im diving with bob carney in the morning good get on with it then and watch yourself watch myself dillon said is that the best you can do stop whining dillon ferguson told him this sort of things exactly why i chose you for the job youre still in one piece right just about there you are then theyre trying to put the frighteners on you thats all thats all he says leave it with me ill be in touch ferguson put the phone down switching off the light and lay there thinking about it after a while he drifted into sleep again dillon went to the small bar there were tea and coffee bags there he boiled the water and opted for a cup of tea taking it out on the terrace looking out into the bay where there were lights on some of the boats more to things than met the eye he was more convinced than ever and he hadnt liked the shotgun it made him feel naked there was an answer to that of course a visit to the address ferguson had given him in st thomas the hardware specialist that could come in the afternoon after hed dived with carney the moment he and guerra were back on board algaro reported to santiago when he was finished santiago said you did well algaro said he wont do anything about it will he señor the police i mean of course not he doesnt want the authorities to know why hes here thats the beauty of it that uboat is in american waters so legally it should be reported to the coast guard but thats the last thing dillon and this brigadier ferguson he works for want algaro said i see go to bed now santiago told him algaro departed and santiago went to the rail he could see a light in cottage seven at that moment it went out sleep well mr dillon he said softly turned and went below it was nine oclock the following morning when ferguson arrived at downing street he had to wait for only five minutes before an aide took him upstairs and showed him into the study where the prime minister was seated at his desk signing one document after another he looked up ah there you are brigadier you asked to see me prime minister yes ive had the deputy director of the security services and sir francis on my back about this virgin islands affair is it true what they tell me that youve taken on this man dillon to handle things yes ferguson said calmly a man with his record can you tell me why because hes right for the job sir believe me i find nothing admirable in dillons past his work some years ago for the ira is known to us although nothing has ever been proven against him the same applies to his activities on the international scene hes a gun for hire prime minister even the israelis have used him when it suited them i cant say i like it i think carter has a point of view i can pull him out if that is what you wish but youd rather not i think hes the man for this particular job to be frank its a dirty one and it has already become apparent since we last spoke that there are people he will have to deal with who play very dirty indeed i see the prime minister sighed very well brigadier i leave it to your own good judgment but do try and make your peace with carter i will prime minister ferguson said and withdrew jack lane was waiting in the daimler as it drove away he said and what was that all about ferguson told him hes got a point of course you know how i feel sir i was always against it i wouldnt trust dillon an inch interesting thing about dillon ferguson said one of the things hes always been known for is a kind of twisted sense of honor if he gives his word he sticks to it and expects others to do the same i find that hard to believe sir yes i suppose most people would ferguson picked up the car phone and rang through to simon carters office he wasnt there he was meeting with pamer at the house of commons get a message through to him now ferguson told carters secretary tell him i need to see them both urgently ill meet them on the terrace at the house in fifteen minutes he replaced the phone you can come with me jack youve never been on the terrace have you whats going on sir wait and see jack wait and see rain drifted across the thames in a fine spray clearing the terrace of people except for a few who stood under the awnings drink in hand everyone else had taken to the bars and cafes ferguson stood by the wall holding a large golfers umbrella his chauffeur had given him lane sheltering with him doesnt it fill you with a sense of majesty and awe jack the mother of parliaments and all that sort of thing ferguson asked not with rain pouring down my neck sir ah there you are they turned and saw carter and pamer standing in the main entrance to the terrace carter was carrying a black umbrella which he put up and he and pamer joined them ferguson said isnt this cozy im not in the mood for your feeble attempts at humor ferguson now what do you want carter demanded ive just been to see the pm i understand youve been complaining again old boy didnt do you any good hes told me to carry on and use my judgment carter was furious but he managed to control himself and glanced at lane whos this my present assistant detective inspector jack lane ive borrowed him from special branch thats against regulations you cant do it thats as may be but im not a deckhand on your ship i run my own and as my time is limited lets get down to facts dillon arrived in st john around five oclock in the evening their time yesterday he was attacked by two crew members of santiagos boat the maria blanco who ran him off the road in his jeep and fired a shotgun at him my god pamer said in horror carter frowned is he all right oh yes a rubber ball our dillon always bounces back personally i think they were trying it on hassling him of course the interesting thing is how come they knew who he was and knew he was there now look here pamer began i trust youre not suggesting any lack of security on our part carter said shut up francis hes got a valid point this santiago man is far too well informed he turned to ferguson what are you going to do about it actually i was thinking of taking a brief holiday ferguson told him you know sun sea and sand swaying palms they tell me the virgins are lovely at this time of the year carter nodded youll stay in touch of course dear old boy ferguson smiled and turned to lane lets go jack weve lots to do on the way back to the ministry ferguson told his chauffeur to pull in beside a mobile sandwich bar on victoria embankment this man does the best cup of tea in london jack the owner greeted him as an old friend rotten day brigadier it was worse on the hook fred the brigadier said and walked with his cup of tea to the wall overlooking the thames as lane received his cup of tea he said to fred what did he mean the hook that was a really bad place that was worst position in the whole of korea so many dead bodies that every time you dug another trench arms and legs came out you knew the brigadier then knew him i was a platoon sergeant when he was a second lieutenant he won his first military cross carrying me on his back under fire fred grinned thats why i never charge for the tea lane impressed joined ferguson and leaned on the parapet under the umbrella youve got a fan there sir fred old soldiers tales dont listen im going to need the learjet direct flight to st thomas should be possible i believe the work on those new tanks the raf did has extended the range to at least four thousand miles sir there you are then ferguson glanced at his watch just after ten i want that learjet ready to leave gatwick no later than one oclock jack top priority allowing for the time difference i could be in st thomas somewhere between five or six oclock their time do you want me with you sir no youll have to hold the fort youll need accommodation sir ill see to that ferguson shook his head ive reserved it at this caneel place where i booked dillon in you mean you were expecting what happened to happen something like that look sir said lane in exasperation exactly what is going on when you find out tell me jack ferguson emptied his cup went and put it on the counter thanks fred he turned to lane come on jack must get moving lots to do before i leave and he got into the rear of the daimler santiago was up early even went for a swim in the sea and was seated at the table in the stern enjoying his breakfast in the early morning sunshine when algaro brought him the telephone its sir francis he said a wonderful morning here santiago said hows london cold and wet im just about to have a sandwich lunch and then spend the whole afternoon in interminable committee meetings look max carter saw the prime minister and tried to put the boot into ferguson because he was employing dillon i didnt imagine carter to be quite so stupid ferguson still got his way of course yes the pm backed him to the hilt more worrying he asked for another meeting with me and carter and told us dillon had been attacked on his first night in st john what on earth was that about my people were just leaning on him a little francis after all and as you made clear he knows of my existence yes but what fergusons now interested in is how you knew who dillon was the fact that he was arriving in st john and so on he said you were far too well informed and carter agreed with him did he make any suggestion as to how he thought i was getting my information no but he did say he thought hed join dillon in st john for a few days did he now that should prove interesting i look forward to meeting him pamer said genuine despair in his words god dammit max they know of your involvement how long before they know about mine youre not on the boards of any of the companies francis and neither was your father no mention of the name pamer anywhere and the great thing about this whole affair is that it is a private war as ive already told you ferguson wont want the american authorities in on this were rather like two dogs squabbling over the same bone im still worried pamer told him is there anything else i can do keep the information flowing francis and keep your nerve nothing else you can do santiago put the phone down and algaro said more coffee señor santiago nodded brigadier ferguson is coming here to caneel algaro smiled and what would you like me to do about him señor oh ill think of something santiago said and drank his coffee in the meantime lets find out what our friend dillon is up to this morning guerra went round to caneel beach in an inflatable taking one of the divers with him a young man called javier noval they wore swimming shorts teeshirts and dark glasses just another couple of tourists they pulled in amongst other small craft at the dock guerra killed the outboard motor and noval tied up at that moment dillon appeared at the end of the dock he wore a black tracksuit and carried a couple of towels thats him guerra told noval get going ill stay out of the way in case he remembers me from last night bob carney was manhandling dive tanks from a trolley on to the deck of a small twentyfivefoot dive boat turned and saw dillon he waved and went along the dock to join him passing noval who stopped to light a cigarette close enough to listen to them carney said youre going to need a few things lets go up to the dive shop they moved away noval waited and then followed there was a wide range of excellent equipment dillon chose a threequarterlength suit of black and green in padded nylon nothing too heavy a mask fins and gloves have you tried one of these carney opened a box a marathon dive computer the wonder of the age automatic readings on your depth elapsed time under water safe time remaining even tells you how long you should wait to fly thats for me dillon told him i always was lousy at mental arithmetic carney itemized the bill ill put this on your hotel account dillon signed it so what have you got planned oh nothing too strenuous youll see carney smiled lets get going and he led the way out noval dropped down into the inflatable the other man is called carney he owns the diving concession here paradise watersports so they are going diving guerra asked they must be dillon was in the shop with him buying equipment he glanced up here they come now dillon and carney passed above them and got into the dive boat after a moment carney fired the engine and dillon cast off the boat moved out of the bay weaving its way through various craft anchored there guerra said theres no name on that boat privateer thats what its called noval told him i asked one of the beach guards you know ive done most of my diving around puerto rico but ive heard of this carney hes big stuff guerra nodded okay wed better get back and let señor santiago know whats happening noval cast off guerra started the outboard and they moved away the privateer was doing a steady twenty knots the sea not as calm as it could have been dillon held on tight and managed to light a cigarette onehanded are you prone to sea sickness carney asked not that i know of dillon shouted above the roar of the engine good because its going to get worse before it gets better weve not too far to go though waves swept in long and steep the privateer riding up over them and plunging down and dillon hung on taking in the incredible scenery the peaks of the islands all around and then they were very close to a smaller island turned in toward it and moved into the calmer waters of a bay congo cay carney said a nice dive he went round to the prow dropped the anchor and came back not much to tell you twentyfive to ninety feet very little current theres a ridge maybe three hundred feet long if you want to limit your depth you could stay on top of that sounds the kind of place youd bring novices dillon said pulling on the black and green diving suit all the time carney told him calmly dillon got into his gear quickly and fastened a weight belt round his waist carney had already clamped tanks to their inflatable jackets and helped dillon ease into his while sitting on the side of the boat dillon pulled on his gloves carney said see you at the anchor dillon nodded pulled down his mask checked that the air was flowing freely through his mouthpiece and went over backwards into the sea he swam under the keel of the boat until he saw the anchor line and followed it down pausing only to swallow a couple of times a technique aimed at equalizing the pressure in his ears when they became uncomfortable he reached the ridge paused with a hand on the anchor and looked at carney descending to join him through a massive school of silversides at that moment an extraordinary thing happened a black tip reef shark about nine feet in length shot out of the gloom scattering clouds of fish before it swerved around carney then disappeared over the ridge as fast as it had come carney made the okay sign with finger and thumb dillon replied in kind and followed him as he led the way along the reef there were brilliant yellow tube sponges everywhere and when they went over the edge there was lots of orange sponge attached to the rock faces the coral outcroppings were multicolored and very beautiful and at one point carney paused pointing and dillon saw a huge eagle ray pass in the distance wings flapping in slow motion it was a very calm very enjoyable dive but no big deal and after about thirty minutes dillon realized theyd come full circle because the anchor line was ahead of them he followed carney up the line nice and slow finally swam under the keel and surfaced at the stern carney with practiced ease was up over the stern pulling his gear behind him dillon unstrapped his jacket slipped out of it and carney reached down and pulled jacket and tank on board dillon joined him a moment later carney busied himself clipping fresh tanks to the jackets and went and pulled in the anchor dillon put a towel over his shoulders and lit a cigarette the reef shark he said does that happen often not really carney said enough to give some people a heart attack ive been diving for years carney told him and ive never found sharks a problem not even a great white how often would you see one of those no nurse sharks in the main and theyre no problem around here reef sharks now and then or lemon sharks sure they could be a problem but hardly ever were big and theyre big and they just want to keep out of the way having said that did you enjoy the dive it was fine dillon shrugged which means youd like a little more excitement carney started the engine okay lets go for one of my big boy dives and he gunned the engine and took the privateer out into open water they actually passed at some distance maria blanco still at anchor off paradise beach and guerra was in the deckhouse scanning the area with binoculars he recognized the boat and told captain serra who examined the chart and then took a book on dive sites in the virgin islands from a drawer in the chart table keep watching he told guerra and leafed through theyve anchored guerra told him and run up the dive flag carval rock serra said thats where theyre diving at that moment algaro came in and held the door open for santiago who was wearing a blue blazer and a captains cap a gold rim to the peak whats happening carney and dillon are diving out there señor serra indicated the spot and gave santiago the binoculars santiago could just see the two men moving in the stern of privateer he said that couldnt be the site could it no way señor serra told him its a difficult place to dive but hundreds of dives are made there every year never mind santiago said put the launch in the water well go and have a look well see what these two divers of yours noval and pinto can do very well señor ill get things moving and serra went out followed by guerra algaro said you wish me to come too señor why not santiago said even if dillon sees you it doesnt matter he knows you exist the rock was magnificent rising up out of a very turbulent sea birds of every kind perched up there on the ridge gulls descending in slow motion in the heavy wind carval rock carney said this is rated an advanced dive descends to about eighty or so feet theres the wreck of a cessna over on the other side that crashed a few years back there are some nice ravines fissures one or two short tunnels and wonderful rock and coral cliffs the problem is the current caused by tidal movement through the pillsbury sound how strong dillon asked as he fastened his weight belt one or two knots is fairly common above two knots is unswimmable he looked over and shook his head and id say its three knots today dillon lifted his jacket and tank on to the thwart and put it on himself sounds as if it could be interesting your funeral carney got his own gear on and dillon turned to lean over and wash out his mask and saw a white launch approaching were going to have company carney turned to look i doubt it no dive master i know would take his people down in this current today hed go somewhere easier the swells were huge now the privateer bucking up and down on the anchor line dillon went over paused to check his air supply and started down to what looked like a dense forest below he paused on the bottom waiting until carney had reached him beckoned and turned toward the rock dillon followed amazed at the strength of the current pushing against him was aware of a stream of white bubbles over to his left and saw an anchor descend on the launch santiago sat in the wheelhouse while serra went to the prow and dropped the anchor algaro was helping noval and pinto into their diving equipment serra said finally they are ready to go señor what are your orders tell them to just have a look around santiago said no trouble leave carney and dillon alone as you say señor the two divers were sitting together on the port side serra nodded and together they went over backwards into the water dillon followed carney with increasing difficulty because of the strength of the current up across rock and coral following a deep channel that led through to the other side of the rocks the force was quite tremendous and carney was down on his belly pulling himself through with gloved hands reaching for one handhold after another and dillon went after him the other mans fins just three or four feet in front of him there was a kind of threshold carney was motionless for a while and then passed through and dillon had the same problem faced with a kind of wall of pressure he clawed at the rocks with agonizing slowness foot by foot and suddenly was through and into another world the surface was fifty feet above him and as he surged forward he found himself in the middle of a school of tarpon at least four feet in length there were yellow tail snappers horseeyed jacks bonita king mackerel and barracuda some of them five feet long carney plunged down to the other side the rock face falling below and dillon followed him they closed together and dillon was aware of the current as they turned and saw noval and pinto trying to come through the cut noval almost made it then lost his grip and was pushed into pinto and they disappeared back to the other side carney moved on and dillon followed down to seventyfive feet and the current took them now in a fierce threeknot riptide that bounced them along the front of the wall in an upright position they were surrounded by clouds of silversides flying through space the ultimate dream and dillon had never felt so excited it seemed to go on forever and then the current slackened and carney was using his fins now and climbing dillon followed through a deep ravine that led into another waterlike black glass checked his computer and was surprised to find that they had been under for twentyfive minutes they moved away from the rock itself now only three or four feet above the forest of the seabed and came to a line and anchor carney paused to examine it then turned and shook his head moving on toward the left finally arriving at their own anchor they went up slowly leaving the line at fifteen feet and swimming to one side of the boat surfacing at the keel carney reached down to take dillons tank and the irishman got a foot in the tiny ladder and pulled himself up and over the stern he felt totally exhilarated unzipped his diving suit and pulled it off as carney stowed their tanks bloody marvelous carney smiled it wasnt bad was it he turned and looked across at the launch which was anchored over on the port side swinging on its anchor chain in the heavy sea dillon said i wonder what happened to the two divers we saw trying to get through the cut they couldnt make it i guess that was rough duty down there the launch swung round exposing the stern thats the maria blancos launch carney added is that a fact dillon dried himself slowly with a towel and stood at the rail looking across he recognized algaro at once standing in the stern with serra and then santiago came out of the wheelhouse whos the guy in the blazer and cap dillon enquired carney looked across thats max santiago the owner ive seen him in st john a time or two santiago was looking across at them and on impulse dillon raised an arm and waved santiago waved back and at that moment noval and pinto surfaced time to go home carney said and he went round to the prow and heaved in the anchor on the way back dillon said the maria blanco where would it anchor when its here caneel bay more likely to be off paradise beach could we take a look carney glanced at him then looked away why not its your charter dillon got the water bottle from the icebox drank about a pint then passed it to carney and lit a cigarette carney drank a little and passed it back youve dived before mr dillon and thats a fact dillon agreed they were close to paradise now and carney throttled back the engine and the privateer passed between two of the oceangoing yachts that were moored there and came to the maria blanco there she is he said there were a couple of crewmen working on deck who looked up casually as they passed jesus dillon said that thing must have made a dent in santiagos wallet a couple of million id say and then some carney went up to full power and made for caneel beach dillon lit another cigarette and leaned against the wall of the deckhouse do you get many interesting wrecks in this area some carney said theres the cartanser senior off buck island over to st thomas an old freighter thats a popular dive and the general rodgers the coast guard sank her to get rid of her no i was thinking of something more interesting than that dillon said i mean you know this area like the back of your hand would it be possible for there to be a wreck on some reef out there that youd never come across carney slowed as they entered the bay anythings possible its a big ocean so there could be something out there just waiting to be discovered the privateer coasted in beside the dock dillon got the stern line went over and tied up he did the same with the other line as carney cut the engine went back on board and pulled on his track suit carney leaned by the wheel looking at him mr dillon i dont know what goes on here all i know for certain is you are one hell of a diver and that i admire what all this talk of wrecks means i dont know and dont want to as im inclined to the quiet life but i will give you one piece of advice your interest in max santiago oh yes dillon said continuing to put his diving equipment in a net diving bag it could be unhealthy ive heard things about him that arent good plenty of people could tell you the same the way he makes his money for example a hotel keeper as i heard it dillon smiled theres other ways that involve small planes or a fast boat by night to florida but what the hell youre a grown man carney moved out on deck you want to dive with me again you can count on it ive got business in st thomas this afternoon how would i get there carney pointed to the other side of the dock where a very large launch was just casting off thats the resort ferry they run back and forth during the day but i figure you missed this one damn dillon said mr dillon you arrived at cruz bay in your own floatplane and the front desk who keep me informed of such things tell me you pay with an american express platinum card what can i say youve got me dillon told him amicably water taxis are expensive but not to a man of your means the front desk will order you one thanks dillon crossed to the dock and paused maybe i could buy you a drink tonight will you be at jennys place hell im there every night at the moment carney said otherwise id starve my wife and kids are away on vacation ill see you then dillon said and turned and walked away along the dock toward the front desk the water taxi had seats for a dozen passengers but he had it to himself the only crew was a woman in a peaked cap and denims who sat at the wheel and made for st thomas at a considerable rate of knots it was noisy and there wasnt much chance to speak which suited dillon he sat there smoking and thinking about the way things had gone so far algaro max santiago and the maria blanco he knew about santiago but santiago knew about him that was a fact and yet to be explained there had almost been a touch of comradeship in the way santiago had waved back at him at carval rock carney he liked in fact everything about him he liked for one thing the american knew his business but there was power there and real authority an outstanding example of a quiet man it wouldnt pay to push here we go the water taxi driver shouted over her shoulder and dillon glanced up and saw that they were moving in toward the waterfront of charlotte amalie it was quite a place and bustling with activity two enormous cruise liners berthed on the far side of the harbor the waterfront was lined with buildings in white and pastel colors shops and restaurants of every description it had been a danish colony he knew that and the influence still showed in some of the architecture he followed a narrow alley called drakes passage that was lined with colorful shops offering everything from designer clothes to gold and jewelry for this was a free port and came out into main street he consulted the address ferguson had given him and crossed to where some taxis waited can you take me to cane street he asked the first driver i wouldnt take your money man the driver told him amiably just take the next turning through to back street cane is the third on the left dillon thanked him and moved on it was hot very hot people crowding the pavements traffic moving slowly in the narrow streets but cane street when he came to it was quiet and shaded the house he wanted was at the far end clapboard painted white with a red corrugated iron roof there was a tiny garden in front of it and steps leading up to a porch on which an ageing black man with gray hair sat on a swing seat reading a newspaper he looked up as dillon approached and what can i do for you im looking for earl stacey dillon told him the man peered at him over the top of reading glasses you aint gonna spoil my day with no bills are you ferguson told me to look you up dillon said brigadier charles ferguson my name is dillon the other man smiled and removed his glasses ive been expecting you come right this way and he pushed open the door and led the way into the house im on my own since my wife died last year stacey opened a door switched on a light and led the way down wooden steps to a cellar there were wooden shelves up to the ceiling pots of paint stacked there cupboards below he reached in and released some kind of catch and pulled it open like a door revealing another room he switched on a light come into my parlor there was all kinds of weaponry rifles submachine guns boxes of ammunition it looks like christmas to me dillon told him you just tell me what you want man and ferguson picks up the tab that was the arrangement rifle first dillon said armalite perhaps i like the folding stock i can do better i got an ak assault rifle here with a folding stock fires automatic when you want thirtyround magazine he took the weapon from a stand and handed it over yes this will do fine dillon told him ill take it with two extra magazines i need a handgun now walther ppk for preference and a carswell silencer two extra magazines for that as well can do stacey opened a very large drawer under the bench which ran along one wall inside there was an assortment of handguns he selected a walther and passed it to dillon for approval anything else there was a cheaplooking plastic holster with the butt of a pistol sticking out of it and dillon was intrigued whats that its an aceinthehole stacey took it out that metal strip on the back is a magnet stick it underneath anywhere and as long as its metal itll hold fast the gun dont look much pointtwotwo belgian semiautomatic sevenshot but ive put hollownosed rounds in they fragment bone ill take it dillon said one more thing would you happen to have any c explosive the kind salvage people use for underwater work exactly no but i tell you what i do have something just as good semtex you heard of that stuff oh yes dillon said i think you could say im familiar with semtex one of czechoslovakias more successful products the terrorists favorite weapon stacey took a box down from the shelf the palestinians the ira all those cats use this stuff you gonna use this underwater yourself just to make a hole in a wreck then you need some detonation cord a remotecontrol unit or ive got some chemical detonating pencils here they work real good you just break the cap i got some timed for ten minutes and others for thirty he pushed all the items together is that it a night sight would be useful and a pair of binoculars i can do them too he opened another drawer there you go the night sight was small but powerful extending if needed like a telescope the binoculars were by zeiss and pocket size excellent dillon said stacey went and found an olivegreen army holdall unzipped it put the ak assault rifle in first and then the other things he closed the zip turned and led the way out switching off the light and pushing the shelving back into place dillon followed him up the cellar stairs and out to the porch stacey offered him the bag mr dillon i get the impression you intend to start world war three maybe we can call a truce dillon said who knows i wish you luck my friend ill send my bill to ferguson stacey sat down put on his reading glasses and picked up his newspaper and dillon walked out through the small garden and started back toward the waterfront he was walking along the side of the harbor to where the water taxis operated from when he saw that the caneel ferry was in a gangplank stretching down to the dock the captain was standing at the top as dillon went up you staying at caneel sir i certainly am well be leaving soon just heard someones on the way down from the airport dillon went into the main cabin put his bag on a seat and accepted a rum punch offered by one of the crew he glanced out of the window and saw a large taxi bus draw up a single passenger inside went and sat down and drank some of his punch one of the crew came in and put two suitcases in the corner there was the sound of the gangplank being moved the captain went into the wheelhouse and started the engines dillon checked his watch it was fivethirty he put his plastic cup on the table lit a cigarette and at the same time was aware of someone slumping down beside him fancy meeting you dear boy charles ferguson said bloody hot isnt it dillon had a quick swim off paradise beach conscious that the maria blanco was still at anchor out there then he went back up to the cottage had a shower and changed into navy blue linen slacks and a shortsleeved white cotton shirt he went out crossed the vestibule and tapped on the door of e come ferguson called dillon entered the setup was similar to his own the bathroom marginally larger as was the other room ferguson in gray flannel slacks and a white turnbull and asser shirt stood in front of the mirror in the small dressing room easing the guards tie into a neat windsor knot at his neck ah there you are he said took a doublebreasted navy blue blazer and pulled it on how do i look dear boy like an advertisement for gieves and hawkes the bloody english gentleman abroad just because youre irish doesnt mean you have to feel inferior all the time ferguson told him some very reasonable people were irish dillon my mother for instance not to mention the duke of wellington who said that just because a man had been born in a stable didnt mean he was a horse dillon pointed out dear me did he say that most unfortunate ferguson picked up a panama hat and a malacca cane with a silver handle i never knew you needed a cane dillon said bought this during the korean war strong as steel because it has a steel core weighted with lead at the tip oh and heres a rather nice device he turned the silver handle to one side and pulled out a steel poniard about nine inches long very interesting dillon said yes well we are in foreign parts i call it my pig sticker there was a click as ferguson rammed the poniard home now are you going to offer me a quick drink before we go out or arent you dillon had negotiated a supply of krug from room service had several halfbottles in one of the iceboxes he filled two glasses and went out to ferguson on the terrace picking up the zeiss field glasses on the way that large white motor yacht out there is the maria blanco really dillon passed him the zeiss glasses and the brigadier had a look a sort of minor floating palace id say so it would appear ferguson still held the glasses to his eyes as a young man i was a subaltern in the korean war one year of unmitigated hell i did a tour of duty on a position called the hook just like the first world war miles of trenches barbed wire mine fields and thousands of chinese trying to get in they used to watch us and we used to watch them it was like a game a particularly nasty game which exploded into violence every so often he sighed and lowered the glasses what on earth am i prattling on about dillon oh id say youre going the long way round to the pub to tell me that you suspect santiagos watching too something like that tell me how far things have gone and dont leave anything out not a single damn thing when dillon was finished he refilled the brigadiers glass while ferguson sat there thinking about it what do you think the next move should be dillon asked well now youve gone and got yourself tooled up by stacey i suppose youre eager for confrontation a gunfight at the ok corral ive taken precautions thats all dillon said and i needed the semtex to blast a way into the uboat if we find it ferguson said and not a murmur from the girl shell turn up eventually and in the meantime id like to take things further with carney we really do need him on our side i can see that but it would be a question of how to approach him would a cash offer help not really if im right carney is the kind of man wholl only do a thing if he really wants to or if he thinks it right oh dear ferguson sighed heaven save me from the romantics of this world he stood up and glanced at his watch food dillon thats what i need where shall we eat we could walk up to turtle bay dining room thats more formal i hear but excellent ive booked a table good then lets get moving and for heavens sake put a jacket on i dont want people to think im dining with a beachcomber out in the gathering darkness of caneel bay an inflatable from the maria blanco nosed in beside carneys sport fisherman sea raider the only sound the muted throbbing of the outboard motor serra was at the helm and algaro sat in the stern as they bumped against the hull of sea raider he went up over the rail and into the wheelhouse took a tiny electronic box from his pocket reached under the instrument panel until he found metal and put it in place attached by its magnet a moment later he was back in the inflatable now the small dive boat privateer he said and serra turned and moved toward it max santiago wearing a white linen suit was sitting in caneel bay bar sipping a mint julep when algaro came in he wore a black teeshirt and a loosefitting baggy suit in black linen that made him look rather sinister did everything go well santiago asked absolutely ive put a bug on both of carneys dive boats that means we can follow wherever he goes without being observed ferguson booked in just after six i checked with the reservations desk dillon has booked a table for two up at turtle bay dining room good santiago said it might be amusing to join him captain serra entered at that moment have you any further orders señor if dillon does as he did last night he may probably visit this bar jennys place santiago said ill probably look in there myself so ill take the launch round to cruz bay señor to pick you up from there santiago smiled ive had a better idea go back to the maria blanco pick up some of the crew and take them into cruz they can have a drink on me later let off a little steam if you follow me perfectly señor serra smiled and went out it was just after midnight at the convent of the little sisters of pity and jenny grant who had gone to bed early was restless and unable to sleep she got up found her cigarettes lit one and went and sat on the padded windowseat and peered out into driving rain she could see the light still on in the window of sister maria bakers office but then she never seemed to stop working strange how henry had always kept her very existence a secret it was as if hed been somehow ashamed of her the religious thing hed never been able to handle that jenny felt much better than when she had arrived infinitely more rested and yet restless at the same time she wondered what was happening in st john and how dillon was getting on shed liked dillon that was the simple truth in spite of everything in his background of which she thoroughly disapproved on the other hand you could only speak as you found and to her he had been good kind considerate and understanding she went back to bed switched off the light and dozed and had a dream of the halfwaking sort the uboat in dark waters and henry diving deep dear henry such an idiot to have been down there in the first place and somewhere dangerous somewhere unusual somewhere people didnt normally go it had to be she came awake in the instant and spoke out loud in the darkness oh my god of course and so simple she got out of bed and went to the window the light was still on in the mother superiors office she dressed quickly in jeans and sweater and hurried across the courtyard through the rain and knocked on the door when she entered she found sister maria baker seated behind her desk working she glanced up in surprise why jenny what is it cant you sleep ill be leaving tomorrow sister i just wanted to let you know im going back to st john so soon jenny but why the location of the uboat that henry found and that dillon is looking for i think i can find it for him it just came to me as i was falling asleep ferguson sat on the terrace at turtle bay and looked out to the sir francis drake channel islands like black cutouts against the dark sky streaked with orange as the sun descended really is quite extraordinary the brigadier said as they sipped a fruit punch sunsets exquisitely dying thats what the poet said dillon murmured the cicadas chirped ceaselessly night birds calling to each other he got up and moved to the edge of the terrace and ferguson said good heavens i didnt realize you had a literary bent dear boy dillon lit a cigarette the zippo flaring he grinned to be frank with you im a bloody literary genius brigadier i did hamlet at the royal academy i can still remember most of the text his voice changed suddenly into a remarkable impression of marlon brando i could have been somebody i could have been a contender dont get maudlin on me at this stage in your life dillon never pays to look back with regret because you cant change anything and youve wasted too much time already on that damned cause of yours i trust you realize that stay with the present the main point which concerns me at the moment is how this wretched man santiago comes to be so well informed and wouldnt i like to know that myself dillon said santiago walked in through the arched gateway algaro at his shoulder he looked around the terrace saw dillon and ferguson and came over mr dillon max santiago i know who you are señor dillon replied in excellent spanish santiago looked surprised i must congratulate you señor he replied in the same language such fluency in a foreigner is rare he turned to ferguson and added in english a pleasure to see you at caneel bay brigadier have a nice dinner gentlemen and he left followed by algaro he knew who you are and he knew you were here dillon said so i noticed ferguson stood up lets eat im starving the service was good the food excellent and ferguson thoroughly enjoyed himself they split a bottle of louis roederer crystal champagne and started with grilled sea scallops in a red pepper and saffron sauce followed by a caesar salad and then a panroasted pheasant ferguson napkin tucked in his collar devoured everything to be honest dear boy i really prefer nursery food but one must make an effort an englishman abroad again dillon inquired ferguson i need hardly point out is the most scots of scottish names dillon and as i told you my mother was irish yes but eton sandhurst and the grenadier guards got mixed up in that little lot somewhere ferguson poured some more crystal lovely bottle you can see right through it very unusual czar nicholas designed it himself dillon told him said he wanted to be able to see the champagne extraordinary never knew that didnt do him any good when the bolsheviks murdered him im glad you said murdered dillon theres some hope for you still whats friend santiago doing having dinner at the edge of the garden behind you the ghoul with him by the way is called algaro he must be his minder hes the one who ran me off the road and fired a shotgun oh dear we cant have that ferguson asked the waiter for tea instead of coffee what do you suggest our next move should be santiago is obviously pressing and intends we should know it i think i need to speak to carney if anybody might have some ideas about where that uboat is it would be he thats not only exquisitely grammatical dear boy it makes sense do you know where he might be oh yes excellent ferguson stood picked up his panama and malacca cane lets get moving then dillon drove into the car park at mongoose junction and switched off he took the holstered belgian semiautomatic from his jacket pocket what on earth is that ferguson demanded an aceinthehole ill leave it under the dashboard looks like a womans gun to me and like most women it gets the job done brigadier so dont be sexist dillon clamped the holster under the dashboard okay lets go and see if we can find carney they walked along the front from mongoose junction to jennys place it was about halffull when they went inside billy jones working the bar mary and one waitress between them handling the dinner trade there were only four tables taken and carney sat at one captain serra and three of the crew from the maria blanco were at a booth table in the corner guerra the mate was one of them dillon recognized him from the first night although the fact that guerra said thats him in spanish and they all stopped talking was sufficient confirmation hello there mary jones approached and dillon smiled well join bob carney a bottle of champagne whatever youve got two glasses ferguson raised his hat politely mary took his arm her teeth flashing in a delighted smile i like this man where did you find him i love a gentleman billy leaned over the bar you put him down woman its not his fault dillon said hes a brigadier all that army training a brigadier general her eyes widened well yes thats true in your army ferguson said uncomfortably well you go and join bob carney honey marys gonna take care of you right now carney was just finishing an order of steak and french fries a beer at his elbow and looked up as they approached mr dillon he said this is a friend of mine brigadier charles ferguson dillon told him may we join you carney smiled im impressed but i should warn you brigadier all i made was corporal and that was in the marines grenadier guards ferguson told him hope you dont mind hell no i guess we elite unit boys have got to stick together sit down as they each pulled up a chair he went back to his steak and said to dillon you ever in the army dillon not exactly dillon told him hell theres nothing exact about it not that you hear about the irish army too much except that they seem to spend most of their time fighting for the united nations in beirut or angola or someplace of course there is the other lot the ira he stopped cutting the last piece of steak for a moment then carried on but no that wouldnt be possible would it dillon he smiled and ferguson said my dear chap be reasonable what on earth would the ira be interested in here whats more to the point why would i be involved i dont know about that brigadier what i do know is that dillon here is a mystery to me and a mystery is like a crossword puzzle ive just got to solve it santiago came in followed by algaro and the other four stood up weve got company dillon told ferguson the brigadier looked round oh dear he said bob carney pushed his plate away just to save you more questions santiago you know and that creep algaro the one with the beard is the captain of the maria blanco serra the others will be crew billy jones brought a bottle of pol roget in a bucket opened it for them then went across to the booth to take santiagos order dillon poured the champagne raised his glass and spoke to carney in irish jesus carney said what in the hell are you saying dillon irish the language of kings a very ancient toast may the wind be always at your back appropriate for a ships captain i mean you do have a masters ticket amongst other things carney frowned then turned to ferguson lets see if i can put it together he works for you in a manner of speaking at that moment they heard a womans voice say please dont do that the waitress serving the drinks at santiagos table was a small girl rather pretty with her blonde hair in a plait bound up at the back she was very young very vulnerable algaro was running his hand over her buttocks and started to move down a leg i hate to see that carney said and his face was hard dillon said i couldnt agree more to say hes in from the stable would be an insult to horses the girl pulled away the crew laughing and santiago looked across his eyes meeting dillons he smiled turned and whispered to algaro who nodded and got to his feet now lets keep our heads here ferguson said algaro crossed to the bar and sat on a vacant stool as the girl passed he put an arm round her waist and whispered in her ear she went red in the face close to tears leave me alone she said and struggled to free herself dillon glanced across santiago raised his glass and toasted him a halfsmile on his face as algaro slipped a hand up her skirt billy jones was serving at the other end of the bar and he turned to see what was happening carney got to his feet picked up his glass and walked to the bar he put an arm around the girls shoulders and eased her away then he poured what was left of his beer into algaros crotch excuse me he said i didnt see you there and he turned and walked back to the table everyone stopped talking and dillon took the bottle from the ice bucket and refilled the brigadiers glass algaro stood up and looked down at his trousers in disbelief why you little creep im going to break your left arm for that he moved to the table fast arms extended and carney turned crouching to defend himself but it was dillon who struck first reversed his grip on the champagne bottle and smashed it across the side of algaros skull not once but twice the bottle splintering champagne going everywhere algaro pulled himself up hands on the edge of the table and dillon still seated kicked sideways at the kneecap algaro cried out and fell to one side he lay there for a moment then forced himself up on to one knee dillon jumped up and raised a knee into the unprotected face youve never learned to lie down have you the other members of the crew of the maria blanco were on their feet one of them picking up a chair and billy jones came round the bar in a rush a baseball bat in his hand can it or ill call the law he asked for it he got it just get him out of here they stopped dead not so much because of billy as santiago who said in spanish no trouble just get him and leave captain serra nodded and guerra the mate and pinto went and helped algaro to his feet he appeared dazed blood on his face and they led him out followed by the others santiago stood up and raised his glass emptied it and left conversation resumed and mary brought a brush and pan to sweep up the glass billy said to dillon i couldnt get there fast enough i thank you guys how about another bottle of champagne on the house include me out billy carney said put the meal on my tab im getting too old for this kind of excitement im going home to bed he stood up brigadier its been interesting he started toward the door and dillon called id like to dive in the morning does that suit you ninethirty carney told him be at the dock and he turned and went out his jeep was in the car park at mongoose junction he walked along there thinking about what had happened was unlocking the door when a hand grabbed his shoulder and as he turned guerra punched him in the mouth now then you bastard lets teach you some manners serra stood a yard or two away supporting algaro santiago beside them guerra and the other two crew members moved in fast carney ducked the first blow and punched the mate in the stomach halfturning giving pinto a reverse elbow strike in the face and then they were all over him they held him down pinning his arms and algaro shuffled over now then he said it was at that precise moment that dillon and ferguson having taken a raincheck on the champagne turned the corner the irishman went in on the run as algaro raised a foot to stamp down on carneys face sent him staggering and punched the nearest man sideways in the jaw carney was already on his feet algaro was past it but when captain serra moved in to help the other three it raised the odds and dillon and carney prepared to defend themselves the jeep at their backs arms raised waiting there was a sudden shot the sound of it flat on the night air everyone stopped dead turned and found ferguson standing beside dillons jeep holding the belgian semiautomatic in one hand now do lets stop playing silly buggers shall we he said there was a pause and santiago said in spanish back to the launch the crew shuffled away unwillingly serra and guerra supporting algaro who still looked dazed another time brigadier santiago said in english and followed them carney wiped a little blood from his mouth with a handkerchief would somebody kindly tell me what in the hell is going on yes we do need to talk captain carney ferguson said briskly and sooner rather than later okay i give in carney smiled bleakly follow me and well go to my place its not too far away carney said its the damnedest thing i ever heard of but you accept its true ferguson asked i have a copy of the translation of the diary in my briefcase at caneel which id be happy for you to see the uboat thing is perfectly possible carney said they were in these waters during world war two thats a known fact and there are locals wholl tell you stories about how they used to come ashore by night he shook his head hitler in the bunker martin bormann ive read all those books and it is an interesting thought that if bormann landed on samson cay and didnt go down with the boat it would explain all those sightings of him in south america in the years since the war good dillon said so you accept the existence of u but where would it be let me get a chart carney went out and came back with one which he unrolled it was the virgin islands chart for st thomas up to virgin gorda theres samson cay south of norman island in the british virgins if that hurricane twisted which they sometimes do and came in from an easterly direction the uboat would definitely be driven somewhere toward the west and south from st john ending where ferguson said it wouldnt be anywhere usual by that i mean somewhere people dive however regularly and ill tell you something else it would have to be within one hundred feet what makes you say that dillon asked henry was a recreational diver that means no decompression is necessary if you follow the tables one hundred and thirty feet is absolute maximum for that kind of sport diving and at that depth he could only afford ten minutes bottom time before going back up to the surface to examine the submarine and find the diary carney shook his head it just wouldnt be possible and henry was sixtythree years of age he knew his limitations so what are you saying to discover the wreck enter it hunt around and find that diary carney shrugged id say thirty minutes bottom time so his depth would likely be eighty feet or so now dive masters take tourists to that kind of depth all the time thats why i mean the location has got to be quite out of the ordinary he frowned and ferguson said you must have some idea the morning henry made his discovery must have been the day after the hurricane blew itself out hed gone out so early that he was coming back in at around ninethirty when i was taking a dive party out we crossed each other and we spoke what did he say dillon asked i asked him where hed been he said french cap told me it was like a millpond out there then thats it ferguson said surely carney shook his head i use french cap a lot the water is particularly clear its a great dive in fact i took my clients out there after meeting henry that morning and he was right it was like a millpond the visibility is spectacular he shook his head no if it was there it would have been found before now can you think of anywhere else carney frowned theres always south drop thats even further you dive there ferguson asked occasionally trouble is if the seas rough its a long and uncomfortable trip but it could be the sort of place a long ridge running to a hundred and seventy or so on one side and two thousand on the other could we take a look at these places ferguson asked carney shook his head and examined the chart again i dont know ferguson said id pay you well captain carney it isnt that carney said strictly speaking this thing is in united states territorial waters just listen please ferguson said were not doing anything wicked here there are some documents on u or so we believe which could give my government cause for concern all we want to do is recover them as quickly as possible and no harm done and santiago where does he fit in hes obviously after the same thing ferguson said why i dont know at this time but i will i promise you you go to the movies carney dillon said santiago and his bunch are the bad guys blackhats and im a good guy carney laughed out loud get the hell out of here and let me get some sleep ill see you at the dock at ninethirty santiago standing in the stern of the maria blanco looked toward cottage seven and the lights which had just come on in both sections so they are back he said to serra who stood beside him now that theyve made contact with carney they may make their move sometime tomorrow serra said youll be able to follow them in the launch whichever boat they are in thanks to the bugs at a discreet distance of course shall i take the divers if you like but i doubt that anything will come of it carney doesnt know where u is serra im convinced of that theyve asked him for suggestions thats all take the divesite handbook for this area with you if they dive somewhere thats mentioned in the book you may take it from me its a waste of time santiago shook his head frankly im inclined to think that the girl has the answer well just have to wait for her return by the way if we ever did find the uboat and needed to blast a way in could noval and pinto cope most assuredly señor we have supplies of c explosive on board and all the necessary detonating equipment excellent santiago said i wish you luck tomorrow then good night captain serra walked away and algaro slipped out of the dark can i go with the launch in the morning ah revenge is it santiago laughed and why not enjoy it while you can algaro and he laughed as he went down to the salon it was a beautiful morning when dillon and ferguson went down to the dock sea raider was tied up no sign of anyone around and privateer was moving out to sea with four people seated in the stern perhaps we got it wrong dillon observed i doubt it ferguson said not that sort of fellow at that moment carney turned on to the end of the dock and came toward them pushing a trolley loaded with air tanks morning he called thought youd left us dillon said looking out toward privateer hell no thats just one of my people taking some divers out to little st james i thought wed use sea raider today because weve a lot further to go he turned to ferguson you a good sailor brigadier my dear chap ive just called in at the gift shop to obtain some seasickness pills of which ive taken not one but two he went on board and climbed the ladder to the flying bridge where he sat in solitary splendor on one of the swivel seats while dillon and carney loaded the tanks when they were finished carney went up joined ferguson and switched on the engines as they eased away from the dock dillon went into the deckhouse he wasnt using his net dive bag had put his diving gear into the olivegreen army holdall stacey had given him in st thomas underneath was the ak assault rifle stock folded and a thirtyround clip inserted ready for action plus an extra magazine there was also his aceinthehole belgian semiautomatic which hed retrieved from the jeep as with all sport fishermen there was a wheel in the deckhouse as well as on the flying bridge so the boat could be steered from there in rough weather dillon felt under the instrument panel until he encountered a metal surface and clamped the holster and gun in place he went up the ladder and joined the others whats our course pretty well due south through pillsbury sound then southwest to french cap carney grinned at ferguson who swung from side to side as the boat started to lift over waves to the open sea you okay brigadier ill let you know i presume you would anticipate our friends from the maria blanco following ive been looking but i havent seen anything yet theres certainly no sign of the maria blanco herself but then theyd use the white launch we saw at carval rock thats a good boat good for twentyfive or six knots i dont get much more than twenty out of this he said to dillon theres some glasses in the locker if you want to keep a weather eye open dillon got them out focused and checked astern there were a number of yachts and a small vehicle ferry with trucks on board crossing from st thomas but no launch not a sign he said now i find that strange ferguson observed you worry too much brigadier carney told him now lets get out of here and he pushed the throttle forward and took sea raider out to open water fast the launch was there of course but a good mile behind serra at the wheel his eye occasionally going to the dark screen with the blob of light showing what was the sea raider algaro stood beside him and noval and pinto busied themselves with diving equipment in the stern algaro didnt look good he had a black eye and his mouth was bruised and swollen no chance of losing them no way serra said ill show you there was a steady and monotonous pinging sound coming from the screen when he swung the wheel turning to port it raised its pitch sounded frantic see that tells us when were off track he turned back to starboard straightening when he got the right sound again checking the course reading good algaro said how are you feeling serra asked well lets put it this way ill feel a whole lot better when ive sorted those bastards out algaro said particularly dillon and he turned and went and joined the others the water heaved in heavy long swells as they drifted in to french cap cay dillon went to the prow to lower the anchor while carney maneuvered the boat leaning out under the blue awning of the flying bridge to give him instructions theres what we call the pinnacle under here he said its top is about fortyfive feet down thats what were trying to catch the anchor on after a while he nodded thats it he called and cut the engines what are we going to do dillon asked as he zipped up his diving suit not much we can do carney told him as he fastened his weight belt its around ninetyfive feet at the most ranging up to fifty we can do a turn right round the rock base and general reef area the visibility is incredible youll not find better anywhere thats why i dont believe this is the right spot that uboat would have been spotted before now by the way i think you picked up my diving gloves by mistake yesterday and ive got yours he rummaged in dillons holdall and found the rifle dear god he said taking it out whats this insurance dillon said as he pulled on his fins an ak is considerably more than that carney unfolded the stock and checked it i would remind you mr carney that it was our friends who fired the first shot ferguson said youre familiar with that weapon i was in vietnam brigadier ive used one for real they make a real ugly distinctive sound i never hope to hear one fired again carney folded the stock replaced the ak in the holdall and finished getting his diving gear on he stepped awkwardly on to the diving platform at its rear and turned ill see you down there he said to dillon inserted his mouthpiece and tumbled backwards serra watched them from about a quarter of a mile away through a pair of old binoculars noval and pinto stood ready in their diving suits algaro said what are they doing theyve anchored and dillon and carney have gone down theres just the brigadier on deck what do you want us to do noval asked well go in very fast but i wont anchor well make it a drift dive catch them by surprise so be ready to go he pushed the launch up to twentyfive knots and as it surged forward noval and pinto got the rest of their equipment on carney hadnt exaggerated there were all colors of coral barrel and tube sponges fish of every description but it was the visibility that was so incredible the water tinged with a deep blue stretching into a kind of infinity there was a school of horseeyed jacks overhead as dillon followed carney and a couple of manta rays flapped across the sandy slope to one side but carney had also been right about the uboat no question that it could be on a site like this dillon followed him along the reef and the base of the rock until finally carney turned and spread his arms dillon understood the gesture and swung round for the return to the boat and saw noval and pinto ahead of them and perhaps twenty feet higher he and carney hung suspended watching them and then the american gestured forward and led the way back to the anchor line they paused there and looked up and saw the keel of the launch moving in a wide circle carney started up the line and dillon followed him finally surfacing at the stern when did they arrive dillon asked ferguson as he shrugged off his jacket and tank about ten minutes after you went down roared up at a hell of a speed didnt put the anchor down simply dropped two divers over the stern we saw them dillon took his gear off and looked across at the launch theres serra the captain and our old chum algaro glowering away they did a neat job of trailing us ill say that carney said anyway lets get moving are we still going to try this south drop place dillon asked im game if you are haul up the anchor noval and pinto surfaced beside the launch and heaved themselves in as dillon went into the prow and started to pull in the anchor only it wouldnt come ill start the engine and try a little movement carney said it made no difference and dillon looked up stuck fast okay carney nodded one of us will have to go down and pull it free well thats me obviously dillon picked up his jacket and tank we need you to handle the boat ferguson said have you got enough air left in that thing dillon checked five hundred thats ample your turn brigadier carney said get in the prow and haul that anchor up the moment its free and try not to give yourself a hernia ill do my best dear boy one thing dillon carney called you wont have the line to come up on and theres a one to twoknot current so youll most probably surface well away from the boat just inflate your jacket and ill come and get you as dillon went in off the stern algaro said whats happening probably the anchor got stuck noval said dillon had in fact reached it at that precise moment it was firmly wedged in a deep crevasse above him carney was working the boat on minimum engine power and as the line slackened dillon pulled the anchor free it dragged over coral for a moment then started up he tried to follow was aware of the current pushing him to one side and didnt fight it simply drifted up slowly and surfaced he was perhaps fifty yards away from sea raider and inflated his jacket lifted high on the heavy swell the brigadier had just about got the anchor in and noval was the first one to spot dillon there he is wonderful algaro shouldered serra aside and took over the wheel ill show him he gunned the engine the launch bore down on dillon who frantically swam to one side just managing to avoid it carney cried out a warning swinging sea raider round from the prow ferguson almost falling into the sea dillon had his left hand raised holding up the tube that allowed him to expel the air from his buoyancy jacket the launch swerved in again brushing him to one side algaro laughing like a maniac the sound clear across the water was turning in a wide circle to come in again the brigadier had the ak out of the holdall was wrestling with it when carney came down the ladder his hands sliding on the guard rails i know how those things work you dont brigadier he put it on full automatic fired a burst over the launch serra was wrestling with algaro now and noval and pinto had hit the deck carney fired another careful burst that ripped up some decking in the prow by that time dillon had disappeared and serra had taken over the wheel he turned in a wide circle and took off at full speed ferguson surveyed the area anxiously has he gone dillon surfaced some little distance away and carney put down the ak went into the lower wheelhouse and took the boat toward him dillon came in at the stern and carney hurried back to relieve him of his jacket and tank jesus but that was lively dillon said when he reached the deck what happened algaro decided to run you down the brigadier told him dillon reached for a towel and saw the ak i thought i heard a little gunfire he looked up at carney you hell they made me mad carney said you still want to try south drop why not ferguson looked at the dwindling launch i dont think theyll be bothering us again not likely carney pointed south rain squall rolling in and thats good because i know where im going and they dont and he went up the ladder to the flying bridge the launch slowed half a mile away and serra raised the glasses to his eyes and watched sea raider disappear into the curtain of rain and mist he checked the screen theyre moving south where are they going any ideas algaro asked serra took the divesite handbook from a shelf opened it and checked the map that was french cap the only one marked here further out is called south drop he riffled through the pages here we are theres a ridge at about seventy feet around a hundred and sixty or seventy on one side then it just drops on the other all the way to the bottom maybe two thousand could that be it i doubt it the very fact that its in the handbook means its dived reasonably frequently noval said the way it works is simple dive masters only bring clients this far out in good weather any other kind and the trip is too long and rough people get sick he shrugged so a place like south drop wouldnt get dived as often but captain serra is right the fact that its in the handbook at all makes it very unlikely the uboat is there somebody would have spotted it years ago and thats a professionals opinion serra said i think señor santiago is right carney doesnt know anything hes just taking them to one or two farout places for want of something better to do señor santiago thinks the girl is our only chance so its a question of waiting for her return id still like to teach those swine a lesson algaro told him and get shot at again that was an ak carney was firing i recognized the sound he could have knocked us all off algaro shrugged he didnt and he wont now pinto was reading the section on south drop in the site guide it sounds a good dive he said to noval except for one thing it says here that black tip reef sharks have been noted are they dangerous algaro demanded depends on the situation if they get stirred up the wrong way they can be a real threat algaros smile was unholy have we still got any of that filthy stuff left you had in the bucket when you were fishing from the launch yesterday he asked noval you mean the bait we were using noval turned to pinto is there any left pinto moved to the stern found a large plastic bucket and took the lid off the smell was appalling there were all kinds of cutup fish in there mingled with intestines rotting meat and oil i bet the sharks would like that algaro said that would bring them in from miles around noval looked horrified it would drive them crazy good then this is what we do algaro turned to serra once theyve stopped we close in through the rain nice and quietly were bound to home in on them with that electronic gadget am i right serra looked troubled yes but i dont want to hear any buts we wait give them time to go down then we go in very fast dump this shit over the side and get the hell out of it there was a smile of pure joy on his face with any kind of luck dillon could lose a leg the sea raider was at anchor lifting in a heavy rolling swell ferguson sat in the deckhouse watching as the other two got ready carney opened the deck locker and took out a long tube with a handle at one end is that what they call an underwater spear gun ferguson asked no its a power gun carney opened a box of ammunition what we call a powerhead some people use a shotgun cartridge me i prefer aacp slide it on the rear chamber here close her up nice and tight theres a firing pin in the base when i jab it against the target the cartridge is fired the bullet goes through but the gases blast a hole the size of your hand and good night vienna dillon pulled on his jacket and tank youre going fishing this time not exactly when i was out here last there were reef sharks about and one of them got kind of heavy im just being careful dillon went in first falling back off the diving platform swam to the line and went down very quickly he turned at the anchor and saw carney following the powerhead in his left hand he hovered about fifteen feet above dillon beckoned and started along the ridge pausing on the edge of the drop the water was gin clear and dillon could see a long way the cliff vanishing way below carney beckoned again and turned to cross the reef to the shallower side there was an eagle ray passing in slow motion in the far distance and suddenly a reef shark crossed its path and passed not too far from them carney turned made a dismissive gesture and dillon followed him to the other side ferguson aware of the rain in the wind moved into the deckhouse found the thermos flask that was full of hot coffee and poured himself a cup he seemed to hear something a muted throbbing moved to the stern and stood there listening there was a sudden roar as serra pushed his engine up to full speed the launch broke from the curtain of rain and cut across sea raiders prow ferguson swore dropped the thermos flask and started for the ak in the holdall in the deckhouse aware of the men on the deck of the launch the bucket emptying into the water by the time he had the ak out they were gone the sound of the engine rapidly disappearing into the rain dillon was aware of something overhead glanced up and saw the keel of the launch moving fast and then the bait drifting down into the water he hovered there watching as a barracuda went in like lightning tearing at a piece of meat he was aware of a tug at his ankle glanced down and saw carney gesturing for him to descend the american was flat on the bottom when dillon reached him and above them there was a sudden turbulence in the water and a shark went in like a torpedo dillon lay on his back like carney looking up as another shark swerved in jaws open and then to his horror a third flashed in overhead they seemed to be fighting amongst themselves and one of them snapped at the barracuda taking its entire body leaving only the head to float down carney turned to dillon pointed across the ridge to the anchor line motioned to keep low and led the way dillon followed aware of the fierce turbulence glanced back and saw them circling each other now and most of the bait had gone he kept right behind carney and so low that his stomach scraped the bottom only starting to rise as they reached the anchor something knocked him to one side with tremendous force he bounced around as one of the sharks brushed past it turned and started in again and carney above him a hand on the line jabbed the powerhead there was an explosion the shark twisted away leaving a trail of blood the other two sharks circled it then one went in jaws open carney tugged at dillons arm and started up the line about halfway up dillon looked down the third shark had joined in now tearing at the wounded one blood in the water like a cloud dillon didnt look back after that surfaced at the dive platform beside carney and hauled himself on board tank and all he sat on deck laughing shakily does that happen often theres a first time for everything carney took his tank off nobody tried to do that to me before he turned to ferguson presumably that was the launch i expect the bastard came in on low power then went up to full speed at the last minute thats it exactly by the time i got to the ak they were away ferguson said carney dried himself and put on a teeshirt id sure like to know how they managed to follow us though especially in this rain and mist he went and hauled in the anchor and dillon said i should have told you brigadier i have my aceinthehole stowed under here maybe you could have got to it faster he ran his hand under the instrument panel to find it and his fingers brushed against the bug he detached it and held it out to ferguson in the palm of his hand well now ferguson said were into electronic wizardry are we what in the hell have you got there carney demanded as he came round from the prow dillon held it out stuck under the instrument panel on a magnet weve been bugged my old son no wonder they were able to keep track of us so easily they probably did the same thing to privateer in case we used that but she stayed close inshore this morning exactly otherwise they might have got confused carney shook his head you know im really going to have to do something about these people and he went up the ladder to the flying bridge on the way back to st john there was a break in the weather another rain squall sweeping across the water the launch was well ahead of it pulled in beside the maria blanco and serra and algaro went up the ladder and found santiago in the stern under the awning you look pleased with yourself he said to algaro have you been killing people again i hope so algaro related the mornings events when he finished santiago shook his head i doubt whether dillon sustained any lasting damage this carney man knows his business too well he sighed were wasting our time theres nothing to be done until the girl returns well run over to samson cay im tired of this place how long will it take serra two hours señor maybe less theres a squall out there off pillsbury sound but its only temporary good well leave at once let prieto know were coming serra turned away and santiago said oh and by the way phone up one of your fishermen friends in cruz bay i want to know the instant that girl turns up the squall was quite ferocious driving rain before it in a heavy curtain but having a curious smoothing effect on the surface of the sea carney switched off the engines and came down the ladder and joined ferguson and dillon in the deckhouse best to ride this out it wont last long he grinned normally i wouldnt carry alcohol but this being a private charter he opened the plastic icebox and came up with three cans of beer accepted gratefully ferguson pulled the tab and drank some down god but thats good there are times when an icecold beer is the only thing carney said once in vietnam i was in a unit that got mortared real bad in fact ive still got fragments in both arms and legs too small to be worth fishing out i sat on a box in the rain eating a sandwich while a corpsman stitched me up and he was out of morphine i was so glad to be alive i didnt feel a thing then someone gave me a can of beer warm beer mind you but nothing ever tasted as good dillon said until the smoke cleared and i saw a guy sitting against a tree with both legs gone carney shook his head god how i came to hate that war after my time i went to georgia state on the marines when nixon came and the police turned up to beat up the antiwar demonstrators all us veterans wore white teeshirts with our medals pinned to them to shame them he laughed and ferguson said the hook in korea was just like that more bodies than you could count absolute hell and you ended up wondering what you were doing there heidegger once said that for authentic living what is necessary is the resolute confrontation of death dillon told them carney laughed harshly i know the works of heidegger i took a bachelor of philosophy degree at georgia state and ill tell you this i bet heidegger was seated at his desk in the study when he wrote that ferguson laughed well said anyway dillon what do you know about it which was your war carney asked dillon said calmly ive been at war all my life he stood up lit a cigarette and went up the ladder to the flying bridge carney said hey wait a minute brigadier that discussion we had about the irish army last night at jennys place when i made a remark about the ira is that what he is one of those gunmen you read about thats what he used to be though they like to call themselves soldiers of the irish republican army his father was killed accidentally in crossfire by british soldiers in belfast when he was quite young so he joined the glorious cause and now i get the impression that his sympathy for the glorious cause of the ira has dwindled somewhat lets be polite and say hes become a kind of mercenary and leave it at that id say thats a waste of a good man its his life ferguson said i suppose so carney stood up clearing now wed better go he went up the ladder to the flying bridge dillon didnt say a word simply sat there in the swivel chair smoking and carney switched on the engines and took the sea raider in toward st john it was perhaps ten minutes later that carney realized that the motor yacht bearing down on them was the maria blanco well damn me he said our dear old friend santiago they must be moving on to samson cay ferguson climbed the ladder to the flying bridge to join them and carney took the sea raider in so close that they could see santiago in the stern with algaro carney leaned over the rail and called have a nice day and ferguson lifted his panama santiago raised his glass to them and said to algaro what did i tell you you fool the sharks probably came off worst at that moment serra came along from the radio room and handed him the portable phone a call from london señor sir francis francis santiago said how are you i was wondering if youd had any breakthrough yet no but theres no need to worry everything is under control one thing has just occurred to me cant imagine why i didnt think of it before the caretakers of the old hotel at samson cay during the war they were a black couple from tortola may and joseph jackson she died years ago but hes still around about seventytwo i think last time i saw him he was running a taxi on the cay i see santiago said i mean he was there when my mother arrived and then bormann you take my point sorry i should have thought of it before you should francis but never mind ill attend to it santiago put the phone down and turned to algaro another job for you but theres no rush im going for a lie down call me when we get in later in the afternoon dillon was lying on a sun lounger on the terrace when ferguson appeared ive just had a thought the brigadier said this millionaires retreat at samson cay might be rather fun to have dinner there beard the lion in his den sounds good to me dillon said we could fly over if you like theres the airstrip i passed over it on my way here and that cessna of mine can put down on land as well as water perhaps we can persuade carney to join us ring the front desk on your cellular phone get the number and ask for the general managers name which dillon did writing the details down quickly there you go carlos prieto within two minutes ferguson was speaking to the gentleman mr prieto brigadier charles ferguson here im staying at caneel one of my friends has a floatplane here and we thought it might be rather fun to fly over this evening and join you for dinner its a dualpurpose plane we could put down on your airstrip there would be three of us i regret brigadier but dining facilities are reserved for our residents what a shame id so hate to disappoint mr santiago there was a slight pause mr santiago was expecting you check with him do a moment brigadier prieto phoned the maria blanco for santiago always preferred to stay on board when at samson cay im sorry to disturb you señor but does the name ferguson mean anything to you brigadier charles ferguson he is on the telephone from caneel he wishes to fly over in a floatplane three of them for dinner santiago laughed out loud excellent prieto marvelous i wouldnt miss it for the world prieto said we look forward to seeing you brigadier at what time may we expect you sixthirty or seven excellent ferguson handed the cellular phone back to dillon get hold of carney and tell him to meet us at jennys place at six in his best bib and tucker well have a cocktail and wing our way to samson cay should be a jolly evening he said and went out it was seven oclock in the evening when jenny grant reached paris and charles de gaulle airport she returned the hired car went to the british airways reservation desk and booked on the next flight to london it was too late to connect with any flight to antigua that day but there was space the following morning on the nine am flight from gatwick arriving in antigua just after two in the afternoon and they even booked her on an onward flight to st thomas on one of the liat interisland service planes with luck she would be in st john by early evening she waited for her tickets went and booked in for the london flight so that she could get rid of her luggage she went to one of the bars and ordered a glass of wine best to stay overnight at gatwick at one of the airport hotels she felt good for the first time since shed heard the news of henrys death excited as well and couldnt wait to get back to st john to see if she was right she went and bought a phone card at one of the kiosks found a telephone and rang jennys

message for me tell him im coming back because i think i might know where it is where what is billy demanded never mind just you give him that message its very important she put the phone down picked up her hand luggage and still full of excitement and elation passed through security into the international lounge ferguson and dillon parked the jeep in the car park at mongoose junction and walked along to jennys place in blazer and guards tie the panama at a suitable angle the brigadier looked extremely impressive dillon wore a navy blue silk suit a white cotton shirt buttoned at the neck when they entered jennys place the bar was already halffull with the early evening trade bob carney leaned on the bar wearing white linen slacks and a blue shirt a blazer on the stool beside him he turned and whistled a regular fashion parade thank god i dressed well we are meeting the devil face to face in a manner of speaking ferguson laid his malacca cane on the bar under the circumstances i think one should make an effort champagne innkeeper he said to billy i thought that might be what youd want i got a bottle of pol roget on ice right here billy produced it from beneath the bar and thumbed out the cork now the surprise ive been saving and whats that carney asked miss jenny was on the phone from paris france shes coming home should be here right about this time tomorrow thats wonderful carney said billy filled three glasses and she gave me a special message for you mr dillon oh and what would that be dillon inquired she said it was important she said to tell you shes coming back because she thinks she might know where it is does that make any kind of sense to you because it sure as hell doesnt to me all the sense in the world ferguson raised his glass and toasted the others to women in general gentlemen and jenny grant in particular bloody marvelous he emptied his glass good into battle and he turned and led the way out behind them the bearded fisherman who had been sitting at the end of the bar listening got up and left he walked to a public phone just along the waterfront took out the piece of paper serra had given him and rang the maria blanco santiago was in his cabin getting ready for the evening when serra hurried in carrying the phone what on earth is it santiago demanded my informant in st john he just heard dillon and his friends talking to jones the bartender at jennys place apparently she was on the phone from paris will be in st john tomorrow evening interesting santiago said thats not all señor she sent a message to dillon to say she was coming back because she thinks she might know where it is santiagos face was very pale and he snatched the phone santiago here now repeat your story to me he listened and finally said youve done well my friend youll be taken care of continue to keep your eyes open he handed the portable phone to serra you see everything comes to he who waits and he turned back to the mirror ferguson dillon and carney crossed from mongoose and followed the trail to lind point toward the seaplane ramp ferguson said rather convenient having a ramp here and so on actually we do have a regular seaplane service some of the time carney said when its operating you can fly to st thomas or st croix even direct to san juan on puerto rico they reached the cessna and dillon walked round checking it generally then pulled the blocks away from the wheels he opened the rear door okay my friends in you go ferguson went first followed by carney dillon opened the other door climbed into the pilots seat slammed and locked the door behind him strapping himself in he released the brakes and the plane rolled down the ramp into the water and drifted outwards on the current ferguson looked across the bay in the fading light beautiful evening but ive been thinking well be flying back in darkness no its a full moon tonight brigadier carney told him i checked the weather forecast dillon added clear crisp night perfect conditions the flight shouldnt take more than fifteen minutes seat belts fastened life jackets under the seat he switched on the engine coughed into life the propeller turned he taxied out of harbor checked to make sure there was no boat traffic and turned into the wind they drifted up into the air and started to climb leveling out at a thousand feet they passed over part of the southern edge of st john then reef bay and finally ram head before striking out to sea toward norman island samson cay perhaps four miles south of it it was a flight totally without incident and exactly fifteen minutes after leaving cruz bay he was making his first pass over the island the maria blanco was lying in the harbor below three hundred yards offshore and there were a number of yachts still a few people on the beach in the fading light a real rich folks hideaway bob carney said is that so ferguson said unimpressed well i hope they do a decent meal thats all im interested in carlos prieto came out of the entrance to reception and looked up as the cessna passed overhead there was an ancient ford station wagon parked at the bottom of the steps an ageing black man leaning against it prieto said there they are joseph get up to the airstrip and bring them in right away sir joseph got behind the wheel and drove off as prieto turned to go inside algaro emerged ah there you are ive been looking for you do we have an old black somewhere around called jackson joseph jackson we certainly do he was the driver of that station wagon that just drove off hes gone to the airstrip to pick up brigadier ferguson and the others do you need him for anything important it can wait algaro told him and went back inside dillon put the cessna down for a perfect landing taxied toward the other end of the airstrip turning into the wind and switched off not bad dillon ferguson told him you can fly a plane ill grant you that youve no idea how good that makes me feel dillon said they all got out and joseph jackson came to meet them car waiting right over here gents ill take you down to the restaurant josephs the name joseph jackson anything you want just let me know ive been around this island longer than anybody indeed ferguson said i dont suppose you were here in the war i understand it was unoccupied that aint so jackson said there was an old hotel here belonged to an american family the herberts the hotel was unoccupied during the war but me and my wife may we came over from tortola to look after things they had reached the station wagon and ferguson said herbert you say they were the owners miss herberts father he gave it to her as a wedding present then she married a mr vail jackson opened the rear door for ferguson to get in then she had a daughter dillon sat beside ferguson and carney took the front seat beside jackson the old boy was obviously enjoying himself so miss herbert became mrs vail who had a daughter called miss vail dillon said jackson started the engine and cackled out loud only miss vail then became lady pamer what do you think of that a real english lady just like the movies switch off that engine ferguson ordered jackson looked bewildered did i say something bob carney reached over and turned the key ferguson said miss vail became lady pamer youre sure i knew her didnt i she came here at the end of the war with her baby little francis that must have been in april fortyfive there was a heavy silence dillon said was anyone else here at the time german gent named strasser he just turned up one night i think he got a fishing boat to drop him off from tortola but lady pamer she was expecting him and sir joseph he came over from england in june mr strasser he moved on the pamers left and went back to england after that sir joseph he used to come back but that was years ago when the resort was first built and sir francis pamer ferguson asked little francis jackson laughed he growed up real fine ive seen him here many times can we go now gents of course ferguson said jackson drove away dillon took out a cigarette and no one said a word until they reached the front entrance ferguson produced his wallet extracted a tenpound note and passed it to jackson my thanks and i thank you jackson told him ill be ready for you gents when you want to go back the three of them paused at the bottom of the steps dillon said so now we know how santiago comes to be so well informed god in heaven ferguson said a minister of the crown and one of the oldest families in england a lot of those people thought hitler had the right ideas during the nineteenthirties dillon said it fits brigadier it all fits what about carter the british secret service was unfortunate enough to employ dear old kim philby burgess maclean all of whom also worked for the kgb and sold us down the river to communism without a moments hesitation since then there was blunt rumours of a fifth man a sixth ferguson sighed in spite of the fact that i dont care a jot for simon carter i must tell you that i believe hes an oldfashioned patriot and honest as the day is long carlos prieto appeared at the top of the steps brigadier ferguson what a pleasure señor santiago is waiting for you in the bar hes just come over from the maria blanco he prefers to stay on board while hes here the lounge bar was busy with the rich and the good as one would expect in such a place people tended to be older rather than younger the men especially mostly american being rather obviously close to the end of their working lives there was a preponderance of trousers in fake scottish plaid swelling over ample bellies white tuxedos god save me dillon said ive never seen so many men who resembled danceband leaders in their prime ferguson laughed out loud and santiago who was seated in a booth by the bar algaro bending over him turned to look at them he stood up and reached out a hand urbanely my dear brigadier ferguson such a pleasure señor santiago ferguson said formally ive long looked forward to this meeting he pointed briefly at algaro with his malacca cane but do we really have to have this creature present i mean couldnt he go and feed the fish or something algaro looked as if he would have liked to kill him on the spot but santiago laughed out loud poor algaro an acquired taste i fear the little devil dillon wagged a finger at algaro now go and chew a bone or something theres a good boy santiago turned and said to algaro in spanish your turn will come go and do as i have told you algaro went out and ferguson said so here we are what now a little champagne perhaps a pleasant dinner santiago waved to prieto who snapped his fingers at a waiter and escorted him with a bottle of krug in an ice bucket one can be civilized cant one isnt that a fact dillon checked the label eightythree not bad señor i bow to your judgment the waiter filled the glasses and santiago raised his to you brigadier ferguson to the playing fields of eton and the continued success of group four you are well informed the brigadier said and you captain carney what a truly remarkable fellow you are war hero sea captain diver of legendary proportions who on earth could they get to play you in the movie i suppose id just have to do it myself carney told him and mr dillon what can i say to a man whose only rival in his chosen profession has been carlos so you know all about us ferguson said very impressive you must need whats in that uboat very badly indeed lets lay our cards on the table brigadier you want what should still be in the captains quarters bormanns briefcase containing his personal authorization from the führer the blue book and the windsor protocol there was a pause and it was carney who said interesting you didnt call him hitler you said the führer santiagos face was hard a great man a very great man who had a vision of the world as it should be not as it has turned out really ferguson commented id always understood that if you counted jews gypsies russians and war dead from various countries around twentyfive million people died to prove him wrong we both want the same thing you and i santiago said the contents of that case you dont want them to fall into the wrong hands the old scandal affecting so many people the duke of windsor putting the royal family in the eye of the storm again the media would have a field day as i say we both want the same thing i dont want all that to come out either so the work continues ferguson said the kamaraden how many names are on that list famous names old names who have prospered since the war in industry and business all on the back of nazi money jesus dillon said it makes the mafia look like small beer come now santiago told him is any of this important after all these years it sure as hell must be either to you or close friends carney said otherwise why would you go to such trouble but it is important mr carney ferguson said thats the point if the network continues over the years if sons become involved grandsons people in higher places politicians for example he drank some more champagne imagine as i say just for example having someone high in government how useful that would be and then after so many years the kind of scandal that could bring everything down around your ears santiago waved for the waiter to pour more champagne i thought you might be sensible but i see not i dont need you brigadier or you mr carney i have my own divers finding it is not enough carney said youve got to get into that tin can and that requires expertise i have divers mr carney an ample supply of c is that the name of the explosive i only employ people who know what they are doing he smiled but this is not getting us anywhere he stood up at least we can eat like civilized men please gentlemen join me the ford station wagon slowed to a halt at the side of the air strip algaro sitting in the rear behind joseph jackson is this where you wanted mister i guess so algaro said those people you brought in from the plane what were they like nice gentlemen jackson said no what i mean is were they curious did they ask questions jackson began to feel uncomfortable what kind of questions you mean mister lets put it this way algaro told him they talked and you talked now what about well the english gentleman he was interested in the old days i told him how i was caretaker here in the herbert place during the big war with my wife and what else did you tell him nothing mister i swear jackson was frightened now algaro put a hand on the back of his neck and squeezed tell me damn you it was nothing much mister jackson struggled to get away about the pamers the pamers yes lady pamer and how she came here at the end of the war tell me algaro said tell me everything he patted him on the side of the face its all right just tell the truth which jackson did and when he was finished algaro said there that wasnt too bad was it he slid an arm across jacksons throat put his other hand on top of his head and twisted breaking the neck so cleanly that the old man was dead in a second he went round opened the door and pulled the body out he positioned it with the head just under the car by the rear wheel took out a flick knife sprung it and stabbed the point into the rear offside tire so that it deflated he got the tool kit out raised the car on the hydraulic jack whistling as he pumped it up very quickly he undid the bolts and removed the tire he stood back and kicked at the jack and the rear of the station wagon lurched to one side and descended on jackson he took out the spare tire and laid it beside the other one then walked across to the cessna and stood looking at it for quite some time the meal was excellent west indian chicken wings with blue cheese conch chowder followed by baked red snapper no one opted for dessert and santiago said coffee id prefer tea dillon told him how very irish of you all i could afford as a boy ill join you ferguson said and at that moment algaro appeared in the doorway you must excuse me gentlemen santiago got up and went and joined algaro what is it i found out who the jackson man was the old fool driving that ford taxi so what happened algaro told him briefly and santiago listened intently watching as the waiter took tea and coffee to the table but it means our friends now know that sir francis is involved in this business it doesnt make any difference señor we know the girl is returning tomorrow we know she thinks she knows where the uboat is who needs these people any more algaro santiago said what have you done as santiago returned to the table ferguson finished his tea and stood up excellent dinner santiago but we really must be going what a pity its been quite an experience hasnt it by the way a couple of presents for you ferguson took the two tracking bugs from his pocket and put them on the table yours i think give my regards to sir francis next time youre in touch or i could give your regards to him how well you put it santiago said and sat down they reached the front entrance to find prieto standing at the top of the steps looking flustered im so sorry gentlemen but ive no idea whats happened to the taxi its of no consequence ferguson said we can walk there in five or six minutes good night to you excellent meal and he went down the steps it was carney who noticed the station wagon just as they reached the airstrip whats he doing over there he said and called jackson there was no reply they walked across and saw the body at once dillon got down on his knees and got as close as he could he stood up brushing his clothes hes been dead for some time the poor bastard carney said the jack must have toppled over a remarkable coincidence ferguson said exactly dillon nodded he tells us all about francis pamer and bingo hes dead just a minute carney put in i mean if santiago knew about the old boys existence why leave it till now id have thought hed have got rid of him a lot earlier than this but not if he didnt realize he existed ferguson said dillon nodded until somebody told him somebody whos been feeding all the other information he needed you mean this guy pamer carney asked yes isnt it perfectly dreadful ferguson said just shows you you cant trust anyone these days now lets get out of here he and carney got in the rear seats and strapped themselves in dillon got a torch from the map compartment and did an external inspection he came back climbed into the pilots seat and closed the door everything looks all right i dont think hell want to kill us yet ferguson said all the other little pranks have been aggravation but he still needs us to hopefully lead him to that uboat so lets get moving theres a good fellow dillon dillon switched on the engine roared into life the propeller turned he carefully checked the illuminated dials on the instrument panel fuel oil pressure he recited the litany looks good to me here we go he took the cessna down the runway and lifted into the night turning out to sea it was a magnificent night stars glittering in the sky the sea and the islands below bathed in the hard white light of the full moon st john loomed before them they crossed ram head moving along the southern coast and it happened the engine missed a beat coughed and spluttered what is it ferguson demanded i dont know dillon said and then checked the instruments and saw what had happened to the oil pressure weve got problems he said get your life jackets on carney got the brigadiers out and helped him into it but surely the whole point of these things is that you dont have to crash you can land on the sea ferguson said thats the theory dillon told him and the engine died totally and the propeller stopped they were at nine hundred feet and he took the plane down in a steep dive reef bay dead ahead carney said right now this is how it goes dillon told them if were lucky well simply glide down and land on the water if the waves are too much we might start to tip so bail out straightaway how deep is it down there carney around seven fathoms close in right theres a third alternative brigadier and thats going straight under youve just made my night ferguson told him if that happens trust carney hell see to you but on no account waste time trying to open the door on your way down itll just stay closed until weve settled and enough water finds its way inside and equalizes the pressure thanks very much ferguson said right here we go the surface of the bay was very close now and it didnt look too rough dillon dropped the cessna in for what seemed like a perfect landing and something went wrong straightaway the plane lurched forward sluggishly not handling at all then tipped and plunged beneath the surface nosedown the water was like black glass they were already totally submerged and descending still plenty of air in the cabin the lights gleaming on the instrument panel dillon felt the water rising up over his ankles and suddenly it was waist deep and the instrument panel lights went out christ almighty ferguson cried carney said ive unbuckled your belt be ready to go any second now the cessna still nosedown touched at that moment a patch of clear sand at the bottom of the bay lifted a little then settled to one side the tip of the port wing braced against a coral ridge the rays of the full moon drifting down through the water created an astonishing amount of light and dillon looking out through the cockpit window as the water level reached his neck was surprised at how far he could see he heard carney say big breath brigadier im opening the door now just slide out through and well go up together dillon took a deep breath himself and as the water passed over his head opened his door reached for the wing strut and pulled himself out he turned still hanging on the strut saw carney clutching at the brigadiers sleeve kicking away from the wing and then they started up it was usually argued that if you went up too fast and didnt expel air slowly on the way there was a danger of rupturing the lungs but in a situation like this there was no time for niceties and dillon floated up the rays of moonlight filtering down through the clear water aware of carney and the brigadier to the left and above him it all seemed to happen in slow motion curiously dreamlike and then he broke through to the surface and took a deep lungful of salt air carney and ferguson floated a few yards away dillon swam toward them are you all right dillon ferguson was gasping for breath i owe you dinner i owe you both a dinner ill hold you to that dillon said you can take me to the garrick again anywhere you want now do you think its possible we could get the hell out of here they turned and swam toward the beach carney and dillon on either side of the older man they staggered out of the water together and sat on the sand recovering carney said theres a house not too far from here i know the people well theyll run us into town and the plane ferguson asked theres a good salvage outfit in st thomas ill phone the boss at home tonight theyll probably get over first thing in the morning theyve got a recovery boat with a crane thatll lift that baby straight off the bottom he turned to dillon what went wrong the oil pressure went haywire and that killed the engine i must say your landing left much to be desired ferguson said and stood up wearily it was a good landing dillon said things only went sour at the very last moment and there has to be a reason for that i mean one thing going wrong is unfortunate two is highly suspicious itll be interesting to see what those salvage people find carney commented as they started across the beach dillon said remember when i was checking the plane back at samson brigadier and you said you didnt think hed want to kill us yet so ferguson said whats your point well i think he just tried the man carney knew at the house nearby got his truck out and ran them down to mongoose where they went their separate ways carney promising to handle the salvaging of the plane and to report back to them in the morning back at the cottage at caneel dillon had a hot shower standing under it for quite some time thinking about things finally he poured himself a glass of champagne and went and stood on the terrace in the warm night he heard his door open and ferguson came in ah there you are he too wore a robe but also had a towel around his neck ill take a glass of that dear boy and also the phone what time is it just coming up to midnight five oclock in the morning in london time to get up and ferguson dialed the number of detective inspector jack lanes flat lane came awake with a groan switched on the bedside lamp and picked up the phone lane here its me jack ferguson told him still in bed are we for gods sake sir its only five oclock in the morning whats that got to do with it ive got work for you jack ive discovered how our friend santiago has managed to stay so well informed really sir lane was coming awake now would you believe sir francis pamer good god lane flung the bedclothes to one side and sat up but why ferguson gave him a brief account of what had happened culminating in old joseph jacksons revelations and the plane crash lane said its difficult to believe isnt it anyway give the pamer family the works jack where did old sir josephs money come from how does sir francis manage to live like a prince use all the usual sources what about the deputy director sir do i inform him in any way simon carter ferguson laughed out loud hed go through the roof it would be at least a week before he could bring himself to believe it very well sir ill get moving on things right away ferguson said so thats taken care of ive been thinking dillon said you were right when you said earlier that you didnt think santiago was ready to kill us yet because he needed us so assuming the crash was no accident i wonder what made him change his mind ive no idea dear boy but im sure well find out ferguson punched the numbers on the cellular phone again ah samson cay resort mr prieto if you please a moment later a voice said prieto here charles ferguson calling from caneel wonderful evening excellent meal do thank mr santiago for me but of course brigadier it was kind of you to call ferguson replaced the phone that will give the bastard pause for thought give me another drop of champagne dear boy then im off to my bed dillon filled his glass not before you tell me something ferguson swallowed half the champagne and what would that be you knew youd be coming to st john from the beginning booked your accommodation at the same time you booked mine and that was before i got here before it became apparent that santiago knew my name and who i was and why i was here which means what dillon said you knew pamer was up to no good before i left london true ferguson said i just didnt have any proof but how did you know process of elimination dear boy after all who knew about the affair at all henry baker the girl admiral travers myself jack lane you dillon the prime minister every one of you could be instantly discarded which only left carter and pamer sounds like an oldfashioned variety act doesnt it carter as i told you earlier and based on my past experience of the man is totally honest which left the good sir francis exactly and that seemed absurd as ive said before a baronet one of englands oldest families a government minister he finished his champagne and put the glass down but then as i think the great sherlock holmes once said when youve exhausted all the possibilities then the impossible must be the answer he smiled goodnight dear boy ill see you in the morning the following morning santiago went for a swim in the sea then sat in the stern under the awnings had coffee and toast and a few grapes while he thought about things algaro waited by the rail patiently saying nothing i wonder what went wrong santiago said after all it would be unusual for you to make a mistake algaro i know my business i did what was necessary señor believe me at that moment captain serra presented himself ive just had a call from my man in cruz bay señor it appears the cessna crashed in reef bay last night thats on the south coast of st john it finished up forty feet down on the bottom ferguson carney and dillon all survived damn them to hell algaro said angrily soon enough santiago sat there frowning serra said have you any order señor yes santiago turned to algaro after lunch you take guerra and go to st john in the launch the girl should arrive at around six in the evening you wish us to bring her to you señor that wont be necessary just find out what she knows im sure thats not beyond your capability algaros smile was quite evil at your orders señor and he withdrew serra waited patiently while santiago poured more coffee how long will the launch take to make the run to cruz bay santiago asked depending on the weather two to two and a half hours señor about the same time as the maria blanco would take yes señor santiago nodded i may want to return to our mooring at paradise some time tonight im not sure it depends on events in any case get me sir francis in london it took twenty minutes for serra to run pamer to earth and he finally located him at a function at the dorchester he sounded rather irritated when he came to the phone who is this i hope its important ive got a speech to make oh im sure youll do marvelously francis there was a pause and pamer said oh its you max how are things we succeeded in locating the old man you mentioned jackson what a mind quite remarkable remembered everything about nineteen fortyfive in sharpest detail oh my god said pamer santiago who had never seen any point in not facing up to the facts of any situation carried on luckily for you he had an accident when changing a wheel on his car and has gone to a better place please max i dont want to know this dont be silly francis this is holdontoyournerves time particularly as the old boy told everything he knew to ferguson before my man helped him on his way unfortunate that ferguson knows pamer felt as if he were about to choke and tore at his tie about my mother and father samson cay martin bormann im afraid so but what are we going to do get rid of ferguson obviously dillon as well and carney the girl arrives this evening and my information is that she knows where the uboat is shell be of no further use after that of course for gods sake no pamer implored and suddenly turned quite cold ive just thought of something my secretary asked me if there was anything wrong with my financial affairs this morning when i asked her why she told me shed noticed a trace being run through the computer i didnt think anything of it i mean when youre a minister they keep these various checks going for your own protection right santiago said have the source checked at once and report back to me he handed the phone to serra you know serra he said its a constant source of amazement to me the frequency with which i become involved with stupid people when ferguson dillon and carney drove down to reef bay in carneys jeep they could see the cessna suspended on the end of the crane at the stern of the salvage boat clear of the water there were three men on deck in diving suits and one in a peaked cap denim shirt and jeans carney whistled the man turned waved then dropped into an inflatable at the side of the boat started the outboard and aimed for shore he came up the beach holding fergusons malacca cane and said to carney this belong to somebody ferguson reached for it im deeply indebted to you means a great deal to me carney introduced them whats the verdict or havent you had time yet hell its open and shut the salvage captain said and turned to dillon bo tells me your oil pressure gauge went wild thats true not surprising the filler cap was blown off that kind of pressure is usually only generated when theres a substantial amount of water in the oil as the engine heats up the water turns to steam and there you go wouldnt you say it was kind of strange to have that much water in the oil carney asked not for me to say what is certain is some vandal or other intended you harm somebody went to work on the bottom of the floats with what looks like a fire axe thats why your landing was fouled the moment you hit the water it poured into those floats he shrugged the rest you know anyway well haul her back to st thomas ill arrange repairs and keep you posted he shook his head you guys were real lucky and he went back to the inflatable and returned to the salvage boat they sat in a booth at jennys place and mary jones brought them chowder and hunks of french bread billy supplied the beer icecold and shook his head you gents must live right i mean you shouldnt be here he walked away and dillon said so you were wrong brigadier he did try to have us killed why maybe it had something to do with what that old guy jackson said carney put in yes that would be part of it but im still surprised ferguson said i still thought we had our uses well we sure will have when jenny gets in carney told him lets hope so the brigadier raised his arm lets have some more beer innkeeper it really is quite excellent when pamer called santiago back it was six oclock in the evening in london it couldnt be worse he said that computer trace has been authorized by detective inspector lane hes fergusons assistant at the moment on temporary loan from special branch its a check on my familys financial background max searching way back im finished dont be a fool just stay cool just think of the time scale if you consider when ferguson found out about you he can only have had time to speak to this lane and tell him to start digging but what if hes spoken to simon carter or the pm if he had youd know by now and why should he fergusons played this whole thing very close to his chest and thats the way hell continue but what about lane ill have him taken care of for gods sake no pamer moaned i cant take any more killing do try to act like a man occasionally santiago said and you do have one consolation once we have the bormann documents in our hands the windsor protocol should prove a very useful tool to have in your possession and there must be people whose fathers or grandfathers appear in the blue book whod give anything to prevent that fact coming out he laughed dont worry francis well have lots of fun with this one he replaced the phone thought about it then picked it up again and dialed another london number he spoke in spanish santiago i have a major elimination for you which must be carried out tonight a detective inspector jack lane special branch im sure you can find the address he handed the phone back to algaro and now my friend i think its time you and guerra departed for st john it was halfpast five when jenny came in on the ferry to cruz bay it was only a few hundred yards along the front to jennys place and when she went in there were already a few people at the bar billy jones standing behind he came round to meet her why miss jenny its so good to see you is mary here she sure is in the kitchen getting things right for this evening just go through i will in a moment did you speak to dillon did you give him my message i did he and that friend of his and bob carney have been as thick as thieves these past few days i dont know whats going on but something sure is so dillon and brigadier ferguson are still at caneel they sure are you want to get in touch with him as soon as possible well you know they dont have telephones in the cottages at caneel but dillon has a cellular phone he gave me the number he went behind the bar opened the cash register drawer and took out a piece of paper here it is mary came through the kitchen door at that moment and came to a dead halt jenny youre back she kissed her on the cheek then held her at arms length you look terrible honey what you been doing nothing much jenny gave her a tired smile just driving halfway across france then catching a plane to london another to antigua a third to st thomas ive never felt so tired in my life what you need is food a hot bath and a nights sleep thats a great idea mary but ive things to do a cup of coffee would be fine let me have it in the office i want to make a telephone call algaro and guerra had obtained the address of the house at gallows point from the fisherman who was captain serras contact in cruz bay they had already paid the place a visit although algaro had decided against a forced entry at that time they went back to the waterfront watched the ferry come in from st thomas and the passengers disembark out of the twenty or so passengers only five were white and three of those were men as the other woman was at least sixty there was little doubt who the younger one with the suitcase was they followed her at a discreet distance and saw her go up the steps to the cafe what do we do now guerra asked wait algaro told him shell go to the house sooner or later guerra shrugged took out a cigarette and lit it and they went and sat on a bench dillon was actually swimming off paradise beach had left the cellular phone with his towel on a recliner on the beach he heard the phone and swam as fast as he could to the shore dillon here its jenny where are you at the bar i just got in how have things been well lets say its been lively and leave it at that there were people waiting for me the moment i got here jenny the wrong sort of people theres a man called santiago who was responsible for the breakin at lord north street and those two thugs who tried to jump you by the thames hes been hanging around here in a motor yacht called the maria blanco causing us as much trouble as possible why he wants bormanns briefcase its as simple as that but how did he know about the uboats existence there was a leak at the london end of things someone connected with intelligence you were right about bob carney quite a guy but hes not been able to come up with a solution do you really think you can help jenny its just an idea so simple that im afraid to tell you so lets leave it until we meet she glanced at her watch six oclock i could do with a hot bath and all the trimmings lets say well meet here at seventhirty and bring bob fine by me dillon put the phone down toweled himself dry then he picked it up and tried carneys house at chocolate hole it was a while before he answered dillon here i was in the shower were in business jennys just phoned me from the bar she just got in has she told you where it is no shes still being mysterious she wants to see us at the bar at seventhirty ill be there dillon rang off then hurried back up the slope to the cottage to report to ferguson when jenny came out of the office mary was standing at the end of the bar talking to her husband you still look like a bad weekend honey she said i know im going to walk up to the house have a shower and put on some fresh clothes then im coming back ive arranged to meet dillon brigadier ferguson and bob carney at seventhirty you aint walking anywhere honey billy you take her up in the jeep check out the house make sure everythings in order then bring her back when shes ready ill get young annie from the kitchen to tend bar while youre gone no need for that mary jenny told her its settled dont give me no argument girl now on your way when jenny emerged from the bar billy jones was at her side carrying the suitcase algaro and guerra followed them at a distance saw them get in the jeep in the car park at mongoose junction and drive away hes taking her up to the house i bet you guerra said algaro nodded well walk up its not far hell have left by the time we get there well get her then guerra said no sign of dillon or the other two that means she hasnt had a chance to speak to them yet and maybe she never will algaro told him guerra paused and licked his lips nervously now look i dont want to get in anything like that not with any woman thats bad luck shut your mouth and do as youre told algaro told him now lets get moving at the ministry of defence just before midnight the light still shone from the windows of fergusons office overlooking horse guards avenue jack lane finished his preliminary reading of the first facts to emerge from the computer concerning the pamer family and very interesting reading they made but hed done enough for one night he put them in his briefcase placed it in the secure drawer of his desk got his raincoat switched off the lights and left he came out of the horse guards avenue entrance and walked along the pavement the young man sitting behind the wheel of the stolen jaguar on the opposite side of the road checked the photo on the seat beside him with a torch just to make sure then slipped it into a pocket he wore glasses and a raincoat over a neat blue suit looked totally ordinary he started the engine watched lane cross the road and start along whitehall court lane was tired and still thinking of the pamer affair glanced casually to the right was aware of the jaguar but had plenty of time to cross the road there was the sudden roar of the engine he halfturned too late the jaguar hit him with such force that he was flung violently to one side lane lay there trying to push himself up was aware that the jaguar was reversing the rear bumper fractured his skull killing him instantly and the car bumped over his body the young man got out and walked forward to check that the inspector was dead the street was quite empty only the rain falling as he got back into the jaguar swerved around lanes body and drove away five minutes later he dumped the jaguar in a side street off the strand and walked rapidly away at gallows point jenny had a long hot shower and washed her hair while downstairs billy opened shutters to air the rooms got a broom and swept the front porch algaro and guerra watched from the bushes nearby damn him why doesnt he go algaro said i dont know but i wouldnt advise trying anything with that one guerra said they tell me he used to be heavyweight boxing champion of the caribbean im frightened to death algaro said after a while jenny came out on the porch and joined billy she wore white linen trousers a shortsleeved blouse looked fresh and relaxed now thats better billy said yes i actually feel human again she said well go back now billy they got in the jeep and drove away and the two men emerged onto the dirt road now what guerra demanded no problem algaro said well get her later for now well go back to the bar and they set off down the road it was almost dark when bob carney went into jennys place and found her serving behind the bar with billy she came round and greeted him warmly with a kiss and drew him over to a booth its good to see you jenny he put a hand on hers i was real sorry about henry i know what he meant to you he was a good man bob a decent kind man i saw him on that last morning carney told her coming in as i was leaving with a dive party he must have gone out real early i asked him where hed been and he told me french cap he shook his head not true jenny dillon and i checked out french cap even had a look at south drop but theyre sites people go to anyway bob that uboat couldnt have just sat there all those years without someone having seen it it was at that moment that dillon and ferguson entered they saw carney and jenny at once and came over ferguson raised his panama miss grant she held out a hand to dillon he took it for a moment and there was an awkwardness between them did things work out all right oh yes i saw henrys sister sorry i was so mysterious the truth is shes a nun little sisters of pity in fact shes the mother superior i never knew that carney said no henry never talked about her he was an atheist you see he felt she was burying herself away to no purpose it led to a rift between them billy came up at that moment can i get you folks some drinks later billy she said we have business to discuss here he went away and ferguson said yes were all ears hopefully youre going to tell us the location of u yes jenny bob carney was excited now where is it i dont know is the short answer she said simply there was consternation on fergusons face you dont know but i was led to believe you did dillon put a restraining hand on the brigadiers arm give her a chance let me put it this way jenny said i think i might know where that information may be found but its so absurdly simple she took a deep breath oh lets get on with it she turned to carney bob the rhoda is still moored there in the harbor will you take us out there sure jenny carney stood up and ferguson said the rhoda carney explained henrys boat the one he was out in that day come on lets go they went down the steps to the road and went along the waterfront to the dock and algaro and guerra watched them descend to an inflatable carney sat in the stern started the outboard and they moved out into the harbor now what guerra asked well just have to wait and see algaro replied carney switched on the light in the deckhouse and they all crowded in well miss grant ferguson said were all here so what have you got to tell us its just an idea she turned to carney bob what do a lot of divers do after a dive you mean check their equipment she broke in something much more basic what im thinking of is the details of the dive carney said of course what on earth is she getting at ferguson demanded i think i see dillon said just like pilots many divers keep logs they enter details of each dive they make its common practice henry was meticulous about it she said usually the first thing he did after getting back on board and drying himself he usually kept it in here she opened the small locker by the wheel reached inside and found it at once it had a red cover bakers name stamped on it in gold she held it out to dillon im afraid i might be wrong you read it dillon paused then turned the pages and read the last one it says here he made an eighty to ninetyfoot dive at a place called thunder point thunder point carney said id never have thought it no one would his final entry reads horseeyed jacks in quantity yellowtail snappers angel and parrot fish and one type vii german submarine u on ledge on east face thank god jenny grant said i was right there was a profound silence as dillon closed the log and ferguson said and now i really could do with that drink algaro and guerra watched them return algaro said shes told them something im sure of it you stay here and keep an eye on things while i go down to the public phone and report in inside they sat at the same booth and when billy came over ferguson said this time champagne is very definitely in order he rubbed his hands now we can really get down to brass tacks dillon said to carney you seemed surprised i mean about the location this thunder point why its maybe twelve miles out thats close to the edge of things ive never dived there no one dives there its the most dangerous reef in this part of the world if the sea is at all rough its a hell of a haul to get there and when you do the current is fierce can take you every which way how do you know this if youve never dived it dillon asked there was an old diver here a few years back old tom poole hes dead now he dived it on his own years back he told me he happened to be that far out by chance and realized it was calmer than usual from what he said its a bit like south drop a reef around seventy feet about a hundred and eighty feet on one side and two thousand on the other in spite of the weather being not too bad the old boy nearly lost his life he never tried again why didnt he see the uboat ferguson demanded maybe he just didnt get that far maybe its moved position since his time the one thing we know for sure is its there because henry found it carney told him i just wonder why he even attempted such a dive jenny said you know what henry was like carney told her always diving on his own when he shouldnt and that morning after the hurricane the sea was calmer than ive ever seen it i figure he was just sailing out there for the pure joy of it realized where he was and saw that conditions were exceptional in those circumstances he would have dropped his hook on that reef and been over the side in no time at all well according to rear admiral travers dillon said and he talked extensively to baker bormann was using the captains cabin except that it wasnt really a cabin it just had a curtain across its on the port side opposite the radio and sound room thats in the forward part of the boat the idea of having it there was so the captain had instant access to the control room that seems reasonably straightforward to me carney said yes but the only access from the control room is by the forward watertight hatch and baker told travers it was corroded to hell really solid okay carney said so well have to blow it c is the thing the stuff santiago was going on about when we were at samson im ahead of you there dillon told him i couldnt get hold of any c but i thought semtex would be an acceptable substitute ive also got chemical detonating pencils is there anything you forgot carney asked ironically i hope not so when do we go ferguson demanded dillon said id say thats up to carney here hes the expert carney nodded slightly abstracted im thinking about it he nodded again the way i see it we want to be in and out before santiago even knows whats going on that makes sense ferguson agreed they cant track us any longer because we got rid of the bugs in both boats we could capitalize on that by leaving around midnight making the trip under cover of darkness dawn at five to fivethirty we could go down at first light sounds good to me dillon said right i left sea raider at caneel bay this evening so well leave from there youll need to pick up that semtex you mentioned any extras we need i can get from the dive shop but not right now ferguson told him now we eat all this excitement has given me quite an appetite it started to rain a little and algaro and guerra sheltered under a tree mother of god is this going to take all night guerra demanded it takes as long as is needed algaro told him inside they had dined well on marys best chowder and grilled snapper were at the coffee stage when dillons cellular phone rang he answered it then handed it across to ferguson its for you somebody from special branch in london the brigadier took the phone ferguson here he listened and suddenly turned very pale and his shoulders sagged just a moment he said wearily and got up excuse me ill be back and he went out what in the hell is that all about carney asked well its not good whatever it is dillon said ferguson returned at that moment and sat down jack lane my assistant is dead oh no jenny said hitandrun accident round about midnight hed been working late you see the police have found the car dumped in a side street off the strand blood all over it stolen of course another remarkable coincidence dillon said you tell him to check up on pamer and in no time hes lying dead in a london side street it was the first time hed seen real anger in fergusons face something flared in the brigadiers eyes that hadnt escaped me dillon the bill will be paid in full believe me he took a deep breath and stood up right lets get going are you coming with us my dear i dont think so jenny told him that kind of boat ride is the last thing i need after what ive been through but ill come and see you off ill follow you in my jeep you carry on ill catch you up i just want a word with mary she went into the kitchen and dillon beckoned billy to the end of the bar do you think you and mary could spend the night at jennys house you think there could be a problem weve had too many for comfort ferguson told him dillon took the belgian semiautomatic from his pocket take this that bad billy inquired that bad then this is better billy took a colt automatic from under the counter fine dillon slipped the belgian semiautomatic back in his pocket take care well see you in the morning in the kitchen mary was working hard at the stove what you doing now girl ive got to go up to caneel mary bob carney is taking the brigadier and mr dillon on a special dive i want to see them off you should be in bed i know ill go soon she went out through the bar and hurried down the steps algaro said there she is lets get after her but jenny started to run catching ferguson dillon and carney at mongoose junction algaro and guerra watched as their quarry got into her jeep carney at her side and followed dillon and ferguson out of the car park all right algaro said lets get after them and they ran toward their own vehicle at the cottage dillon got the olivegreen army holdall took everything out the semtex and fuses the ak and the walther and its silencer ferguson came in as he was finishing wearing cord slacks suede desert boots and a heavy sweater are we going to war again he asked dillon stowed everything back in the holdall i hope not carney and i are going to have enough on our plate just making the dive but you know where everything is if you need it you think you can pull it off well see dillon found his tracksuit top im sorry about lane brigadier so am i ferguson looked bleak but our turn will come dillon i promise you now lets get on with it as they made for the door dillon paused and opened the bar cupboard he took out half a bottle of brandy and dropped it into the holdall purely medicinal he said and held the door open its going to be bloody cold down there at that time of the morning carney had brought the sea raider in to the end of the dock at caneel jenny was sitting on a bench looking down at the boat as he checked the air tanks a threepiece band was playing in the bar music and laughter drifting over the water on the night air ferguson and dillon walked along the front passed the beach terrace restaurant and came along the dock ferguson stepped on board and dillon passed him the holdall he turned to jenny are you all right fine she said not long now dillon told her as some poet put it all doubts resolved all passion spent and then what will you do she asked dillon kissed her briefly on the cheek jesus girl will you give a man a chance to draw breath he took the belgian semiautomatic out of his pocket put that in your purse and dont tell me you dont know what to do with it just pull the slider point and fire she took it reluctantly you think this is necessary you never can tell santiago has been ahead of us too many times when you get back to the bar youll find that billy and mary intend to spend the night with you you think of everything dont you i try to it would take a good man to mess with billy he stepped on board and carney looked down at them from the flying bridge cast off for us jenny he switched on the engines she untied the stern line and handed it to dillon went and did the same with the other the boat drifted out then started to turn away take care my dear ferguson called she raised an arm as sea raider moved out to sea dillon looked back at her standing there under the light at the end of the dock and then she turned and walked away she went past the bar and the shop and started up the path past the sugar mill restaurant to the car park where the taxis waited algaro and guerra had watched the departure from the shadows and now they followed her what shall we do guerra whispered shes bound to go home sooner or later algaro said the best place to deal with her all nice and quiet and we dont even need to follow her jenny got into her jeep and started the engine and they waited until she was driving away before moving toward their own vehicle there were still a few people in the bar when she went in and mary was helping one of the waitresses to clear the tables she came to the end of the bar and billy joined them they got off all right then billy asked thats right are we going to be told what theyre up to miss jenny everyone is sure acting mighty mysterious maybe one of these days billy but not right now she yawned feeling very tired and mary said dont you hold her up with any damn fool questions she needs her sleep she turned to jenny mr dillon asked us to spend the night with you and thats what were going to do all right jenny said ill go on up to the house maybe you should wait for us miss jenny billy told her it will only take us five minutes to close she opened her purse and took out the belgian semiautomatic ive got this billy and i know how to use it ill be fine ill see you soon shed parked the jeep right outside at the bottom of the steps and she slid behind the wheel turned on the engine and drove away so tired that for a moment she forgot to switch on the lights the streets were reasonably quiet now as she drove out toward gallows point and she was at the house in five minutes she parked in the driveway went up the steps found her key and unlocked the front door she switched on the porch light then went in god but she was tired more tired than she had ever been and she mounted the stairs wearily opened her bedroom door and switched on the light it was hot very hot in spite of the ceiling fan and she crossed to the french windows leading to the balcony and opened them there were a few heavy spots of rain and then a sudden rush the kind of thing that happened at night at that time of year she stood there for a moment enjoying the coolness then turned and found algaro and guerra standing just inside the room it was as if she was dreaming but that terrible face told her otherwise the cropped hair the scar from the eye to the mouth he laughed suddenly and said to guerra in spanish this could prove interesting and jenny in spite of her tiredness surprised even herself by darting forward and around them to the door almost made it and it was guerra who caught her right wrist and swung her around algaro struck her heavily across the face then hurled her back on the bed she tried to pull the gun from her purse he took it from her turned her on her face pulling her left arm up twisted and applied some special kind of leverage the pain was terrible and she cried out you like that eh algaro was enjoying himself and tossed the gun across the room lets try some more and this time the pain was the worst thing shed ever known and she screamed at the top of her voice he turned her over slapped her heavily again and took a flick knife from his pocket when he jumped the blade she saw that it was razor sharp he grabbed a handful of her hair now im going to ask you some questions he stroked the blade across her cheek and pricked it gently with the needle point so that blood came if you refuse to answer ill slit your nose and thats just for starters she was only human and terrified out of her mind anything she pleaded right where would we find the wreck of u thunder point she gasped and where would that be its on the chart about ten or twelve miles south of st john thats all i know dillon the brigadier and carney we saw them leave from the dock at caneel bay theyve gone to thunder point to dive on the uboat is that right she hesitated and he slapped her again is that right yes she said theyre diving at first light he patted her face closed the knife and turned to guerra lock the door guerra seemed bewildered why i said lock the door idiot algaro walked past him and swung it shut turning the key he turned and his smile was the cruellest thing jenny had ever seen in her life you did say youd do anything and he started to take his jacket off she screamed again totally hysterical now jumped to her feet turned and ran headlong through the open french windows on to the balcony in total panic hit the railings and went over plunging down through the heavy rain to the garden below guerra knelt beside her in the rain and felt for a pulse he shook his head she looks dead to me right leave her there algaro said that way it looks like an accident now lets get out of here the sound of their jeeps engine faded into the night and jenny lay there rain falling on her face it was only five minutes later that billy and mary jones turned into the drive in their jeep and found her at once lying half across a path half on grass my god mary dropped to her knees and touched jennys face shes cold as ice looks like she fell from the balcony billy said at that moment jenny groaned and moved her head slightly mary said thank god shes alive you carry her inside and ill phone for the doctor and she ran up the steps into the house algaro spoke to santiago from a public telephone on the waterfront santiago listened intently to what he had to say so the girl is dead thats unfortunate no sweat algaro told him just an accident thats how it will look what happens now stay where you are and phone me back in five minutes santiago put the phone down and turned to serra thunder point about ten or twelve miles south of st john well have a look on the chart señor santiago followed him along to the bridge and serra switched on the light over the chart table ah yes here we are santiago had a look frowning slightly dillon and company are on their way there now they intend to dive at first light is there any way we could beat them to it if we left now i doubt it señor and thats open sea out there theyd see the maria blanco coming for miles i take your point santiago said and as we learned the other day theyre armed he examined the chart again and nodded no i think well let them do all the work for us if they succeed it will make them feel good theyll sail back to st john happy maybe even slightly offguard because they will think they have won the game and then señor well descend on them when they return to caneel possibly at the cottage well see so what are your orders well sail back to st john and anchor off paradise beach again the phone was ringing in the radio room that will be algaro calling back and santiago went to answer it algaro replaced the phone and turned to guerra they intend to let those bastards get on with it and do all the work well hit them when they get back what just you and me no stupid the maria blanco will be back off paradise beach in the morning well rendezvous with her then in the meantime well go back to the launch and try to catch a little shuteye jennys head resting on the pillow was turned to one side she looked very pale made no movement even as the doctor gave her an injection mary said what do you think doctor he shook his head not possible to make a proper diagnosis at this stage the fact that shes not regained consciousness is not necessarily bad no overt signs of broken bones but hairline fractures are always possible well see how she is in the morning hopefully shell have regained consciousness by then he shook his head that was a long fall ill have her transferred to st thomas hospital she can have a scan there youll stay with her tonight me and billy wont move an inch mary told him good the doctor closed his bag the slightest change call me billy saw him out then came back up to the bedroom can i get you anything honey no you go and lie down billy ill just sit here with her mary said as you say billy went out and mary put a chair by the bed sat down and held jennys hand youll be fine baby she said softly just fine marys here at three oclock they ran into a heavy squall rain driving in under the canopy over the flying bridge stinging like bullets carney switched off the engine well be better off below for a while dillon followed him down the ladder and they went into the deckhouse where ferguson lay stretched out on one of the benches his head propped up against the holdall he yawned and sat up is there a problem sea raider swung to port buffeted by the wind and rain only a squall carney said itll blow itself out in half an hour i could do with a coffee break anyway a splendid idea dillon found the thermos and some mugs and carney produced a plastic box containing ham and cheese sandwiches they sat in companionable silence for a while eating them the rain drumming against the roof its maybe time we discussed how were going to do this thing carney said to dillon for a nodecompression dive at eighty feet were good for forty minutes so a second dive would be the problem ferguson said i dont understand the technicalities would someone explain the air we breathe is part oxygen part nitrogen carney told him when you dive the pressure causes nitrogen to be absorbed by the body tissues the deeper you go the increase in pressure causes more nitrogen to be absorbed if youre down too long or come up too quickly it can form bubbles in your blood vessels and tissues just like shaking a bottle of club soda the end result is decompression sickness and how can you avoid that first of all by limiting the time were down there particularly on the first dive second time around we might need a safety stop at fifteen feet and what does that entail ferguson asked we rise to that depth and just stay there for a while decompressing slowly how long for that depends dillon lit a cigarette the zippo flaring in the gloom what were really going to have to do is find that submarine fast and lay the charge on the first dive down carney said baker did say it was lying on a ledge on the east face carney nodded i figure that to be the big drop side so we wont waste time going anywhere else he swallowed his coffee and got up if we had the luck went straight down got in the control room and laid that semtex he grinned hell we could be in like flynn and out and back up top in twenty minutes that would make a big difference to the second dive dillon said it surely would the rain had stopped the sea was calm again now and carney glanced at his watch time to get moving gents and he went back up the ladder to the flying bridge in london it was nine oclock in the morning and francis pamer was just finishing a delicious breakfast of scrambled eggs and bacon which his housekeeper had prepared when the phone rang he picked it up pamer here simon carter morning simon pamer said any word from ferguson no but something rather shocking which affects ferguson has happened what would that be you know his assistant the one he borrowed from special branch detective inspector lane pamer almost choked on the piece of toast he was eating yes of course i do he managed to say killed last night when he was leaving the ministry of defence around midnight hit and run stolen car apparently which the police have recovered how terrible thing is special branch arent too happy about it it seems the preliminary medical report indicates that he was hit twice of course that could simply mean the driver panicked and reversed or something on the other hand lane sent a lot of men to prison there must be many who bore him a grudge i see pamer said so special branch are investigating oh yes you know what the police are like when one of their own gets hit free for lunch francis yes pamer said but it would have to be at the house im taking part in the debate on the crisis in croatia thats all right ill see you on the terrace at twelvethirty pamer put the phone down his hand shaking and looked at his watch no sense in ringing santiago now it would be four in the morning over there it would have to wait he pushed his plate with the rest of his breakfast on it away from him suddenly revolted bile rising in his throat the truth was he had never been so frightened in his life way over toward the east the sun was rising as sea raider crept in toward thunder point carney checking the fathometer there it is he said as he saw the yellow ridged lines on the black screen you get to the anchor he told dillon ill have to do some maneuvering so you can hit that ridge at seventy feet there was a heavy swell the boat with the engines throttled back just about holding her own dillon felt the anchor bite satisfactorily called up to carney on the flying bridge and the american switched off the engines carney came down the ladder and looked over the side theres a rough old current running here could be three knots at least ferguson said i must say the water seems exceptionally clear i can see right down to the reef thats because were so far from the mainland carney said it means there is very little particulate matter in the water in fact it gives me an idea whats that dillon asked carney took off his jeans and teeshirt this water is so clear im going to go trolling that means ill stay at less than ten feet work my way across and locate the edge of the cliff if im lucky and the water down there is as clear as it looks i might manage to pinpoint the uboat he zipped up his diving suit and dillon helped him into his tank do you want a line carney shook his head i dont think so he pulled on his mask sat on the high thwart waited for the swell to rise high and went over backwards the water was so clear that they could mark his progress for a while whats the point of all this ferguson asked well by staying at such a shallow depth it will have no effect on the diving later it could save time and time is crucial on this one brigadier if we use too much of it we just wouldnt be able to dive again perhaps for many hours carney surfaced a hundred yards away and waved his arms ferguson got out the old binoculars and focused them hes beckoning carneys voice echoed faintly over here dillon switched on the engines by the deckhouse wheel and throttled down try and get the anchor up brigadier ill do my best to give you a bit of movement ferguson went round to the prow and got to work while dillon tried to give him some slack finally it worked the brigadier shouted in triumph and hauled in dillon throttled down and coasted toward carney when they came alongside the american called drop the hook right here ferguson complied dillon switched off the engine carney swam around to the dive platform slipped off his jacket and climbed aboard clearest ive ever seen he said were right on the edge of the cliff theres been a lot of coral damage recently maybe because of the hurricane but i swear i can see something sticking out over a ledge youre sure ferguson demanded hell nothings certain in this life brigadier but if it is the uboat we can go straight down and be inside in a matter of minutes could make all the difference now lets see what youve got in the bag dillon dillon produced the semtex itll work better if its rolled into a rope and placed around the outer circle of the hatch you would know would you carney asked ive used the stuff before okay lets have a look at those chemical detonating fuses dillon passed them to him and carney examined them these are good ive used them before ten or thirtyminute delay well use a ten dillon was already into his diving suit and now he sliced a large section off the block of semtex and first kneaded it then rolled it between his hands into several long sausages he put it into his dive bag with the detonating fuses im ready when you are carney helped him on with his gear then handed him an underwater spot lamp ill see you at the anchor and remember dillon speed is everything and be prepared for that current dillon nodded and did what carney had done simply sat on the thwart waited until the swell lifted and went in backwards the water was astonishingly clear and very blue the ridge below covered with elkhorn coral and large basket sponges in muted shades of orange as he waited at the anchor a school of barracudalike fish called sennet moved past him and when he looked up there were a number of large jacks overhead the current was strong so fierce that when he held on to the anchor chain his body was extended to one side he glanced up again and carney came down toward him paused for a moment already drifting sideways and gestured dillon went after him checking his dive computer noting that he was at sixtyfive feet followed carney over the edge of the cliff looking down into the blue infinity below and saw to the left the great scar where the coral had broken away the bulk of u the prow sticking out from the ledge they descended to the conning tower held on to the top of the bridge rail dropped down from the high gun platform to the ragged fifteenfoot gash in the hull below the conning tower dillon hovered as carney went inside checked his dive computer and saw that it was seven minutes since leaving sea raider he switched his spot lamp on and went after the american it was dark and gloomy a confusion of twisted metal in spite of the illumination from carneys lamp he was crouched beside the forward hatch trying to turn the unlocking wheel with no success dillon opened his dive bag took out the semtex and handed a coil to carney they worked together dillon taking the top of the hatch carney the bottom pressing the plastic of the explosive in place until they had completed a full circle they finished carney turned and held out a gloved hand dillon passed him two of the chemical detonating pencils carney paused broke the first one and pushed it onto the semtex at the top of the circular hatch a small spiral of bubbles appeared at once carney did the same at the bottom of the circle with the other dillon glanced at his computer seventeen minutes carney nodded and dillon turned and went out through the rent rose to the edge of the cliff went straight to the anchor and started up the line holding on with one hand carney just behind him as they left the line at fifteen feet and moved under the keel of the stern he checked the computer again twentyone minutes he broke through to the surface slipped out of his jacket and climbed on to the diving platform you found it ferguson demanded just like carney said dillon told him in like flynn and out again twenty minutes thats all just twenty bloody minutes carney was changing the tanks for fresh ones sweet jesus ive never seen such a sight ive been diving twenty years or more and ive got to tell you ive never seen anything to beat that dillon lit a cigarette with his zippo santiago eat your heart out id like to take him down weight him with lead and leave him inside carney said except it would be an insult to brave sailors who died down there the surface of the sea lifted spray scattering foam appeared moved outwards in concentric circles over the swell they stood at the rail watching until the activity dwindled finally carney said thats it lets get moving they got their diving gear on again dillon said what happens now i mean how long if were lucky and we find what we want straightaway then theres no problem the whole forward part of the boat has been sealed all these years carney tightened his weight belt that should mean no silt very little detritus human remains will have dissolved years ago except for a few bones in other words it should be relatively clear he sat on the thwart and pulled on his fins if i think we should stop on the way back ill just signal and hang in there dillon followed him down aware of motion in the water some sort of current like shockwaves that hadnt been there before carney hovered over the edge of the cliff and when dillon joined him he saw the problem at once the force of the explosion had caused the uboat to move the stern had lifted the prow stretching out over that feet drop was already dipping they held on to the bridge rail beside the gun and dillon could actually feel the boat move he looked at carney and the american shook his head he was right of course another few feet higher at the stern and u would slide straight over into oblivion and dillon couldnt accept that he turned to go down was aware of carneys restraining hand managed to pull free and jackknifed heading for the rent in the hull pulling himself into the control room everything was stirring with the effects from the explosion the movement of the boat he switched on his spot lamp and moved forward and saw the great ragged hole where the hatch cover had been it was dark in there far murkier than he had expected again from the effects of the explosion he shone his spotlight inside and as he pulled himself through was aware of a strange eerie noise as if some living creature was groaning in pain was aware of the boat moving lurching a little too late to retreat now and his own stubbornness refused to let him the radio and sound room was on the right the captains quarters opposite to his left no curtain left now long since decayed over the years there was a metal locker a door hanging off the skeleton of a bunk he splayed the beam of the torch around and saw it lying in the corner coated with filth a metal briefcase with a handle just like the one baker had taken to london he ran a hand across it silver gleamed dully and then the floor tilted at an alarming angle and everything seemed to be moving he bounced against the bulkhead dropping the case grabbed it again turned and started through the hatch his jacket snagged and he stopped dead struggling frantically aware of the boat tilting farther and then carney was in front of him reaching through to release him the american turned and made for that gash in the hull and dillon went after him the whole boat tilting now sliding the strange groaning noises metal scraping across the edge and carney was through drifting up and dillon rose to join him hovering on the edge of the cliff and as they turned to look down the great whalelike shape of u slid over the edge and plunged into the void carney made the okay sign dillon responded then followed him across the ridge to the anchor line he checked his computer another twenty minutes which was fine and he followed up the line slowly but carney was taking no chances at fifteen feet he stopped and looked down dillon nodded moved up beside him and raised the briefcase in his right hand he could tell that carney was smiling they stayed there for five minutes then surfaced at the stern to find ferguson leaning over anxiously dear god i thought the end of the world had come he said they stowed the gear made everything shipshape carney pulled on jeans and a teeshirt dillon his tracksuit ferguson got the thermos poured coffee and added brandy from the halfbottle the whole bloody sea erupted he said never seen anything like it sort of boiled over what happened she was lying on a ledge brigadier you knew that carney said already sticking right out and the force of the explosion made her start to move good god carney drank some of the coffee christ thats good anyway this idiot here decided he was going to go inside anyway always suspected you were a fool dillon ferguson told him i got the briefcase didnt i it was in the corner of the captains quarters on the floor and then the whole damn boat started to go taking me with it because i got snagged trying to get back out of the hatch what happened a mad impetuous fool called bob carney whod decided to follow me and pulled me through carney went and looked over the side still drinking his coffee a long long way down thats the last anyone will ever see of u its as if she never existed oh yes she did ferguson said and we have this to prove it and he held up the briefcase there wasnt much encrusting carney got a small wire brush from the tool kit and an old towel the surface cleaned up surprisingly well the kriegsmarine insignia clearly etched into the righthand corner carney unfastened the two clips and tried to raise the lid it refused to move shall i force it brigadier get on with it ferguson told him his face pale with excitement carney pushed a thinbladed knife under the edge by the lock exerted pressure there was a cracking sound and the lid moved at that moment it started to rain ferguson took the briefcase into the deckhouse sat down with it on his knees and opened it the documents were in sealed envelopes ferguson opened the first one took out a letter and unfolded it he passed it to dillon my german is a little rusty youre the language expert dillon read it aloud from the leader and chancellor of the state reichsleiter martin bormann is acting under my personal orders in a matter of the utmost importance to the state he is answerable only to me all personnel military or civil without distinction of rank will assist him in any way he sees fit dillon handed it back its signed adolf hitler really ferguson folded it again and put it back in its envelope that would fetch a few thousand at auction at christies he passed another larger envelope over try that dillon opened it and took out a bulky file he leafed through several pages this must be the blue book alphabetical list of names addresses a paragraph under each a sort of thumbnail sketch of the individual see if pamer is there dillon checked quickly yes major sir joseph pamer military cross member of parliament hatherley court hampshire theres an address in mayfair the remarks say hes an associate of sir oswald mosley politically sound and totally committed to the cause of national socialism really ferguson said dryly dillon looked through several more pages and whistled softly jesus brigadier i know im just a little irish peasant but some of the names in here you wouldnt believe some of englands finest a few of americas also ferguson took the file from him glanced at a couple of pages his face grave who would have thought it he put the file back in its envelope and passed another try that there were several documents inside and dillon looked them over briefly these are details of numbered bank accounts in switzerland various south american countries and the united states he handed them back anything else just this ferguson passed the envelope to him and we know what that must be the windsor protocol dillon took the letter out and unfolded it it was written on paper of superb quality almost like parchment and was in english he read it quickly then passed it over written at a villa in estoril in portugal in july addressed to hitler and the signature at the bottom seems to be that of the duke of windsor and what does it say carney asked simple enough the duke says too many have already died on both sides the war is pointless and should be ended as soon as possible he agrees to take over the throne in the event of a successful german invasion my god carney said if thats genuine its dynamite exactly ferguson folded the letter and replaced it in its envelope if it is genuine the nazis were past masters at forgery but his face was sad as he closed the case now what carney asked we return to st john where dillon and i will pack and make our way back to london i have a learjet awaiting my orders at st thomas he held up the case and smiled bleakly the prime minister is a man who likes to hear bad news as quickly as possible the maria blanco had dropped anchor off paradise beach midmorning and algaro and guerra in the launch had made contact at once santiago sitting at his massive desk in the salon listened as they went over the events of the previous night then turned to serra who was standing beside him tell me about the situation as you see it captain a long run out there señor perhaps two and a half hours to come back because theyll be sailing into the wind all the way id say theyll be back quite soon probably just before noon so what do we do hit them tonight algaro asked no santiago shook his head id anticipate ferguson making a move back to london as soon as possible according to our information he has a learjet on standby at st thomas airport he shook his head no we make our move on the instant so what are your orders algaro demanded the simple approach is the best you and guerra will go ashore in one of the inflatables dressed as tourists leave the inflatable on paradise below cottage seven where ferguson and dillon are staying serra will give you each a walkietalkie so you can keep in touch with each other and the ship you algaro will stay in the general vicinity of the cottage read a book on the beach enjoy the sun try to look normal if thats possible and me señor guerra asked you go down to caneel beach and wait when carneys boat arrives notify algaro ferguson and dillon must return to the cottage to change clothes and pack thats when you strike once you have the bormann briefcase you return in the inflatable and well get out of here remember the briefcase is distinctive its made of aluminium and is silver in appearance do we return to san juan señor serra asked no santiago shook his head samson cay i want time to consider my next move the contents of that case will be more than interesting serra they could give my life a whole new meaning he opened a drawer at his right hand there were a number of handguns in there he selected a browning hi power and pushed it across to algaro dont fail me i wont algaro said if they have that briefcase well get it for you oh theyll have it all right santiago smiled i have every faith in our friend dillon his luck is good when sea raider moved in through all the moored yachts to the dock at caneel bay the sun was high in the heavens there were people windsurfing out in the bay and the beach was crowded with sun worshippers guerra was one of them sitting on a deck chair in flowered shirt and bermuda shorts dark glasses shading his eyes he saw dillon step on to the dock to tie up he returned on board then came back the olivegreen holdall in one hand ferguson followed him carrying the briefcase carney walking at his side guerra pulled on a white floppy sunhat that with the brim down partially concealed his features adjusted the dark glasses and moved off the beach along the front of the restaurant to where the path from the dock emerged he reached it almost at the same time as the three men and at that moment a young black receptionist hurried out of the front desk lobby oh captain carney i saw you coming in there was an urgent message for you and what was it carney demanded it was billy jones he said to tell you jenny grant had an accident last night fell from a balcony at her house up at gallows point shes there now theyre moving her over to st thomas hospital real soon my god carney said and nodded to the girl thats okay honey ill handle it another bloody accident dillon said bitterly and handed the holdall to ferguson im going to see her yes of course dear boy ferguson replied ill go back to the cottage have a shower get packed and so on ill see you later dillon turned to carney are you coming i sure as hell am carney told him and they hurried off toward the car park together with the holdall in his right hand and the briefcase in his left ferguson set off following the path that led past the cottages fronting caneel bay guerra paused in the shelter of some bushes and using the walkietalkie called up algaro who sitting on the beach at paradise answered at once yes i hear you ferguson is on his way and alone the others have gone to see the girl theyve what algaro was thrown but quickly pulled himself together all right meet me on the downside of the cottage guerra switched off and turned he could see ferguson a couple of hundred yards further on and hurried after him ferguson put the briefcase on the bed then pulled off his sweater he should have felt exhilarated he told himself looking down at the case but then too much had happened joseph jackson at samson cay a poor old man who had never done anyone harm in his life and jack he sighed opened the door to the bar cupboard and found a whisky miniature he poured it into a glass added water and drank it slowly jack lane the best damn copper he had ever worked with and now jenny grant her accident socalled was beyond coincidence santiago had much to answer for he took the briefcase from the bed and stood it at the side of the small desk checked that the front door was locked then went into the bathroom and turned on the shower guerra and algaro went up the steps and entered the lobby very gently guerra tried the door he shook his head locked algaro beckoned and led the way out back down the steps it was very quiet no one about and the garden surrounding the cottage was very luxuriant shielding a great deal of it from view above their heads a large terrace jutted out there was a path some steps a low wall a small tree beside it easy algaro said stand on the wall brace yourself on the tree and ill make a step up for you with my hands you can reach the terrace rail ill wait at the door he handed him the browning take this guerra was on the terrace in a matter of seconds the venetian blinds were down at the windows but he managed to peer inside through narrow slats there was no sign of ferguson very gently he tried the handle to the terrace door which opened to his touch he took out the browning aware of the sound of the shower glanced around the room saw no immediate sign of the briefcase and went to the outside door and opened it algaro moved in and took the browning from him in the shower is he yes but i cant see the briefcase guerra whispered but algaro did moved quickly to the desk and picked it up triumphantly this is it lets go as they turned to the door ferguson emerged from the bathroom tying the belt of a terry toweling robe the dismay on his face was instant but he didnt waste breath on words simply flung himself at them algaro struck him across the side of the head with the barrel of the browning and when ferguson fell to one knee stamped him sideways into the wall come on algaro cried to guerra pulled open the door and hurried down the steps ferguson managed to get to his feet dizzy his head hurting like hell he staggered across the room got the terrace door open and went out in time to see algaro and guerra running down to the little beach at the bottom of the grass slope they pushed the inflatable into the water started the outboard and moved out from the shore it was only then that ferguson looking up realized that the maria blanco was anchored off there he never felt so impotent in his life never so full of rage he went into the bathroom got a damp flannel for his head found the field glasses and focused them on the yacht he saw algaro and guerra go up the ladder and hurry along the stern to where santiago sat under the awning captain serra beside him algaro placed the briefcase on the table santiago placed his hands on it then turned and spoke to serra the captain moved away and went on the bridge a moment later they started to haul up the anchor and the maria blanco began to move and then a strange thing happened as if realizing he was being observed santiago raised the briefcase in one hand waved with the other and went into the salon it was billy who opened the front door to admit dillon and bob carney at the house at gallows point im real glad to see you he said how is she carney demanded not too good seems like she fell from the balcony outside her bedroom when me and mary found her she was lying there in the rain he wants her the doctor over to st thomas hospital for a scan theyre coming to pick her up in an hour mary said can she speak dillon asked as they went upstairs came to around an hour ago it was you she asked for mr dillon did she tell you how it happened no in fact she aint said much at all listen ill go and make coffee while you stay with her come on billy she told her husband and they went out carney said her face is real bad i know dillon said grimly and she didnt get that from any accident if shed fallen on her face from such a height it would have been smashed completely he took her hand and she opened her eyes dillon thats right jenny im sorry dillon sorry i let you down you didnt let us down jenny we found the uboat carney and i went down together sure jenny carney leaned over we blew a hole in her and we found bormanns briefcase she didnt really know what she was saying of course but carried on i told him dillon i told him you had gone to thunder point told who jenny the man with the scar the big scar from his eye to his mouth algaro carney said she gripped dillons hand lightly he hurt me dillon he really hurt me nobody ever hurt me like that and she closed her eyes and drifted off again when dillon turned the rage on his face was a living thing hes a dead man walking algaro i give you my word and he brushed past carney and went downstairs the front door was open billy sitting on the porch and mary was pouring coffee you gonna have some just a quick one dillon said how is she drifted off again carney told her as he came out on the porch dillon nodded to him and moved to the other end of the porch lets examine the situation it was probably round about midnight algaro put the screws on jenny and found out that wed gone to thunder point so no sign of the opposition turning up either there or on the way back does max santiago seem the kind of man whod just give up at this point no way carney said i agree i think it much more likely he decided to try and relieve us of bormanns briefcase at the earliest opportunity exactly what i was thinking good dillon swallowed his black coffee and put the cup down lets get back to caneel fast you check around the general area of caneel beach the bar the dock and ill find ferguson well meet up in the bar later they went back to mary and billy you boys going mary asked got to dillon said what about you billy will run things down at the bar but me im going to st thomas with jenny tell her ill be in to see her dillon said dont forget now and he hurried down the steps followed by carney when dillon hammered on the door of e it was opened by ferguson holding a flannel loaded with ice cubes to his head what happened dillon demanded algaro happened i was in the shower and the door was locked god knows how he got in but i walked out of the bathroom and there he was with one of the other men i did my best dillon but the bastard had a browning clouted me across the head let me see dillon examined it it could be worse they had an inflatable on the beach and took off for maria blanco it was anchored out there dillon pulled up the venetian blinds in one of the windows well it isnt now i wonder where hes gone back to san juan perhaps ferguson scowled i saw him in the stern through those field glasses saw algaro give him the briefcase he seemed to know i was watching he raised the case in one hand and waved with the other ferguson scowled cheeky bastard i told carney wed see him in the bar dillon said come on wed better go and break the bad news and decide what were going to do in the darkest corner of the bar ferguson and dillon shared a table the brigadier was enjoying a large scotch tinkling with ice while dillon had contented himself with evian water and a cigarette carney came in quickly to join them and called to the waitress just a cold beer what happened i checked with a friend who was out fishing they passed him heading southeast which means they must be going to samson cay dillon actually laughed right you bastard ive got you now what on earth do you mean ferguson demanded the maria blanco will be anchored off samson tonight and if you remember the general manager prieto told us that santiago always stays on board when hes there its simple well go in under cover of darkness and ill get the briefcase back if carney will run us down there in sea raider of course try stopping me carney told him ferguson shook his head you dont give up easily do you dillon i could never see the point dillon poured more evian water and raised his glass it was toward evening as dillon and ferguson waited on the dock at caneel bay sitting on the bench the irishman smoking a cigarette the olivegreen military holdall on the ground between them i think thats him now ferguson said and pointed and dillon saw sea raider coming in from the sea slowly to negotiate the moored yachts there were still people on the beach some of them swimming in the evening sun laughter drifting across the water ferguson said from what i know of santiago i should think hed be ready to repel boarders do you really think you can pull this off anythings possible brigadier dillon shrugged you dont need to come you know id understand ill overlook the insult this time ferguson said coldly but dont ever say something like that to me again dillon dillon smiled cheer up brigadier ive no intention of dying at a place called samson cay after all ive got a dinner at the garrick club to look forward to again with you he got up and moved to the edge of the dock as sea raider drifted in he waved up to carney jumped across the gap got the fenders over then threw a line to the brigadier carney killed the engines and came down the ladder as they finished tying up ive refuelled so everythings shipshape we can leave any time you like ferguson passed the holdall to dillon and stepped across as dillon took it into the deckhouse and put it on one of the benches at that moment the receptionist whod given them the news about jenny when theyd come in earlier came along the dock ive just taken a phone call from mary jones at st thomas hospital mr dillon shed like for you to call her back carney said ill come with you the brigadier nodded ill wait here and keep my fingers crossed dillon stepped over the side and turned along the dock carney at his side mary said shes going to be fine but a good job she had that scan theres what they call a hairline fracture in the skull but the specialist he say nothing that care and good treatment wont cure fine dillon said dont forget to tell her ill be in to see her carney was leaning at the entrance of the telephone booth his face anxious hairline fracture of the skull dillon told him as he hung up but shes going to be okay well thats good carney said as they walked back to the dock thats one way of putting it dillon said another is that santiago and algaro have got a lot to answer for not to mention that bastard pamer ferguson got up and came out of the deckhouse as they arrived good news it could be worse dillon said and told him thank god ferguson took a deep breath all right i suppose wed better get going carney said sure but id like to know how were going to handle this thing even in the dark theres a limit to how close we can get in sea raider without being spotted it seems to me the smart way would be an approach underwater dillon said only theres no we about it carney i once told you you were one of the good guys santiago and his people theyre the bad guys and thats what i am im a bad guy too ask the brigadier hell tell you thats why he hired me for this job in the first place this is where i earn my keep and its a oneman affair now look carney said i can hold up my end i know that and youve got the medals to prove it the brigadier showed me your record but vietnam was different you were stuck in a lousy war that wasnt really any of your business i suppose you were just trying to stay alive and i made it im here arent i remember when you and the brigadier were swapping war stories about vietnam and korea and you asked me what i knew about war and i told you id been at war all my life so at an age when i should have been taking girls out to dances i was fighting the kind of war where the battlefield was rooftops and back alleys leading british paratroopers a dance through the sewers of the falls road in belfast being chased by the sas through south armagh and theyre the best what are you trying to say to me carney asked that when i go over the rail of the maria blanco to recover that briefcase ill kill anyone who tries to get in my way dillon shrugged like i said i can do that without a moments hesitation because im a bad guy i dont think you can and thank god for it there was silence carney turned to ferguson who nodded hes right im afraid okay carney said reluctantly this is the way it goes ill go as close to the maria blanco as we dare and drop anchor then ill take you the rest of the way in an inflatable dillon tried to speak and carney cut him off no buts thats the way its going to be ive got an inflatable moored out there on the buoy with privateer well pick it up on the way all right dillon said have it your way and i come in dillon if anything goes wrong i come in on horseback bugles blowing dillon laughed the south shall rise again you people never could come to terms with losing the civil war there was no civil war carney went up to the flying bridge you must be referring to the war for the independence of the confederacy now lets get moving he switched on the engines dillon stepped over to the dock and untied the lines a moment later and they were moving out into the bay the maria blanco was anchored in the bay at samson cay and santiago sat in the salon reading the documents in bormanns briefcase for the third time hed never been so fascinated in his life he examined the personal order from hitler the signature then reread the windsor protocol it was the blue book which was the most interesting though all those names members of parliament peers of the realm people at the highest levels of society who had supported however secretly the cause of national socialism but then it was hardly surprising in the england of the great depression with something like four million people out of work many would have looked at germany and thought that hitler had the right idea he got up went to the bar and poured a glass of dry sherry then returned to the desk picked up the telephone and called the radio room get me sir francis pamer in london pamer was sitting alone at the desk in his office at the house of commons when the phone rang francis max here pamer was immediately all attention has anything happened you could say that ive got it francis right here on my desk bormanns briefcase and korvettenkapitän paul friemel was right the reichsleiter wasnt just shooting his mouth off while drunk its all here francis hitlers order to him details of numbered bank accounts the windsor protocol now theres an impressivelooking document if they forged it i can only say they did a good job my god pamer said and the blue book francis absolutely fascinating stuff such famous names and a neat little background paragraph for each heres an interesting one ill read it to you major sir joseph pamer military cross member of parliament hatherley court hampshire an associate of sir oswald mosley politically sound totally committed to the cause of national socialism no pamer groaned and there was sudden sweat on his face i cant believe it i wonder what your local conservative association would make of that still alls well that ends well as they say a good thing ive got it and no one else youll destroy it of course pamer said i mean youll destroy the whole bloody lot leave it to me francis ill see to everything santiago said just like i always do ill be in touch soon he put down the phone and started to laugh was still laughing when captain serra came in have you any orders señor santiago looked at his watch it was just after seven yes ill go ashore for a couple of hours and eat at the restaurant very well señor and make sure the deck is patrolled tonight serra just in case our friends decide to pay us a visit i dont think we need worry señor theyd have trouble getting close to us without being spotted but well take every precaution good make the launch ready ill be with you in a moment and santiago went into the bedroom taking the briefcase with him sea raider crept to the west side of samson cay round the point from the resort and the main anchorage carney switched off the engines came down the ladder as dillon went in to the prow and dropped the anchor shunt bay they call this carney said ive been here before a long time ago only four or five fathoms clear sand bottom you cant get down to it because of the cliffs so when guests want to swim here they bring them round from the resort by boat well be safe here at this time of night ferguson checked his watch ten oclock what time will you go maybe another hour ill see dillon went into the deckhouse opened the holdall and took out the ak assault rifle and passed it to ferguson just in case lets hope not ferguson put it on the bench dillon took the walther from the holdall checked it and put it in the dive bag with the carswell silencer then he put in what was left of the semtex and a couple of detonating fuses the thirtyminute ones you really are going to war ferguson said you better believe it dillon slipped the night sight into the bag also carney said ill take you as close as i can in the inflatable and hope to see you on the way back fine dillon smiled break out the thermos brigadier and well have some coffee and then its action stations santiago had enjoyed an excellent meal starting with caviar followed by grilled filet mignon with artichoke hearts washed down by a bottle of chateau palmer deliberate selfindulgence because he felt on top of the world he liked things to go well and the bormann affair had gone very well indeed it was like a wonderful game the information contained in the documents was so startling that the possibilities were endless he asked for a cigar cuban of course just like the old days before that madman castro had ruined everything prieto brought him a romeo and julietta trimmed the end and warmed it for him the meal it was satisfactory señor santiago the meal it was bloody marvelous prieto santiago patted him on the shoulder ill see you tomorrow he stood up picked up the bormann briefcase from the floor beside the table and walked to the door where algaro was waiting well go back to the ship now algaro as you say señor santiago went down the steps and walked along the dock to the launch savouring the night the scent of his cigar yes life could really be very good carney took the inflatable round the point the outboard motor throttled down the noise of it a murmur in the night there were yachts in the bay scattered here and there and a few smaller craft maria blanco anchored three hundred yards out was by far the largest carney killed the engine took a couple of short wooden oars from the bottom of the boat and fitted them into the rowlocks manpower the rest of the way he said the way i see it and with those other boats around i can get you maybe fifty yards away without being spotted thats fine dillon was already wearing his jacket and tank and a black nylon diving cowl carney had found him he took the walther from his dive bag screwed the carswell silencer into place and slipped the weapon inside his jacket youd better pray you dont get a misfire carney said as he rowed water does funny things to guns i learned that in vietnam in those damn paddy fields no problem with a walther its a rollsroyce dillon said they couldnt see each other their faces a pale blur in the darkness carney said you actually enjoy this kind of thing im not too sure if enjoy is the right word exactly i knew guys in vietnam like that special forces mainly they kept drawing these hard assignments and then a strange thing happened they ended up wanting more couldnt get enough is that how you feel dillon theres a poem by browning dillon told him something about our interest being on the dangerous edge of things when i was young and foolish in those early days with the ira and the sas chasing the hell out of me all over south armagh i also discovered a funny thing i loved it more than anything id ever known i lived more in a day really lived than in a year back in london i understand that carney said its like being on some sort of drug but it can only end one way on your back in the gutter in some belfast street oh youve no need to worry about that dillon told him those days are over ill never go back to that carney paused sniffing i think i can smell cigar smoke they floated there in the darkness and the launch emerged on the other side of a couple of yachts and moved to the bottom of the maria blancos steel stairway under the light serra was on deck looking over guerra hurried down to take the line and tied up and santiago went up to the deck followed by algaro looks like hes carrying the briefcase with him carney said dillon got the night sight from his dive bag and focused it youre right hes probably afraid to let it out of his sight what now carney said well hang on for a little while give them a chance to settle down santiago and serra descended from the bridge to the main deck guerra and solona stood at the bottom of the ladder each armed with an m rifle algaro stood by the rail two hours on and four off well rotate during the night and well leave the security lights on that seems more than adequate we might as well turn in now santiago said good night captain he went along to the salon and algaro followed him do you need me any more tonight señor i dont think so algaro you can go to bed algaro withdrew santiago put the briefcase on the desk then he took off his jacket and went and poured a cognac he returned to the desk sat down and leaned back sipping his cognac and just looking at the briefcase finally as he knew he would he opened it and started to go through the documents again dillon focused the night sight he picked out solona in the shadows by a lifeboat in the prow guerra in the stern had made no attempt to hide sat on one of the chairs under the awning smoking a cigarette his rifle on the table dillon handed carney the night sight all yours im on my way he dropped back over the side of the inflatable descended to ten feet and approached the ship he surfaced at the stern of the launch which was tied up at the bottom of the steel stairway suddenly solona appeared up above on the platform dillon eased under the water aware of footsteps descending solona paused halfway down and lit a cigarette the match flaring in cupped hands dillon surfaced gently at the stern of the launch took the walther from inside his jacket and extended his arm over here he whispered in spanish solona glanced up the match still flaring and the silenced walther coughed as dillon shot him between the eyes solona fell back and to one side slid over the rail and dropped ten feet into the water it didnt make too much of a splash but guerra noticed it and got to his feet hey solona is that you yes dillon called softly in spanish no problem he could hear guerra walking along the deck above went under and swam to the anchor he opened his jacket unzipped his diving suit and forced the walther inside then he slipped out of the jacket and tank clipped them to the anchor line and hauled himself up the chain sliding in through the port algaro lying on his bunk was only wearing a pair of boxer shorts because of the oppressive heat for that reason he had the porthole open and heard guerra calling to solona he also heard dillons reply he frowned went to the porthole and listened guerra called softly again where are you solona algaro picked up the revolver on his bedside locker and went out guerra called again where are you solona and moved to the forward deck the m ready over here amigo dillon said and as guerra turned shot him twice in the heart driving him back against the bulkhead dillon went forward cautiously leaned over to check that he was dead there was no sound behind for algaro was barefooted but dillon was suddenly aware of the barrel of the revolver against his neck now then you bastard ive got you algaro reached over and took the walther so a real professionals weapon i like that in fact i like it so much im going to keep it he tossed the revolver over the rail into the sea now turn round im going to give you two in the belly so you take a long time bob carney watching events through the night sight had seen algaros approach had never been so frustrated in his life at his inability to do something about it was never totally certain what happened afterwards because everything moved so fast dillon turned his left arm sweeping algaros right to the side the walther discharging into the deck dillon closed with him if youre going to do it do it dont talk about it they struggled for a moment feeling each others strength why dont you call for help because ill kill you myself with my own hands algaro told him through clenched teeth for my own pleasure youre good at beating up girls arent you dillon said how are you with a man algaro twisted round exerting all his strength and pushed dillon back against the rail at the prow it was his last mistake for dillon let himself go straight over taking algaro with him and the sea was dillons territory not his algaro dropped the walther as they went under the water and started to struggle and dillon held on pulling him down aware of the anchor chain against his back he grabbed for it with one hand and got a forearm across algaros throat at first he struggled very hard indeed feet kicking but quickly weakened finally he was still dillon his own lungs nearly bursting reached onehanded and unbuckled his weight belt he passed it around algaros neck and fastened the buckle again binding him to the anchor chain he surfaced taking in great lungfuls of air it occurred to him then that carney would be watching events through the night sight and he turned and raised an arm then hauled himself back up the anchor chain he kept to the shadows moving along the deck until he came to the main salon he glanced in a porthole and saw santiago sitting at the desk the briefcase open reading dillon crouched down thinking about it then made his decision he took what was left of the semtex from his dive bag inserted the two thirtyminute detonator fuses went and dropped it down one of the engine room air vents then returned and peered through the porthole again santiago was sitting at the desk but now he replaced the documents in his briefcase closed it yawned and got up and went into the bedroom dillon didnt hesitate he moved into the companionway opened the salon door and darted across to the desk and as he picked up the briefcase santiago came back into the room the cry that erupted from his mouth was like a howl of anguish no he cried and dillon turned and ran for the door santiago got the desk drawer open grabbed a smith amp wesson and fired blindly dillon was already into the companionway and making for the deck by now the ship was aroused and serra appeared from his cabin at the rear of the bridge a gun in his hand whats going on he demanded stop him santiago cried its dillon dillon didnt hesitate but kept to the shadows running to the stern and jumped over the rail he went under as deep as he could but the case made things awkward he surfaced aware that they were firing at him and struck out for the darkness as fast as possible in the end it was carney who saved him roaring out of the night and tossing him a line hang on and lets get the hell out of here he called boosted speed and took them away into the friendly dark serra said guerras dead his body is still here but no sign of solona and algaro never mind that santiago told him dillon and carney didnt come all the way in that inflatable from st john carneys sport fisherman must be nearby true serra said and theyll up anchor and start back straightaway and the moment they move youll see them on your radar right i mean theres no other boat moving out to sea from samson cay tonight true señor then get the anchor up serra pressed the bridge button for the electric hoist the motor started to whine santiago said what now the three remaining members of the crew pinto noval and mugica were down on the forward deck and serra leaned over the bridge rail the anchor line is jamming check it mugica leaned over the prow then turned its algaro hes tied to the chain santiago and serra went down the ladder and hurried to the prow and looked over algaro hung there from the anchor chain the weight belt around his throat mother of god santiago said pull him up damn you he turned to serra now lets get moving dont worry señor serra told him were faster than they are theres no way they can get back to st john without us overtaking them and he turned to the ladder and went up to the bridge as noval and mugica hauled algaros body in through the chain port at shunt bay ferguson leaned anxiously over the stern of sea raider as the inflatable coasted in out of the darkness what happened he demanded dillon passed the bormann briefcase up to him thats what happened now lets get out of here he stepped on to the diving platform and carney passed him the inflatable line and dillon tied it securely then went to the deckhouse and worked his way round to the prow and started to pull in the anchor it came free of the sandy bottom with no difficulty behind him carney had already gone up to the flying bridge and was starting the engines ferguson joined him how did it go he doesnt take prisoners ill say that for him carney said but lets get out of here we dont have any kind of time to hang about sea raider plowed forward into the night the wind freshening four to five ferguson sat in the swivel chair and dillon leaned against the rail beside carney theyre faster than we are you know that carney said and hes going to keep coming i know dillon told him he doesnt like to lose well i sure as hell cant go any faster were doing twentytwo knots and thats tops it was ferguson who saw the maria blanco first theres a light back there im sure there is carney glanced round thats them all right couldnt be anyone else dillon raised the night sight yes its the maria blanco hes got good radar on that thing must have carney said no way i can lose him oh yes there is dillon said just keep going serra on the bridge of the maria blanco held a pair of night glasses to his eyes got it he said and passed the glasses to santiago santiago focused them and saw the outline of sea raider right you bastards he leaned over the bridge rail and looked down at mugica noval and pinto who all waited on the forward deck holding m rifles weve seen them get yourselves ready serra increased speed the maria blanco raced forward over the waves and santiago raised the glasses again saw the outline of sea raider and smiled now dillon now he murmured the explosion when it came was instantaneous tearing the bottom out of the ship what happened was so catastrophic that neither santiago captain serra nor the three remaining crew members had time to take it in as their world disintegrated and the maria blanco lifted then plunged beneath the waves on the flying bridge of sea raider what they saw first was a brilliant flash of orange fire and then a second or two later the explosion boomed across the water and then the fire disappeared extinguished only darkness remaining bob carney killed the engine instantly it was very quiet ferguson said a long way down dillon looked back through the night sight u went further he put the night sight in the locker under the instrument panel he did say they were carrying explosives remember carney said we should go back perhaps there are survivors you really think so after that dillon said gently st johns that way carney switched on the engines and as they plowed forward into the night dillon went down the ladder to the deckhouse he took off his diving suit pulled on his tracksuit found a pack of cigarettes went to the rail ferguson came down the ladder and joined him my god he said softly i dont think he had much to do with it brigadier dillon said and he lit a cigarette the zippo flaring it was just after ten the following morning when a nurse showed the three of them into the private room at the st thomas hospital dillon was wearing the black cord slacks the denim shirt and the black flying jacket hed arrived in on the first day ferguson supremely elegant as usual in his panama blazer and guards tie jenny was propped up against pillows her head swathed in white bandages mary sitting beside her knitting got up ill leave you to it but dont you gentlemen overtire her she went out and jenny managed a weak smile my three musketeers now thats kind of fanciful bob carney took her hand how are you i dont feel im here half the time that will pass my dear ferguson said ive had a word with the superintendent anything you want any treatment you need you get its all taken care of thank you brigadier she turned to dillon looked up at him without speaking bob carney said ill be back honey you take care he turned to ferguson who nodded and they went out dillon sat on the bed and took her hand you look terrible i know how are you im fine how did it all go weve got the bormann briefcase the brigadier has his learjet waiting at the airport were taking it back to london the way you put it you make it sound as if it was easy it could have been worse dont go on about it jenny theres no point santiago and his friends that animal algaro theyll never bother you again can you be certain of that as a coffin lid closing he said bleakly there was a kind of pain on her face she closed her eyes briefly opened them again people dont really change do they i am what i am jenny he said simply but then you knew that will i see you again i dont think thats likely he kissed her hand got up went to the door and opened it dillon she called he turned yes jenny god bless and take care of yourself the door closed softly she closed her eyes and drifted into sleep they allowed carney to walk out across the tarmac to the lear with them a porter pushing a trolley with the luggage one of the two pilots met them and helped the porter stow the luggage while dillon ferguson and carney stood at the bottom of the steps the brigadier held up the briefcase thanks for this captain carney if you ever need help or i can do you a good turn he shook hands take care my friend and he went up the steps carney said what happens now in london i mean thats up to the prime minister dillon said depends what he wants to do with those documents it was a long time ago carney said a legitimate point of view carney hesitated then said this pamer guy what about him i hadnt really thought about it dillon said calmly oh yes you have carney shook his head god help you dillon because youll never change and he turned and walked away across the tarmac dillon joined ferguson inside and strapped himself in a good man that ferguson said dillon nodded the best the second pilot pulled up the steps and closed the door went and joined his colleague in the cockpit after a while the engines fired and they moved forward a few moments later they were climbing high and out over the sea ferguson looked out st john over there yes dillon said ferguson sighed i suppose we should discuss what happens when we get back not now brigadier dillon closed his eyes im tired lets leave it till later the house at chocolate hole had never seemed so empty when bob carney entered it he walked slightly aimlessly from room to room then went in the kitchen and got a beer from the icebox as he went to the living room the phone rang it was his wife karye hi honey how are you im fine just fine how about the kids oh lively as usual they miss you this is an impulse call were at a gas station near orlando i just stopped to fill up im sure looking forward to you coming back it wont be long now she said i know its been lonely for you anything interesting happened a slow smile spread across carneys face and he took a deep breath not that i can think of same old routine bye honey ill have to go he put the phone down drank some of his beer went out on the porch it was a fine clear afternoon and he could see the islands on the other side of pillsbury sound and beyond a long way but not as far as max santiago had gone it was just before six oclock the following evening in fergusons office at the ministry of defence and simon carter sat on the other side of the desk whitefaced and shaken as ferguson finished talking so whats to be done about the good sir francis ferguson asked a minister of the crown behaving not only dishonourably but in what can only be described as a criminal way dillon standing by the window in a blue burberry trenchcoat lit a cigarette and carter said does he have to be here nobody knows more of this affair than dillon cant keep him out of it now carter picked up the blue book file hesitated then put it down and unfolded the windsor protocol to read it again i cant believe this is genuine perhaps not but the rest of it is ferguson reached across for the documents replaced them in the briefcase and closed it the prime minister will see us at downing street at eight naturally i havent invited sir francis ill meet you there carter got up very well he went to the door was reaching for the handle when ferguson said oh and carter yes dont do anything stupid like phoning pamer id stay well clear of this if i were you carters face sagged he turned wearily and went out it was ten minutes later and sir francis pamer was clearing his desk at the house of commons before leaving for the evening when his phone rang pamer here he said charles ferguson ah youre back brigadier pamer said warily we need to meet ferguson told him quite impossible tonight i have a most important function dinner with the lord mayor of london cant miss that max santiago is dead ferguson said and i have here on my desk the bormann briefcase the blue book makes very interesting reading your father is featured prominently on page eighteen oh dear god pamer slumped down on his chair i wouldnt speak to simon carter about this if i were you ferguson said that wouldnt really be to your advantage of course not anything you say pamer hesitated you havent spoken to the prime minister then no i thought it best to see you first im very grateful brigadier im sure we can work something out you know charing cross pier of course one of the river boats the queen of denmark leaves there at six fortyfive ill meet you on board youll need an umbrella by the way its raining rather hard ferguson put down the phone and turned to dillon who was still standing by the window thats it then how did he sound dillon asked terrified ferguson got up went to the oldfashioned hall stand he kept in the corner and took down his overcoat the type known to guards officers as a british warm and pulled it on but then he would be poor sod dont expect me to have any sympathy for him dillon picked up the briefcase from the desk come on lets get on with it and he opened the door and led the way out when pamer arrived at charing cross pier the fog was so thick that he could hardly see across the thames he bought his ticket from a steward at the head of the gangplank the queen of denmark was scheduled to call in at westminster pier and eventually cadogan pier at chelsea embankment a popular run on a fine summer evening but on a night like this there were few passengers pamer had a look in the lower saloon where there were halfadozen passengers and a companionway to the upper saloon where he encountered only two ageing ladies talking to each other in whispers he opened a glass door and went outside and looked down there was someone standing at the rail in the stern holding an umbrella over his head he went back inside descended the companionway and went out on deck opening his umbrella against the driving rain that you ferguson he went forward hesitantly his hand on the butt of the pistol in his righthand raincoat pocket it was a very rare weapon from the exclusive collection of world war two handguns his father had left him a volka specially designed for use by the hungarian secret service and as silenced as a pistol could be hed kept it in his desk at the commons for years the queen of denmark was moving away from the pier now and starting her passage upriver fog swirled up from the surface of the water the light from the saloon above was yellow and sickly there were no rear windows to the lower saloon they were alone in their own private space ferguson turned from the rail ah there you are he held up the briefcase well there it is the prime ministers having a look at eight oclock please ferguson pamer pleaded dont do this to me its not my fault that my father was a fascist quite right its also not your fault that your fathers immense fortune in postwar years came from his association with the nazi movement the kamaradenwerk i can even excuse as simply weakness of character the way youve been happy over the years to accept a large continuing income from samson cay holdings mostly money produced by max santiagos more dubious enterprises the drug business for example now look here pamer began dont bother to deny it id asked jack lane to investigate your familys financial background not realizing i was sentencing him to death of course hed really made progress before he was killed or should i say murdered i found his findings in his desk earlier today it wasnt my fault any of it pamer said wildly all my father and his bloody love affair with hitler i had my family name to think of ferguson my position in the government oh yes ferguson conceded rather selfish of you but understandable what i cant forgive is the fact that you acted as santiagos lap dog from the very beginning fed him every piece of information you could you sold me out you sold out dillon putting us in danger of our very lives it was your actions that resulted in jennifer grant being attacked twice once in london where god knows what would have happened if dillon hadnt intervened the second time in st john where she was severely injured and almost died shes in a hospital now i knew none of this i swear oh everything was arranged by santiago i grant you that what im talking about is responsibility on samson cay a poor old man called joseph jackson who gave me my first clue to the truth behind the whole affair the man who was caretaker at the old herbert hotel in was brutally murdered just after talking to me now that was obviously the work of santiagos people but how did he know of the existence of the old man in the first place because you told him you cant prove that you cant prove any of it true just as i cant prove exactly what happened to jack lane but ill make an educated guess those were computer printouts i found in his desk that means he was doing a computer sweep on your family affairs i presume one of your staff noticed normally you wouldnt have been concerned it happens to crown ministers all the time but in the light of recent events you panicked feared the worst and phoned santiago who took care of it for you ferguson sighed i often think the direct dialing system a curse in the old days it would have taken the international operator at least four hours to connect you to a place like the virgins these days all you do is punch a rather long series of numbers pamer took a deep breath and squared his shoulders as regards my familys business interests that was my fathers affair not mine ill plead ignorance if you persist with this thing i know the law ferguson and you seem to have forgotten that i was a working barrister for a short while actually i had ferguson said santiago being dead the only thing you have left is my fathers inclusion in the blue book hardly my fault he seemed to have recovered his nerve you cant prove a thing ill tough it out ferguson ferguson turned and looked at the river as i said i could understand your panic an ancient name tarnished your political career threatened but the attacks on that girl the death of that old man the coldblooded murder of inspector lane on those charges you are every bit as culpable as the men who carried them out prove it pamer said clutching his umbrella in both hands goodbye sir francis charles ferguson said and turned and walked away pamer was trembling and hed totally forgotten about the volka in his pocket too late now for any wild ideas like relieving ferguson of the briefcase at gunpoint he took a deep breath and coughed as the fog bit at the back of his throat he fumbled for his cigarette case got one to his mouth and tried to find his lighter there was the softest of footfalls and dillons zippo flared there you go pamers eyes widened in fear dillon what do you want a word only dillon put his right arm around pamers shoulders under the umbrella and drew him against the stern rail the first time i met you and simon carter on the terrace at the house of commons i made a joke about security and the river and you said you couldnt swim is that true well yes pamers eyes widened as he understood he pulled the volka from his raincoat pocket but dillon in close swept the arm wide the weapon gave a muted cough the bullet thudded into the bulkhead the irishman grabbed for the right wrist slamming it on the rail so that pamer cried out and dropped the pistol in the river thanks old son dillon said youve just made it easier for me he swung pamer round and pushed hard between the shoulder blades so that he sagged across the stern rail reached down grabbed him by the ankles and heaved him over the umbrella floated upside down pamer surfaced raised an arm there was a strangled cry as he went under again and the fog swirled across the surface of the thames covering everything five minutes later the queen of denmark pulled in at westminster pier next to the bridge ferguson was first down the gangway and waited under a tree for dillon to join him taken care of i think you could say that dillon told him good ive got my appointment at downing street now i can walk there from here ill see you at my flat in cavendish square let you know what happened dillon watched him go then moved away himself in the opposite direction fading into the fog and rain ferguson was admitted to downing street some fifteen minutes early for his appointment someone took his coat and umbrella and one of the prime ministers aides came down the stairs at that moment ah there you are brigadier a trifle early i fear no problem the prime minister would welcome the opportunity to consider the material in question himself is that it yes ferguson handed him the briefcase please make yourself comfortable im sure he wont keep you long ferguson took a seat in the hall feeling rather cold he shivered and the porter by the door said no central heating brigadier the workmen moved in today to install the new security systems ah so theyve finally started yes but its bleeding cold of an evening we had to light a fire in the prime ministers study first time in years is that so a few moments later there was a knock at the door the porter opened it and admitted carter brigadier carter said formally the porter took his coat and umbrella and at that moment the aide reappeared please come this way gentlemen the prime minister sat at his desk the briefcase open at one side he was reading through the blue book and glanced up briefly sit down gentlemen ill be with you directly the fire burned brightly in the grate of the victorian fireplace it was very quiet only sudden flurries of rain hammering against the window finally the prime minister sat back and looked at them some of the names on this blue book list are really quite incredible sir joseph pamer for example on page eighteen i presume this is why you didnt ask sir francis to join us brigadier i felt his presence would be inappropriate in the circumstances prime minister and sir francis agreed carter turned and glanced at him sharply the prime minister said you have informed him of his fathers presence in the blue book then yes sir i have i appreciate sir franciss delicacy in the matter on the other hand the fact that his father was a fascist all those years ago is hardly his fault we dont visit the sins of the fathers on the children the prime minister glanced at the blue book again then looked up unless you have anything else to tell me brigadier there was a strange set look on his face as if he was somehow challenging ferguson carter glanced at ferguson puzzled his face pale and ferguson said firmly no prime minister good now we come to the windsor protocol the prime minister unfolded it do you gentlemen consider this to be genuine one cant be certain carter said the nazis did produce some remarkable forgeries during the war there is no doubt about that it is a known fact that the duke hoped for a speedy end to the war ferguson said this is in no way to suggest that he was disloyal but he deeply regretted the loss of life on both sides and wanted it to end be that as it may the tabloid press would have a field day with this and the effect on the royal family would be catastrophic and i wouldnt want that the prime minister said youve brought me the original of korvettenkapitän friemels diary as i asked and the translation are these all the copies everything ferguson assured him good the prime minister piled the documents together got up and went to the fire he put the windsor protocol on top of the blazing coals first an old story gentlemen a long time ago the protocol flared curled into ash he followed it with the hitler order the bank lists the blue book and finally paul friemels diary he turned it never happened gentlemen not any of it carter stood up and managed a feeble smile a wise decision prime minister having said that it would appear this business of using the services of the man dillon worked out brigadier we only reached a successful conclusion because of dillons efforts sir the prime minister came round the desk to shake hands and smiled im sure its an interesting story you must tell me sometime brigadier but for now you must excuse me by some mystery the door opened smoothly behind them and the aide appeared to usher them out in the hall the porter helped them on with their coats a satisfactory conclusion all round id say carter remarked you think so do you ferguson said the porter opened the door and at that moment the aide hurried in from the rear office a moment gentlemen weve just had a most distressing call from the river police they recovered the body of sir francis pamer from the thames a short time ago im about to inform the prime minister carter was struck dumb and ferguson said very sad thank you for letting us know and he stepped out past the policeman on the step put up his umbrella and started to walk along downing street to whitehall he walked very fast was almost at the security gates before carter caught up with him and grabbed his arm what was it you said to him ferguson i want to know i gave him all the facts ferguson said you are aware of the part he played from the beginning in this affair i reminded him of that i can only imagine he decided to do the decent thing very convenient yes isnt it they were on the pavement of whitehall now do you want to share a cab damn you to hell ferguson simon carter told him and walked away ferguson stood there for a moment rain bouncing from his umbrella and a black cab swerved into the curb the driver peered out a cap down over his eyes and asked in perfect cockney you want a cab guvnor thank you ferguson climbed in and the cab pulled away dillon removed his cap and smiled at ferguson in the rearview mirror how did it go ferguson said did you steal this thing no it belongs to a good friend of mine londonirish no doubt of course actually its not registered as a working cab but as everyone assumes it is its great for parking now what about the prime minister he put everything on the fire said it was an old story was even charitable about francis pamer did you put him straight there i couldnt see the point and how did carter take it rather badly just as we were leaving the prime ministers office received a report from the river police they recovered pamers body and carter thinks he did it because of pressure from you i dont know what he thinks or care the only thing i worry about is carters competence he dislikes me so much that it clouded his judgment for example he was so taken up with the mention of sir joseph pamer in the blue book on page eighteen that he missed the gentleman on page fiftyone and who would that be an army sergeant from the first world war badly wounded on the somme no pension out of work in the twenties and understandably angry with the establishment another associate of sir oswald mosley who entered politics and became general secretary of a major trade union he died about ten years ago and who are we talking about the prime ministers uncle on his mothers side mother of god dillon said and you think he knew the prime minister i mean that i knew oh yes ferguson nodded but as he said an old story and the evidence has just gone up in smoke anyway which is why i can afford to tell you dillon after all your efforts in this affair i think youre entitled to know very convenient i must say dillon observed no the prime minister was right we cant visit the sins of the fathers on the children pamer was different where are we going by the way your place i suppose dillon said ferguson opened the window a little and let the rain blow in ive been thinking dillon my departments under severe pressure at the moment besides the usual things weve got the yugoslavian business and all this neonazi stuff in berlin and east germany losing jack lane leaves me in rather a hole i see dillon said ferguson leaned forward right up your street the sort of thing i have in mind think about it dillon dillon swung the wheel did a uturn and started back the other way ferguson was flung back in his seat what are you doing for gods sake dillon smiled in the rearview mirror you did mention dinner at the garrick club didnt you
