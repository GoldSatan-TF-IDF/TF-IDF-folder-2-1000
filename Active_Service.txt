active service by stephen crane chapter i marjory walked pensively along the hall in the cool shadows made by the palms on the window ledge her face wore the expression of thoughtful melancholy expected on the faces of the devotees who pace in cloistered gloom she halted before a door at the end of the hall and laid her hand on the knob she stood hesitating her head bowed it was evident that this mission was to require great fortitude at last she opened the door father she began at once there was disclosed an elderly narrowfaced man seated at a large table and surrounded by manuscripts and books the sunlight flowing through curtains of turkey red fell sanguinely upon the bust of deadeyed pericles on the mantle a little clock was ticking hidden somewhere among the countless leaves of writing the maps and broad heavy tomes that swarmed upon the table her father looked up quickly with an ogreish scowl go away he cried in a rage go away go away get out he seemed on the point of arising to eject the visitor it was plain to her that he had been interrupted in the writing of one of his sentences ponderous solemn and endless in which wandered multitudes of homeless and friendless prepositions adjectives looking for a parent and quarrelling nouns sentences which no longer symbolised the languageform of thought but which had about them a quaint aroma from the dens of longdead scholars get out snarled the professor father faltered the girl either because his formulated thought was now completely knocked out of his mind by his own emphasis in defending it or because he detected something of portent in her expression his manner suddenly changed and with a petulant glance at his writing he laid down his pen and sank back in his chair to listen well what is it my child the girl took a chair near the window and gazed out upon the snowstricken campus where at the moment a group of students returning from a class room were festively hurling snowballs ive got something important to tell you father said she but i dont quite know how to say it something important repeated the professor he was not habitually interested in the affairs of his family but this proclamation that something important could be connected with them filled his mind with a capricious interest well what is it marjory she replied calmly rufus coleman wants to marry me what demanded the professor loudly rufus coleman what do you mean the girl glanced furtively at him she did not seem to be able to frame a suitable sentence as for the professor he had like all men both thoughtless and thoughtful told himself that one day his daughter would come to him with a tale of this kind he had never forgotten that the little girl was to be a woman and he had never forgotten that this tall lithe creature the present marjory was a woman he had been entranced and confident or entranced and apprehensive according to the time a man focussed upon astronomy the pig market or social progression may nevertheless have a secondary mind which hovers like a spirit over his dahlia tubers and dreams upon the mystery of their slow and tender revelations the professors secondary mind had dwelt always with his daughter and watched with a faith and delight the changing to a woman of a certain fat and mumbling babe however he now saw this machine this selfsustaining selfoperative love which had run with the ease of a clock suddenly crumble to ashes and leave the mind of a great scholar staring at a calamity rufus coleman he repeated stunned here was his daughter very obviously desirous of marrying rufus coleman marjory he cried in amazement and fear what possesses you marry rufus colman the girl seemed to feel a strong sense of relief at his prompt recognition of a fact being freed from the necessity of making a flat declaration she simply hung her head and blushed impressively a hush fell upon them the professor stared long at his daugh ter the shadow of unhappiness deepened upon his face marjory marjory he murmured at last he had tramped heroically upon his panic and devoted his strength to bringing thought into some kind of attitude toward this terrible fact i ami am surprised he began fixing her then with a stern eye he asked why do you wish to marry this man you with your opportunities of meeting persons of intelligence and you want to marry his voice grew tragic you want to marry the sunday editor of the new york eclipse it is not so very terrible is it said marjory sullenly wait a moment dont talk cried the professor he arose and walked nervously to and fro his hands flying in the air he was very red behind the ears as when in the classroom some student offended him a gambler a sporter of fine clothes an expert on champagne a polite loafer a witness knave who edits the sunday edition of a great outrage upon our sensibilities you want to marry him this man marjory you are insane this fraud who asserts that his work is intelligent this fool comes here to my house and he became aware that his daughter was regarding him coldly i thought we had best have all this part of it over at once she remarked he confronted her in a new kind of surprise the little keeneyed professor was at this time imperial on the verge of a majestic outburst be still he said dont be clever with your father dont be a dodger or if you are dont speak of it to me i suppose this fine young man expects to see me personally he was coming tomorrow replied marjory she began to weep he was coming tomorrow um said the professor he continued his pacing while marjory wept with her head bowed to the arm of the chair his brow made the three dark vertical crevices well known to his students some times he glowered murderously at the photographs of ancient temples which adorned the walls my poor child he said once as he paused near her to think i never knew you were a fool i have been deluding myself it has been my fault as much as it has been yours i will not readily forgive myself the girl raised her face and looked at him finally resolved to disregard the dishevelment wrought by tears she presented a desperate front with her wet eyes and flushed cheeks her hair was disarrayed i dont see why you can call me a fool she said the pause before this sentence had been so portentous of a wild and rebellious speech that the professor almost laughed now but still the father for the first time knew that he was being undauntedly faced by his child in his own library in the presence of pages of the book that was to be his masterpiece at the back of his mind he felt a great awe as if his own youthful spirit had come from the past and challenged him with a glance for a moment he was almost a defeated man he dropped into a chair does your mother know of this he asked mournfully yes replied the girl she knows she has been trying to make me give up rufus rufus cried the professor rejuvenated by anger well his name is rufus said the girl but please dont call him so before me said the father with icy dignity i do not recognise him as being named rufus that is a contention of yours which does not arouse my interest i know him very well as a gambler and a drunkard and if incidentally he is named rufus i fail to see any importance to it he is not a gambler and he is not a drunkard she said um he drinks heavilythat is well known he gambles he plays cards for money more than he possessesat least he did when he was in college you said you liked him when he was in college so i did so i did answered the professor sharply i often find myself liking that kind of a boy in college dont i know themthose lads with their beer and their poker games in the dead of the night with a towel hung over the keyhole their habits are often vicious enough but something remains in them through it all and they may go away and do great things this happens we know it it happens with confusing insistence it destroys theories therethere isnt much to say about it and sometimes we like this kind of a boy better than we do thethe others for my part i know of many a pure pious and fineminded student that i have positively loathed from a personal pointofview but he added this rufus coleman his life in college and his life since go to prove how often we get off the track there is no gauge of collegiate conduct whatever until we can get evidence of the mans work in the world your precious scoundrels evidence is now all in and he is a failure or worse you are not habitually so fierce in judging people said the girl i would be if they all wanted to marry my daughter rejoined the professor rather than let that man make love to youor even be within a short railway journey of you ill cart you off to europe this winter and keep you there until you forget if you persist in this silly fancy i shall at once become medieval marjory had evidently recovered much of her composure yes father new climates are always supposed to cure one she remarked with a kind of lightness it isnt so much the old expedient said the professor musingly as it is that i would be afraid to leave you herewith no protection against that drinking gambler and gambling drunkard father i have to ask you not to use such terms in speaking of the man that i shall marry there was a silence to all intents the professor remained unmoved he smote the tips of his fingers thoughtfully together yees he observed that sounds reasonable from your standpoint his eyes studied her face in a long and steady glance he arose and went into the hall when he returned he wore his hat and great coat he took a book and some papers from the table and went away marjory walked slowly through the halls and up to her room from a window she could see her father making his way across the campus labouriously against the wind and whirling snow she watched it this little black figure bent forward patient steadfast it was an inferior fact that her father was one of the famous scholars of the generation to her he was now a little old man facing the wintry winds recollect ing herself and rufus coleman she began to weep again wailing amid the ruins of her tumbled hopes her skies had turned to paper and her trees were mere bits of green sponge but amid all this woe appeared the little black image of her father making its way against the storm chapter ii in a highwalled corrider of one of the college buildings a crowd of students waited amid jostlings and a loud buzz of talk suddenly a huge pair of doors flew open and a wedge of young men inserted itself boisterously and deeply into the throng there was a great scuffle attended by a general banging of books upon heads the two lower classes engaged in herculean play while members of the two higher classes standing aloof devoted themselves strictly to the encouragement of whichever party for a moment lost ground or heart this was in order to prolong the conflict the combat waged in the desperation of proudest youth waxed hot and hotter the wedge had been instantly smitten into a kind of block of men it had crumpled into an irregular square and on three sides it was now assailed with remarkable ferocity it was a matter of wall meet wall in terrific rushes during which lads could feel their very hearts leaving them in the compress of friends and foes they on the outskirts upheld the honour of their classes by squeezing into paper thickness the lungs of those of their fellows who formed the centre of the melee in some way it resembled a panic at a theatre the first lancelike attack of the sophomores had been formidable but the freshmen outnumbering their enemies and smarting from continual sophomoric oppression had swarmed to the front like drilled collegians and given the arrogant foe the first serious check of the year therefore the tall gothic windows which lined one side of the corridor looked down upon as incomprehensible and enjoyable a tumult as could mark the steps of advanced education the seniors and juniors cheered themselves ill long freed from the joy of such meetings their only means for this kind of recreation was to involve the lower classes and they had never seen the victims fall to with such vigour and courage bits of printed leaves torn notebooks dismantled collars and cravats all floated to the floor beneath the feet of the warring hordes there were no blows it was a battle of pressure it was a deadly pushing where the leaders on either side often suffered the most cruel and sickening agony caught thus between phalanxes of shoulders with friend as well as foe contributing to the pain charge after charge of freshmen beat upon the now compact and organised sophomores then finally the rock began to give slow way a roar came from the freshmen and they hurled themselves in a frenzy upon their betters to be under the gaze of the juniors and seniors is to be in sight of all men and so the sophomores at this important moment laboured with the desperation of the halfdoomed to stem the terrible freshmen in the kind of game it was the time when bad tempers came strongly to the front and in many sophomores minds a thought arose of the incomparable insolence of the freshmen a blow was struck an infuriated sophomore had swung an arm high and smote a freshman although it had seemed that no greater noise could be made by the given numbers the din that succeeded this manifestation surpassed everything the juniors and seniors immediately set up an angry howl these veteran classes projected themselves into the middle of the fight buffeting everybody with small thought as to merit this method of bringing peace was as militant as a landslide but they had much trouble before they could separate the central clump of antagonists into its parts a score of freshmen had cried out it was coke coke punched him coke a dozen of them were tempestuously endeavouring to register their protest against fisticuffs by means of an introduction of more fisticuffs the upper classmen were swift harsh and hard come now freshies quit it get back get back dyhear with a wrench of muscles they forced themselves in front of coke who was being blindly defended by his classmates from intensely earnest attacks by outraged freshmen these meetings between the lower classes at the door of a recitation room were accounted quite comfortable and idle affairs and a blow delivered openly and in hatred fractured a sharply defined rule of conduct the corridor was in a hubbub many seniors and juniors bursting from old and iron discipline wildly clamoured that some freshman should be given the privilege of a single encounter with coke the freshmen themselves were frantic they besieged the tight and dauntless circle of men that encompassed coke none dared confront the seniors openly but by headlong rushes at auspicious moments they tried to come to quarters with the rings of darkbrowed sophomores it was no longer a festival a game it was a riot coke wildeyed pallid with fury a ribbon of blood on his chin swayed in the middle of the mob of his classmates comrades who waived the ethics of the blow under the circumstance of being obliged as a corps to stand against the scorn of the whole college as well as against the tremendous assaults of the freshmen shamed by their own man but knowing full well the right time and the wrong time for a palaver of regret and disavowal this battalion struggled in the desperation of despair once they were upon the verge of making unholy campaign against the interfering seniors this fiery impertinence was the measure of their state it was a critical moment in the play of the college four or five defeats from the sophomores during the fall had taught the freshmen much they had learned the comparative measurements and they knew now that their prowess was ripe to enable them to amply revenge what was according to their standards an execrable deed by a man who had not the virtue to play the rough game but was obliged to resort to uncommon methods in short the freshmen were almost out of control and the sophomores debased but defiant were quite out of control the senior and junior classes which in american colleges dictate in these affrays found their dignity toppling and in consequence there was a sudden oncome of the entire force of upper classmen football players naturally in advance all distinctions were dissolved at once in a general fracas the stiff and still gothic windows surveyed a scene of dire carnage suddenly a voice rang brazenly through the tumult it was not loud but it was different gentlemen gentlemen instantly there was a remarkable number of haltings abrupt replacements quick changes prof wainwright stood at the door of his recitation room looking into the eyes of each member of the mob of three hundred ssh said the mob ssh quit stop its the embassador stop he had once been minister to austrohungary and forever now to the students of the college his name was embassador he stepped into the corridor and they cleared for him a little respectful zone of floor he looked about him coldly it seems quite a general dishevelment the sophomores display an energy in the halls which i do not detect in the class room a feeble murmur of appreciation arose from the outskirts of the throng while he had been speaking several remote groups of battling men had been violently signaled and suppressed by other students the professor gazed into terraces of faces that were still inflamed i neednt say that i am surprised he remarked in the accepted rhetoric of his kind he added musingly there seems to be a great deal of torn linen who is the young gentleman with blood on his chin the throng moved restlessly a manful silence such as might be in the tombs of stern and honourable knights fell upon the shadowed corridor the subdued rustling had fainted to nothing then out of the crowd coke pale and desperate delivered himself oh mr coke said the professor i would be glad if you would tell the gentlemen they may retire to their dormitories he waited while the students passed out to the campus the professor returned to his room for some books and then began his own march across the snowy campus the wind twisted his coattails fantastically and he was obliged to keep one hand firmly on the top of his hat when he arrived home he met his wife in the hall look here mary he cried she followed him into the library look here he said what is this all about marjory tells me she wants to marry rufus coleman mrs wainwright was a fat woman who was said to pride herself upon being very wise and if necessary sly in addition she laughed continually in an inexplicably personal way which apparently made everybody who heard her feel offended mrs wainwright laughed well said the professor bristling what do you mean by that oh harris she replied oh harris the professor straightened in his chair i do not see any illumination in those remarks mary i understand from marjorys manner that she is bent upon marrying rufus coleman she said you knew of it why of course i knew it was as plain plain scoffed the professor plain why of course she cried i knew it all along there was nothing in her tone which proved that she admired the event itself she was evidently carried away by the triumph of her penetration i knew it all along she added nodding the professor looked at her affectionately you knew it all along then mary why didnt you tell me dear because you ought to have known it she answered blatantly the professor was glaring finally he spoke in tones of grim reproach mary whenever you happen to know anything dear it seems only a matter of partial recompense that you should tell me the wife had been taught in a terrible school that she should never invent any inexpensive retorts concerning bookworms and so she yawed at once really harris really i didnt suppose the affair was serious you could have knocked me down with a feather of course he has been here very often but then marjory gets a great deal of attention a great deal of attention the professor had been thinking rather than let my girl marry that scalawag ill take you and her to greece this winter with the class separation it is a sure cure that has the sanction of antiquity well said mrs wainwright you know best harris you know best it was a common remark with her and it probably meant either approbation or disapprobation if it did not mean simple discretion chapter iii there had been a babe with no arms born in one of the western counties of massachusetts in place of upper limbs the child had growing from its chest a pair of finlike hands mere bits of skincovered bone furthermore it had only one eye this phenomenon lived four days but the news of the birth had travelled up this country road and through that village until it reached the ears of the editor of the michaelstown tribune he was also a correspondent of the new york eclipse on the third day he appeared at the home of the parents accompanied by a photographer while the latter arranged his instrument the correspondent talked to the father and mother two coweyed and yellowfaced people who seemed to suffer a primitive fright of the strangers afterwards as the correspondent and the photographer were climbing into their buggy the mother crept furtively down to the gate and asked in a foreigners dialect if they would send her a copy of the photograph the correspondent carelessly indulgent promised it as the buggy swung away the father came from behind an apple tree and the two semihumans watched it with its burden of glorious strangers until it rumbled across the bridge and disappeared the correspondent was elate he told the photographer that the eclipse would probably pay fifty dollars for the article and the photograph the office of the new york eclipse was at the top of the immense building on broadway it was a sheer mountain to the heights of which the interminable thunder of the streets arose faintly the hudson was a broad path of silver in the distance its edge was marked by the tracery of sailing ships rigging and by the huge and manycoloured stacks of ocean liners at the foot of the cliff lay city hall park it seemed no larger than a quilt the grey walks patterned the snowcovering into triangles and ovals and upon them many tiny people scurried here and there without sound like a fish at the bottom of a pool it was only the vehicles that sent high unmistakable the deep bass of their movement and yet after listening one seemed to hear a singular murmurous note a pulsation as if the crowd made noise by its mere living a mellow hum of the eternal strife then suddenly out of the deeps might ring a human voice a newsboy shout perhaps the cry of a faraway jackal at night from the level of the ordinary roofs combined in many plateaus dotted with short iron chimneys from which curled wisps of steam arose other mountains like the eclipse building they were great peaks ornate glittering with paint or polish northward they subsided to suncrowned ranges from some of the windows of the eclipse office dropped the walls of a terrible chasm in the darkness of which could be seen vague struggling figures looking down into this appalling crevice one discovered only the tops of hats and knees which in spasmodic jerks seemed to touch the rims of the hats the scene represented some weird fight or dance or carouse it was not an exhibition of men hurrying along a narrow street it was good to turn ones eyes from that place to the vista of the citys splendid reaches with spire and spar shining in the clear atmosphere and the marvel of the jersey shore pearlmisted or brilliant with detail from this height the sweep of a snowstorm was defined and majestic even a slight summer shower with swords of lurid yellow sunlight piercing its edges as if warriors were contesting every foot of its advance was from the eclipse office something so inspiring that the chance pilgrim felt a sense of exultation as if from this peak he was surveying the worldwide war of the elements and life the staff of the eclipse usually worked without coats and amid the smoke from pipes to one of the editorial chambers came a photograph and an article from michaelstown massachusetts a boy placed the packet and many others upon the desk of a young man who was standing before a window and thoughtfully drumming upon the pane he turned at the thudding of the packets upon his desk blast you he remarked amiably oh i guess it wont hurt you to work answered the boy grinning with a comrades insolence baker an assistant editor for the sunday paper took scat at his desk and began the task of examining the packets his face could not display any particular interest because he had been at the same work for nearly a fortnight the first long envelope he opened was from a woman there was a neat little manuscript accompanied by a letter which explained that the writer was a widow who was trying to make her living by her pen and who further hoped that the generosity of the editor of the eclipse would lead him to give her article the opportunity which she was sure it deserved she hoped that the editor would pay her as well as possible for it as she needed the money greatly she added that her brother was a reporter on the little rock sentinel and he had declared that her literary style was excellent baker really did not read this note his vast experience of a fortnight had enabled him to detect its kind in two glances he unfolded the manuscript looked at it woodenly and then tossed it with the letter to the top of his desk where it lay with the other corpses none could think of widows in arkansas ambitious from the praise of the reporter on the little rock sentinel waiting for a crown of literary glory and money in the next envelope a man using the notepaper of a boston journal begged to know if the accompanying article would be acceptable if not it was to be kindly returned in the enclosed stamped envelope it was a humourous essay on trolley cars adventuring through the odd scraps that were come to the great mill baker paused occasionally to relight his pipe as he went through envelope after envelope the desks about him gradually were occupied by young men who entered from the hall with their faces still red from the cold of the streets for the most part they bore the unmistakable stamp of the american college they had that confident poise which is easily brought from the athletic field moreover their clothes were quite in the way of being of the newest fashion there was an air of precision about their cravats and linen but on the other hand there might be with them some indifferent westerner who was obliged to resort to irregular means and harangue startled shopkeepers in order to provide himself with collars of a strange kind he was usually very quick and brave of eye and noted for his inability to perceive a distinction between his own habit and the habit of others his western character preserving itself inviolate amid a confusion of manners the men coming one and one or two and two flung badinage to all corners of the room afterward as they wheeled from time to time in their chairs they bitterly insulted each other with the utmost goodnature taking unerring aim at faults and riddling personalities with the quaint and cynical humour of a newspaper office throughout this banter it was strange to note how infrequently the men smiled particularly when directly engaged in an encounter a wide door opened into another apartment where were many little slanted tables each under an electric globe with a green shade here a curlyheaded scoundrel with a corncob pipe was hurling paper balls the size of apples at the head of an industrious man who under these difficulties was trying to draw a picture of an awful wreck with ghastlyfaced sailors frozen in the rigging near this pair a lady was challenging a german artist who resembled napoleon iii with having been publicly drunk at a music hall on the previous night next to the great gloomy corridor of this sixteenth floor was a little office presided over by an austere boy and here waited in enforced patience a little dismal band of people who wanted to see the sunday editor baker took a manuscript and after glancing about the room walked over to a man at another desk here is something that i think might do he said the man at the desk read the first two pages but where is the photogragh he asked then there should be a photograph with this thing oh i forgot said baker he brought from his desk a photograph of the babe that had been born lacking arms and one eye bakers superior braced a knee against his desk and settled back to a judicial attitude he took the photograph and looked at it impassively yes he said after a time thats a pretty good thing you better show that to coleman when he comes in in the little office where the dismal band waited there had been a sharp hopeful stir when rufus coleman the sunday editor passed rapidly from door to door and vanished within the holy precincts it had evidently been in the minds of some to accost him then but his eyes did not turn once in their direction it was as if he had not seen them many experiences had taught him that the proper manner of passing through this office was at a blind gallop the dismal band turned then upon the austere office boy some demanded with terrible dignity that he should take in their cards at once others sought to ingratiate themselves by smiles of tender friendliness he for his part employed what we would have called his knowledge of men and women upon the group and in consequence blundered and bungled vividly freezing with a glance an annoyed and importunate arctic explorer who was come to talk of illustrations for an article that had been lavishly paid for in advance the hero might have thought he was again in the northern seas at the next moment the boy was treating almost courteously a german from the cast side who wanted the eclipse to print a grand full page advertising description of his invention a gun which was supposed to have a range of forty miles and to be able to penetrate anything with equanimity and joy the gun as a matter of fact had once been induced to go off when it had hurled itself passionately upon its back incidentally breaking its inventors leg the projectile had wandered some four hundred yards seaward where it dug a hole in the water which was really a menace to navigation since then there had been nothing tangible save the inventor in splints and out of splints as the fortunes of science decreed in short this office boy mixed his business in the perfect manner of an underdone lad dealing with matters too large for him and throughout he displayed the pride and assurance of a god as coleman crossed the large office his face still wore the stern expression which he invariably used to carry him unmolested through the ranks of the dismal band as he was removing his london overcoat he addressed the imperturbable back of one of his staff who had a desk against the opposite wall has hasskins sent in that drawing of the mine accident yet the man did not lift his head from his work but he answered at once no not yet coleman was laying his hat on a chair well why hasnt he he demanded he glanced toward the door of the room in which the curlyheaded scoundrel with the corncob pipe was still hurling paper balls at the man who was trying to invent the postures of dead mariners frozen in the rigging the office boy came timidly from his post and informed coleman of the waiting people all right said the editor he dropped into his chair and began to finger his letters which had been neatly opened and placed in a little stack by a boy baker came in with the photograph of the miserable babe it was publicly believed that the sunday staff of the eclipse must have a kind of aesthetic delight in pictures of this kind but colemans face betrayed no emotion as he looked at this specimen he lit a fresh cigar tilted his chair and surveyed it with a cold and stony stare yes thats all right he said slowly there seemed to be no affectionate relation between him and this picture evidently he was weighing its value as a morsel to be flung to a ravenous public whose wolflike appetite could only satisfy itself upon mental entrails abominations as for himself he seemed to be remote exterior it was a matter of the eclipse business suddenly coleman became executive better give it to schooner and tell him to make a halfpage or no send him in here and ill tell him my idea hows the article any good well give it to smith to rewrite an artist came from the other room and presented for inspection his drawing of the seamen dead in the rigging of the wreck a company of grizzly and horrible figures bonyfingered shrunken and with awful eyes hum said coleman after a prolonged study thats all right thats good jimmie but youd better work em up around the eyes a little more the office boy was deploying in the distance waiting for the correct moment to present some cards and names the artist was cheerfully taking away his corpses when coleman hailed him oh jim let me see that thing again will you now how about this spar this dont look right to me it looks right to me replied the artist sulkily but see its going to take up half a page cant you change it somehow how am i going to change it said the other glowering at coleman thats the way it ought to be how am i going to change it thats the way it ought to be no it isnt at all said coleman youve got a spar sticking out of the main body of the drawing in a way that will spoil the look of the whole page the artist was a man of remarkable popular reputation and he was very stubborn and conceited of it constantly making himself unbearable with covert threats that if he was not delicately placated at all points he would freight his genius over to the office of the great opposition journal thats the way it ought to be he repeated in a tone at once sullen and superior the spar is all right i cant rig spars on ships just to suit you and i cant give up the whole paper to your accursed spars either said coleman with animation dont you see you use about a third of a page with this spar sticking off into space now you were always so clever jimmie in adapting yourself to the page cant you shorten it or cut it off or something or break itthats the thing make it a broken spar dangling down see yes i spose i could do that said the artist mollified by a thought of the ease with which he could make the change and mollified too by the brazen tribute to a part of his cleverness well do it then said the sunday editor turning abruptly away the artist with head high walked majestically back to the other room whereat the curlyheaded one immediately resumed the rain of paper balls upon him the office boy came timidly to coleman and suggested the presence of the people in the outer office let them wait until i read my mail said coleman he shuffled the pack of letters indifferently through his hands suddenly he came upon a little grey envelope he opened it at once and scanned its contents with the speed of his craft afterward he laid it down before him on the desk and surveyed it with a cool and musing smile so he remarked thats the case is it he presently swung around in his chair and for a time held the entire attention of the men at the various desks he outlined to them again their various parts in the composition of the next great sunday edition in a few brisk sentences he set a complex machine in proper motion his men no longer thrilled with admiration at the precision with which he grasped each obligation of the campaign toward a successful edition they had grown to accept it as they accepted his hat or his london clothes at this time his face was lit with something of the selfcontained enthusiasm of a general immediately afterward he arose and reached for his coat and hat the office boy coming circuitously forward presented him with some cards and also with a scrap of paper upon which was scrawled a long and semicoherent word what are these grumbled coleman they are waiting outside answered the boy with trepidation it was part of the law that the lion of the anteroom should cringe like a cold monkey more or less as soon as he was out of his private jungle oh tallerman cried the sunday editor heres this arctic man come to arrange about his illustration i wish youd go and talk it over with him by chance he picked up the scrap of paper with its cryptic word oh he said scowling at the office boy pity you cant remember that fellow if you cant remember faces any better than that you should be a detective get out now and tell him to go to the devil the wilted slave turned at once but coleman hailed him hold on come to think of it i will see this idiot send him in he commanded grimly coleman lapsed into a dream over the sheet of grey note paper presently a middleaged man a palpable german came hesitatingly into the room and bunted among the desks as unmanageably as a tempesttossed scow finally he was impatiently towed in the right direction he came and stood at colemans elbow and waited nervously for the engrossed man to raise his eyes it was plain that this interview meant important things to him somehow on his commonplace countenance was to be found the expression of a dreamer a fashioner of great and absurd projects a fine tender fool he cast hopeful and reverent glances at the man who was deeply contemplative of the grey note he evidently believed himself on the threshold of a triumph of some kind and he awaited his fruition with a joy that was only made sharper by the usual human suspicion of coming events coleman glanced up at last and saw his visitor oh its you is it he remarked icily bending upon the german the stare of a tyrant so youve come again have you he wheeled in his chair until he could fully display a contemptuous merciless smile now mr whatsyourname youve called here to see me about twenty times already and at last i am going to say something definite about your invention his listeners face which had worn for a moment a look of fright and bewilderment gladdened swiftly to a gratitude that seemed the edge of an outburst of tears yes continued coleman i am going to say something definite i am going to say that it is the most imbecile bit of nonsense that has come within the range of my large newspaper experience it is simply the aberration of a rather remarkable lunatic it is no good it is not worth the price of a cheese sandwich i understand that its one feat has been to break your leg if it ever goes off again persuade it to break your neck and now i want you to take this nursery rhyme of yours and get out and dont ever come here again do you understand you understand do you he arose and bowed in courteous dismissal the german was regarding him with the surprise and horror of a youth shot mortally he could not find his tongue for a moment ultimately he gasped but mister editor coleman interrupted him tigerishly you heard what i said get out the man bowed his head and went slowly toward the door coleman placed the little grey note in his breast pocket he took his hat and top coat and evading the dismal band by a shameless manoeuvre passed through the halls to the entrance to the elevator shaft he heard a movement behind him and saw that the german was also waiting for the elevator standing in the gloom of the corridor coleman felt the mournful owlish eyes of the german resting upon him he took a case from his pocket and elaborately lit a cigarette suddenly there was a flash of light and a cage of bronze gilt and steel dropped magically from above coleman yelled down a door flew open coleman followed by the german stepped upon the elevator well johnnie he said cheerfully to the lad who operated this machine is business good yes sir pretty good answered the boy grinning the little cage sank swiftly floor after floor seemed to be rising with marvellous speed the whole building was winging straight into the sky there were soaring lights figures and the opalescent glow of ground glass doors marked with black inscriptions other lifts were springing heavenward all the lofty corridors rang with cries up down down up the boys hand grasped a lever and his machine obeyed his lightest movement with sometimes an unbalancing swiftness coleman discoursed briskly to the youthful attendant once he turned and regarded with a quick stare of insolent annoyance the despairing countenance of the german whose eyes had never left him when the elevator arrived at the ground floor coleman departed with the outraged air of a man who for a time had been compelled to occupy a cell in company with a harmless spectre he walked quickly away opposite a corner of the city hall he was impelled to look behind him through the hordes of people with cable cars marching like panoplied elephants he was able to distinguish the german motionless and gazing after him coleman laughed thats a comic old boy he said to himself in the grillroom of a broadway hotel he was obliged to wait some minutes for the fulfillment of his orders and he spent the time in reading and studying the little grey note when his luncheon was served he ate with an expression of morose dignity chapter iv marjory paused again at her fathers door after hesitating in the original way she entered the library her father almost represented an emblematic figure seated upon a column of books well he cried then seeing it was marjory he changed his tone ah under the circumstances my dear i admit your privilege of interrupting me at any hour of the day you have important business with me his manner was satanically indulgent the girl fingered a book she turned the leaves in absolute semblance of a person reading rufus coleman called indeed said the professor and ive come to you father before seeing him the professor was silent for a time well marjory he said at last what do you want me to say he spoke very deliberately i am sure this is a singular situation here appears the man i formally forbid you to marry i am sure i do not know what i am to say i wish to see him said the girl you wish to see him enquired the professor you wish to see him marjory i may as well tell you now that with all the books and plays ive read i really dont know how the obdurate father should conduct himself he is always pictured as an exceedingly dense gentleman with white whiskers who does all the unintelligent things in the plot you and i are going to play no drama are we marjory i admit that i have white whiskers and i am an obdurate father i am as you well may say a very obdurate father you are not to marry rufus coleman you understand the rest of the matter he is here you want to see him what will you say to him when you see him i will say that you refuse to let me marry him father and she hesitated a moment before she lifted her eyes fully and formidably to her fathers face and that i shall marry him anyhow the professor did not cavort when this statement came from his daughter he nodded and then passed into a period of reflection finally he asked but when that is the point when the girl made a sad gesture i dont know i dont know perhaps when you come to know rufus better know him better know that rapscallion better why i know him much better than he knows himself i know him too well do you think i am talking offhand about this affair do you think i am talking without proper information marjory made no reply well said the professor you may see coleman on condition that you inform him at once that i forbid your marriage to him i dont understand at all how to manage these situations i dont know what to do i suppose i should go myself andno you cant see him majory still the girl made no reply her head sank forward and she breathed a trifle heavily marjory cried the professor it is impossible that you should think so much of this man he arose and went to his daughter marjory many wise children have been guided by foolish fathers but we both suspect that no foolish child has ever been guided by a wise father let us change it i present myself to you as a wise father follow my wishes in this affair and you will be at least happier than if you marry this wretched coleman she answered he is waiting for me the professor turned abruptly from her and dropped into his chair at the table he resumed a grip on his pen go he said wearily go but if you have a remnant of sense remember what i have said to you go he waved his hand in a dismissal that was slightly scornful i hoped you would have a minor conception of what you were doing it seems a pity drooping in tears the girl slowly left the room coleman had an idea that he had occupied the chair for several months he gazed about at the pictures and the odds and ends of a drawingroom in an attempt to take an interest in them the great garlanded paper shade over the piano lamp consoled his impatience in a mild degree because he knew that marjory had made it he noted the clusters of cloth violets which she had pinned upon the yellow paper and he dreamed over the fact he was able to endow this shade with certain qualities of sentiment that caused his stare to become almost a part of an intimacy a communion he looked as if he could have unburdened his soul to this shade over the piano lamp upon the appearance of marjory he sprang up and came forward rapidly dearest he murmured stretching out both hands she gave him one set of fingers with chilling convention she said something which he understood to be goodafternoon he started as if the woman before him had suddenly drawn a knife marjory he cried what is the matter they walked together toward a window the girl looked at him in polite enquiry why she said do i seem strange there was a moments silence while he gazed into her eyes eyes full of innocence and tranquillity at last she tapped her foot upon the floor in expression of mild impatience people do not like to be asked what is the matter when there is nothing the matter what do you mean colemans face had gradually hardened well what is wrong he demanded abruptly what has happened what is it marjory she raised her glance in a perfect reality of wonder what is wrong what has happened how absurd why nothing of course she gazed out of the window look she added brightly the students are rolling somebody in a drift oh the poor man coleman now wearing a bewildered air made some pretense of being occupied with the scene yes he said ironically very interesting indeed oh said marjory suddenly i forgot to tell you father is going to take mother and me to greece this winter with him and the class coleman replied at once ah indeed that will be jolly yes wont it be charming i dont doubt it he replied his composure may have displeased her for she glanced at him furtively and in a way that denoted surprise perhaps oh of course she said in a glad voice it will be more fun we expect to nave a fine time there is such a n ice lot of boys going sometimes father chooses these dreadfully studious ones but this time he acts as if he knew precisely how to make up a party he reached for her hand and grasped it viselike marjory he breathed passionately dont treat me so dont treat me she wrenched her hand from him in regal indignation one or two rings make it uncomfortable for the hand that is grasped by an angry gentleman she held her fingers and gazed as if she expected to find them mere debris i am sorry that you are not interested in the students rolling that man in the snow it is the greatest scene our quiet life can afford he was regarding her as a judge faces a lying culprit i know he said after a pause somebody has been telling you some stories you have been hearing something about me some stories she enquired some stories about you what do you mean do you mean that i remember stories i may happen to hear about people there was another pause and then colemans face flared red he beat his hand violently upon a table good god marjory dont make a fool of me dont make this kind of a fool of me at any rate tell me what you mean explain she laughed at him explain really your vocabulary is getting extensive but it is dreadfully awkward to ask people to explain when there is nothing to explain he glanced at her i know as well as you do that your father is taking you to greece in order to get rid of me and do people have to go to greece in order to get rid of you she asked civilly i think you are getting excited marjory he began stormily she raised her hand hush she said there is somebody coming a bell had rung a maid entered the room mr coke she said marjory nodded in the interval of waiting coleman gave the girl a glance that mingled despair with rage and pride then coke burst with halftamed rapture into the room oh miss wainwright he almost shouted i cant tell you how glad i am i just heard today you were going imagine it it will be more oh how are you coleman how are you marjory welcomed the newcomer with a cordiality that might not have thrilled coleman with pleasure they took chairs that formed a triangle and one side of it vibrated with talk coke and marjory engaged in a tumultuous conversation concerning the prospective trip to greece the sunday editor as remote as if the apex of his angle was the top of a hill could only study the girls clear profile the youthful voices of the two others rang like bells he did not scowl at coke he merely looked at him as if be gently disdained his mental calibre in fact all the talk seemed to tire him it was childish as for him he apparently found this babble almost insupportable and just think of the camel rides well have cried coke camel rides repeated coleman dejectedly my dear coke finally he arose like an old man climbing from a sick bed well i am afraid i must go miss wainwright then he said affectionately to coke goodbye old boy i hope you will have a good time marjory walked with him to the door he shook her hand in a friendly fashion goodbye marjory he said perhaps it may happen that i shant see you again before you start for greece and so i had best bid you godspeed or whatever the term is now you will have a charming time greece must be a delightful place really i envy you marjory and now my dear child his voice grew brotherly filled with the patronage of generous fraternal love although i may never see you again let me wish you fifty as happy years as this last one has been for me he smiled frankly into her eyes then dropping her hand he went away coke renewed his tempest of talk as marjory turned toward him but after a series of splendid eruptions whose red fire illumined all of ancient and modem greece he too went away the professor was in his library apparently absorbed in a book when a tottering palefaced woman appeared to him and in her course toward a couch in a corner of the room described almost a semicircle she flung herself face downward a thick strand of hair swept over her shoulder oh my heart is broken my heart is broken the professor arose grizzled and thriceold with pain he went to the couch but he found himself a handless fetless man my poor child he said my poor child he remained listening stupidly to her convulsive sobbing a ghastly kind of solemnity came upon the room suddenly the girl lifted herself and swept the strand of hair away from her face she looked at the professor with the wideopen dilated eyes of one who still sleeps father she said in a hollow voice he dont love me he dont love me he dont love me at all you were right father she began to laugh marjory said the professor trembling be quiet child be quiet but she said i thought he loved me i was sure of it but it dontdont matter i i cant get over it womenwomen thebut it dont matter marjory said the professor marjory my poor daughter she did not heed his appeal but continued in a dull whisper he was playing with me he was waswas flirting with me he didnt care when i told him i told him i was goinggoing away she turned her face wildly to the cushions again her young shoulders shook as if they might break womenwomenthey always chapter v by a strange mishap of management the train which bore coleman back toward new york was fetched into an obscure sidetrack of some lonely region and there compelled to bide a change of fate the engine wheezed and sneezed like a paused fat man the lamps in the cars pervaded a stuffy odor of smoke and oil coleman examined his case and found only one cigar important brakemen proceeded rapidly along the aisles and when they swung open the doors a polar wind circled the legs of the passengers well now what is all this for demanded coleman furiously i want to get back to new york the conductor replied with sarcasm maybe you think im stuck on it i aint running the road im running this train and i run it according to orders amid the dismal comforts of the waiting cars coleman felt all the profound misery of the rebuffed true lover he had been sentenced he thought to a penal servitude of the heart as he watched the dusky vague ribbons of smoke come from the lamps and felt to his knees the cold winds from the brakemens busy flights when the train started with a whistle and a jolt he was elate as if in his abjection his beloveds hand had reached to him from the clouds when he had arrived in new york a cab rattled him to an uptown hotel with speed in the restaurant he first ordered a large bottle of champagne the last of the wine he finished in sombre mood like an unbroken and defiant man who chews the straw that litters his prison house during his dinner he was continually sending out messenger boys he was arranging a poker party through a window he watched the beautiful moving life of upper broadway at night with its crowds and clanging cable cars and its electric signs mammoth and glittering like the jewels of a giantess word was brought to him that the poker players were arriving he arose joyfully leaving his cheese in the broad hall occupied mainly by miscellaneous people and actors all deep in leather chairs he found some of his friends waiting they trooped up stairs to colemans rooms where as a preliminary coleman began to hurl books and papers from the table to the floor a boy came with drinks most of the men in order to prepare for the game removed their coats and cuffs and drew up the sleeves of their shirts the electric globes shed a blinding light upon the table the sound of clinking chips arose the elected banker spun the cards careless and dexterous later during a pause of dealing coleman said billie what kind of a lad is that young coke up at washurst he addressed an old college friend oh you mean the sophomore coke asked the friend seems a decent sort of a fellow i dont know why well who is he where does he come from what do you know about him hes one of those ohio cokesregular thing father millionaireused to be a barbergood old boywhy nothin said coleman looking at his cards i know the lad i thought he was a good deal of an ass i wondered who his people were oh his people are all rightin one way father owns rolling mills do you raise it henry well in order to make vice abhorrent to the young im obliged to raise back ill see it observed coleman slowly pushing forward two blue chips afterward he reached behind him and took another glass of wine to the others coleman seemed to have something bitter upon his mind he played poker quietly steadfastly and without change of eye following the mathematical religion of the game outside of the play he was savage almost insupportable whats the matter with you rufus said his old college friend lost your job girl gone back on you youre a hell ofa host we dont get any thing but insults and drinks late at night coleman began to lose steadily in the meantime he drank glass after glass of wine finally he made reckless bets on a mediocre hand and an opponent followed him thoughtfully bet by bet undaunted calm absolutely without emotion coleman lost he hurled down his cards nobody but a damned fool would have seen that last raise on anything less than a full hand steady come off whats wrong with you rufus cried his guests youre not drunk are you said his old college friend puritanically drunk repeated coleman oh say cried a man lets play cards whats all this gabbling it was when a grey dirty light of dawn evaded the thick curtains and fought on the floor with the feebled electric glow that coleman in the midst of play lurched his chest heavily upon the table some chips rattled to the floor ill call you he murmured sleepily well replied a man sternly three kings the other players with difficulty extracted five cards from beneath colemans pillowed head not a pair come come this wont do oh lets stop playing this is the rottenest game i ever sat in lets go home why dont you put him to bed billie when coleman awoke next morning he looked back upon the poker game as something that had transpired in previous years he dressed and went down to the grillroom for his breakfast he ordered some eggs on toast and a pint of champagne a privilege of liberty belonged to a certain irish waiter and this waiter looked at him grinning maybe you had a pretty lively time last night mr coleman yes pat answered coleman i did it was all because of an unrequited affection patrick the man stood near a napkin over his arm coleman went on impressively the ways of the modern lover are strange now i patrick am a modern lover and when yesterday the dagger of disappointment was driven deep into my heart i immediately played poker as hard as i could and incidentally got loaded this is the modern point of view i understand on good authority that in old times lovers used to languish that is probably a lie but at any rate we do not in these times languish to any great extent we get drunk do you understand patrick the waiter was used to a harangue at colemans breakfast time he placed his hand over his mouth and giggled yessir of course continued coleman thoughtfully it might be pointed out by uneducated persons that it is difficult to maintain a high standard of drunkenness for the adequate length of time but in the series of experiments which i am about to make i am sure i can easily prove them to be in the wrong i am sure sir said the waiter the young ladies would not like to be hearing you talk this way yes no doubt no doubt the young ladies have still quite medieval ideas they dont understand they still prefer lovers to languish at any rate sir i dont see that your heart is sure enough broken you seem to take it very easy broken cried coleman easy man my heart is in fragments bring me another small bottle chapter vi six weeks later coleman went to the office of the proprietor of the eclipse coleman was one of those smoothshaven oldyoung men who wear upon some occasions a singular air of temperance and purity at these times his features lost their quality of worldly shrewdness and endless suspicion and bloomed as the face of some innocent boy it then would be hard to tell that he had ever encountered even such a crime as a lie or a cigarette as he walked into the proprietors office he was a perfect semblance of a fine inexperienced youth people usually concluded this change was due to a turkish bath or some other expedient of recuperation but it was due probably to the power of a physical characteristic boss in said coleman yeh said the secretary jerking his thumb toward an inner door in his private office sturgeon sat on the edge of the table dangling one leg and dreamily surveying the wall as coleman entered he looked up quickly rufus he cried youre just the man i wanted to see ive got a scheme a great scheme he slid from the table and began to pace briskly to and fro his hands deep in his trousers pockets his chin sunk in his collar his light blue eyes afire with interest now listen this is immense the eclipse enlists a battalion of men to go to cuba and fight the spaniards under its own flagthe eclipse flag collect trained officers from here and thereenlist every young devil we seedrill em best riflesloads of ammunitionprovisionsstaff of doctors and nursesa couple of dynamite gunseverything complete best in the world now isnt that great whats the matter with that now eh eh isnt that great its great isnt it eh why my boy well free coleman did not seem to ignite i have been arrested four or five times already on fool matters connected with the newspaper business he observed gloomily but ive never yet been hung i think your scheme is a beauty sturgeon paused in astonishment why what happens to be the matter with you what are you kicking about coleman made a slow gesture im tired he answered i need a vacation vacation cried sturgeon why dont you take one then thats what ive come to see you about ive had a pretty heavy strain on me for three years now and i want to get a little rest well who in thunder has been keeping you from it it hasnt been me i know it hasnt been you but of course i wanted the paper to go and i wanted to have my share in its success but now that everything is all right i think i might go away for a time if you dont mind mind exclaimed sturgeon falling into his chair and reaching for his check book where do you want to go how long do you want to be gone how much money do you want i dont want very much and as for where i want to go i thought i might like to go to greece for a while sturgeon had been writing a check he poised his pen in the air and began to laugh thats a queer place to go for a rest why the biggest war of modern times a war that may involve all europeis likely to start there at any moment you are not likely to get any rest in greece i know that answered coleman i know there is likely to be a war there but i think that is exactly what would rest me i would like to report the war you are a queer bird answered sturgeon deeply fascinated with this new idea he had apparently forgotten his vision of a cuban volunteer battalion war correspondence is about the most original medium for a rest i ever heard of oh it may seem funny but really any change will be good for me now ive been whacking at this old sunday edition until im sick of it and some times i wish the eclipse was in hell thats all right laughed the proprietor of the eclipse but i still dont see how you are going to get any vacation out of a war that will upset the whole of europe but thats your affair if you want to become the chief correspondent in the field in case of any such war why of course i would be glad to have you i couldnt get anybody better but i dont see where your vacation comes in ill take care of that answered coleman when i take a vacation i want to take it my own way and i think this will be a vacation because it will be differentdont you seedifferent no i dont see any sense in it but if you think that is the way that suits you why go ahead how much money do you want i dont want much just enough to see me through nicely sturgeon scribbled on his check book and then ripped a check from it heres a thousand dollars will that do you to start with thats plenty when do you want to start tomorrow oh said sturgeon youre in a hurry this impetuous manner of exit from business seemed to appeal to him tomorrow he repeated smiling in reality he was some kind of a poet using his millions romantically spending wildly on a sentiment that might be with beauty or without beauty according to the momentary vacillation the vaguelydefined desperation in colemans last announcement appeared to delight him he grinned and placed the points of his fingers together stretching out his legs in a careful attitude of indifference which might even mean disapproval tomorrow he murmured teasingly by jiminy exclaimed coleman ignoring the other mans mood im sick of the whole business ive got out a sunday paper once a week for three years and i feel absolutely incapable of getting out another edition it would be all right if we were running on ordinary lines but when each issue is more or less of an attempt to beat the previous issue it becomes rather wearing you know if i cant get a vacation now i take one later in a lunatic asylum why im not objecting to your having a vacation im simply marvelling at the kind of vacation you want to take and tomorrow too eh well it suits me muttered coleman sulkily well if it suits you thats enough heres your check clear out now and dont let me see you again until you are thoroughly rested even if it takes a year he arose and stood smiling he was mightily pleased with himself he liked to perform in this way he was almost seraphic as he thrust the check for a thousand dollars toward coleman then his manner changed abruptly hold on a minute i must think a little about this thing if you are going to manage the correspondence of course it will be a long and bloody war you bet the big chance is that all europe will be dragged into it of course then you would have to come out of greece and take up abetter positionsay vienna no i wouldnt care to do that said coleman positively i just want to take care of the greek end of it it will be an idiotic way to take a vacation observed sturgeon well it suits me muttered coleman again i tell you what it is he added suddenly ive got some private reasonssee sturgeon was radiant with joy private reasons he was charmed by the sombre pain in colemans eyes and his own ability to eject it good go now and be blowed i will cable final instruction to meet you in london as soon as you get to greece cable me an account of the situation there and we will arrange our plans he began to laugh private reasons come out to dinner with me i cant very well said coleman if i go tomorrow ive got to pack but here the real tyrant appeared emerging suddenly from behind the curtain of sentiment appearing like a red devil in a pantomine you cant snapped sturgeon nonsense chapter vii sweeping out from between two remote halfsubmerged dunes on which stood slender sentry light houses the steamer began to roll with a gentle insinuating motion passengers in their staterooms saw at rhythmical intervals the spray racing fleetly past the portholes the waves grappled hurriedly at the sides of the great flying steamer and boiled discomfited astern in a turmoil of green and white from the tops of the enormous funnels streamed level masses of smoke which were immediately torn to nothing by the headlong wind meanwhile as the steamer rushed into the northeast men in caps and ulsters comfortably paraded the decks and stewards arranged deck chairs for the reception of various women who were coming from their cabins with rugs in the smoking room old voyagers were settling down comfortably while new voyagers were regarding them with a diffident respect among the passengers coleman found a number of people whom he knew including a wholesale wine merchant a chicago railway magnate and a new york millionaire they lived practically in the smoking room necessity drove them from time to time to the salon or to their berths once indeed the millionaire was absent from the group while penning a short note to his wife when the irish coast was sighted coleman came on deck to look at it a tall young woman immediately halted in her walk until he had stepped up to her well of all ungallant men rufus coleman you are the star she cried laughing and held out her hand awfully sorry im sure he murmured been playing poker in the smoking room all voyage didnt have a look at the passenger list until just now why didnt you send me word these lies were told so modestly and sincerely that when the girl flashed her brilliant eyes full upon their author there was a mixt of admiration in the indignation send you a card i dont believe you can read else you would have known i was to sail on this steamer if i hadnt been ill until today you would have seen me in the salon i open at the folly theatre next week dear ol lunnon y know of course i knew you were going said coleman but i thought you were to go later what do you open in fly by night come walk along with me see those two old ladies theyve been watching for me like hawks ever since we left new york they expected me to flirt with every man on board but ive fooled them ive been just as good i had to be as the pair moved toward the stern enormous and radiant green waves were crashing futilely after the steamer ireland showed a dreary coast line to the north a wretched man who had crossed the atlantic eightyfour times was declaiming to a group of novices a venerable banker bundled in rugs was asleep in his deck chair well nora said coleman i hope you make a hit in london you deserve it if anybody does youve worked hard worked hard cried the girl i should think so eight years ago i was in the rear row now i have the centre of the stage whenever i want it i made chalmers cut out that great scene in the second act between the queen and rodolfo the idea did he think i would stand that and just because he was in love with clara trotwood too coleman was dreamy remember when i was dramatic man for the gazette and wrote the first notice indeed i do answered the girl affectionately indeed i do rufus ah that was a great lift i believe that was the first thing that had an effect on old oliver before that he never would believe that i was any good give me your arm rufus lets parade before the two old women coleman glanced at her keenly her voice had trembled slightly her eyes were lustrous as if she were about to weep good heavens he said you are the same old nora black i thought you would be proud and aughty by this time not to my friends she murmured not to my friends im always the same and i never forget rufus never forget what asked coleman if anybody does me a favour i never forget it as long as i live she answered fervently oh you mustnt be so sentimental nora you remember that play you bought from little ben whipple just because he had once sent you some flowers in the old days when you were poor and happened to bed sick a sense of gratitude cost you over eight thousand dollars that time didnt it coleman laughed heartily oh it wasnt the flowers at all she interrupted seriously of course ben was always a nice boy but then his play was worth a thousand dollars thats all i gave him i lost some more in trying to make it go but it was too good that was what was the matter it was altogether too good for the public i felt awfully sorry for poor little ben too good sneered coleman too good too indifferently bad you mean my dear girl you mustnt imagine that you know a good play you dont at all she paused abruptly and faced him this regal creature was looking at him so sternly that coleman felt awed for a moment as if he were in the presence of a great mind do you mean to say that im not an artist she asked coleman remained cool ive never been decorated for informing people of their own affairs he observed but i should say that you were about as much of an artist as i am frowning slightly she reflected upon this reply then of a sudden she laughed there is no use in being angry with you rufus you always were a hopeless scamp but she added childishly wistful have you ever seen fly by night dont you think my dance in the second act is artistic no said coleman i havent seen fly by night yet but of course i know that you are the most beautiful dancer on the stage everybody knows that it seemed that her hand tightened on his arm her face was radiant there she exclaimed now you are forgiven you are a nice boy rufussometimes when miss black went to her cabin coleman strolled into the smoking room every man there covertly or openly surveyed him he dropped lazily into a chair at a table where the wine merchant the chicago railway king and the new york millionaire were playing cards they made a noble pretense of not being aware of him on the oil cloth top of the table the cards were snapped down turn by turn finally the wine merchant without lifting his head toaddress a particular person said new conquest hailing a steward coleman asked for a brandy and soda the millionaire said hes a sly cuss anyhow the railway man grinned after an elaborate silence the wine merchant asked know miss black long rufus coleman looked scornfully at his friends whats wrong with you there fellows anyhow the chicago man answered airily oh nothin nothin whatever at dinner in the crowded salon coleman was aware that more than one passenger glanced first at nora black and then at him as if connecting them in some train of thought moved to it by the narrow horizon of shipboard and by a sense of the mystery that surrounds the lives of the beauties of the stage near the captains right hand sat the glowing and splendid nora exhibiting under the gaze of the persistent eyes of many meanings a practiced and profound composure that to the populace was terrfying dignity strolling toward the smoking room after dinner coleman met the new york millionaire who seemed agitated he took coleman fraternally by the arm say old man introduce me wont you im crazy to know her do you mean miss black asked coleman why i dont know that i have a right of course you know she hasnt been meeting anybody aboard ill ask her thoughcertainly thanks old man thanks id be tickled to death come along and have a drink when will you ask her why i dont know when ill see her tomorrow i suppose they had not been long in the smoking room however when the deck steward came with a card to coleman upon it was written come for a stroll everybody saw coleman read this card and then look up and whisper to the deck steward the deck steward bent his head and whispered discreetly in reply there was an abrupt pause in the hum of conversation the interest was acute coleman leaned carelessly back in his chair puffing at his cigar he mingled calmly in a discussion of the comparative merits of certain transatlantic lines after a time he threw away his cigar and arose men nodded didnt i tell you his studiously languid exit was made dramatic by the eagleeyed attention of the smoking room on deck he found nora pacing to and fro you didnt hurry yourself she said as he joined her the lights of queenstown were twinkling a warm wind wet with the moisture of rainstricken sod was coming from the land why said coleman weve got all these duffers very much excited well what do you care asked hte girl you dont care do you no i dont care only its rather absurd to be watched all the time he said this precisely as if he abhorred being watched in this case oh by the way he added then he paused for a moment aw a friend of mine not a bad fellow he asked me for an introduction of course i told him id ask you she made a contemptuous gesture oh another willie tell him no tell him to go home to his family tell him to run away he isnt a bad fellow he said coleman diffidently he would probably be at the theatre every night in a box yes and get drunk and throw a wine bottle on the stage instead of a bouquet no she declared positively i wont see him coleman did not seem to be oppressed by this ultimatum oh all right i promised him that was all besides are you in a great hurry to get rid of me rid of you nonsense they walked in the shadow how long are you going to be in london rufus asked nora softly who i oh im going right off to greece first train theres going to be a war you know a war why who is going to fight the greeks and the the the what the turks im going right over there why thats dreadful rufus said the girl mournfull and shocked you might get hurt or something presently she asked and arent you going to be in london any time at all oh he answered puffing out his lips i may stop in londom for three or four days on my way home im not sure of it and when will that be oh i cant tell it may be in three or four months or it may be a year from now when the war stops there was a long silence as the walked up and down the swaying deck do you know said nora at last i like you rufus coleman i dont know any good reason for it either unless it is because you are such a brute now when i was asking you if you were to be in london you were perfectly detestable you know i was anxious i detestable cried coleman feigning amazement why what did i say it isnt so much what you said began nora slowlly then she suddenly changed her manner oh well dont lets talk about it any more its too foolish onlyyou are a disagreeable person sometimes in the morning as the vessel steamed up the irish channel coleman was on deck keeping furtive watch on the cabin stairs after two hours of waiting he scribbled a message on a card and sent it below he received an answer that miss black had a headache and felt too ill to come on deck he went to the smoking room the three cardplayers glanced up grinning whats the matter asked the wine merchant you look angry as a matter of fact coleman had purposely wreathed his features in a pleasant and satisfied expression so he was for a moment furious at the wine merchant confound the girl he thought to himself she has succeeded in making all these beggars laugh at me he mused that if he had another chance he would show her how disagreeable or detestable or scampish he was under some circumstances he reflected ruefully that the complacence with which he had accepted the comradeship of the belle of the voyage might have been somewhat overdone perhaps he had got a little out of proportion he was annoyed at the stares of the other men in the smoking room who seemed now to be reading his discomfiture as for nora black he thought of her wistfully and angrily as a superb woman whose company was honour and joy a payment for any sacrifices whats the matter persisted the wine merchant you look grumpy coleman laughed do i at liverpool as the steamer was being slowly warped to the landing stage by some tugs the passengers crowded the deck with their handbags adieus were falling as dead leaves fall from a great tree the stewards were handling small hills of luggage marked with flaming red labels the ship was firmly against the dock before miss black came from her cabin coleman was at the time gazing shoreward but his three particular friends instantly nudged him what there she is oh miss black he composedly walked toward her it was impossible to tell whether she saw him coming or whether it was accident but at any rate she suddenly turned and moved toward the stern of the ship ten watchful gossips had noted colemans travel in her direction and more than half the passengers noted his defeat he wheeled casually and returned to his three friends they were colicstricken with a coarse and yet silent merriment coleman was glad that the voyage was over after the polite business of an english custom house the travellers passed out to the waiting train a nimble little theatrical agent of some kind sent from london dashed forward to receive miss black he had a firstclass compartment engaged for her and he bundled her and her maid into it in an exuberance of enthusiasm and admiration coleman passing moodily along the line of coaches heard noras voice hailing him rufus there she was framed in a carriage window beautiful and smiling brightly every near by person turned to contemplate this vision oh said coleman advancing i thought i was not going to get a chance to say goodbye to you he held out his hand goodbye she pouted why theres plenty of room in this compartment seeing that some forty people were transfixed in observation of her she moved a short way back come on in this compartment rufus she said thanks i prefer to smoke said coleman he went off abruptly on the way to london he brooded in his corner on the two divergent emotions he had experienced when refusing her invitation at euston station in london he was directing a porter who had his luggage when he heard nora speak at his shoulder well rufus you sulky boy she said i shall be at the cecil if you have time come and see me thanks im sure my dear nora answered coleman effusively but honestly im off for greece a brougham was drawn up near them and the nimble little agent was waiting the maid was directing the establishment of a mass of luggage on and in a fourwheeler cab well put me into my carriage anyhow said nora you will have time for that afterward she addressed him from the dark interior now rufus you must come to see me the minute you strike london againof she hesitated a moment and then smiling gorgeously upon him she said brute chapter viii as soon as coleman had planted his belongings in a hotel he was bowled in a hansom briskly along the smoky strand through a dark city whose walls dripped like the walls of a cave and whose passages were only illuminated by flaring yellow and red signs walkley the london correspondent of the eclipse whirled from his chair with a shout of joy and reliefat sight of coleman cables he cried nothin but cables all the people in new york are writing cables to you the wires groan with them and we groan with them too they come in here in bales however there is no reason why you should read them all many are similar in words and many more are similar in spirit the sense of the whole thing is that you get to greece quickly taking with you immense sums of money and enormous powers over nations well when does the row begin the most astute journalists in europe have been predicting a general european smashup every year since said walkley and the prophets weep the english are the only people who can pull off wars on schedule time and they have to do it in odd corners of the globe i fear the war business is getting tuckered there is sorrow in the lodges of the lone wolves the war correspondents however my boy dont bury your face in your blanket this greek business looks very promising very promising he then began to proclaim trains and connections dover calais paris brindisi corfu patras athens that is your game you are supposed to skyrocket yourself over that route in the shortest possible time but you would gain no time by starting before tomorrow so you can cool your heels here in london until then i wish i was going along coleman returned to his hotel a knight impatient and savage at being kept for a time out of the saddle he went for a late supper to the grill room and as he was seated there alone a party of four or five people came to occupy the table directly behind him they talked a great deal even before they arrayed them selves at the table and he at once recognised the voice of nora black she was queening it apparently over a little band of awed masculine worshippers either by accident or for some curious reason she took a chair back to back with colemans chair her sleeve of fragrant stuff almost touched his shoulder and he felt appealing to him seductively a perfume of orris root and violet he was drinking bottled stout with his chop be sat with a face of wood oh the little lord nora was crying to some slave now do you know he wont do at all he is too awfully charming he sits and ruminates for fifteen minutes and then he pays me a lovely compliment then he ruminates for another fifteen minutes and cooks up another fine thing it is too tiresome do you know what kind of man i like she asked softly and confidentially and here she sank back in her chair until coleman knew from the tingle that her head was but a few inches from his head her sleeve touched him he turned more wooden under the spell of the orris root and violet her courtiers thought it all a graceful pose but coleman believed otherwise her voice sank to the liquid siren note of a succubus do you know what kind of a man i like really like i like a man that a woman cant bend in a thousand different ways in five minutes he must have some steel in him he obliges me to admire him the most when he remains stolid stolid to me lures ah that is the only kind of a man who cap ever break a heart among us women of the world his stolidity is not real no it is mere art but it is a highly finished art and often enough we cant cut through it really we cant and then we may actually come to er care for the man really we may isnt it funny alt the end coleman arose and strolled out of the room smoking a cigarette he did not betray a sign before the door clashed softly behind him nora laughed a little defiantly perhaps a little loudly it made every man in the grillroom perk up his ears as for her courtiers they were entranced in her description of the conquering man she had easily contrived that each one of them wondered if she might not mean him each man was perfectly sure that he had plenty of steel in his composition and that seemed to be a main point coleman delayed for a time in the smoking room and then went to his own quarters in reality he was somewhat puzzled in his mind by a projection of the beauties of nora black upon his desire for greece and marjory his thoughts formed a duality once he was on the point of sending his card to nora blacks parlour inasmuch as greece was very distant and he could not start until the morrow but he suspected that he was holding the interest of the actress because of his recent appearance of impregnable serenity in the presence of her fascinations if he now sent his card it was a form of surrender and he knew her to be one to take a merciless advantage he would not make this tactical mistake on the contrary he would go to bed and think of war in reality he found it easy to fasten his mind upon the prospective war he regarded himself cynically in most affairs but he could not be cynical of war because had heseen none of it his rejuvenated imagination began to thrill to the roll of battle through his thought passing all the lightning in the pictures of detaille de neuville and morot lashed battery horse roaring over bridges grand cuirassiers dashing headlong against stolid invincible redfaced lines of german infantry furious and bloody grapplings in the streets of little villages of northeastern france there was one thing at least of which he could still feel the spirit of a debutante in this matter of war he was not too unlike a young girl embarking upon her first season of opera walkely the next morning saw this mood sitting quaintly upon coleman and cackled with astonishment and glee colemans usual manner did not return until he detected walkelys appreciation of his state and then he snubbed him according to the ritual of the sunday editor of the new york eclipse parenthetically it might be said that if coleman now recalled nora black to his mind at all it was only to think of her for a moment with ironical complacence he had beaten her when the train drew out of the station coleman felt himself thrill was ever fate less perverse war and lovewar and marjorywere in conjunction both in greeceand he could tilt with one lance at both gods it was a great fine game to play and no man was ever so blessed in vacations he was smiling continually to himself and sometimes actually on the point of talking aloud this was despite the presence in the compartment of two fellow passengers who preserved in their uncomfortably rigid icy and uncompromising manners many of the more or less ridiculous traditions of the english first class carriage colemans fine humour betrayed him once into addressing one of these passengers and the man responded simply with a wide look of incredulity as if he discovered that he was travelling in the same compartment with a zebu it turned coleman suddenly to evil temper and he wanted to ask the man questions concerning his education and his present mental condition and so until the train arrived at dover his ballooning soul was in danger of collapsing on the packet crossing the channel too he almost returned to the usual rufus coleman since all the world was seasick and he could not get a cabin in which to hide himself from it however he reaped much consolation by ordering a bottle of champagne and drinking it in sight of the people which made them still more seasick from calais to brindisi really nothing met his disapproval save the speed of the train the conduct of some of the passengers the quality of the food served the manners of the guards the temperature of the carriages the prices charged and the length of the journey in time he passed as in a vision from wretched brindisi to charming corfu from corfu to the little warbitten city of patras and from patras by rail at the speed of an oxcart to athens with a smile of grim content and surrounded in his carriage with all his beautiful brown luggage he swept through the dusty streets of the greek capital even as the vehicle arrived in a great terraced square in front of the yellow palace greek recruits in garments representing many trades and many characters were marching up cheering for greece and the king officers stood upon the little iron chairs in front of the cafes all the urchins came running and shouting ladies waved their handkerchiefs from the balconies the whole city was vivified with a leaping and joyous enthusiasm the athenians as dragomen or otherwisehad preserved an ardor for their glorious traditions and it was as if that in the white dust which lifted from the plaza and floated across the oldivory face of the palace there were the souls of the capable soldiers of the past coleman was almost intoxicated with it it seemed to celebrate his own reasons his reasons of love and ambition to conquer in love when the carriage arrived in front of the hotel dangleterre coleman found the servants of the place with more than one eye upon the scene in the plaza but they soon paid heed to the arrival of a gentleman with such an amount of beautiful leather luggage all marked boldly with the initials r c coleman let them lead him and follow him and conduct him and use bad english upon him without noting either their words their salaams or their work his mind had quickly fixed upon the fact that here was the probable headquarters of the wainwright party and with the rush of his western race fleeting through his veins he felt that he would choke and die if he did not learn of the wainwrights in the first two minutes it was a tragic venture to attempt to make the levantine mind understand something off the course that the new arrivals first thought was to establish a knowlege of the whereabouts of some of his friends rather than to swarm helterskelter into that part of the hotel for which he was willing to pay rent in fact he failed to thus impress them failed in dark wrath but nevertheless failed at last he was simply forced to concede the travel of files of men up the broad redcarpeted staircase each man being loaded with colemans luggage the men in the hotelbureau were then able to comprehend that the foreign gentleman might have something else on his mind they raised their eyebrows languidly when he spoke of the wainwright party in gentle surprise that he had not yet learned that they were gone some time they were departed on some excursion where oh reallyit was almost laughable indeedthey didnt know were they sure why yesit was almost laughable indeedthey were quite sure where could the gentleman find out about them well theyas they had explaineddid not know butit was possiblethe american minister might know where was he to be found oh that was very simple it was well known that the american minister had apartments in the hotel was he in ah that they could not say so coleman rejoicing at his final emancipation and with the grime of travel still upon him burst in somewhat violently upon the secretary of the hon thomas m gordner of nebraska the united states minister to greece from his desk the secretary arose from behind an accidental bulwark of books and govermental pamphets yes certainly mr gordner is in if you would give me your card directly coleman was introduced into another room where a quiet man who was rolling a cigarette looked him frankly but carefully in the eye the wainwrights said the minister immediately after the question why i myself am immensely concerned about them at present im afraid theyve gotten themselves into trouble really said coleman yes that little professor is ratherer stubborn isnt he he wanted to make an expedition to nikopolis and i explained to him all the possibilities of war and begged him to at least not take his wife and daughter with him daughter murmured coleman as if in his sleep but that little old man had a head like a stone and only laughed at me of course those villainous young students were only too delighted at a prospect of war but it was a stupid and absurd thing for the man to take his wife and daughter there they are up there now i cant get a word from them or get a word to them coleman had been choking where is nikopolis he asked the minister gazed suddenly in comprehension of the man before him nikopolis is in turkey he answered gently turkey at that time was believed to be a country of delay corruption turbulence and massacre it meant everything more than a half of the christians of the world shuddered at the name of turkey colemans lips tightened and perhaps blanched and his chin moved out strangely once twice thrice how can i get to nikopolis he said the minister smiled it would take you the better part of four days if you could get there but as a matter of fact you cant get there at the present time a greek army and a turkish army are looking at each other from the sides of the river at artathe river is there the frontierand nikopolis happens to be on the wrong side you cant reach them the forces at arta will fight within three days i know it of course ive notified our legation at constantinople but with turkish methods of communication nikopolis is about as far from constantinople as new york is from pekin coleman arose theyve run themselves into a nice mess he said crossly well im a thousand times obliged to you im sure the minister opened his eyes a trifle you are not going to try to reach them are you yes answered coleman abstractedly im going to have a try at it friends of mine you know at the bureau of the hotel the correspondent found several cables awaiting him from the alert office of the new york eclipse one of them read state department gives out bad plight of wainwright party lost somewhere find them eclipse when coleman perused the message he began to smile with seraphic bliss could fate have ever been less perverse whereupon he whirled himself in athens and it was to the considerable astonishment of some athenians he discovered and instantly subsidised a young englishman who during his absence at the front would act as correspondent for the eclipse at the capital he took unto himself a dragoman and then bought three horses and hired a groom at a speed that caused a little crowd at the horse dealers place to come out upon the pavement and watch this surprising young man ride back toward his hotel he had already driven his dragoman into a curious state of oriental bewilderment and panic in which he could only lumber hastily and helplessly here and there with his face in the meantime marked with agony colemans own field equipment had been ordered by cable from new york to london but it was necessary to buy much tinned meats chocolate coffee candles patent food brandy tobaccos medicine and other things he went to bed that night feeling more placid the train back to patras was to start in the early morning and he felt the satisfaction of a man who is at last about to start on his own great quest before he dropped off to slumber he heard crowds cheering exultantly in the streets and the cheering moved him as it had done in the morning he felt that the celebration of the people was really an accompaniment to his primal reason a reason of love and ambition to conquer in loveeven as in the theatre the music accompanies the heroin his progress he arose once during the night to study a map of the balkan peninsula and get nailed into his mind the exact position of nikopolis it was important chapter ix colemans dragoman aroused him in the blue before dawn the correspondent arrayed himself in one of his new khaki suitsriding breeches and a tunic well marked with buttoned pocketsand accompanied by some of his beautiful brown luggage they departed for the station the ride to patras is a terror under ordinary circumstances it begins in the early morning and ends in the twilight to coleman having just come from patras to athens this journey from athens to patras had all the exasperating elements of a forced recantation moreover he had not come prepared to view with awe the ancient city of corinth nor to view with admiration the limpid beauties of the gulf of that name with its olive grove shore he was not stirred by parnassus a faraway snowfield high on the black shoulders of the mountains across the gulf no he wished to go to nikopolis he passed over the graves of an ancient race the gleam of whose mighty minds shot hardly dimmed through the clouding ages no he wished to go to nikopolis the train went at a snails pace and if coleman bad an interest it was in the people who lined the route and cheered the soldiers on the train in coleman s compartment there was a greasy person who spoke a little english he explained that he was a poet a poet who now wrote of nothing but war when a man is in pursuit of his love and success is known to be at least remote it often relieves his strain if he is deeply bored from time to time the train was really obliged to arrive finally at patras even if it was a tortoise and when this happened a hotel runner appeared who lied for the benefit of the hotel in saying that there was no boat over to mesalonghi that night when all too late coleman discovered the truth of the matter his wretched dragoman came in for a period of infamy and suffering however while strolling in the plaza at patras amid newsboys from every side by rumour and truth coleman learned things to his advantage a greek fleet was bombarding prevasa prevasa was near nikopolis the opposing armies at arta were engaged principally in an artillery duel arta was on the road from nikopolis into greece hearing this news in the sunlit square made him betray no weakness but in the darkness of his room at the hotel he seemed to behold marjory encircled by insurmountable walls of flame he could look out of his window into the black night of the north and feel every ounce of a hideous circumstance it appalled him here was no power of calling up a score of reporters and sending them scampering to accomplish everything he even might as well have been without a tongue as far as it could serve him in goodly speech he was alone confronting the black ominous turkish north behind which were the deadly flames behind the flames was marjory it worked upon him until he felt obliged to call in his dragoman and then seated upon the edge of his bed and waving his pipe eloquently he described the plight of some very dear friends who were cut off at nikopolis in epirus some of his talk was almost wistful in its wish for sympathy from his servant but at the end he bade the dragoman understand that be coleman was going to their rescue and he defiantly asked the hireling if he was prepared to go with him but he did not know the greek nature in two minutes the dragoman was weeping tears of enthusiasm and for these tears coleman was overgrateful because he had not been told that any of the more crude forms of sentiment arouse the common greek to the highest pitch but sometimes when it comes to what the americans call a show down when he gets backed toward his last corner with a solitary privilege of dying for these sentiments perhaps he does not always exhibit those talents which are supposed to be possessed by the bulldog he often then goes into the cafes and takes it out in oration like any common parisian in the morning a steamer carried them across the strait and landed them near mesalonghi at the foot of the railroad that leads to agrinion at agrinion coleman at last began to feel that he was nearing his goal there were plenty of soldiers in the town who received with delight and applause this gentleman in the distinguishedlooking khaki clothes with his revolver and his field glasses and his canteen and his dragoman the dragoman lied of course and vocifcrated that the gentleman in the distinguishedlooking khaki clothes was an english soldier of reputation who had naturally come to help the cross in its fight against the crescent he also said that his master had three superb horses coming from athens in charge of a groom and was undoubtedly going to join the cavalry whereupon the soldiers wished to embrace and kiss the gentleman in the distinguishedlooking khaki clothes there was more or less of a scuffle coleman would have taken to kicking and punching but he found that by aseries of elusive movements he could dodge the demonstrations of affection without losing his popularity escorted by the soldiers citizens children and dogs he went to the diligence which was to take him and others the next stage of the journey as the diligence proceeded colemans mind suffered another little inroad of illfate as to the success of his expedition in the first place it appeared foolish to expect that this diligence would ever arrive anywhere moreover the accommodations were about equal to what one would endure if one undertook to sleep for a night in a tree then there was a devildog a little blackandtan terrier in a blanket gorgeous and belled whose duty it was to stand on the top of the coach and bark incessantly to keep the driver fully aroused to the enormity of his occupation to have this cur silenced either by strangulation or ordinary clubbing coleman struggled with his dragoman as jacob struggled with the angel but in the first place the dragoman was a greek whose tongue could go quite drunk a greek who became a slave to the heralding and establishment of one certain fact or lie and now he was engaged in describing to every village and to all the country side the prowess of the gentleman in the distinguishedlooking khaki clothes it was the general absurdity of this advance to the frontier and the fighting to the crucial place where he was resolved to make an attempt to rescue his sweetheart it was this ridiculous aspect that caused to come to coleman a premonition of failure no knight ever went out to recover a lost love in such a diligence and with such a devildog tinkling his little bells and yelping insanely to keep the driver awake after nightfall they arrived at a town on the southern coast of the gulf of arta and the goaded dragoman wasthrust forth from the little inn into the street to find the first possible means of getting on to arta he returned at last to tremulously say that there was no single chance of starting for arta that night where upon he was again thrust into the street with orders strict orders in due time coleman spread his rugs upon the floor of his little room and thought himself almost asleep when the dragoman entered with a really intelligent man who for some reason had agreed to consort with him in the business of getting the stranger off to arta they announced that there was a brigantine about to sail with a load of soldiers for a little port near arta and if coleman hurried he could catch it permission from an officer having already been obtained he was up at once and the dragoman and the unaccountably intelligent person hastily gathered his chattels stepping out into a black street and moving to the edge of black water and embarking in a black boat filled with soldiers whose rifles dimly shone was as impressive to coleman as if really it had been the first start he had endured many starts it was true but the latest one always touched him as being conclusive there were no lights on the brigantine and the men swung precariously up her sides to the deck which was already occupied by a babbling multitude the dragoman judiciously found a place for his master where during the night the latter had to move quickly everytime the tiller was shifted to starboard the craft raised her shadowy sails and swung slowly off into the deep gloom forward some of the soldiers began to sing weird minor melodies coleman enveloped in his rugssmoked three or four cigars he was content and miserable lying there hearing these melodies which defined to him his own affairs at dawn they were at the little port first in the carmine and grey tints from a sleepy sun they could see little mobs of soldiers working amid boxes of stores and then from the back in some dun and green hills sounded a deepthroated thunder of artillery an officer gave coleman and his dragoman positions in one of the first boats but of course it could not be done without an almost endless amount of palaver eventually they landed with their traps coleman felt through the sole of his boot his foot upon the shore he was within striking distance but here it was smitten into the head of colemans servant to turn into the most inefficient dragoman probably in the entire east coleman discerned it immediately before any blunder could tell him he at first thought that it was the voices of the guns which had made a chilly inside for the man but when he reflected upon the incompetency or childish couriers falsity at patras and his discernible lack of sense from agrinion onward he felt that the fault was elemental in his nature it was a mere basic inability to front novel situations which was somehow in the dragoman he retreated from everything difficult in a smoke of gibberish and gesticulation coleman glared at him with the hatred that sometimes ensues when breed meets breed but he saw that this man was indeed a golden link in his possible success this man connected him with greece and its language if he destroyed him he delayed what was now his main desire in life however this truth did not prevent him from addressing the man in elegant speech the two little men who were induced to carry colemans luggage as far as the greek camp were really procured by the correspondent himself who pantomined vigourously and with unmistakable vividness followed by his dragoman and the two little men he strode off along a road which led straight as a stick to where the guns were at intervals booming meanwhile the dragoman and the two little men talked talked talkedcoleman was silent puffing his cigar and reflecting upon the odd things which happen to chivalry in the modern age he knew of many men who would have been astonished if they could have seen into his mind at that time and he knew of many more men who would have laughed if they had the same privilege of sight he made no attempt to conceal from himself that the whole thing was romantic romantic despite the little tinkling dog the decrepit diligence the palavering natives the superidiotic dragoman it was fine it was from another age and even the actors could not deface the purity of the picture however it was true that upon the brigantine the previous night he had unaccountably wetted all his available matches this was momentous important cruel truth but coleman after all was takingas well as he could forgeta solemn and knightly joy of this adventure and there were as many portraits of his lady envisioning before him as ever held the heart of an armourencased young gentleman of medieval poetry if he had been travelling in this region as an ordinary tourist he would have been apparent mainly for his lofty impatience over trifles but now there was in him a positive assertion of direction which was undoubtedly one of the reasons for the despair of the accomplished dragoman before them the country slowly opened and opened the straight white road always piercing it like a lanceshaft soon they could see black masses of men marking the green knolls the artillery thundered loudly and now vibrated augustly through the air coleman quickened his pace to the despair of the little men carrying the traps they finally came up with one of these black bodies of men and found it to be composed of a considerable number of soldiers who were idly watching some hospital people bury a dead turk the dragoman at once dashed forward to peer through the throng and see the face of the corpse then he came and supplicated coleman as if he were hawking him to look at a relic and coleman moved by a strong mysterious impulse went forward to look at the poor little claycoloured body at that moment a snake ran out from a tuft of grass at his feet and wriggled wildly over the sod the dragoman shrieked of course but one of the soldiers put his heel upon the head of the reptile and it flung itself into the agonising knot of death then the whole crowd powwowed turning from the dead man to the dead snake coleman signaled his contingent and proceeded along the road this incident this paragraph had seemed a strange introduction to war the snake the dead man the entire sketch made him shudder of itself but more than anything he felt an uncanny symbolism it was no doubt a mere occurrence nothing but an occurrence but inasmuch as all the detail of this daily life associated itself with marjory he felt a different horror he had thought of the little devildog and marjory in an interwoven way supposing marjory had been riding in the diligence with the devildogatop what would she have said of her fund of expressions a fund uncountable which would she have innocently projected against the background of the greek hills would it have smitten her nerves badly or would she have laughed and supposing marjory could have seen him in his new khaki clothes cursing his dragoman as he listened to the devildog and now he interwove his memory of marjory with a dead man and with a snake in the throes of the end of life they crossed intersected tangled these two thoughts he perceived it clearly the incongruity of it he academically reflected upon the mysteries of the human mind this homeless machine which lives here and then there and often lives in two or three opposing places at the same instant he decided that the incident of the snake and the dead man had no more meaning than the greater number of the things which happen to us in our daily lives nevertheless it bore upon him on a spread of plain they saw a force drawn up in a long line it was a flagrant inky streak on the verdant prairie from somewhere near it sounded the timed reverberations of guns the brisk walk of the next ten minutes was actually exciting to coleman he could not but reflect that those guns were being fired with serious purpose at certain human bodies much like his own as they drew nearer they saw that the inky streak was composed of cavalry the troopers standing at their bridles the sunlight flicked upon their bright weapons now the dragoman developed in one of his extraordinary directions he announced forsooth that an intimate friend was a captain of cavalry in this command coleman at first thought that this was some kind of mysterious lie but when he arrived where they could hear the stamping of hoofs the clank of weapons and the murmur of men behold a most dashing young officer gave a shout of joy and he and the dragoman hurled themselves into a mad embrace after this first ecstacy was over the dragoman bethought him of his employer and looking toward coleman hastily explained him to the officer the latter it appeared was very affable indeed much had happened the greeks and the turks had been fighting over a shallow part of the river nearly opposite this point and the greeks had driven back the turks and succeeded in throwing a bridge of casks and planking across the stream it was now the duty and the delight of this force of cavalry to cross the bridge and passing the little force of covering greek infantry to proceed into turkey until they came in touch with the enemy colemans eyes dilated was ever fate less perverse partly in wretched french to the officer and partly in idiomatic english to the dragoman he proclaimed his fiery desire to accompany the expedition the officer immediately beamed upon him in fact he was delighted the dragoman had naturally told him many falsehoods concerning coleman incidentally referring to himself more as a philanthropic guardian and valuable friend of the correspondent than as a plain unvarnished dragoman with an exceedingly good eye for the financial possibilities of his position coleman wanted to ask his servant if there was any chance of the scout taking them near nikopolis but he delayed being informed upon this point until such time as he could find out secretly for himself to ask the dragoman would be mere stupid questioning which would surely make the animal shy he tried to be content that fate had given him this early opportunity of dealing with a medieval situation with some show of proper form that is to say armed ahorseback and in danger then he could feel that to the gods of the game he was not laughable as when he rode to rescue his love in a diligence with a devildog yelping atop with some flourish the young captain presented him to the major who commanded the cavalry this officer stood with his legs wide apart eating the rind of a fresh lemon and talking betimes to some of his officers the major also beamed upon coleman when the captain explained that the gentleman in the distinguishedlooking khaki clothes wished to accompany the expedition he at once said that he would provide two troop horses for coleman and the dragoman coleman thanked fate for his behaviour and his satisfaction was not without a vestige of surprise at that time he judged it to be a remarkable amiability of individuals but in later years he came to believe in certain laws which he deemed existent solely for the benefit of war correspondents in the minds of governments war offices and generals they have no function save one of disturbance but coleman deemed it proven that the common men and many uncommon men when they go away to the fighting ground out of the sight out of the hearing of the world known to them and are eager to perform feats of war in this new place they feel an absolute longing for a spectator it is indeed the veritable coronation of this world there is not too much vanity of the street in this desire of men to have some disinterested fellows perceive their deeds it is merely that a man doing his best in the middle of a sea of war longs to have people see him doing his best this feeling is often notably serious if in peace a man has done his worst or part of his worst coleman believed that above everybody young proud and brave subalterns had this itch but it existed truly enough from lieutenants to colonels none wanted to conceal from his left hand that his right hand was performing a manly and valiant thing although there might be times when an application of the principle would be immensely convenient the war correspondent arises then to become a sort of a cheap telescope for the people at home further still there have been fights where the eyes of a solitary man were the eyes of the world one spectator whose business it was to transfer according to his ability his visual impressions to other minds coleman and his servant were conducted to two saddled troop horses and beside them waited decently in the rear of the ranks the uniform of the troopers was of plain dark green cloth and they were well and sensibly equipped the mounts however had in no way been picked there were little horses and big horses fat horses and thin horses they looked the result of a wild conscription coleman noted the faces of the troopers and they were calm enough save when a man betrayed himself by perhaps a disproportionate angry jerk at the bridle of his restive horse the major artistically drooping his cloak from his left shoulder and tenderly and musingly fingering his long yellow moustache rode slowly to the middle of the line and wheeled his horse to face his men a bugle called attention and then he addressed them in a loud and rapid speech which did not seem to have an end coleman imagined that the major was paying tribute to the greek tradition of the power of oratory again the trumpet rang out and this parade front swung off into column formation then coleman and the dragoman trotted at the tail of the squadron restraining with difficulty their horses who could not understand their new places in the procession and worked feverishly to regain what they considered their positions in life the column jangled musically over the sod passing between two hills on one of which a greek light battery was posted its men climbed to the tops of their interenchments to witness the going of the cavalry then the column curved along over ditch and through hedge to the shallows of the river across this narrow stream was turkey turkey however presented nothing to the eye but a muddy bank with fringes of trees back of it it seemed to be a great plain with sparse collections of foliage marking it whereas the greek side presented in the main a vista of high gaunt rocks perhaps one of the first effects of war upon the mind is a new recognition and fear of the circumscribed ability of the eye making all landscape seem inscrutable the cavalry drew up in platoon formation on their own bank of the stream and waited if coleman had known anything of war he would have known from appearances that there was nothing in the immediate vicinity to cause heartjumping but as a matter of truth he was deeply moved and wondered what was hidden what was veiled by those trees moreover the squadrons resembled art old picture of a body of horse awaiting napoleons order to charge in the meantime his mount fumed at the bit plunging to get back to the ranks the sky was without a cloud and the sun rays swept down upon them sometimes coleman was on the verge of addressing the dragoman according to his anxiety but in the end he simply told him to go to the river and fill the canteens at last an order came and the first troop moved with muffled tumult across the bridge coleman and his dragoman followed the last troop the horses scrambled up the muddy bank much as if they were merely breaking out of a pasture but probably all the men felt a sudden tightening of their muscles coleman in his excitement felt more than he saw glossy horse flanks greenclothed men chumping in their saddles banging sabres and canteens and carbines slanted in line there were some greek infantry in a trench they were heavily overcoated despite the heat and some were engaged in eating loaves of round thick bread they called out lustily as the cavalry passed them the troopers smiled slowly somewhat proudly in response presently there was another halt and coleman saw the major trotting busily here and there while troop commanders rode out to meet him spreading groups of scouts and flankers moved off and disappeared their dashing young officer friend cantered past them with his troop at his heels he waved a joyful goodbye it was the doings of cavalry in actual service horsemen fanning out in all forward directions there were two troops held in reserve and as they jangled ahead at a foot pace coleman and his dragoman followed them the dragoman was now moved to erect many reasons for an immediate return it was plain that he had no stomach at all for this business and that he wished himself safely back on the other side of the river coleman looked at him askance when these men talked together coleman might as well have been a polar bear for all he understood of it when he saw the trepidation of his dragoman he did not know what it foreboded in this situation it was not for him to say that the dragomans fears were founded on nothing and ever the dragoman raised his reasons for a retreat coleman spoke to himself i am just a trifle rattled he said to his heart and after he had communed for a time upon the duty of steadiness he addressed the dragoman in cool language now my persuasive friend just quit all that because business is business and it may be rather annoying business but you will have to go through with it long afterward when ruminating over the feelings of that morning he saw with some astonishment that there was not a single thing within sound or sight to cause a rational being any quaking he was simply riding with some soldiers over a vast treedotted prairie presently the commanding officer turned in his saddle and told the dragoman that he was going to ride forward with his orderly to where he could see the flanking parties and the scouts and courteously with the manner of a gentleman entertaining two guests he asked if the civilians cared to accompany him the dragoman would not have passed this question correctly on to coleman if he had thought he could have avoided it but with both men regarding him he considered that a lie probably meant instant detection he spoke almost the truth contenting himself with merely communicating to coleman in a subtle way his sense that a ride forward with the commanding officer and his orderly would be depressing and dangerous occupation but coleman immediately accepted the invitation mainly because it was the invitation of the major and in war it is a brave man who can refuse the invitation of a commanding officer the little party of four trotted away from the reserves curving in single file about the waterholes in time they arrived at where the plain lacked trees and was one great green lake of grass grass and scrubs on this expanse they could see the greek horsemen riding mainly appearing as little black dots far to the left there was a squad said to be composed of only twenty troopers but in the distance their black mass seemed to be a regiment as the officer and his guests advanced they came in view of what one may call the shore of the plain the rise of ground was heavily clad with trees and over the tops of them appeared the cupola and part of the walls of a large white house and there were glimpses of huts near it as if a village was marked the black specks seemed to be almost to it the major galloped forward and the others followed at his pace the house grew larger and larger and they came nearly to the advance scouts who they could now see were not quite close to the village there had been a deception of the eye precisely as occurs at sea herds of unguarded sheep drifted over the plain and little ownerless horses still cruelly hobbled leaped painfully away frightened as if they understood that an anarchy had come upon them the party rode until they were very nearly up with the scouts and then from low down at the very edge of the plain there came a long rattling noise which endured as if some kind of grinding machine had been put in motion smoke arose faintly marking the position of an intrenchment sometimes a swift spitting could be heard from the air over the party it was colemans fortune to think at first that the turks were not firing in his direction but as soon as he heard the weird voices in the air he knew that war was upon him but it was plain that the range was almost excessive plain even to his ignorance the major looked at him and laughed he found no difficulty in smiling in response if this was war it could be withstood somehow he could not at this time understand what a mere trifle was the present incident he felt upon his cheek a little breeze which was moving the grassblades he had tied his canteen in a wrong place on the saddle and every time the horse moved quickly the canteen banged the correspondent to his annoyance and distress forcibly on the knee he had forgotten about his dragoman but happening to look upon that faithful servitor he saw him gone white with horror a bullet at that moment twanged near his head and the slave to fear ducked in a spasm coleman called the orderlys attention and they both laughed discreetly they made no pretension of being heroes but they saw plainly that they were better than this man coleman said to him how far is it now to nikopolis the dragoman replied only with a look of agonized impatience but of course there was no going to nikopolis that day the officer had advanced his men as far as was intended by his superiors and presently they were all recalled and trotted back to the bridge they crossed it to their old camp an important part of colemans traps was back with his athenian horses and their groom but with his present equipment he could at least lie smoking on his blankets and watch the dragoman prepare food but he reflected that for that day he had only attained the simple discovery that the approach to nikopolis was surrounded with difficulties chapter x the same afternoon coleman and the dragoman rode up to arta on their borrowed troop horses the correspondent first went to the telegraph office and found there the usual number of despairing clerks they were outraged when they found he was going to send messages and thought it preposterous that he insisted upon learning if there were any in the office for him they had trouble enough with endless official communications without being hounded about private affairs by a confident young man in khaki but coleman at last unearthed six cablegrams which collective said that the eclipse wondered why they did not hear from him that walkley had been relieved from duty in london and sent to join the army of the crown prince that young point the artist had been shipped to greece that if he coleman succeeded in finding the wainwright party the paper was prepared to make a tremendous uproar of a celebration over it and finally the paper wondered twice more why they did not hear from him when coleman went forth to enquire if anybody knew of the whereabouts of the wainwright party he thought first of his fellow correspondents he found most of them in a cafe where was to be had about the only food in the soldierladen town it was a slothful den where even an ordinary boiled egg could be made unpalatable such a common matter as the salt men watched with greed and suspicion as if they were always about to grab it from each other the proprietor in a dirty shirt could always be heard whining evidently telling the world that he was being abused but he had spirit enough remaining to charge three prices for everything with an almost jewish fluency the correspondents consoled themselves largely upon blackbread and the native wines also there were certain little oiled fishes and some green odds and ends for salads the correspondents were practically all englishmen some of them were veterans of journalism in the sudan in india in south africa and there were others who knew as much of war as they could learn by sitting at a desk and editing the london stock reports some were on their own hook some had horses and dragomen and some had neither the one nor the other many knew how to write and a few had it yet to learn the thing in common was a spirit of adventure which found pleasure in the extraordinary business of seeing how men kill each other they were talking of an artillery duel which had been fought the previous day between the greek batteries above the town and the turkish batteries across the river coleman took seat at one of the long tables and the astute dragoman got somebody in the street to hold the horses in order that he might be present at any feasting one of the experienced correspondents was remarking that the fire of the greek batteries in the engagement had been the finest artillery practice of the century he spoke a little loudly perhaps in the wistful hope that some of the greek officers would understand enough english to follow his meaning for it is always good for a correspondent to admire the prowess on his own side of the battlefield after a time coleman spoke in a lull and describing the supposed misfortunes of the wainwright party asked if anyone had news of them the correspondents were surprised they had none of them heard even of the existence of a wainwright party also none of them seemed to care exceedingly the conversation soon changed to a discussion of the probable result of the general greek advance announced for the morrow coleman silently commented that this remarkable appearance of indifference to the mishap of the wainwrights a little party a single group was a better definition of a real condition of war than that bit of longrange musketry of the morning he took a certain despatch out of his pocket and again read it find wainwright party at all hazards much talk here success means red fire by ton eclipse it was an important matter he could imagine how the american people vibrating for years to stories of the cruelty of the turk would trembleindeed was now tremblingwhile the newspapers howled out the dire possibilities he saw all the kinds of people from those who would read the wainwright chapters from day to day as a sort of sensational novel to those who would work up a gentle sympathy for the woe of others around the table in the evenings he saw bar keepers and policemen taking a high gallery thrill out of this kind of romance he saw even the emotion among american colleges over the tragedy of a professor and some students it certainly was a big affair marjory of course was everything in one way but that to the world was not a big affair it was the romance of the wainwright party in its simplicity that to the american world was arousing great sensation one that in the old days would have made his heart leap like a colt still when batteries had fought each other savagely and horse foot and guns were now about to make a general advance it was difficult he could see to stir men to think and feel out of the present zone of action to adopt for a time in fact the thoughts and feelings of the other side of the world it made coleman dejected as he saw clearly that the task was wholly on his own shoulders of course they were men who when at home manifested the most gentle and widereaching feelings most of them could not by any possibility have slapped a kitten merely for the prank and yet all of them who had seen an unknown man shot through the head in battle had little more to think of it than if the man had been a ragbaby tender they might be poets they might be but they were all horned with a provisional temporary but absolutely essential callouse which was formed by their existence amid war with its quality of making them always think of the sights and sounds concealed in their own direct future they had been simply polite yes said one to coleman how many people in the party are they all americans oh i suppose it will be quite right your minister in constantinople will arrange that easily where did you say at nikopolis well we conclude that the turks will make no stand between here and pentepigadia in that case your nikopolis will be uncovered unless the garrison at prevasa intervenes that garrison at prevasa by the way may make a deal of trouble remember plevna exactly how far is it to nikopolis asked coleman oh i think it is about thirty kilometers replied the others there is a good miltary road as soon as you cross the louros river ive got the map of the austrian general staff would you like to look at it coleman studied the map speeding with his eye rapidly to and fro between arta and nikopolis to him it was merely a brown lithograph of mystery but he could study the distances he had received a cordial invitation from the commander of the cavalry to go with him for another ride into turkey and he inclined to believe that his project would be furthered if he stuck close to the cavalry so he rode back to the cavalry camp and went peacefully to sleep on the sod he awoke in the morning with chattering teeth to find his dragoman saying that the major had unaccountably withdrawn his loan of the two troop horses coleman of course immediately said to himself that the dragoman was lying again in order to prevent another expedition into ominous turkey but after all if the commander of the cavalry had suddenly turned the light of his favour from the correspondent it was only a proceeding consistent with the nature which coleman now thought he was beginning to discern a nature which can never think twice in the same place a gageous mind which drifts dissolves combines vanishes with the ability of an aerial thing until the man of the north feels that when he clutches it with full knowledge of his senses he is only the victim of his ardent imagination it is the difference in standards in creeds which is the more luminous when men call out that they are all alike so coleman and his dragoman loaded their traps and moved out to again invade turkey it was not yet clear daylight but they felt that they might well start early since they were no longer mounted men on the way to the bridge the dragoman although he was curiously in love with his forty francs a day and his opportunities ventured a stout protest based apparently upon the fact that after all this foreigner four days out from athens was somewhat at his mercy meester coleman he said stopping suddenly i think we make no good if we go there much better we wait arta for our horse much better i think this no good there is coming one big fight and i think much better we go stay arta much better oh come off said coleman and in clear language he began to labour with the man look here now if you think you are engaged in steering a bunch of woodenheaded guys about the acropolis my dear partner of my joys and sorrows you are extremely mistaken as a matter of fact you are now the dragoman of a war correspondent and you were engaged and are paid to be one it becomes necessary that you make good make good do you understand im not out here to be buncoed by this sort of game he continued indefinitely in this strain and at intervals he asked sharply do you understand perhaps the dragoman was dumbfounded that the laconic coleman could on occasion talk so much or perhaps he understood everything and was impressed by the argumentative power at any rate he suddenly wilted he made a gesture which was a protestation of martyrdom and picking up his burden proceeded on his way when they reached the bridge they saw strong columns of greek infantry dead black in the dim light crossing the stream and slowly deploying on the other shore it was a bracing sight to the dragoman who then went into one of his absurd babbling moods in which he would have talked the head off any man who was not born in a country laved by the childish mediterranean coleman could not understand what he said to the soldiers as they passed but it was evidently all grandiose nonsense two light batteries had precariously crossed the rickety bridge during the night and now this force of several thousand infantry with the two batteries was moving out over the territory which the cavalry had reconnoitered on the previous day the ground being familiar to coleman he no longer knew a tremour and regarding his dragoman he saw that that invaluable servitor was also in better form they marched until they found one of the light batteries unlimbered and aligned on the lake of grass about a mile from where parts of the white house appeared above the treetops here the dragoman talked with the captain of artillery a tiny man on an immense horse who for some unknown reason told him that this force was going to raid into turkey and try to swing around the opposing armys right flank he announced as he showed his teeth in a smile that it would be very very dangerous work the dragoman precipitated himself upon coleman this is much danger the copten he tell me the trups go now in back of the turks it will be much danger i think much better we go arta wait for horse much better coleman although be believed he despised the dragoman could not help but be influenced by his fears they were so to speak in a room with one window and only the dragoman looked forth from the window so if he said that what he saw outside frightened him coleman was perforce frightened also in a measure but when the correspondent raised his eyes he saw the captain of the battery looking at him his teeth still showing in a smile as if his information whether true or false had been given to convince the foreigner that the greeks were a very superior and brave people notably one little officer of artillery he had apparently assumed that coleman would balk from venturing with such a force upon an excursion to trifle with the rear of a hard fighting ottoman army he exceedingly disliked that man sitting up there on his tall horse and grinning like a cruel little ape with a secret in truth coleman was taken back at the outlook but he could no more refrain from instantly accepting this halfconcealed challenge than he could have refrained from resenting an ordinary form of insult his mind was not at peace but the small vanities are very large he was perfectly aware that he was being misled into the thing by an odd pride but anyhow it easily might turn out to be a stroke upon the doors of nikopolis he nodded and smiled at the officer in grateful acknowledgment of his service the infantry was moving steadily afield black blocks of men were trailing in column slowly over the plain they were not unlike the backs of dominoes on a green baize table they were so vivid so startling the correspondent and his servant followed them eventually they overtook two companies in command of a captain who seemed immensely glad to have the strangers with him as they marched the captain spoke through the dragoman upon the virtues of his men announcing with other news the fact that his first sergeant was the bravest man in the world a number of columns were moving across the plain parallel to their line of march and the whole force seemed to have orders to halt when they reached a long ditch about four hundred yards from where the shore of the plain arose to the luxuriant groves with the cupola of the big white house sticking above them the soldiers lay along the ditch and the bravest man in the world spread his blanket on the ground for the captain coleman and himself during a long pause coleman tried to elucidate the question of why the greek soldiers wore heavy overcoats even in the bitter heat of midday but he could only learn that the dews when they came were very destructive to the lungs further he convinced himself anew that talking through an interpreter to the minds of other men was as satisfactory as looking at landscape through a stained glass window after a time there was in front a stir near where a curious hedge of dry brambles seemed to outline some sort of a garden patch many of the soldiers exclaimed and raised their guns but there seemed to come a general understanding to the line that it was wrong to fire then presently into the open came a dirty brown figure and coleman could see through his glasses that its head was crowned with a dirty fez which had once been white this indicated that the figure was that of one of the christian peasants of epirus obedient to the captain the sergeant arose and waved invitation the peasant wavered changed his mind was obviously terrorstricken regained confidence and then began to advance circuitously toward the greek lines when he arrived within hailing distance the captain the sergeant colemans dragoman and many of the soldiers yelled human messages and a moment later he was seen to be a poor yellowfaced stripling with a body which seemed to have been first twisted by an illbirth and afterward maimed by either labour or oppression these being often identical in their effects his reception of the greek soldiery was no less fervid than their welcome of him to their protection he threw his grimy fez in the air and croaked out cheers while tears wet his cheeks when he had come upon the right side of the ditch he ran capering among them and the captain the sergeant the dragoman and a number of soldiers received wild embraces and kisses he made a dash at coleman but coleman was now wary in the game and retired dexterously behind different groups with a finished appearance of not noting that the young man wished to greet him behind the hedge of dry brambles there were more indications of life and the peasant stood up and made beseeching gestures soon a whole flock of miserable people had come out to the greeks men women and children in crude and comic smocks prancing here and there uproariously embracing and kissing their deliverers an old tearful toothless hag flung herself rapturously into the arms of the captain and colemans brickandiron soul was moved to admiration at the way in which the officer administered a chaste salute upon the furrowed cheek the dragoman told the correspondent that the turks had run away from the village on up a valley toward jannina everybody was proud and happy a major of infantry came from the rear at this time and asked the captain in sharp tones who were the two strangers in civilian attire when the captain had answered correctly the major was immediately mollified and had it announced to the correspondent that his battalion was going to move immediately into the village and that he would be delighted to have his company the major strode at the head of his men with the group of villagers singing and dancing about him and looking upon him as if he were a god coleman and the dragoman at the officers request marched one on either side of him and in this manner they entered the village from all sorts of hedges and thickets people came creeping out to pass into a delirium of joy the major borrowed three little pack horses with ropebridles and thus mounted and followed by the clanking column they rode on in triumph it was probably more of a true festival than most men experience even in the longest life time the major with his greek instinct of drama was a splendid personification of poetic quality in fact he was himself almost a lyric from time to time he glanced back at coleman with eyes half dimmed with appreciation the people gathered flowers great blossoms of purple and corn colour they sprinkled them over the three horsemen and flung them deliriously under the feet of the little nags being now mounted coleman had no difficulty in avoiding the embraces of the peasants but he felt to the tips of his toes an abandonment to a kind of pleasure with which he was not at all familiar riding thus amid cries of thanksgiving addressed at him equally with the others he felt a burning virtue and quite lost his old self in an illusion of noble be nignity and there continued the fragrant hail of blossoms miserable little huts straggled along the sides of the village street as if they were following at the heels of the great white house of the bey the column proceeded northward announcing laughingly to the glad villagers that they would never see another turk before them on the road was here and there a fez from the head of a fled turkish soldier and they lay like drops of blood from some wounded leviathan ultimately it grew cloudy it even rained slightly in the misty downfall the column of soldiers in blue was dim as if it were merely a long trail of lowhung smoke they came to the ruins of a church and there the major halted his battalion coleman worried at his dragoman to learn if the halt was only temporary it was a long time before there was answer from the major for he had drawn up his men in platoons and was addressing them in a speech as interminable as any that coleman had heard in greece the officer waved his arms and roared out evidently the glories of patriotism and soldierly honour the glories of their ancient people and he may have included any subject in this wonderful speech for the reason that he had plenty of time in which to do it it was impossible to tell whether the oration was a good one or bad one because the men stood in their loose platoons without discernible feelings as if to them this appeared merely as one of the inevitable consequences of a campaign an established rule of warfare coleman ate black bread and chocolate tablets while the dragoman hovered near the major with the intention of pouncing upon him for information as soon as his lungs yielded to the strain upon them the dragoman at last returned with a very long verbal treatise from the major who apparently had not been as exhausted after his speech to the men as one would think the major had said that he had been ordered to halt here to form a junction with some of the troops coming direct from arta and that he expected that in the morning the army would be divided and one wing would chase the retreating turks on toward jannina while the other wing would advance upon prevasa because the enemy had a garrison there which had not retreated an inch and although it was cut off it was necessary to send either a force to hold it in its place or a larger force to go through with the business of capturing it else there would be left in the rear of the left flank of a greek advance upon jannina a body of the enemy which at any moment might become active the major said that his battalion would probably form part of the force to advance upon prevasa nikopolis was on the road to prevasa and only three miles away from it chapter xi coleman spent a long afternoon in the drizzle enveloped in his macintosh he sat on a boulder in the lee of one of the old walls and moodily smoked cigars and listened to the ceaseless clatter of tongues a ray of light penetrated the mind of the dragoman and he laboured assiduously with wet fuel until he had accomplished a tin mug of coffee bits of cinder floated in it but coleman rejoiced and was kind to the dragoman the night was of cruel monotony afflicted by the wind and the darkness the correspondent sat with nerves keyed high waiting to hear the pickets open fire on a night attack he was so unaccountably sure that there would be a tumult and panic of this kind at some time of the night that he prevented himself from getting a reasonable amount of rest he could hear the soldiers breathing in sleep all about him he wished to arouse them from this slumber which to his ignorance seemed stupid the quality of mysterious menace in the great gloom and the silence would have caused him to pray if prayer would have transported him magically to new york and made him a young man with no coat playing billiards at his club the chill dawn came at last and with a fine elation which ever follows a dismal night in war an elation which bounds in the bosom as soon as day has knocked the shackles from a trembling mind although coleman had slept but a short time he was now as fresh as a total abstainer coming from the bath he heard the creak of battery wheels he saw crawling bodies of infantry moving in the dim light like ghostly processions he felt a tremendous virility come with this new hope in the daylight he again took satis faction in his sentimental journey it was a shining affair he was on active service an active service of the heart and he felt that he was a strong man ready to conquer difficulty even as the olden heroes conquered difficulty he imagined himself in a way like them he too had come out to fight for love with giants dragons and witches he had never known that he could be so pleased with that kind of a parallel the dragoman announced that the major had suddenly lent their horses to some other people and after cursing this versatility of interest he summoned his henchmen and they moved out on foot following the sound of the creaking wheels they came in time to a bridge and on the side of this bridge was a hard military road which sprang away in two directions north and west some troops were creeping out the westward way and the dragoman pointing at them said they going prevasa that is road to nikopolis coleman grinned from ear to car and slapped his dragoman violently on the shoulder for a moment he intended to hand the man a louis of reward but he changed his mind their traps were in the way of being heavy but they minded little since the dragoman was now a victim of the influence of colemans enthusiasm the road wound along the base of the mountain range sheering around the abutments in wide white curves and then circling into glens where immense trees spread their shade over it some of the great trunks were oppressed with vines green as garlands and these vines even ran like verdant foam over the rocks streams of translucent water showered down from the hills and made pools in which every pebble every eaf of a water plant shone with magic lustre and if the bottom of a pool was only of clay the clay glowed with sapphire light the day was fair the country was part of that land which turned the minds of its ancient poets toward a more tender dreaming so that indeed their nymphs would die one is sure in the cold mythology of the north with its storms amid the gloom of pine forests it was all wine to colemans spirit it enlivened him to think of success with absolute surety to be sure one of his boots began soon to rasp his toes but he gave it no share of his attention they passed at a much faster pace than the troops and everywhere they met laughter and confidence and the cry on to prevasa at midday they were at the heels of the advance battalion among its stragglers taking its white dust into their throats and eyes the dragoman was waning and he made a number of attempts to stay coleman but no one could have had influence upon colemans steady rush with his eyes always straight to the front as if thus to symbolize his steadiness of purpose rivulets of sweat marked the dust on his face and two of his toes were now paining as if they were being burned off he was obliged to concede a privilege of limping but he would not stop at nightfall they halted with the outpost batallion of the infantry all the cavalry had in the meantirne come up and they saw their old friends there was a village from which the christian peasants came and cheered like a trained chorus soldiers were driving a great flock of fat sheep into a corral they had belonged to a turkish bey and they bleated as if they knew that they were now mere spoils of war coleman lay on the steps of the beys house smoking with his head on his blanket roll camp fires glowed off in the fields he was now about four miles from nikopolis within the house the commander of the cavalry was writing dispatches officers clanked up and down the stairs the dashing young captain came and said that there would be a general assault on prevasa at the dawn of the next day afterward the dragoman descended upon the village and in some way wrenched a little grey horse from an inhabitant its pack saddle was on its back and it would very handily carry the traps in this matter the dragoman did not consider his master he considered his own sore back coleman ate more bread and chocolate tablets and also some tinned sardines he was content with the days work he did not see how he could have improved it there was only one route by which the wainwright party could avoid him and that was by going to prevasa and thence taking ship but since prevasa was blockaded by a greek fleet he conceived that event to be impossible hence he had them hedged on this peninsula and they must be either at nikopolis or prevasa he would probably know all early in the morning he reflected that he was too tired to care if there might be a night attack and then wrapped in his blankets he went peacefully to sleep in the grass under a big tree with the crooning of some soldiers around their fire blending into his slumber and now although the dragoman had performed a number of feats of incapacity he achieved during the one hour of colemans sleeping a blunder which for real finish was simply a perfection of art when coleman much later extracted the full story it appeared that ringing events happened during that single hour of sleep ten minutes after he had lain down for a night of oblivion the battalion of infantry which had advanced a little beyond the village was recalled and began a hurried night march back on the way it had so festively come it was significant enough to appeal to almost any mind but the dragoman was able to not understand it he remained jabbering to some acquaintances among the troopers coleman had been asleep his hour when the dashing young captain perceived the dragoman and completely horrified by his presence at that place ran to him and whispered to him swiftly that the game was to flee flee flee the wing of the army which had advanced northward upon jannina had already been tumbled back by the turks and all the other wing had been recalled to the louros river and there was now nothing practically between him and his sleeping master and the enemy but a cavalry picket the cavalry was immediately going to make a forced march to the rear the stricken dragoman could even then see troopers getting into their saddles he rushed to the tree and in a panic simply bundled coleman upon his feet before he was awake he stuttered out his tale and the dazed correspondent heard it punctuated by the steady trample of the retiring cavalry the dragoman saw a mans face then turn in a flash from an expression of luxurious drowsiness to an expression of utter malignancy however he was in too much of a hurry to be afraid of it he ran off to the little grey horse and frenziedly but skilfully began to bind the traps upon the packsaddle he appeared in a moment tugging at the halter he could only say come come come queek queek they slid hurriedly down a bank to the road and started to do again that which they had accomplished with considerable expenditure of physical power during the day the hoof beats of the cavalry had already died away and the mountains shadowed them in lonely silence they were the rear guard after the rear guard the dragoman muttered hastily his last dire rumours five hundred circassian cavalry were coming the mountains were now infested with the dread albanian irregulars coleman had thought in his daylight tramp that he had appreciated the noble distances but he found that he knew nothing of their nobility until he tried this night stumbling and the hoofs of the little horse made on the hard road more noise than could be made by men beating with hammers upon brazen cylinders the correspondent glanced continually up at the crags from the other side he could sometimes hear the metallic clink of water deep down in a glen for the first time in his life he seriously opened the flap of his holster and let his fingers remain on the handle of his revolver from just in front of him he could hear the chattering of the dragomans teeth which no attempt at more coolness could seem to prevent in the meantime the casual manner of the little grey horse struck coleman with maddening vividness if the blank darkness was simply filled with ferocious albanians the horse did not care a button he leisurely put his feet down with a resounding ring coleman whispered hastily to the dragoman if they rush us jump down the bank no matter how deep it is thats our only chance and try to keep together all they saw of the universe was in front of them a place faintly luminous near their feet but fading in six yards to the darkness of a dungeon this represented the bright white road of the day time it had no end coleman had thought that he could tell from the very feel of the air some of the landmarks of his daytime journey but he had now no sense of location at all he would not have denied that he was squirming on his belly like a worm through black mud they went on and on visions of his past were sweeping through colemans mind precisely as they are said to sweep through the mind of a drowning person but he had no regret for any bad deeds he regretted merely distant hours of peace and protection he was no longer a hero going to rescue his love he was a slave making a gasping attempt to escape from the most incredible tyranny of circumstances he half vowed to himself that if the god whom he had in no wise heeded would permit him to crawl out of this slavery he would never again venture a yard toward a danger any greater than may be incurred from the police of a most proper metropolis if his juvenile and uplifting thoughts of other days had reproached him he would simply have repeated and repeated adventure be damned it became known to them that the horse had to be led the debased creature was asserting its right to do as it had been trained to follow its customs it was asserting this right during a situation which required conduct superior to all training and custom it was so grossly conventional that coleman would have understood that demoniac form of anger which sometimes leads men to jab knives into warm bodies coleman from cowardice tried to induce the dragoman to go ahead leading the horse and the dragoman from cowardice tried to induce coleman to go ahead leading the horse coleman of course had to succumb the dragoman was only good to walk behind and tearfully whisper maledictions as he prodded the flanks of their tranquil beast in the absolute black of the frequent forests coleman could not see his feet and he often felt like a man walking forward to fall at any moment down a thousand yards of chasm he heard whispers he saw skulking figures and these frights turned out to be the voice of a little trickle of water or the effects of wind among the leaves but they were replaced by the same terrors in slightly different forms then the poignant thing interpolated a volley crashed ahead of them some half of a mile away and another volley answered from a still nearer point swishing noises which the correspondent had heard in the air he now know to have been from the passing of bullets he and the dragoman came stock still they heard three other volleys sounding with the abrupt clamour of a hail of little stones upon a hollow surface coleman and the dragoman came close together and looked into the whites of each others eyes the ghastly horse at that moment stretched down his neck and began placidly to pluck the grass at the roadside the two men were equally blank with fear and each seemed to seek in the other some newly rampant manhood upon which he could lean at this time behind them were the turks in front of them was a fight in the darkness in front it was mathematic to suppose in fact were also the turks they were barred enclosed cut off the end was come even at that moment they heard from behind them the sound of slow stealthy footsteps they both wheeled instantly choking with this additional terror coleman saw the dragoman move swiftly to the side of the road ready to jump into whatever abyss happened to be there coleman still gripped the halter as if it were in truth a straw the stealthy footsteps were much nearer then it was that an insanity came upon him as if fear had flamed up within him until it gave him all the magnificent desperation of a madman he jerked the grey horse broadside to the approaching mystery and grabbing out his revolver aimed it from the top of his improvised bulwark he hailed the darkness halt whos there he had expected his voice to sound like a groan but instead it happened to sound clear stern commanding like the voice of a young sentry at an encampment of volunteers he did not seem to have any privilege of selection as to the words they were born of themselves he waited then blanched and hopeless for death to wing out of the darkness and strike him down he heard a voice the voice said do you speak english for one or two seconds he could not even understand english and then the great fact swelled up and within him this voice with all its new quavers was still undoubtedly the voice of prof harrison bwainwright of washurst college chapter xii a change flashed over coleman as if it had come from an electric storage he had known the professor long but he had never before heard a quaver in his voice and it was this little quaver that seemed to impel him to supreme disregard of the dangers which he looked upon as being the final dangers his own voice had not quavered when he spoke he spoke in a low tone it was the voice of the master of the situation he could hear his dupes fluttering there in the darkness yes he said i speak english there is some danger stay where you are and make no noise he was as cool as an iced drink to be sure the circumstances had in no wise changed as to his personal danger but beyond the important fact that there were now others to endure it with him he seemed able to forget it in a strange unauthorized sense of victory it came from the professors quavers meanwhile he had forgotten the dragoman but he recalled him in time to bid him wait then as well concealed as a monk hiding in his cowl he tiptoed back into a group of people who knew him intimately he discerned two women mounted on little horses and about them were dim men he could hear them breathing hard it is all right he began smoothly you only need to be very careful suddenly out of the blackness projected a half phosphorescent face it was the face of the little professor he stammered wewedo you really speak english coleman in his feeling of superb triumph could almost have laughed his nerves were as steady as hemp but he was in haste and his haste allowed him to administer rebuke to his old professor didnt you hear me he hissed through his tightening lips they are fighting just ahead of us on the road and if you want to save yourselves dont waste time another face loomed faintly like a mask painted in dark grey it belonged to coke and it was a mask figured in profound stupefaction the lips opened and tensely breathed out the name coleman instantly the correspondent felt about him that kind of a tumult which tries to suppress itself he knew that it was the most theatric moment of his life he glanced quickly toward the two figures on horseback he believed that one was making foolish gesticulation while the other sat rigid and silent this latter one he knew to be marjory he was content that she did not move only a woman who was glad he had come but did not care for him would have moved this applied directly to what he thought he knew of marjorys nature there was confusion among the students but coleman suppressed it as in such situation might a centurion sssteady he seized the arm of the professor and drew him forcibly close the condition is this he whispered rapidly we are in a fix with this fight on up the road i was sent after you but i cant get you into the greek lines tonight mrswainwright and marjory must dismount and i and my man will take the horses on and hide them all the rest of you must go up about a hundred feet into the woods and hide when i come back ill hail you and you answer low the professor was like pulp in his grasp he choked out the word coleman in agony and wonder but he obeyed with a palpable gratitude coleman sprang to the side of the shadowy figure of marjory come he said authoritatively she laid in his palm a little icy cold hand and dropped from her horse he had an impulse to cling to the small fingers but he loosened them immediately imparting to his manner as well as the darkness permitted him a kind of casual politeness as if he were too intent upon the business in hand he bunched the crowd and pushed them into the wood then he and the dragoman took the horses a hundred yards onward and tethered them no one would care if they were stolen the great point was to get them where their noise would have no power of revealing the whole party there had been no further firing after he had tied the little grey horse to a tree he unroped his luggage and carried the most of it back to the point where the others had left the road he called out cautiously and received a sibilant answer he and the dragoman bunted among the trees until they came to where a forlorn company was seated awaiting them lifting their faces like frogs out of a pond his first question did not give them any assurance he said at once are any of you armed unanimously they lowly breathed no he searched them out one by one and finally sank down by the professor he kept sort of a hypnotic handcuff upon the dragoman because he foresaw that this man was really going to be the key to the best means of escape to a large neutral party wandering between hostile lines there was technically no danger but actually there was a great deal both armies had too many irregulars lawless hillsmen come out to fight in their own way and if they were encountered in the dead of night on such hazardous ground the greek hillsmen with their white cross on a blue field would be precisely as dangerous as the bloodhungry albanians coleman knew that the rational way was to reach the greek lines and he had no intention of reaching the greek lines without a tongue and the only tongue was in the mouth of the dragoman he was correct in thinking that the professors deep knowledge of the ancient language would give him small clue to the speech of the modern greek as he settled himself by the professor the band of students eight in number pushed their faces close he did not see any reason for speaking there were thirty seconds of deep silence in which he felt that all were bending to hearken to his words of counsel the professor huskily broke the stillness well what are we to do now coleman was decisive indeed absolute well stay here until daylight unless you care to get shot all right answered the professor he turned and made a useless remark to his flock stay here coleman asked civilly have you had anything to eat have you got anything to wrap around you we have absolutely nothing answered the professor our servants ran away and and then we left everything behind us and ive never been in such a position in my life coleman moved softly in the darkness and unbuckled some of his traps on his knee he broke the hard cakes of bread and with his fingers he broke the little tablets of chocolate these he distributed to his people and at this time he felt fully the appreciation of the conduct of the eight american college students they had not yet said a wordwith the exception of the bewildered exclamation from coke they all knew him well in any circumstance of life which as far as he truly believed they had yet encountered they would have been privileged to accost him in every form of their remarkable vocabulary they were as new to this game as would have been eight newlycaught apache indians if such were set to run the elevators in the tract society building he could see their eyes gazing at him anxiously and he could hear their deepdrawn breaths but they said no word he knew that they were looking upon him as their leader almost as their saviour and he knew also that they were going to follow him without a murmur in the conviction that he knew tenfold more than they knew it occurred to him that his position was ludicrously false but anyhow he was glad surely it would be a very easy thing to lead them to safety in the morning and he foresaw the credit which would come to him he concluded that it was beneath his dignity as preserver to vouchsafe them many words his business was to be the cold masterful enigmatic man it might be said that these reflections were only halfthoughts in his mind meanwhile a section of his intellect was flying hither and thither speculating upon the circassian cavalry and the albanian guerillas and even the greek outposts he unbuckled his blanket roll and taking one blanket placed it about the shoulders of the shadow which was mrswainwright the shadow protested incoherently hut he muttered oh thats all right then he took his other blanket and went to the shadow which was marjory it was something like putting a wrap about the shoulders of a statue he was base enough to linger in the hopes that he could detect some slight trembling but as far as lie knew she was of stone his macintosh he folded around the body of the professor amid quite senile protest so senile that the professor seemed suddenly proven to him as an old old man a fact which had never occurred to washurst or her children then he went to the dragoman and preempted half of his blankets the dragoman grunted but coleman it would not do to have this dragoman develop a luxurious temperament when eight american college students were without speech shivering in the cold night coleman really begun to ruminate upon his glory but he found that he could not do this well without smoking so he crept away some distance from this fireless encampment and bending his face to the ground at the foot of a tree he struck a match and lit a cigar his retun to the others would have been somewhat in the manner of coolness as displayed on the stage if he had not been prevented by the necessity of making no noise he saw regarding him as before the dimly visible eyes of the eight students and marjory and her father and mother then he whispered the conventional words go to sleep if you can youll need your strength in the morning i and this man here will keep watch three of the college students of course crawled up to him and each said ill keep watch old man no well keep watch you people try to sleep he deemed that it might be better to yield the dragoman his blanket and so he got up and leaned against a tree holding his hand to cover the brilliant point of his cigar he knew perfectly well that none of them could sleep but he stood there somewhat like a sentry without the attitude but with all the effect of responsibility he had no doubt but what escape to civilisation would be easy but anyhow his heroism should be preserved he was the rescuer his thoughts of marjory were somewhat in a puzzle the meeting had placed him in such a position that he had expected a lot of condescension on his own part instead she had exhibited about as much recognition of him as would a stone fountain on his grandfathers place in connecticut this in his opinion was not the way to greet the knight who had come to the rescue of his lady he had not expected it so to happen in fact from athens to this place he had engaged himself with imagery of possible meetings he was vexed certainly but far beyond that he knew a deeper adminiration for this girl to him she represented the sex and so the sex as embodied in her seemed a mystery to be feared he wondered if safety came on the morrow he would not surrender to this feminine invulnerability she had not done anything that he had expected of her and so inasmuch as he loved her he loved her more it was bewitching he half considered himself a fool but at any rate he thought resentfully she should be thankful to him for having rendered her a great service however when he came to consider this proposition he knew that on a basis of absolute manly endeavour he had rendered her little or no service the night was long chapter xiii coleman suddenly found himself looking upon his pallid dragoman he saw that he had been asleep crouched at the foot of the tree without any exchange of speech at all he knew there had been alarming noises then shots sounded from nearby some were from rifles aimed in that direction and some were from rifles opposed to them this was distinguishable to the experienced man but all that coleman knew was that the conditions of danger were now triplicated unconsciously he stretched his hands in supplication over his charges dont move dont move and keep close to the ground all heeded him but marjory she still sat straight he himself was on his feet but he now knew the sound of bullets and he knew that no bullets had spun through the trees he could not see her distinctly but it was known to him in some way that she was mutinous he leaned toward her and spoke as harshly as possible marjory get down she wavered for a moment as if resolved to defy him as he turned again to peer in the direction of the firing it went through his mind that she must love him very much indeed he was assured of it it must have been some small outpour between nervous pickets and eager hillsmen for it ended in a moment the party waited in abasement for what seemed to them a time and the blue dawn began to laggardly shift the night as they waited the dawn itself seemed prodigiously long in arriving at anything like discernible landscape when this was consummated coleman in somewhat the manner of the father of a church dealt bits of chocolate out to the others he had already taken the precaution to confer with the dragoman so he said well come ahead well make a try for it they arose at his bidding and followed him to the road it was the same broad white road only that the white was in the dawning something like the grey of a veil it took some courage to venture upon this thoroughfare but coleman stepped outafter looking quickly in both directions the party tramped to where the horses had been left and there they were found without change of a rope coleman rejoiced to see that his dragoman now followed him in the way of a good lieutenant they both dashed in among the trees and had the horses out into the road in a twinkle when coleman turned to direct that utterly subservient group he knew that his face was drawn from hardship and anxiety but he saw everywhere the same style of face with the exception of the face of marjory who looked simply of lovely marble he noted with a curious satisfaction as if the thing was a tribute to himself that his macintosh was over the professors shoulder that marjory and her mother were each carrying a blanket and that the corps of students had dutifully brought all the traps which his dragoman had forgotten it was grand he addressed them to say now approaching outposts is very dangerous business at this time in the morning so my man who can talk both greek and turkish will go ahead forty yards and i will follow somewhere between him and you try not to crowd forward he directed the ladies upon their horses and placed the professor upon the little grey nag then they took up their line of march the dragoman had looked somewhat dubiously upon this plan of having him go forty yards in advance but he had the utmost confidence in this new coleman whom yesterday he had not known besides he himself was a very gallant man indeed and it befitted him to take the post of danger before the eyes of all these foreigners in his new position he was as proud and unreasonable as a rooster he was continually turning his head to scowl back at them when only the clank of hoofs was sounding an impenetrable mist lay on the valley and the hilltops were shrouded as for the people they were like mice coleman paid no attention to the wainwright party but walked steadily along near the dragoman perhaps the whole thing was a trifle absurd but to a great percentage of the party it was terrible for instance those eight boys fresh from a school could in no wise gauge the dimensions and if this was true of the students it was more distinctly true of marjory and her mother as for the professor he seemed weighted to the earth by his love and his responsibility suddenly the dragoman wheeled and made demoniac signs coleman halfturned to survey the main body and then paid his attention swiftly to the front the white road sped to the top of a hill where it seemed to make a rotund swing into oblivion the top of the curve was framed in foliage and therein was a horseman he had his carbine slanted on his thigh and his bridlereins taut upon sight of them he immediately wheeled and galloped down the other slope and vanished the dragoman was throwing wild gestures into the air as coleman looked back at the wainwright party he saw plainly that to an ordinary eye they might easily appear as a strong advance of troops the peculiar light would emphasize such theory the dragoman ran to him jubilantly but he contained now a form of intelligence which caused him to whisper that was one greek that was one greekwhat do you call sentree coleman addressed the others he said its all right come ahead that was a greek picket there is only one trouble now and that is to approach them easydo you seeeasy his obedient charges came forward at his word when they arrived at the top of this rise they saw nothing coleman was very uncertain he was not sure that this picket had not carried with him a general alarm and in that case there would soon occur a certain amount of shooting however as far as he understood the business there was no way but forward inasmuch as he did not indicate to the wainwright party that he wished them to do differently they followed on doggedly after him and the dragoman he knew now that the dragomans heart had for the tenth time turned to dogbiscuit so he kept abreast of him and soon together they walked into a cavalry outpost commanded by no less a person than the dashing young captain who came laughing out to meet them suddenly losing all colour of war the condition was now such as might occur in a drawing room coleman felt the importance of establishing highly conventional relations between the captain and the wainwright party to compass this he first seized his dragoman and the dragoman enlightened immediately spun a series of lies which must have led the captain to believe that the entire heart of the american republic had been taken out of that western continent and transported to greece coleman was proud of the captain the latter immediately went and bowed in the manner of the french school and asked everybody to have a cup of coffee although acceptation would have proved his ruin and disgrace coleman refused in the name of courtesy he called his party forward and now they proceeded merely as one crowd marjory had dismounted in the meantime the moment was come coleman felt it the first rush was from the students immediately he was buried in a thrashing mob of them good boy good boy great man oh isnt he a peach how did he do it he came in strong at the finish good boy coleman through this mist of glowing youthful congratulatioin he saw the professor standing at the outskirts with direct formal thanks already moving on his lips while near him his wife wept joyfully marjory was evidently enduring some inscrutable emotion after all it did penetrate his mind that it was indecent to accept all this wild gratitude but there was built within him no intention of positively declaring himself lacking in all credit or at least lacking in all credit in the way their praises defined it in truth he had assisted them but he had been at the time largely engaged in assisting himself and their coming had been more of a boon to his loneliness than an addition to his care however he soon had no difficulty in making his conscience appropriate every line in these hymns sung in his honour the students curiously wise of men thought his conduct quite perfect oh say come off he protested why i didnt do anything you fellows are crazy you would have gotten in all right by yourselves dont act like asses as soon as the professor had opportunity he came to coleman he was a changed little man and his extraordinary bewilderment showed in his face it was the disillusion and amazement of a stubborn mind that had gone implacably in its one direction and found in the end that the direction was all wrong and that really a certain mental machine had not been infallible coleman remembered what the american minister in athens had described of his protests against the starting of the professors party on this journey and of the complete refusal of the professor to recognise any value in the advice and here now was the consequent defeat it was mirrored in the professors astonished eyes coleman went directly to his dazed old teacher well youre out of it now professor he said warmly i congratulate you on your escape sir the professor looked at him helpless to express himself but the correspondent was at that time suddenly enveloped in the hysterical gratitude of mrs wainwright who hurled herself upon him with extravagant manifestations coleman played his part with skill to both the professor and mrs wainwright his manner was a combination of modestly filial affection and a pretentious disavowal of his having done anything at all it seemed to charm everybody but marjory it irritated him to see that she was apparently incapable of acknowledging that he was a grand man he was actually compelled to go to her and offer congratulations upon her escape as he had congratulated the professor if his manner to her parents had been filial his manner to her was parental well marjory he said kindly you have been in considerable danger i suppose youre glad to be through with it she at that time made no reply but by her casual turn he knew that he was expected to walk along by her side the others knew it too and the rest of the party left them free to walk side by side in the rear this is a beautiful country hereabouts if one gets a good chance to see it he remarked then he added but i suppose you had a view of it when you were going out to nikopolis she answered in muffled tones yes we thought it very beautiful did you note those streams from the mountains that seemed to me the purest water id ever seen but i bet it would make one ill to drink it there is you know a prominent german chemist who has almost proven that really pure water is practical poison to the human stomach yes she said there was a period of silence during which he was perfectly comfortable because he knew that she was ill at ease if the silence was awkward she was suffering from it as for himself he had no inclination to break it his position was as far as the entire wainwright party was concerned a place where he could afford to wait she turned to him at last of course i know how much you have done for us and i want you to feel that we all appreciate it deeplydeeply there was discernible to the ear a certain note of desperation oh not at all he said generously not at all i didnt do anything it was quite an accident dont let that trouble you for a moment well of course you would say that she said more steadily but iwewe know how good and howbrave it was in you to come for us and i we must never forget it as a matter of fact replied coleman with an appearance of ingenuous candor i was sent out here by the eclipse to find you people and of course i worked rather hard to reach you but the final meeting was purely accidental and does not redound to my credit in the least as he had anticipated marjory shot him a little glance of disbelief of course you would say that she repeated with gloomy but flattering conviction oh if i had been a great hero he said smiling no doubt i would have kept up this same manner which now sets so well upon me but i am telling you the truth when i say that i had no part in your rescue at all she became slightly indignant oh if you care to tell us constantly that you were of no service to us i dont see what we can do but continue to declare that you were suddenly he felt vulgar he spoke to her this time with real meaning i beg of you never to mention it again that will be the best way but to this she would not accede no we will often want to speak of it he replied how do you like greece dont you think that some of these ruins are rather out of shape in the popular mind now for my part i would rather look at a good strong finish at a horserace than to see ten thousand parthenons in a bunch she was immediately in the position of defending him from himself you would rather see no such thing you shouldnt talk in that utterly trivial way i like the parthenon of course but i cant think of it now because my head is too full of my escape from where i was soso frightened coleman grinned were you really frightened naturally she answered i suppose i was more frightened for mother and father but i was frightened enough for myself it was notnot a nice thing no it wasnt said coleman i could hardly believe my senses when the minister at athens told me that you all had ventured into such a trap and there is no doubt but what you can be glad that you are well out of it she seemed to have some struggle with herself and then she deliberately said thanks to you coleman embarked on what he intended to make a series of highminded protests not at all but at that moment the dragoman whirled back from the vanguard with a great collection of the difficulties which had been gathering upon him coleman was obliged to resign marjory and again take up the active leadership he disposed of the dragomans difficulties mainly by declaring that they were not difficulties at all he had learned that this was the way to deal with dragomen the fog had already lifted from the valley and as they passed along the wooded mountainside the fragrance of leaves and earth came to them ahead along the hooded road they could see the blue clad figures of greek infantrymen finally they passed an encampment of a battalion whose line was at a right angle to the highway a hundred yards in advance was the bridge across the louros river and there a battery of artillery was encamped the dragoman became involved in all sorts of discussions with other greeks but coleman stuck to his elbow and stifled all aimless oration the wainwright party waited for them in the rear in an observant but patient group across a plain the hills directly behind arta loomed up showing the straight yellow scar of a modern entrenchment to the north of arta were some grey mountains with a dimly marked road winding to the summit on one side of this road were two shadows it took a moment for the eye to find these shadows but when this was accomplished it was plain that they were men the captain of the battery explained to the dragoman that he did not know that they were not also turks in which case the road to arta was a dangerous path it was no good news to coleman he waited a moment in order to gain composure and then walked back to the wainwright party they must have known at once from his peculiar gravity that all was not well five of the students and the professor immediately asked what is it he had at first some oldfashioned idea of concealing the ill tidings from the ladies but he perceived what flagrant nonsense this would be in circumstances in which all were fairly likely to incur equal dangers and at any rate he did not see his way clear to allow their imagination to run riot over a situation which might not turn out to be too bad he said slowly you see those mountains over there well troops have been seen there and the captain of this battery thinks they are turks if they are turks the road to arta is distinctlyerunsafe this new blow first affected the wainwright party as being too much to endure they thought they had gone through enough this was a general sentiment afterward the emotion took colour according to the individual character one student laughed and said well i see our finish another student piped out how do they know they are turks what makes them think they are turks another student expressed himself with a sigh this is a long way from the bowery the professor said nothing but looked annihilated mrs wainwright wept profoundly marjory looked expectantly toward coleman as for the correspondent he was adamantine and reliable and stern for he had not the slightest idea that those men on the distant hill were turks at all chapter xiv oh said a student this game ought to quit i feel like thirty cents we didnt come out here to be pursued about the country by these turks why dont they stop it coleman was remarking really the only sensible thing to do now is to have breakfast there is no use in worrying ourselves silly over this thing until weve got to they spread the blankets on the ground and sat about a feast of bread water cress and tinned beef coleman was the real host but he contrived to make the professor appear as that honourable person they ate casting their eyes from time to time at the distant mountain with its two shadows people began to fly down the road from jannina peasants hurriedly driving little flocks women and children on donkeys and little horses which they clubbed unceasingly one man rode at a gallop shrieking and flailing his arms in the air they were all christian peasants of turkey but they were in flight now because they did not wish to be at home if the turk was going to return and reap revenge for his mortification the wainwright party looked at coleman in abrupt questioning oh its all right he said easily they are always taking on that way suddenly the dragoman gave a shout and dashed up the road to the scene of a melee where a little ratfaced groom was vociferously defending three horses from some greek officers who as vociferously were stating their right to requisition them coleman ran after his dragoman there was a sickening powwow but in the end coleman straight and easy in the saddle came cantering back on a superb openmouthed snorting bay horse he did not mind if the halfwild animal plunged crazily it was part of his role they were trying to steal my horses he explained he leaped to the ground and holding the horse by the bridle he addressed his admiring companions the groomthe man who has charge of the horsessays that he thinks that the people on the mountainside are turks but i dont see how that is possible you see he pointed wisely that road leads directly south to arta and it is hardly possible that the greek army would come over here and leave that approach to arta utterly unguarded it would be too foolish they must have left some men to cover it and that is certainly what those troops are if you are all ready and willing i dont see anything to do but make a good stouthearted dash for arta it would be no more dangerous than to sit here the professor was at last able to make his formal speech mr coleman he said distinctly we place ourselves entirely in your hands it was some how pitiful this man who for years and years had reigned in a little college town almost as a monarch passing judgment with the air of one who words the law dealing criticism upon the universe as one to whom all things are plain publicly disdaining defeat as one to whom all things are easythis man was now veritably appealing to coleman to save his wife his daughter and himself and really declared himself de pendent for safety upon the ingenuity and courage of the correspondent the attitude of the students was utterly indifferent they did not consider themselves helpless at all they were evidently quite ready to withstand anything but they looked frankly up to coleman as their intelligent leader if they suffered any their only expression of it was in the simple grim slang of their period i wish i was at coney island this is not so bad as trigonometry but its worse than playing billiards for the beers and coke said privately to coleman say what in hell are these two damn peoples fighting for anyhow when he saw that all opinions were in favour of following him loyally coleman was impelled to feel a responsibility he was now no errant rescuer but a properly elected leader of fellow beings in distress while one of the students held his horse he took the dragoman for another consultation with the captain of the battery the officer was sitting on a large stone with his eyes fixed into his field glasses when again questioned he could give no satisfaction as to the identity of the troops on the distant mountain he merely shrugged his shoulders and said that if they were greeks it was very good but if they were turks it was very bad he seemed more occupied in trying to impress the correspondent that it was a matter of soldierly indifference to himself coleman after loathing him sufficiently in silence returned to the others and said well well chance it they looked to him to arrange the caravan speaking to the men of the party he said of course any one of you is welcome to my horse if you can ride it butif youre not too tiredi think i had myself better ride so that i can go ahead at times his manner was so fine as he said this that the students seemed fairly to worship him of course it had been most improbable that any of them could have ridden that volcanic animal even if one of them had tried it he saw mrs wainwright and marjory upon the backs of their two little natives and hoisted the professor into the saddle of the grooms horse leaving instructions with the servant to lead the animal always and carefully he and the dragoman then mounted at the head of the procession and amid curious questionings from the soldiery they crossed the bridge and started on the trail to arta the rear was brought up by the little grey horse with the luggage led by one student and flogged by another coleman checking with difficulty the battling disposition of his horse was very uneasy in his mind because the last words of the captain of the battery had made him feel that perhaps on this ride he would be placed in a position where only the best courage would count and he did not see his way clear to feeling very confident about his conduct in such a case looking back upon the caravan he saw it as a most unwieldy thing not even capable of running away he hurried it with sudden sharp contemptuous phrases on the march there incidentally flashed upon him a new truth more than half of that student band were deeply in love with marjory of course when he had been distant from her he had had an eternal jealous reflection to that effect it was natural that he should have thought of the intimate camping relations between marjory and these young students with a great deal of bitterness grinding his teeth when picturing their opportunities to make marjory fall in love with some one of them he had raged particularly about coke whose father had millions of dollars but he had forgotten all these jealousies in the general splendour of his exploits now when he saw the truth it seemed to bring him back to his common life and he saw himself suddenly as not being frantically superior in any way to those other young men the more closely he looked at this last fact the more convinced he was of its truth he seemed to see that he had been impropererly elated over his services to the wainwrights and that in the end the girl might fancy a man because the man had done her no service at all he saw his proud position lower itself to be a pawn in the game looking back over the students he wondered which one marjory might love this hideous nikopolis had given eight men chance to win her his scorn and his malice quite centered upon coke for he could never forget that the mans father had millions of dollars the unfortunate coke chose that moment to address him querulously look here coleman cant you tell us how far it is to arta coke said coleman i dont suppose you take me for a tourist agency but if you can only try to distinguish between me and a map with the scale of miles printed in the lower lefthand corner you will not contribute so much to the sufferings of the party which you now adorn the students within hearing guffawed and coke retired in confusion the march was not rapid coleman almost wore out his arms holding in check his impetuous horse often the caravan floundered through mud while at the same time a hot yellow dust came from the north they were perhaps half way to arta when coleman decided that a rest and luncheon were the things to be considered he halted his troop then in the shade of some great trees and privately he bade his dragoman prepare the best feast which could come out of those saddlebags fresh from athens the result was rather gorgeous in the eyes of the poor wanderers first of all there were three knives three forks three spoons three tin cups and three tin plaies which the entire party of twelve used on a most amiable socialistic principle there were crisp salty biscuits and olives for which they speared in the bottle there was potted turkey and potted ham and potted tongue all tasting precisely alike there were sardines and the ordinary tinned beef disguised sometimes with onions carrots and potatoes out of the saddlebags came pepper and salt and even mustard the dragoman made coffee over a little fire of sticks that blazed with a white light the whole thing was prodigal but any philanthropist would have approved of it if he could have seen the way in which the eight students laid into the spread when there came a polite remonstrancenotably from mrs wainwrightcoleman merely pointed to a large bundle strapped back of the grooms saddle during the coffee he was considering how best to get the students one by one out of the sight of the wainwrights where he could give them good drinks of whisky there was an agitation on the road toward arta some people were coming on horses he paid small heed until he heard a thump of pausing hoofs near him and a musical voice say rufus he looked up quickly and then all present saw his eyes really bulge there on a fat and glossy horse sat nora black dressed in probably one of the most correct riding habits which had ever been seen in the east she was smiling a radiant smile which held the eight students simpty spellbound they would have recognised her if it had not been for this apparitional coming in the wilds of southeastern europe behind her were her peoplesome servants and an old lady on a very little pony well rufus she said coleman made the mistake of hesitating for a fraction of a moment he had acted as if he were embarrassed and was only going to nod and say how ddo he arose and came forward too late she was looking at him with a menacing glance which meant difficulties for him if he was not skilful keen as an eagle she swept her glance over the face and figure of marjory without further introduction the girls seemed to understand that they were enemies despite his feeling of awkwardness colemans mind was mainly occupied by pure astonishment nora black he said as if even then he could not believe his senses how in the world did you get down here she was not too amiable evidently over his reception and she seemed to know perfectly that it was in her power to make him feel extremely unpleasant oh its not so far she answered i dont see where you come in to ask me what im doing here what are you doing here she lifted her eyes and shot the half of a glance at marjory into her last question she had interjected a spirit of ownership in which he saw future woe it turned him cowardly why you know i was sent up here by the paper to rescue the wainwright party and ive got them im taking them to arta but why are you here i am here she said giving him the most defiant of glances principally to look for you even the horse she rode betrayed an intention of abiding upon that spot forever she had made her communication with coleman appear to the wainwright party as a sort of tender reunion coleman looked at her with a steely eye nora you can certainly be a devil when you choose why dont you present me to your friends mis nora black special correspondent of the new york daylighi if you please i belong to your opposition i am your rival rufus and i draw a bigger salarysee funny looking gang that who is the old johnnie in the white wig erwhere you goinyou cant blundered coleman miserably awthe army is in retreat and you must go back todont you see is it she agked after a pause she added coolly then i shall go back to arta with you and your precious wainwrights chapter xv giving coleman another glance of subtle menace nora repeated why dont you present me to your friends coleman had been swiftly searching the whole world for a way clear of this unhappiness but he knew at last that he could only die at his guns why certainly he said quickly if you wish it he sauntered easily back to the luncheon blanket this is miss black of the new york daylight and she says that those people on the mountain are greeks the students were gaping at him and marjory and her father sat in the same silence but to the relief of coleman and to the high edification of the students mrs wainwright cried out why is she an american woman and seeing colemans nod of assent she rustled to her feet and advanced hastily upon the complacent horsewoman im delighted to see you who would think of seeing an american woman way over here have you been here long are you going on further oh weve had such a dreadful time coleman remained long enough to hear nora say thank you very much but i shant dismount i am going to ride back to arta presently then he heard mrs wainwright cry oh are you indeed why we too are going at once to arta we can all go together coleman fled then to the bosom of the students who all looked at him with eyes of cynical penetration he cast a glance at marjory more than fearing a glare which denoted an implacable resolution never to forgive this thing on the contrary he had never seen her so content and serene you have allowed your coffee to get chilled she said considerately wont you have the man warm you some more thanks no he answered with gratitude nora changing her mind had dismounted and was coming with mrs wainwright that worthy lady had long had a fund of information and anecdote the sound of which neither her husband nor her daughter would endure for a moment of course the rascally students were out of the question here then was really the first ear amiably and cheerfully open and she was talking at what the students called her thirty knot gait lost everything absolutely everything neither of us have even a brush and comb or a cake of soap or enough hairpins to hold up our hair im going to take marjorys away from her and let her braid her hair down her back you can imagine how dreadful it is from time to time the cool voice of nora sounded without effort through this clamour oh it will be no trouble at all i have more than enough of everything we can divide very nicely coleman broke somewhat imperiously into this feminine chat well we must be moving you know and his voice started the men into activity when the traps were all packed again on the horse coleman looked back surprised to see the three women engaged in the most friendly discussion the combined parties now made a very respectable squadron coleman rode off at its head without glancing behind at all he knew that they were following from the soft pounding of the horses hoofs on the sod and from the mellow hum of human voices for a long time he did not think to look upon himself as anything but a man much injured by circumstances among his friends he could count numbers who had lived long lives without having this peculiar class of misfortune come to them in fact it was so unusual a misfortune that men of the world had not found it necessary to pass from mind to mind a perfec t formula for dealing with it but he soon began to consider himself an extraordinarily lucky person inasmuch as nora black had come upon him with her saddle bags packed with inflammable substances so to speak and there had been as yet only enough fire to boil coffee for luncheon he laughed tenderly when he thought of the innocence of mrs wainwright but his face and back flushed with heat when lie thought of the canniness of the eight american college students he heard a horse cantering up on his left side and looking he saw nora black she was beaming with satisfaction and good nature well rufus she cried flippantly how goes it with the gallant rescuer youve made a hit my boy you are the success of the season coleman reflected upon the probable result of a direct appeal to nora he knew of course that such appeals were usually idle but he did not consider nora an ordinary person his decision was to venture it he drew his horse close to hers nora he said do you know that you are raising the very devil she lifted her finely penciled eyebrows and looked at him with the babystare how she enquired you know well enough he gritted out wrathfully raising the very devil she asked how do you mean she was palpably interested for his answer she waited for his reply for an interval and then she asked him outright rufus coleman do you mean that i am not a respectable woman in reality he had meant nothing of the kind but this direct throttling of a great question stupefied him utterly for he saw now that she would probably never understand him in the least and that she would at any rate always pretend not to understand him and that the more he said the more harm he manufactured she studied him over carefully and then wheeled her horse towards the rear with some parting remarks i suppose you should attend more strictly to your own affairs rufus instead of raising the devil i am lending hairpins i have seen you insult people but i have never seen you insult anyone quite for the whim of the thing go soak your head not considering it advisable to then indulge in such immersion coleman rode moodily onward the hot dust continued to sting the cheeks of the travellers and in some places great clouds of dead leaves roared in circles about them all of the wainwright party were utterly fagged coleman felt his skin crackle and his throat seemed to be coated with the white dust he worried his dragoman as to the distance to arta until the dragoman lied to the point where he always declared that arta was only off some hundreds of yards at their places in the procession mrs wainwright and marjory were animatedly talking to nora and the old lady on the little pony they had at first suffered great amazement at the voluntary presence of the old lady but she was there really because she knew no better her colossal ignorance took the form mainly of a most obstreperous patriotism and indeed she always acted in a foreign country as if she were the special commissioner of the president or perhaps as a special commissioner could not act at all she was very aggressive and when any of the travelling arrangements in europe did not suit her ideas she was wont to shrilly exclaim well new york is good enough for me nora morbidly afraid that her expense bill to the daylight would not be large enough had dragged her bodily off to greece as her companion friend and protection at arta they had heard of the grand success of the greek army the turks had not stood for a moment before that gallant and terrible advance no they had scampered howling with fear into the north jannina would fallwell jannina would fall as soon as the greeks arrived there was no doubt of it the correspondent and her friend deluded and hurried by the lighthearted confidence of the greeks in arta had hastened out then on a regular tourists excursion to see jannina after its capture nora concealed from her friend the fact that the editor of the daylight particularly wished her to see a battle so that she might write an article on actual warfare from a womans point of view with her name as a queen of comic opera such an article from her pen would be a burning sensation coleman had been the first to point out to nora that instead of going on a picnic to jannina she had better run back to arta when the old lady heard that they had not been entirely safe she was furious with nora the idea she exclaimed to mrs wainwright they might have caught us they might have caught us well said mrs wainwright i verily believe they would have caught us if it had not been for mr coleman is he the gentleman on the fine horse yes thats him oh he has been simplee splendid i confess i was a little bitersurprised he was in college under my husband i dont know that we thought very great things of him but if ever a man won golden opinions he has done so from us oh that must be the coleman who is such a great friend of noras yes said mrs wainwright insidiously is he i didnt know of course he knows so many people her mind had been suddenly illumined by the old lady and she thought extravagantly of the arrival of nora upon the scene she remained all sweetness to the old lady did you know he was here did you expect to meet him i seemed such a delightful coincidence in truth she was being subterraneously clever oh no i dont think so i didnt hear nora mention it of course she would have told me you know our coming to greece was such a surprise nora had an engagement in london at the folly theatre in fly by night but the manager was insufferable oh insufferable so of course nora wouldnt stand it a minute and then these newspaper people came along and asked her to go to greece for them and she accepted i am sure i never expected to find usawfleeing from the turks or i shouldnt have come mrs wainwright was gasping you dont mean that she is she is nora black the actress of course she is said the old lady jubilantly why how strange choked mrs wainwrignt nothing she knew of nora could account for her stupefaction and grief what happened glaringly to her was the duplicity of man coleman was a ribald deceiver he must have known and yet he had pretended throughout that the meeting was a pure accident she turned with a nervous impulse to sympathist with her daughter but despite the lovely tranquillity of the girls face there was something about her which forbade the mother to meddle anyhow mrs wainwright was sorry that she had told nice things of colemans behaviour so she said to the old lady young men of these times get a false age so quickly we have always thought it a great pity about mr coleman why how so asked the old lady oh really nothing only to us he seemed rather erprematurely experienced or something of that kind the old lady did not catch the meaning of the phrase she seemed surprised why ive never seen any fullgrown person in this world who got experience any too quick for his own good at the tail of the procession there was talk between the two students who had in charge the little grey horseone to lead and one to flog billie said one it now becomes necessary to lose this hobby into the hands of some of the other fellows whereby we will gain opportunity to pay homage to the great nora why you egregious thickhead this is the chance of a lifetime im damned if im going to tow this beast of burden much further you wouldnt stand a show said billie pessimistically look at coleman thats all right do you mean to say that you prefer to continue towing pack horses in the presence of this queen of song and the dance just because you think coleman can throw out his chest a little more than you not so think of your bright and sparkling youth theres coke and pete tounley near marjory well call em whereupon he set up a cry say you people were not getting a salary for this supposin you try for a time itll do you good when the two addressed bad halted to await the arrival of the little grey horse they took on glum expressions you look like poisoned pups said the student who led the horse too strong for light work grab onto the halter now peter and tow we are going ahead to talk to nora black good time youll have answered peter tounley coleman is cuttin up scandalous you wont stand a show what do you think of him said coke seems curious all round do you suppose he knew she would show up it was nervy to nervy to what asked billie well said coke seems to me he is playing both ends against the middle i dont know anything about nora black but the three other students expressed themselves with conviction and in chorus colemans all right well anyhow continued coke i dont see my way free to admiring him introducing nora black to the wainwrights he didnt said the others still in chorus queer game said peter tounley he seems to know her pretty well pretty damn well said billie anyhow hes a brick said peter tounley we mustnt forget that lo i begin to feel that our rufus is a fly guy of many different kinds any play that he is in commands my respect he wont be hit by a chimney in the daytime for unto him has come much wisdom i dont think ill worry is he stuck on nora black do you know asked billie one thing is plain replied coke she has got him somehow by the short hair and she intends him to holler murder anybody can see that well he wont holler murder said one of them with conviction ill bet you he wont hell hammer the warpost and beat the tomtom until he drops but he wont holler murder old mother wainwright will be in his wool presently quoth peter tounley musingly i could see it coming in her eye somebody has given his snap away or something aw he had no snap said billie couldnt you see how rattled he was he would have given a lac if dear nora hadnt turned up of course the others assented he was rattled looks queer and nasty said coke nora herself had an axe ready for him they began to laugh if she had had an umbrella she would have basted him over the head with it oh my he was green nevertheless said peter tounley i refuse to worry over our rufus when he cant take care of himself the rest of us want to hunt cover he is a fly guy coleman in the meantime had become aware that the light of mrs wainwrights countenance was turned from him the party stopped at a well and when he offered her a drink from his cup he thought she accepted it with scant thanks marjory was still gracious always gracious but this did not reassure him because he felt there was much unfathomable deception in it when he turned to seek consolation in the manner of the professor he found him as before stunned with surprise and the only idea he had was to be as tractable as a child when he returned to the head of the column nora again cantered forward to join him well me gay lochinvar she cried and has your disposition improved you are very fresh he said she laughed loud enough to be heard the full length of the caravan it was a beautiful laugh but full of insolence and confidence he flashed his eyes malignantly upon her but then she only laughed more she could see that he wished to strangle her what a disposition she said what a disposition you are not nearly so nice as your friends now they are charming but yourufus i wish you would get that temper mended dear rufus do it to please me you know you like to please me dont you now dear he finally laughed confound you nora i would like to kill you but at his laugh she was all sunshine it was as if she had been trying to taunt him into good humour with her aw now rufus dont be angry ill be good rufus really i will listen i want to tell you something do you know what i did well you know i never was cut out for this business and back there when you told me about the turks being near and all that sort of thing i was frightened almost to death really i was so when nobody was looking i sneaked two or three little drinks out of my flask two or three little drinks chapter xvi good god said coleman you dont mean nora smiled rosily at him oh im all right she answered dont worry about your aunt nora my precious boy not for a minute coleman was horrified but you are not going toyou are not going to not at all me son not at all she answered im not going to prance im going to be as nice as pie and just ride quietly along here with dear little rufus only you know what i can do when i get started so you had better be a very good boy i might take it into my head to say some things you know bound hand and foot at his stake he could not even chant his defiant torture song it might precipitate in fact he was sure it would precipitate the grand smash but to the very core of his soul he for the time hated nora black he did not dare to remind her that he would revenge himself he dared only to dream of this revenge but it fairly made his thoughts flame and deep in his throat he was swearing an inflexible persecution of nora black the old expression of his sex came to him oh if she were only a man she had been a man he would have fallen upon her tooth and nail her motives for all this impressed him not at all she was simply a witch who bound him helpless with the pwer of her femininity and made him eat cinders he was so sure that his face betrayed him that he did not dare let her see it well what are you going to do about it he asked over his shoulder ooh she drawled impudently nothing he could see that she was determined not to be confessed i may do this or i may do that it all depends upon your behaviour my dear rufus as they rode on he deliberated as to the best means of dealing with this condition suddenly he resolved to go with the whole tale direct to marjory and to this end he half wheeled his horse he would reiterate that he loved her and then explainexplain he groaned when he came to the word and ceased formulation the cavalcade reached at last the bank of the aracthus river with its lemon groves and lush grass a battery wheeled before them over the ancient bridgea flight of short broad cobbled steps up as far as the centre of the stream and a similar flight down to the other bank the returning aplomb of the travellers was well illustrated by the professor who upon sighting this bridge murmured byzantine this was the first indication that he had still within him a power to resume the normal the steep and narrow street was crowded with soldiers the smoky little coffee shops were ababble with people discussing the news from the front none seemed to heed the remarkable procession that wended its way to the cable office here coleman resolutely took precedence he knew that there was no good in expecting intelligence out of the chaotic clerks but he managed to get upon the wires this message eclipse new york got wainwright party all well coleman the students had struggled to send messages to their people in america but they had only succeeded in deepening the tragic boredom of the clerks when coleman returned to the street he thought that he had seldom looked upon a more moving spectacle than the wainwright party presented at that moment most of the students were seated in a row dejectedly upon the kerb the professor and mrs wainwright looked like two old pictures which after an existence in a considerate gloom had been brought out in their tawdriness to the clear light hot white dust covered everybody and from out the grimy faces the eyes blinked redfringed with sleeplessness desolation sat upon all save marjory she possessed some marvellous power of looking always fresh this quality had indeed impressed the old lady on the little pony until she had said to nora black that girl would look well anywhere nora black had not been amiable in her reply coleman called the professor and the dragoman for a durbar the dragoman said well i can get one carriage and we can go immediatelee carriage be blowed said coleman what these people need is rest sleep you must find a place at once these people cant remain in the street he spoke in anger as if he had previously told the dragoman and the latter had been inattentive the man immediately departed coleman remarked that there was no course but to remain in the street until his dragoman had found them a habitation it was a mournful waiting the students sat on the kerb once they whispered to coleman suggesting a drink but he told them that he knew only one cafe the entrance of which would be in plain sight of the rest of the party the ladies talked together in a group of four nora black was bursting with the fact that her servant had hired rooms in arta on their outcoming journey and she wished mrs wainwright and marjory to come to them at least for a time but she dared not risk a refusal and she felt something in mrs wainwrights manner which led her to be certain that such would be the answer to her invitation coleman and the professor strolled slowly up and down the walk well my work is over sir said coleman my paper told me to find you and through no virtue of my own i found you i am very glad of it i dont know of anything in my life that has given me greater pleasure the professor was himself again in so far as he had lost all manner of dependence but still he could not yet be bumptious mr coleman he said i am placed under lifelong obligation to you i am not thinking of myself so much my wife and daughter his gratitude was so genuine that he could not finish its expression oh dont speak of it said coleman i really didnt do anything at all the dragoman finally returned and led them all to a house which he had rented for gold in the great bare upper chamber the students dropped wearily to the floor while the woman of the house took the wainwrights to a more secluded apartment as the door closed on them coleman turned like a flash have a drink he said the students arose around him like the wave of a flood you bet in the absence of changes of clothing ordinary food the possibility of a bath and in the presence of great weariness and dust colemans whisky seemed to them a glistening luxury afterward they laid down as if to sleep but in reality they were too dirty and too fagged to sleep they simply lay murmuring peter tounley even developed a small fever it was at this time that coleman suddenly discovered his acute interest in the progressive troubles of his affair of the heart had placed the business of his newspaper in the rear of his mind the greater part of the next hour he spent in getting off to new york that dispatch which created so much excitement for him later afterward he was free to reflect moodily upon the ability of nora black to distress him she with her retinue had disappeared toward her own rooms at dusk he went into the street and was edified to see noras dragoman dodging along in his wake he thought that this was simply another manifestation of noras interest in his movements and so he turned a corner and there pausing waited until the dragoman spun around directly into his arms but it seemed that the man had a note to deliver and this was only his oriental way of doing it the note read come and dine with me tonight it was not a request it was peremptory all right he said scowling at the man he did not go at once for he wished to reflect for a time and find if he could not evolve some weapons of his own it seemed to him that all the others were liberally supplied with weapons a clear cold night had come upon the earth when he signified to the lurking dragoman that he was in readiness to depart with him to noras abode they passed finally into a dark courtyard up a winding staircase across an embowered balcony and coleman entered alone a room where there were lights his feet were scarcely over the threshold before he had concluded that the tigress was now going to try some velvet purring he noted that the arts of the stage had not been thought too cheaply obvious for use nora sat facing the door a bit of yellow silk had been twisted about the crude shape of the lamp and it made the play of light amberlike shadowy and yet perfectly clear the light which women love she was arrayed in a puzzling gown of that kind of grecian silk which is so docile that one can pull yards of it through a ring it was of the colour of new straw her chin was leaned pensively upon her palm and the light fell on a pearly rounded forearm she was looking at him with a pair of famous eyes azure perhapscertainly purple at timesand it may be black at odd momentsa pair of eyes that had made many an honest mans heart jump if he thought they were looking at him it was a vision yes but colemans cynical knowledge of drama overpowered his sense of its beauty he broke out brutally in the phrases of the american street your dragoman is a rubberneck if he keeps darking me i will simply have to kick the stuffing out of him she was alone in the room her old lady had been instructed to have a headache and send apologies she was not disturbed by colemans words sit down rufus and have a cigarette and dont be cross because i wont stand it he obeyed her glumly she had placed his chair where not a charm of her could be lost upon an observant man evidently she did not purpose to allow him to irritate her away from her original plan purring was now her method and none of his insolence could achieve a growl from the tigress she arose saying softly you look tired almost ill poor boy i will give you some brandy i have almost everything that i could think to make those daylight people buy with a sweep of her hand she indicated the astonishing opulence of the possessions in different parts of the room as she stood over him with the brandy there came through the smoke of his cigarette the perfume of orrisroot and violet a servant began to arrange the little cold dinner on a camp table and coleman saw with an enthusiasm which he could not fully master four quart bottles of a notable brand of champagne placed in a rank on the floor at dinner nora was sisterly she watched him waited upon him treated him to an affectionate inti macy for which he knew a thousand men who would have hated him the champagne was cold slowly he melted by the time that the boy came with little cups of turkish coffee he was at least amiable nora talked dreamily the dragoman says this room used to be part of the harem long ago she shot him a watchful glance as if she had expected the fact to affect him seems curious doesnt it a harem fancy that he smoked one cigar and then discarded tobacco for the perfume of orrisroot and violet was making him meditate nora talked on in a low voice she knew that through halfclosed lids he was looking at her in steady speculation she knew that she was conquering but no movement of hers betrayed an elation with the most exquisite art she aided his contemplation baring to him for instance the glories of a statuesque neck doing it all with the manner of a splendid and fabulous virgin who knew not that there was such a thing as shame her stockings were of black silk coleman presently answered her only in monosyllable making small distinction between yes and no he simply sat watching her with eyes in which there were two little covetous steelcoloured flames he was thinking to go to the devilto go to the devilto go to the devil with this girl is not a bad fatenot a bad fatenot a bad fate chapter xvii come out on the balcony cooed nora there are some funny old storks on top of some chimneys near here and they clatter like mad all day and night they moved together out to the balcony but nora retreated with a little cry when she felt the coldness of the night she said that she would get a cloak coleman was not unlike a man in a dream he walked to the rail of the balcony where a great vine climbed toward the roof he noted that it was dotted with blossoms which in the deep purple of the oriental night were coloured in strange shades of maroon this truth penetrated his abstraction until when nora came she found him staring at them as if their colour was a revelation which affected him vitally she moved to his side without sound and he first knew of her presence from the damning fragrance she spoke just above her breath its a beautiful evening yes he answered she was at his shoulder if he moved two inches he must come in contact they remained in silence leaning upon the rail finally he began to mutter some commonplaces which meant nothing particularly but into his tone as he mouthed them was the note of a forlorn and passionate lover then as if by accident he traversed the two inches and his shoulder was against the soft and yet firm shoulder of nora black there was something in his throat at this time which changed his voice into a mere choking noise she did not move he could see her eyes glowing innocently out of the pallour which the darkness gave to her face if he was touching her she did not seem to know it i am awfully tired said coleman thickly i think i will go home and turn in you must be poor boy said nora tenderly wouldnt you like a little more of that champagne well i dont mind another glass she left him again and his galloping thought pounded to the old refrain to go to the devilto go to the devilto go to the devil with this girl is not a bad fatenot a bad fatenot a bad fate when she returned he drank his glass of champagne then he mumbled you must be cold let me put your cape around you better it wont do to catch cold here you know she made a sweet pretence of rendering herself to his care oh thanks i am not really cold there thats better of course all his manipulation of the cloak had been a fervid caress and although her acting up to this point had remained in the role of the splendid and fabulous virgin she now turned her liquid eyes to his with a look that expressed knowledge triumph and delight she was sure of her victory and she said sweetheart dont you think i am as nice as marjory the impulse had been airily confident it was as if the silken cords had been parted by the sweep of a sword colemans face had instantly stiffened and he looked like a man suddenly recalled to the ways of light it may easily have been that in a moment he would have lapsed again to his luxurious dreaming but in his face the girl had read a fatal character to her blunder and her resentment against him took precedence of any other emotion she wheeled abruptly from him and said with great contempt rufus you had better go home youre tired and sleepy and more or less drunk he knew that the grand tumble of all their little embowered incident could be neither stayed or mended yes he answered sulkily i think so too they shook hands huffily and he went away when he arrived among the students he found that they had appropriated everything of his which would conduce to their comfort he was furious over it but to his bitter speeches they replied in jibes rufus is himself again admire his angelic disposition see him smile gentle soul a sleepy voice said from a comer i know what pinches him what asked several hes been to see nora and she flung him out bodily yes sneered coleman at times i seem to see in you coke the fermentation of some primeval form of sensation as if it were possible for you to develop a mind in two or three thousand years and then at other times you appear much as you are now as soon as they had well measured colemans temper all of the students save coke kept their mouths tightly closed coke either did not understand or his mood was too vindictive for silence well i know you got a throwdown all right he muttered and how would you know when i got a throw down you pimply milkfed sophomore the others perked up their ears in mirthful appreciation of this language of course continued coleman no one would protest against your continued existence coke unless you insist on recalling yourself violently to peoples attention in this way the mere fact of your living would not usually be offensive to people if you werent eternally turning a sort of calcium light on your prehensile attributes coke was suddenly angry angry much like a peasant and his anger first evinced itself in a mere sputtering and spluttering finally he got out a rather long speech full of grumbling noises but he was understood by all to declare that his prehensile attributes had not led him to cart a notorious woman about the world with him when they quickly looked at coleman they saw that he was livid you but of course there immediately arose all sorts of protesting cries from the seven noncombatants coleman as he took two strides toward cokes corner looked fully able to break him across his knee but for this coke did not seem to care at all he was on his feet with a challenge in his eye upon each cheek burned a sudden hectic spot the others were clamouring oh say this wont do quit it oh we mustnt have a fight he didnt mean it coleman peter tounley pressed coke to the wall saying you damned young jackass be quiet they were in the midst of these festivities when a door opened and disclosed the professor he might have been coming into the middle of a row in one of the corridors of the college at home only this time he carried a candle his speech however was a washurst speech gentlemen gentlemen what does this mean all seemed to expect coleman to make the answer he was suddenly very cool nothing professor he said only that thisonly that coke has insulted me i suppose that it was only the irresponsibility of a boy and i beg that you will not trouble over it mr coke said the professor indignantly what have you to say to this evidently he could not clearly see coke and he peered around his candle at where the virtuous peter tounley was expostulating with the young man the figures of all the excited group moving in the candle light caused vast and uncouth shadows to have conflicts in the end of the room peter tounleys task was not light and beyond that he had the conviction that his struggle with coke was making him also to appear as a rowdy this conviction was proven to be true by a sudden thunder from the old professor mr tounley desist in wrath he desisted and coke flung himself forward he paid less attention to the professor than if the latter had been a jackrabbit you say i insulted you he shouted crazily in colemans face well i meant to do you see coleman was glacial and lofty beyond everything i am glad to have you admit the truth of what i have said coke was still suffocating with his peasant rage which would not allow him to meet the clear calm expressions of coleman yes i insulted you i insulted you because what i said was correct my prehensile attributes yes but i have never he was interrupted by a chorus from the other students oh no that wont do dont say that dont repeat that coke coleman remembered the weak bewilderment of the little professor in hours that had not long passed and it was with something of an impersonal satisfaction that he said to himself the old boys got his warpaint on again the professor had stepped sharply up to coke and looked at him with eyes that seemed to throw out flame and heat there was a moments pause and then the old scholar spoke biting his words as if they were each a short section of steel wire mr coke your behaviour will end your college career abruptly and in gloom i promise you you have been drinking coke his head simply floating in a sea of universal defiance at once blurted out yes sir you have been drinking cried the professor ferociously retire to yourretire to yourretire and then in a voice of thunder he shouted retire whereupon seven hoodlum students waited a decent moment then shrieked with laughter but the old professor would have none of their nonsense he quelled them all with force and finish coleman now spoke a few words professor i cant tell you how sorry i am that i should be concerned in any such riot as this and since we are doomed to be bound so closely into each others society i offer myself without reservation as being willing to repair the damage as well as may be done i don t see how i can forget at once that cokes conduct was insolently unwarranted but if he has anything to sayof a nature that might heal the breach i would be willing to to meet him in the openest manner as he made these remarks colemans dignity was something grand and morever there was now upon his face that curious look of temperance and purity which had been noted in new york as a singular physical characteristic if he was guilty of anything in this affair at allin fact if he had ever at any time been guilty of anythingno mark had come to stain that bloom of innocence the professor nodded in the fullest appreciation and sympathy of course really there is no other sleeping placei suppose it would be better then he again attacked coke young man you have chosen an unfortunate moment to fill us with a suspicion that you may not be a gentleman for the time there is nothing to be done with you he addressed the other students there is nothing for me to do young gentleman but to leave mr coke in your care goodnight sirs goodnight coleman he left the room with his candle when coke was bade to retire he had of course simply retreated fuming to a corner of the room where he remained looking with yellow eyes like an animal from a cave when the others were able to see through the haze of mental confusion they found that coleman was with deliberation taking off his boots afterward when he removed his waistcoat he took great care to wind his large gold watch the students much subdued lay again in their places and when there was any talking it was of an extremely local nature referring principally to the floor as being unsuitable for beds and also referring from time to time to a real or an alleged selfishness on the part of some one of the recumbent men soon there was only the sound of heavy breathing when the professor had returned to what he called the wainwright part of the house he was greeted instantly with the question what was it his wife and daughter were up in alarm what was it they repeated wildly he was peevish oh nothing nothing but that young coke is a regular ruffian he had gotten him self into some tremendous uproar with coleman when i arrived he seemed actually trying to assault him revolting he had been drinking colemans behaviour i must say was splendid recognised at once the delicacy of my positionhe not being a student if i had found him in the wrong it would have been simpler than finding him in the right confound that rascal of a coke then as he began a partial disrobing he treated them to grunted scrap of information coke was quite insane i feared that i couldnt control him coleman was like ice and as much as i have seen to admire in him during the last few days this quiet beat it all if he had not recognised my helplessness as far as he was concerned the whole thing might have been a most miserable business he is a very fine young man the dissenting voice to this last tribute was the voice of mrs wainwright she said well coleman drinks tooeverybody knows that i know responded the professor rather bashfully but i am confident that he had not touched a drop marjory said nothing the earlier artillery battles had frightened most of the furniture out of the houses of arta and there was left in this room only a few old red cushions and the wainwrights were camping upon the floor marjory was enwrapped in colemans macintosh and while the professor and his wife maintained some low talk of the recent incident she in silence had turned her cheek into the yellow velvet collar of the coat she felt something against her bosom and putting her hand carefully into the top pocket of the coat she found three cigars these she took in the darkness and laid aside telling herself to remember their position in the morning she had no doubt that coleman would rejoice over them before he could get back to athens where there were other good cigars chapter xviii the ladies of the wainwright party had not complained at all when deprived of even such civilised advantages as a shelter and a knife and fork and soap and water but mrs wainwright complained bitterly amid the halfcivilisation of arta she could see here no excuse for the absence of several hundred things which she had always regarded as essential to life she began at a m to make both the professor and marjory woeful with an endless dissertation upon the beds in the hotel at athens of course she had not regarded them at the time as being exceptional beds that was quite true but then one really never knew what one was really missing until one really missed it she would never have thought that she would come to consider those athenian beds as excellent but experience is a great teacher makesone reflect upon the people who year in and year out have no beds at all poor things well it made one glad if one did have a good bed even if it was at the time on the other side of the world if she ever reached it she did not know what could ever induce her to leave it again she would never be induced induced snarled the professor the word represented to him a practiced feminine misusage of truth and at such his white warlock always arose induced out of four american women i have seen lately you seem to be the only one who would say that you had endured this thing because you had been induced by others to come over here how absurd mrs wainwright fixed her husband with a steely eye she saw opportunity for a shattering retort you dont mean harrison to include marjory and i in the same breath with those two women the professor saw no danger ahead for himself he merely answered i had no thought either way it did not seem important well it is important snapped mrs wainwright do you know that you are speaking in the same breath of marjory and nora black the actress no said the professor is that so he was astonished but he was not aghast at all do you mean to say that is nora black the comic opera star thats exactly who she is said mrs wainwright dramatically and i consider thati consider that rufus coleman has done no less thanmisled us this last declaration seemed to have no effect upon the professors pure astonishment but marjory looked at her mother suddenly however she said no word exhibiting again that strange and inscrutable countenance which masked even the tiniest of her maidenly emotions mrs wainwright was triumphant and she immediately set about celebrating her victory men never see those things she said to her husband men never see those things you would have gone on forever without finding out that youryourhospitality was being abused by that rufus coleman the professor woke up hospitality he said indignantly hospitality i have not had any hospitality to be abused why dont you talk sense it is not that butit might he hesitated and then spoke slowly it might be very awkward of course one never knows anything definite about such people but i suppose anyhow it was strange in coleman to allow her to meet us it was all a prearranged plan announced the triumphant mrs wainwright she came here on putpose to meet rufus coleman and he knew it and i should not wonder if they had not the exact spot picked out where they were going to meet i can hardly believe that said the professor in distress i can hardly believe that it does not seem to me that coleman oh yes your dear rufus coleman cried mrs wainwright you think he is very fine now but i can remember when you didnt think and the parents turned together an abashed look at their daughter the professor actually flushed with shame it seemed to him that he had just committed an atrocity upon the heart of his child the instinct of each of them was to go to her and console her in their arms she noted it immediately and seemed to fear it she spoke in a clear and even voice i dont think father that you should distress me by supposing that i am concerned at all if mr coleman cares to get nora black over here not at all stuttered the professor i mrs wainwrights consternation turned suddenly to anger he is a scapegrace a rascal a a oh said marjory coolly i dont see why it isnt his own affair he didnt really present her to you mother you remember she seemed quite to force her way at first and then youyou did the rest it should be very easy to avoid her now that we are out of the wilderness and then it becomes a private matter of mr colemans for my part i rather liked her i dont see such a dreadful calamity marjory screamed her mother how dreadful liked her dont let me hear you say such shocking things i fail to see anything shocking answered marjory stolidly the professor was looking helplessly from his daughter to his wife and from his wife to his daughter like a man who was convinced that his troubles would never end this new catastrophe created a different kind of difficulty but he considered that the difficulties were as robust as had been the preceding ones he put on his hat and went out of the room he felt an impossibility of saying anything to coleman but he felt that he must look upon him he must look upon this man and try to know from his manner the measure of guilt and incidentally he longed for the machinery of a finished society which prevents its parts from clashing prevents it with its great series of i law upon law easily operative but relentless here he felt as a man flung into the jungle with his wife and daughter where they could become the victims of any sort of savagery his thought referred once more to what he considered the invaluable services of coleman and as he observed them in conjunction with the present accusation he was simply dazed it was then possible that one man could play two such divergent parts he had not learned this at washurst but no the world was not such a bed of putrefaction he would not believe it he would not believe it after adventures which require great nervous en durance it is only upon the second or third night that the common man sleeps hard the students had expected to slumber like dogs on the first night after their trials but none slept long and few slept coleman was the first man to arise when he left the room the students were just beginning to blink he took his dragoman among the shops and he bought there all the little odds and ends which might go to make up the best breakfast in arta if he had had news of certain talk he probably would not have been buying breakfast for eleven people instead he would have been buying breakfast for one during his absence the students arose and performed their frugal toilets considerable attention was paid to coke by the others he made a monkey of you said peter tounley with unction he twisted you until you looked like a wet grey rag you had better leave this wise guy alone it was not the night nor was it meditation that had taught coke anything but he seemed to have learned something from the mere lapse of time in appearance he was subdued but he managed to make a temporary jauntiness as he said oh i dont know well you ought to know said he who was called billie you ought to know you made an egregious snark of yourself indeed you sometimes resembled a boojum anyhow you were a plain chump you exploded your face about something of which you knew nothing and im damned if i believe youd make even a good retriever youre a halfbred waterspaniel blurted peter tounley and he added musingly that is a pretty low animal coke was argumentative why am i he asked turning his head from side to side i dont see where i was so wrong oh dances balloons picnics parades and ascensions they retorted profanely you swam voluntarily into water that was too deep for you swim out get dry heres a towel coke smitten in the face with a wet cloth rolled into a ball grabbed it and flung it futilely at a welldodging companion no he cried i dont see it now look here i dont see why we shouldnt all resent this nora black business one student said well whats the matter with nora b lack anyhow another student said i dont see how youve been issued any license to say things about nora black another student said dubiously well he knows her well and then three or four spoke at once he was very badly rattled when she appeared upon the scene peter tounley asked well which of you people know anything wrong about nora black there was a pause and then coke said oh of coursei dont knowbut he who was called billie then addressed his companions it wouldnt be right to repeat any old lie about nora black and by the same token it wouldnt be right to see old mother wainwright chummin with her there is no wisdom in going further than that old mother wainwright dont know that her fair companion of yesterday is the famous comic opera star for my part i believe that coleman is simply afraid to tell her i dont think he wished to see nora black yesterday any more than he wished to see the devil the discussion as i understand itconcerned itself only with what coleman had to do with the thing and yesterday anybody could see that he was in a panic they heard a step on the stair and directly coleman entered followed by his dragoman they were laden with the raw material for breakfast the correspondent looked keenly among the students for it was plain that they had been talking of him it filled him with rage and for a stifling moment he could not think why he failed to immediately decamp in chagrin and leave eleven orphans to whatever fate their general incompetence might lead them it struck him as a deep shame that even then he and his paid man were carrying in the breakfast he wanted to fling it all on the floor and walk out then he remembered marjory she was the reason she was the reason for everything but he could not repress certain of his thoughts say you people he said icily you had better soon learn to hustle for yourselves i may be a dragoman and a butler and a cook and a housemaid but im blowed if im a wet nurse in reality he had taken the most generous pleasure in working for the others before their eyes had even been opened from sleep but it was now all turned to wormwood it is certain that even this could not have deviated this executive man from labour and management because these were his life but he felt that he was about to walk out of the room consigning them all to hades his glance of angry reproach fastened itself mainly upon peter tounley because he knew that of all peter was the most innocent peter tounley was abashed by this glance so youve brought us something to eat old man that is tremendously nice of youweappreciate it like everything coleman was mollified by peters tone peter had had that emotion which is equivalent to a sense of guilt although in reality he was speckless two or three of the other students bobbed up to a sense of the situation they ran to coleman and with polite cries took his provisions from him one dropped a bunch of lettuce on the floor and others reproached him with scholastic curses coke was seated near the window half militant half conciliatory it was impossible for him to keep up a manner of deadly enmity while coleman was bringing in his breakfast he would have much preferred that coleman had not brought in his breakfast he would have much preferred to have foregone breakfast altogether he would have much preferred anything there seemed to be a conspiracy of circumstance to put him in the wrong and make him appear as a ridiculous young peasant he was the victim of a benefaction and he hated coleman harder now than at any previous time he saw that if he stalked out and took his breakfast alone in a cafe the others would consider him still more of an outsider coleman had expressed himself like a man of the world and a gentleman and coke was convinced that he was a superior man of the world and a superior gentleman but that he simply had not had words to express his position at the proper time coleman was glib therefore coke had been the victim of an attitude as well as of a benefaction and so he deeply hated coleman the others were talking cheerfully what the deuce are these coleman sausages oh my and look at these burlesque fishes say these greeks dont care what they eat them thar things am sardines in the crude state no great god look at those things look what yes they are radishes greek synonym for radishes the professor entered oh he said apologetically as if he were intruding in a boudoir all his serious desire to probe coleman to the bottom ended in embarrassment mayhap it was not a law of feeling but it happened at any rate he had come in a puzzled frame of mind even an accusative frame of mind and almost immediately he found himself suffer ing like a culprit before his judge it is a phenomenon of what we call guilt and innocence coleman welcomed him cordially well professor goodmorning ive rounded up some things that at least may be eaten you are very good very considerate mr coleman answered the professor hastily iam sure we are much indebted to you he had scanned the correspondents face land it had been so devoid of guile that he was fearful that his suspicion a base suspicion of this noble soul would be detected no no we can never thank you enough some of the students began to caper with a sort of decorous hilarity before their teacher look at the sausage professor did you ever see such sausage isnt it salubrious and see these other things sir arent they curious i shouldnt wonder if they were alive turnips sir no sir i think they are pharisees i have seen a pharisee look like a pelican but i have never seen a pharisee look like a turnip so i think these turnips must be pharisees sir yes they may be walrus were not sure anyhow their angles are geometrically all wrong peter look out some green stuff was flung across the room the professor laughed coleman laughed despite coke darkbrowed sulking and yet desirous of reinstating himself the room had waxed warm with the old college feeling the feeling of lads who seemed never to treat anything respectfully and yet at the same time managed to treat the real things with respect the professor himself contributed to their wild carouse over the strange greek viands it was a vivacious moment common to this class in times of relaxation and it was understood perfectly coke arose i dont see that i have any friends here he said hoarsely and in consequence i dont see why i should remain here all looked at him at the same moment mrs wainwright and marjory entered the room chapter xix goodmorning said mrs wainwright jovially to the students and then she stared at coleman as if he were a sweep at a wedding goodmorning said marjory coleman and the students made reply goodmorning goodmorning goodmorning goodmorning it was curious to see this greeting this common phrase this bit of old ware this antique come upon a dramatic scene and pulverise it nothing remained but a ridiculous dust coke glowering with his lips still trembling from heroic speech was an angry clown a pantaloon in rage nothing was to be done to keep him from looking like an ass he strode toward the door mumbling about a walk before breakfast mrs wainwright beamed upon him why mr coke not before breakfast you surely wont have time it was grim punishment he appeared to go blind and he fairly staggered out of the door mumbling again mumbling thanks or apologies or explanations about the mouth of coleman played a sinister smile the professor cast upon his wife a glance expressing weariness it was as if he said there you go again you cant keep your foot out of it she understood the glance and so she asked blankly why whats the matter oh her belated mind grasped that it waw an aftermath of the quarrel of coleman and coke marjory looked as if she was distressed in the belief that her mother had been stupid coleman was outwardly serene it was peter tounley who finally laughed a cheery healthy laugh and they all looked at him with gratitude as if his sudden mirth had been a real statement or reconciliation and consequent peace the dragoman and others disported themselves until a breakfast was laid upon the floor the adventurers squatted upon the floor they made a large company the professor and coleman discussed the means of getting to athens peter tounley sat next to marjory peter she said privately what was all this trouble between coleman and coke peter answered blandly oh nothing at nothing at all well but she persisted what was the cause of it he looked at her quaintly he was not one of those in love with her but be was interested in the affair dont you know he asked she understood from his manner that she had been some kind of an issue in the quarrel no she answered hastily i dont oh i dont mean that said peter i only meant i only meant oh well it was nothingreally it must have been about something continued marjory she continued because peter had denied that she was concerned in it whose fault i really dont know it was all rather confusing lied peter tranquilly coleman and the professor decided to accept a plan of the correspondents dragoman to start soon on the first stage of the journey to athens the dragoman had said that he had found two large carriages rentable coke the outcast walked alone in the narrow streets the flight of the crown princes army from larissa had just been announced in arta but coke was probably the most woebegone object on the greek peninsula he encountered a strange sight on the streets a woman garbed in the style for walking of an afternoon on upper broadway was approaching him through a mass of kilted mountaineers and soldiers in soiled overcoats of course he recognised nora black in his conviction that everybody in the world was at this time considering him a mere worm he was sure that she would not heed him beyond that he had been presented to her notice in but a transient and cursory fashion but contrary to his conviction she turned a radiant smile upon him oh she said brusquely you are one of the students good morning in her manner was all the confidence of an old warrior a veteran who addresses the universe with assurance because of his past battles coke grinned at this strange greeting yes miss black he answered i am one of the students she did not seem to quite know how to formulate her next speech eri suppose youre going to athens at once you must be glad after your horrid experiences i believe they are going to start for athens today said coke nora was all attention they she repeated arent you going with them well he said well she saw of course that there had been some kind of trouble she laughed you look as if somebody had kicked you down stairs she said candidly she at once assumed an intimate manner toward him which was like a temporary motherhood come walk with me and tell me all about it there was in her tone a most artistic suggestion that whatever had happened she was on his side he was not loath the street was full of soldiers whose tongues clattered so loudly that the two foreigners might have been wandering in a great cave of the winds well what was the row about asked nora and who was in it it would have been no solace to coke to pour out his tale even if it had been a story that he could have told nora he was not stopped by the fact that he had gotten himself in the quarrel because he had insulted the name of the girt at his side he did not think of it at that time the whole thing was now extremely vague in outline to him and he only had a dull feeling of misery and loneliness he wanted her to cheer him nora laughed again why youre a regular little kid do you mean to say youve come out here sulking alone because of some nursery quarrel he was ruffled by her manner it did not contain the cheering he required oh i dont know that im such a regular little kid he said sullenly the quarrel was not a nursery quarrel why dont you challenge him to a duel asked nora suddenly she was watching him closely who said coke coleman you stupid answered nora they stared at each other coke paying her first the tribute of astonishment and then the tribute of admiration why how did you guess that he demanded oh said nora ive known rufus coleman for years and he is always rowing with people that is just it cried coke eagerly that is just it i fairly hate the man almost all of the other fellows will stand his abuse but it riles me i tell you i think he is a beast and of course if you seriously meant what you said about challenging him to a duel i mean if there is any sense in that sort of thingi would challenge coleman i swear i would i think hes a great bluffer anyhow shouldnt wonder if he would back out really i shouldnt nora smiled humourously at a house on her side of the narrow way i wouldnt wonder if he did either she answered after a time she said well do you mean to say that you have definitely shaken them arent you going back to athens with them or anything ii dont see how i can he said morosely oh she said she reflected for a time at last she turned to him archly and asked some words over a lady coke looked at her blankly he suddenly remembered the horrible facts nononot over a lady my dear boy you are a liar said nora freely you are a little unskilful liar it was some words over a lady and the ladys name is marjory wainwright coke felt as though he had suddenly been let out of a cell but he continued a mechanical denial no no it wasnt truly upon my word nonsense said nora i know better dont you think you can fool me you little cub i know youre in love with marjory wainwright and you think coleman is your rival what a blockhead you are cant you understand that people see these things well stammered coke nonsense said nora again dont try to fool me you may as well understand that its useless i am too wise well stammered coke go ahead urged nora tell me about it have it out he began with great importance and solemnity now to tell you the truth that is why i hate him i hate him like anything i cant see why everybody admires him so i dont see anything to him myself i dont believe hes got any more principle than a wolf i wouldnt trust him with two dollars why i know stories about him that would make your hair curl when i think of a girl like marjory his speech had become a torrent but here nora raised her hand oh oh oh that will do that will do dont lose your senses i dont see why this girl marjory is any too good she is no chicken ill bet dont let yourself get fooled with that sort of thing coke was unaware of his incautious expressions he floundered on while nora looked at him as if she wanted to wring his neck noshes too fine and too goodfor him or anybody like himshes too fine and too good aw rats interrupted nora furiously you make me tired coke had a woodenheaded conviction that he must make nora understand marjorys infinite superiority to all others of her sex and so he passed into a pariegyric each word of which was a hot coal to the girl addressed nothing would stop him apparently he even made the most stupid repetitions nora finally stamped her foot formidably will you stop will you stop she said through her clenched teeth do you think i want to listen to your everlasting twaddle about her why shesshes no better than other people you ignorant little mammas boy shes no better than other people you swab coke looked at her with the eyes of a fish he did not understand but she is better than other people he persisted nora seemed to decide suddenly that there would be no accomplishment in flying desperately against this rockwalled conviction oh well she said with marvellous good nature perhaps you are right numbskull but look here do you think she cares for him in his heart his jealous heart he believed that marjory loved coleman but he reiterated eternally to himself that it was not true as for speaking it to another that was out of the question no he said stoutly she doesnt care a snap for him if he had admitted it it would have seemed to him that he was somehow advancing colemans chances oh she doesnt eh said nora enigmatically she doesnt he studied her face with an abrupt miserable suspicion but he repeated doggedly no she doesnt ahem replied nora why shes set her cap for him all right shes after him for certain its as plain as day cant you see that stupidity no he said hoarsely you are a fool said nora it isnt coleman thats after her it is she that is after coleman coke was mulish no such thing colemans crazy about her everybody has known it ever since he was in college you ask any of the other fellows nora was now very serious almost doleful she remained still for a time casting at coke little glances of hatred i dont see my way clear to ask any of the other fellows she said at last with considerable bitterness im not in the habit of conducting such enquiries coke felt now that he disliked her and he read plainly her dislike of him if they were the two villains of the play they were not having fun together at all each had some kind of a deep knowledge that their aspirations far from colliding were of such character that the success of one would mean at least assistance to the other but neither could see how to confess if pethapt it was from shame perhaps it was because nora thought coke to have little wit perhaps it was because coke thought nora to have little conscience their talk was mainly rudderless from time to time nora had an inspiration to come boldly at the point but this inspiration was commonly defeated by some extraordinary manifestation of cokes incapacity to her mind then it seemed like a proposition to ally herself to a butcherboy in a matter purely sentimental she wondered indignantly how she was going to conspire with this lad who puffed out his infantile cheeks in order to conceitedly demonstrate that he did not understand the game at all she hated marjory for it evidently it was only the weaklings who fell in love with that girl coleman was an exception but then coleman was misled by extraordinary artifices she meditatecf for a moment if she should tell coke to go home and not bother her what at last decided the question was his unhappiness shd clung to this unhappiness for its value as it stood alone and because its reason for existence was related to her own unhappiness you say you are not going back toathens with your party i dont suppose youre going to stay here im going back to athens today i came up here to see a battle but it doesnt seem that there are to be any more battles the fighting will now all be on the other side ofthe mountains apparent she had learned in some haphazard way that the greek peninsula was divided by a spine of almost inaccessible mountains and the war was thus split into two simultaneous campaigns the arta campaign was known to be ended if you want to go back to athens without consorting with your friends you had better go back with me i can take you in my carriage as far as the beginning of the railroad dont you worry youve got money enough havent you the professor isnt keeping your money yes he said slowly ive got money enough he was apparently dubious over the proposal in their abstracted walk they had arrived in front of the house occupied by coleman and the wainwright party two carriages forlorn in dusty age stood before the door men were carrying out new leather luggage and flinging it into the traps amid a great deal of talk which seemed to refer to nothing nora and coke stood looking at the scene without either thinking of the importance of running away when out tumbled seven students followed immediately but in more decorous fashion by the wainwrights and coleman some student set up a whoop oh there he is theres coke hey coke where you been here he is professor for a moment after the hoodlum had subsided the two camps stared at each other in silence chapter xx nora and coke were an odd looking pair at the time they stood indeed as if rooted to the spot staring vacuously like two villagers at the surprising travellers it was not an eternity before the practiced girl of the stage recovered her poise but to the end of the incident the green youth looked like a culprit and a fool mrs wainwrights glower of offensive incredulity was a masterpiece marjory nodded pleasantly the professor nodded the seven students clambered boisterously into the forward carriage making it clang with noise like a rooks nest they shouted to coke come on all aboard come on cokewere off hey there cokey hurry up the professor as soon as he had seated himself on the forward seat of the second carriage turned in cokes general direction and asked formally mr coke you are coming with us he felt seemingly much in doubt as to the propriety of abandoning the headstrong young man and this doubt was not at all decreased by cokes appearance with nora black as far as he could tell any assertion of authority on his part would end only in a scene in which coke would probably insult him with some gross violation of collegiate conduct as at first the young man made no reply the professor after waiting spoke again you understand mr coke that if you separate yourself from the party you encounter my strongest disapproval and if i did not feel responsible to the college and your father for your safe journey to new york ii dont know but what i would have you expelled by cable if that were possible although coke had been silent and nora black had had the appearance of being silent in reality she had lowered her chin and whispered sideways and swiftly she had said now heres your time decide quickly and dont look such a wooden indian coke pulled himself together with a visible effort and spoke to the professor from an inspiration in which he had no faith i understand my duties to you sir perfectly i also understand my duty to the college but i fail to see where either of these obligations require me to accept the introduction of objectionable people into the party if i owe a duty to the college and to you i dont owe any to coleman and as i understand it coleman was not in the original plan of this expedition if such had been the case i would not have been here i cant tell what the college may see fit to do but as for my father i i have no doubt of how he will view it the first one to be electrified by the speech was coke himself he saw with a kind of subconscious amazement this volley of birdshot take effect upon the face of the old professor the face of marjory flushed crimson as if her mind had sprung to a fear that if coke could develop ability in this singular fashion he might succeed in humiliating her father in the street in the presence of the seven students her mother coleman andherself she had felt the birdshot sting her father when coke had launched forth coleman with his legs stretched far apart had just struck a match on the wall of the house and was about to light a cigar his groom was leading up his horse he saw the value of cokes argument more appreciatively and sooner perhaps than did coke the match dropped from his fingers and in the white sunshine and still air it burnt on the pavement orange coloured and with langour coleman held his cigar with all five fingersin a manner out of all the laws of smoking he turned toward coke there was danger in the moment but then in a flash it came upon him that his role was not of squabbling with coke far less of punching him on the contrary he was to act the part of a cool and instructed man who refused to be waylaid into foolishness by the outcries of this pouting youngster and who placed himself in complete deference to the wishes of the professor before the professor had time to embark upon any reply to coke coleman was at the side of the carriage and with a fine assumption of distress was saying professor i could very easily ride back to agrinion alone it would be all right i dont want to to his surprise the professor waved at him to be silent as if he were a mere child the old mans face was set with the resolution of exactly what hewas going to say to coke he began in measured tone speaking with feeling but with no trace of anger mr coke it has probably escaped your attention that mr coleman at what i consider a great deal of peril to himself came out to rescue this partyyou and othersand although he studiously disclaims all merit in his finding us and bringing us in i do not regard it in that way and i am surprised that any member of this party should conduct himself in this manner toward a man who has been most devotedly and generously at our service it was at this time that the professor raised himself and shook his finger at coke his voice now ringing with scorn in such moments words came to him and formed themselves into sentences almost too rapidly for him to speak them you are one of the most remarkable products of our civilisation which i have yet come upon what do you mean sir where are your senses do you think that all this pulling and pucking is manhood i will tell you what i will do with you i thought i brought out eight students to greece but when i find that i brought out seven students and er an ourangoutang dont get angry sir i dont care for your anger i say when i discover this i am naturally puzzled for a moment i will leave you to the judgment of your peers young gentlemen of the seven heads of the forward carriage none had to be turned all had been turned since the beginning of the talk if the professors speech had been delivered in one of the classrooms of washurst they would have glowed with delight over the butchery of coke but they felt its portentous aspect butchery here in greece thousands of miles from home presented to them more of the emphasis of downright death and destruction the professor called out young gentlemen i have done all that i can do without using force which much to my regret is impracticable if you will persuade your fellow student to accompany you i think our consciences will be the better for not having left a weak minded brother alone among the bypaths the valuable aggregation of intelligence and refinement which decorated the interior of the first carriage did not hesitate over answering this appeal in fact his fellow students had worried among themselves over coke and their desire to see him come out of his troubles in fair condition was intensified by the fact that they had lately concentrated much thought upon him there was a somewhat comic pretense of speaking so that only coke could hear their chorus was law sung oh cheese it coke let up on yourself you blind ass wait till you get to athens and then go and act like a monkey all this is no good the advice which came from the carriage was all in one direction and there was so much of it that the hum of voices sounded like a wind blowing through a forest coke spun suddenly and said something to nora black nora laughed rather loudly and then the two turned squarely and the wainwright party contemplated what were surely at that time the two most insolent backs in the world the professor looked as if he might be going to have a fit mrs wainwright lifted her eyes toward heaven and flinging out her trembling hands cried oh what an outrage what an outrage that minx the concensus of opinion in the first carriage was perfectly expressed by peter tounley who with a deep drawn breath said well im damned marjory had moaned and lowered her head as from a sense of complete personal shame coleman lit his cigar and mounted his horse well i suppose there is nothing for it but to be off professor his tone was full of regret with sort of poetic regret for a moment the professor looked at him blankly and then gradually recovered part of his usual manner yes he said sadly there is nothing for it but to go on at a word from the dragoman the two impatient drivers spoke gutturally to their horses and the carriages whirled out of arta coleman his dragoman and the groom trotted in the dust from the wheels of the wainwright carriage the correspondent always found his reflective faculties improved by the constant pounding of a horse on the trot and he was not sorry to have now a period for reflection as well as this artificial stimulant as he viewed the game he had in his hand about all the cards that were valuable in fact he considered that the only ace against him was mrs wainwright he had always regarded her as a stupid person concealing herself behind a mass of trivialities which were all conventional but he thought now that the more stupid she was and the more conventional in her triviality the more she approached to being the very ace of trumps itself she was just the sort of a card that would come upon the table mid the neat play of experts and by some inexplicable arrangement of circumstance lose a whole game for the wrong man after mrs wainwright he worried over the students he believed them to be reasonable enough in fact he honoured them distinctly in regard to their powers of reason but he knew that people generally hated a row it put them off their balance made them sweat over a lot of pros and cons and prevented them from thinking for a time at least only of themselves then they came to resent the principals in a row of course the principal who was thought to be in the wrong was the most rescnted but coleman believed that after all people always came to resent the other principal or at least be impatient and suspicious of him if he was a correct person why was he in a row at all the principal who had been in the right often brought this impatience and suspicion upon himself no doubt by never letting the matter end continuing to yawp about his virtuous suffering and not allowing people to return to the steady contemplation of their own affairs as a precautionary measure he decided to say nothing at all about the late trouble unless some one addressed him upon it even then he would be serenely laconic he felt that he must be popular with the seven students in the first place it was nice that in the presence of marjory they should like him and in the second place he feared to displease them as a body because he believed that he had some dignity hoodlums are seldom dangerous to other hoodlums but if they catch pomposity alone in the field pomposity is their prey they tear him to mere bloody ribbons amid heartless shrieks when coleman put himself on the same basis with the students he could cope with them easily but he did not want the wild pack after him when marjory could see the chase and so be reasoned that his best attitude was to be one of rather taciturn serenity on the hard military road the hoofs of the horses made such clatter that it was practically impossible to hold talk between the carriages and the horsemen without all parties bellowing the professor however strove to overcome the difficulties he was apparently undergoing a great amiability toward coleman frequently he turned with a bright face and pointing to some object in the landscape obviously tried to convey something entertaining to colemans mind coleman could see his lips mouth the words he always nodded cheerily in answer and yelled the road ultimately became that straight lancehandle which colemanit seemed as if many years had passedhad traversed with his dragoman and the funny little carriers he was fixing in his mind a possible story to the wainwrights about the snake and his first dead turk but suddenly the carriages left this road and began a circuit of the gulf of arta winding about an endless series of promontories the journey developed into an excess of dust whirling from a road which half circled the waist of cape after cape all dramatics were lost in the rumble of wheels and in the click of hoofs they passed a little soldier leading a prisoner by a string they passed more frightened peasants who seemed resolved to flee down into the very boots of greece and people looked at them with scowls envying them their speed at the little town from which coleman embarked at one stage of the upward journey they found crowds in the streets there was no longer any laughter any confidence any vim all the spirit of the visible greek nation seemed to have been knocked out of it in two blows but still they talked and never ceased talking coleman noticed that the most curious changes had come upon them since his journey to the frontier they no longer approved of foreigners they seemed to blame the travellers for something which had transpired in the past few days it was not that they really blamed the travellers for the nations calamity it was simply that their minds were half stunned by the news of defeats and not thinking for a moment to blame themselves or even not thinking to attribute the defeats to mere numbers and skill they were savagely eager to fasten it upon something near enough at hand for the operation of vengeance coleman perceived that the dragoman all his former plumage gone was whining and snivelling as he argued to a darkbrowed crowd that was running beside the cavalcade the groom who always had been a miraculously laconic man was suddenly launched forth garrulously the drivers from their high seats palavered like mad men driving with oat hand and gesturing with the other explaining evidently their own great innocence coleman saw that there was trouble but he only sat more stiffly in his saddle the eternal gabble moved him to despise the situation at any rate the travellers would soon be out of this town and on to a more sensible region however he saw the driver of the first carriage suddenly pull up boforg a little blackened coffee shop and inn the dragman spurred forward and began wild expostulation the second carriage pulled close behind the other the crowd murmuring like a roman mob in neros time closed around them chapter xxi coleman pushed his horse coolly through to the dragomans side what is it he demanded the dragoman was brokenvoiced these peoples they say you are germans all germans and they are angry he wailed i can do nossingnossing well tell these men to drive on said coleman tell them theymust drive on they will not drive on wailed the dragoman still more loudly i can do nossing they say here is place for feed the horse it is the custom and they will note drive on make them drive on they will note shrieked the agonised servitor coleman looked from the men waving their arms and chattering on the boxseats to the men of the crowd who also waved their arms and chattered in this throng far to the rear of the fighting armies there did not seem to be a single man who was not ablebodied who had not been free to enlist as a soldier they were of that scurvy behindtherearguard which every nation has in degree proportionate to its worth the manhood of greece had gone to the frontier leaving at home this rabble of talkers most of whom were armed with rifles for mere pretention coleman loathed them to the end of his soul he thought them a lot of infants who would like to prove their courage upon eleven innocent travellers all but unarmed and in this fact he was quick to see a great danger to the wainwright party one could deal with soldiers soldiers would have been ashamed to bait helpless people but this rabble the fighting blood of the correspondent began to boil and he really longed for the privilege to run amuck through the multitude but a look at the wainwrights kept him in his senses the professor had turned pale as a dead man he sat very stiff and still while his wife clung to him hysterically beseeching him to do something do something although what he was to do she could not have even imagined coleman took the dilemma by its beard he dismounted from his horse into the depths of the crowd and addressed the wainwrights i suppose we had better go into this place and have some coffee while the men feed their horses there is no use in trying to make them go on his manner was fairly casual but they looked at him in glazed horror it is the only thing to do this crowd is not nearly so bad as they think they are but weve got to look as if we felt confident he himself had no confidence with this angry buzz in his ears but be felt certain that the only correct move was to get everybody as quickly as possible within the shelter of the inn it might not be much of a shelter for them but it was better than the carriages in the street the professor and mrs wainwright seemed to be considering their carriage as a castle and they looked as if their terror had made them physically incapable of leaving it coleman stood waiting behind him the clappertongued crowd was moving ominously marjory arose and stepped calmly down to him he thrilled to the end of every nerve it was as if she had said i dont think there is great danger but if there is great danger why here i am ready with you it conceded everything admitted everything it was a surrender without a blush and it was only possible in the shadow of the crisis when they did not know what the next moments might contain for them as he took her hand and she stepped past him he whispered swiftly and fiercely in her ear i love you she did not look up but he felt that in this quick incident they had claimed each other accepted each other with a far deeper meaning and understanding than could be possible in a mere drawingroom she laid her hand on his arm and with the strength of four men he twisted his horse into the making of furious prancing sidesteps toward the door of the inn clanking sidesteps which mowed a wide lane through the crowd for marjory his marjory he was as haughty as a new german lieutenant and although he held the fuming horse with only his left hand he seemed perfectly capable of hurling the animal over a house without calling into service the arm which was devoted to marjory it was not an exhibition of coolness such as wins applause on the stage when the hero placidly lights a cigarette before the mob which is clamouring for his death it was on the contrary an exhibition of downright classic disdain a disdain which with the highest arrogance declared itself in every glance of his eye into the faces about him very good attack me if you like there is nothing to prevent it you mongrels every step of his progress was made a renewed insult to them the very air was charged with what this lone man was thinking of this threatening crowd his audacity was invincible they actually made way for it as quickly as children would flee from a ghost the horse dancing with ringing steps with his glistening neck arched toward the iron hand at his bit this powerful quivering animal was a regular engine of destruction and they gave room until coleman halted himat an exclamation from marjory my mother and father but they were coming close behind and coleman resumed this contemptuous journey to the door of the inn the groom with his newborn tongue was clattering there to the populace coleman gave him the horse and passed after the wainwrights into the public room of the inn he was smiling what simpletons a new actor suddenly appeared in the person of the keeper of the inn he too had a rifle and a prodigious belt of cartridges but it was plain at once that he had elected to be a friend of the worried travellers a large part of the crowd were thinking it necessary to enter the inn and powwow more but the innkeeper stayed at the door with the dragoman and together they vociferously held back the tide the spirit of the mob had subsided to a more reasonable feeling they no longer wished to tear the strangers limb from limb on the suspicion that they were germans they now were frantic to talk as if some inexorable law had kept them silent for ten years and this was the very moment of their release whereas their simultaneous and interpolating orations had throughout made noise much like a coalbreaker coleman led the wainwrights to a table in a far part of the room they took chairs as if he had commanded them what an outrage he said jubilantly the apes he was keeping more than half an eye upon the door because he knew that the quick coming of the students was important then suddenly the storm broke in wrath something had happened in the street the jabbering crowd at the door had turned and were hurrying upon some central tumult the dragoman screamed to coleman coleman jumped and grabbed the dragoman tell this man to take them somewhere up stairs he cried indicating the wainwrights with a sweep of his arm the innkeeper seemed to understand sooner than the dragoman and he nodded eagerly the professor was crying what is it mr coleman what is it an instant later the correspondent was out in the street buffeting toward a scuffle of course it was the students it appeared afterward that those seven young men with their feelings much ruffled had been making the best of their way toward the door of the inn when a large man in the crowd during a speech which was surely most offensive had laid an arresting hand on the shoulder of peter tounley whereupon the excellent peter tounley had hit the large man on the jaw in such a swift and skilful manner that the large man had gone spinning through a group of his countrymen to the hard earth where he lay holding his face together and howling instantly of course there had been a riot it might well be said that even then the affair could have ended in a lot of talking but in the first place the students did not talk modern greek and in the second place they were now past all thought of talking they regarded this affair seriously as a fight and now that they at last were in it they were in it for every pint of blood in their bodies such a pack of famished wolves had never before been let loose upon men armed with gras rifles they all had been expecting the row and when peter tounley had found it expedient to knock over the man they had counted it a signal their arms immediately begun to swing out as if they had been wound up it was at this time that coleman swam brutally through the greeks and joined his countrymen he was more frightened than any of those novices when he saw peter tounley overthrow a dreadful looking brigand whose belt was full of knives and whocrashed to the ground amid a clang of cartridges he was appalled by the utter simplicity with which the lads were treating the crisis it was to them no common scrimmage at washurst of course but it flashed through colemans mind that they had not the slightegt sense of the size of the thing he expected every instant to see the flash of knives or to hear the deafening intonation of a rifle fired against hst ear it seemed to him miraculous that the tragedy was so long delayed in the meantirne he was in the affray he jilted one man under the chin with his elbow in a way that reeled him off from peter tounleys back a little person in thecked clothes he smote between the eyes he recieved a gunbutt emphatically on the aide of the neck he felt hands tearing at him he kicked the pins out from under three men in rapid succession he was always yelling try to get to the inn boys try to get to the inn look out peter take care for his knife peter suddenly he whipped a rifle out of the hands of a man and swung it whistling he had gone stark mad with the others the boy billy drunk from some blows and bleeding was already staggering toward the inn over the clearage which the wild coleman made with the clubbed rifle tho others follewed as well as they might while beating off a discouraged enemy the remarkable innkeeper had barred his windows with strong wood shutters he held the door by the crack for them and they stumbled one by on through the portal coleman did not know why they were not all dead nor did he understand the intrepid and generous behaviour of the innkeeper but at any rate he felt that the fighting was suspended and he wanted to see marjory the innkeeper was doing a great pantomime in the middle of the darkened room pointing to the outer door and then aiming his rifle at it to explain his intention of defending them at all costs some of the students moved to a billiard table and spread themselves wearily upon it others sank down where they stood outside the crowd was beginning to roar colemans groom crept out from under the little coffee bar and comically saluted his master the dragoman was not present coleman felt that he must see marjory and he made signs to the innkeeper the latter understood quickly and motioned that coleman should follow him they passed together through a dark hall and up a darker stairway where after coleman stepped out into a sunlit room saying loudly oh its all right its all over dont worry three wild people were instantly upon him oh what was it what did happen is anybody hurt oh tell us quick it seemed at the time that it was an avalanche of three of them and it was not until later that he recognised that mrs wainwright had tumbled the largest number of questions upon him as for marjory she had said nothing until the time when she cried ohhe is bleedinghe is bleeding oh come quick she fairly dragged him out of one room into another room where there was a jug of water she wet her handkerchief and softly smote his wounds bruises she said piteously tearfully bruises oh dear how they must hurt you the handkerchief was soon stained crimson when coleman spoke his voice quavered it isnt anything really it isnt anything he had not known of these wonderful wounds but he almost choked in the joy of marjorys ministry and her half coherent exclamations this proud and beautiful girl this superlative creature was reddening her handkerchief with his blood and no word of his could have prevented her from thus attending him he could hear the professor and mrs wainwright fussing near him trying to be of use he would have liked to have been able to order them out of the room marjorys cool fingers on his face and neck had conjured within him a vision at an intimacy tnat was even sweeter than anything which he had imagined and he longed to pour out to her the bubbling impassioned speech which came to his lips but always doddering behind him were the two old people strenuous to be of help to him suddenly a door opened and a youth appeared simply red with blood it was peter tounley his first remark was cheerful well i dont suppose those people will be any too quick to look for more trouble coleman felt a swift pang because he had forgotten to announce the dilapidated state of all the students he had been so submerged by marjorys tenderness that all else had been drowned from his mind his heart beat quickly as he waited for marjory to leave him and rush to peter tounley but she did nothing of the sort oh peter she cried in distress and then she turned back to coleman it was the professor and mrs wainwright who at last finding a field for their kindly ambitions flung them selves upon tounley and carried him off to another place peter was removed crying oh now look here professor im not dying or anything of the sort coleman and marjory were left alone he suddenly and forcibly took one of her hands and the blood stained hankerchief dropped to the floor chapter xxii from below they could hear the thunder of weapons and fits upon the door of the inn amid a great clamour of tongues sometimes there arose the argumtntative howl of the innkeeper above this roar colemans quick words sounded in marjorys ear ive got to go ive got to go back to the boys buti love you yes go go she whispered hastily you should be there butcome back he held her close to him but you are mine remember he said fiercely and sternly you are mineforeveras i am yoursremember her eyes half closed she made intensely solemn answer yes he released her and vphs gone in the glooming coffee room of the inn he found the students the dragoman the groom and the innkeeper armed with a motley collection of weapons which ranged from the rifle of the innkeeper to the table leg in the hands of petertounley the last named young student of archeology was in a position of temporary leadefship and holding a great powbow with the innkeeper through the medium of peircing outcries by the dragoman coleman had not yet undestood why none of them had been either stabbed or shot in the fight in the steeet but it seemed to him now that affairs were leading toward a crisis of tragedy he thought of the possibilities of having the dragoman go to an upper window and harangue the people but he saw no chance of success in such a plan he saw that the crowd would merely howl at the dragoman while the dragoman howled at the crowd he then asked if there was any other exit from the inn by which they could secretly escape he learned that the door into the coffee room was the only door which pierced the four great walls all he could then do was to find out from the innkeeper how much of a siege the place could stand and to this the innkeeper answered volubly and with smiles that this hostelry would easily endure until the mercurial temper of the crowd had darted off in a new direction it may be curious to note here that all of peter tounleys impassioned communication with the innkeeper had been devoted to an endeavour to learn what in the devil was the matter with these people as a man about to be bitten by poisonous snakes should first of all furiously insist upon learning their exact species before deciding upon either his route if he intended to run away or his weapon if he intended to fight them the innkeeper was evidently convinced that this house would withstand the rage of the populace and he was such an unaccountably gallant little chap that coleman trusted entirely to his word his only fear or suspicion was an occasional one as to the purity of the dragomans translation suddenly there was half a silence on the mob without the door it is inconceivable that it could become altogether silent but it was as near to a rational stillness of tongues as it was able then there was a loud knocking by a single fist and a new voice began to spin greek a voice that was somewhat like the rattle of pebbles in a tin box then a startling voice called out in english are you in there rufus answers came from every english speaking person in the room in one great outburst yes well let us in called nora black it is all right weve got an officer with us open the door said coleman with speed the little innkeeper labouriously unfastened the great bars and when the door finally opened there appeared on the threshold nora black with coke and an officer of infantry noras little old companion and noras dragoman we saw your carriage in the street cried the queen of comic opera as she swept into the room she was beaming with delight what is all the row anyway oooh look at that students nose who hit him and look at rufus what have you boys been doing her little greek officer of infantry had stopped the mob from flowing into the room coleman looked toward the door at times with some anxiety nora noting it waved her hand in careless reassurance oh its all right dont worry about them any more he is perfectly devoted to me he would die there on the threshold if i told him it would please me speaks splendid french i found him limping along the road and gave him a lift and now do hurry up and tell me exactly what happened they all told what had happened while nora and coke listened agape coke by the way had quite floated back to his old position with the students it had been easy in the stress of excitement and wonder nobody had any titne to think of the excessively remote incidents of the early morning all minor interests were lost in the marvel of the present situation who landed you in the eye billie asked the awed coke that was a bad one oh i dont know said billie you really couldnt tell who hit you you know it was a football rush they had guns and knives but they didnt use em i dont know why jinks im getting pretty stiff my face feels as if it were made of tin did they give you people a row too no only talk that little officer managed them outtalked them i suppose hear him buzz now the wainwrights came down stairs nora black went confidently forward to meet them youve added one more to your list of rescuers she cried with her glowing triumphant smile miss black of the new york daylightat your service how in the world do you manage to get yourselves into such dreadful scrapes you are the most remarkable people you need a guardian why you might have all been killed how exciting it must seem to be regularly of your party she had shaken cordiaily one of mrs wainwrights hands without that lady indicating assent to the proceeding but mrs wainwright had not felt repulsion in fact she had had no emotion springing directly from it here again the marvel of the situation came to deny mrs wainwright the right to resume a state of mind which had been so painfully interesting to her a few hours earlier the professor coleman and all the students were talking together coke had addressed coleman civilly and coleman had made a civil reply peace was upon them nora slipped her arm lovingly through marjbrys arm that rufus oh that rufus she cried joyously ill give him a good scolding as soon as i see him alone i might have foreseen that he would get you all into trouble the old stupid marjory did not appear to resent anything oh i dont think it was mr colemans fault at ail she answered calmly i think it was more the fault of peter tounley poor boy well id be glad to believe it id be glad to believe it said nora i want rufus to keep out of that sort of thing but he is so hotheaded and foolish if she had pointed out her proprietary stamp on colemans cheek she could not have conveyed what she wanted with more clearness oh said the impassive marjory i dont think you need have any doubt as to whose fault it was if there were any of our boys at fault mr coleman was inside when the fighting commenced and only ran out to help the boys he had just brought us safely through the mob and far from being hotheaded and foolish he was utterly cool in manner impressively cool i thought i am glad to be able to reassure you on these points for i see that they worry you yes they do worry me said nora densely they worry me night and day when he is away from me oh responded marjory i have never thought of mr coleman as a man that one would worry about much we consider him very selfreliant able to take care of himself under almost any conditions but then of course we do not know him at all in the way that you know him i should think that you would find that he came off rather better than you expected from most of his difficulties but then of course as i said you know him so much better than we do her easy indifference was a tacit dismissal of coleman as a topic nora now thoroughly alert glanced keenly into the other girls face but it was inscrutable the actress had intended to go careering through a whole circle of daring illusions to an intimacy withcoleman but here before she had really developed her attack marjory with a few conventional and indifferent sentences almost expressive of boredom had made the subject of coleman impossible an effect was left upon noras mind that marjory had been extremely polite in listening to much nervous talk about a person in whom she had no interest the actress was dazed she did not know how it had all been done where was the head of this thing and where was the tail a fog had mysteriously come upon all her brilliant prospects of seeing marjory wainwright suffer and this fog was the product of a kind of magic with which she was not familiar she could not think how to fight it after being simply dubious throughout a long pause she in the end went into a great rage she glared furiously at marjory dropped her arm as if it had burned her and moved down upon coleman she must have reflected that at any rate she could make him wriggle when she was come near to him she called out rufus in her tone was all the old insolent statement of ownership coleman might have been a poodle she knew how to call his same in a way that was anything less than a public scandal on this occasion everybody looked at him and then went silent as people awaiting the startling denouement of a drama rufus she was baring his shoulder to show the fieurdelis of the criminal the students gaped colemans temper was if one may be allowed to speak in that way broken loose inside of him he could hardly beeathe he felt that his body was about to explode into a thousand fragments he simply snarled out what almost at once he saw that she had at last goaded him into making a serious tactical mistake it must be admitted that it is only when the relations between a man and a woman are the relations of wedlock or at least an intimate resemblance to it that the man snarls out what to the woman mere lovers say i beg your pardon it is only cupids finished product that spits like a cat nora black had called him like a wife and he had answered like a husband for his cause his manner could not possibly have been worse he saw the professor stare at him in surprise and alarm and felt the excitement of the eight students these latter were diabolic in the celerity with which they picked out meanings it was as plain to them as if nora black had said he is my property coleman would have given his nose to have been able to recall that single reverberating word but he saw that the scene was spelling downfall for him and he went still more blind and desperate of it his despair made him burn to make matters worse he did not want to improve anything at all what he demanded what do ye want nora was sweetly reproachful i left my jacket in the carriage and i want you to get it for me well get it for yourself do you see get it for yourself now it is plainly to be seen that no one of the people listening there had ever heard a man speak thus to a woman who was not his wife whenever they had heard that form of spirited repartee it had come from the lips of a husband colemans rude speech was to their ears a flat announcement of an extraordinary intimacy between nora black and the correspondent any other interpretation would not have occurred to them it was so palpable that it greatly distressed them with its arrogance and boldness the professor had blushed the very milkiest word in his mind at the time was the word vulgarity nora black had won a great battle it was her agincourt she had beaten the clever coleman in a way that had left little of him but rags however she could have lost it all again if she had shown her feeling of elation at colemans rudeness her manner indicated a mixture of sadness and embarrassment her suffering was so plain to the eye that peter tounley was instantly moved cant i get your jacket for you miss black he asked hastily and at her grateful nod he was off at once coleman was resolved to improve nothing his overthrow seemed to him to be so complete that he could not in any way mend it without a sacrifice of his dearest prides he turned away from them all and walked to an isolated corner of the room he would abide no longer with them he had been made an outcast by nora black and he intended to be an outcast therc was no sense in attempting to stem this extraordinary deluge it was better to acquiesce then suddenly he was angry with marjory he did not exactly see why he was angry at marjory but he was angry at her nevertheless he thought of how he could revenge himself upon her he decided to take horse with his groom and dragoman and proceed forthwith on the road leaving the jumble as it stood this would pain marjory anyhow he hoped she would feel it deeply he hoped acting upon this plan he went to the professor well of course you are all right now professor and if you dont mind i would like to leave yougo on ahead ive got a considerable pressure of business on my mind and i think i should hurry on to athens if you dont mind the professor did not seem to know what to say of course if you wish itsorry im sureof course it is as you pleasebut you have been such a power in our favourit seems too bad to lose youbutif you wish itif you insist oh yes i quite insist said coleman calmly i quite insist make your mind easy on that score professor i insist well mr coleman stammered the old man well it seems a great pity to lose youyou have been such a power in our favour oh you are now only eight hours from the railway it is very easy you would not need my assistance even if it were a benefit but said the professor colemans dragoman came to him then and said there is one man here who says you made to take one rifle in the fight and was break his head he was say he wants sunthing for you was break his head he says hurt how much does he want asked coleman impatiently the dragoman wrestled then evidently with a desire to protect this mine from outside fingers ii think two gold piece plenty take them said coleman it seemed to him preposterous that this idiot with a broken head should interpolate upon his tragedy afterward you and the groom get the three horses and we will start for athens at once for athens at once said marjorys voice in his ear chapter xxiii om said coleman i was thinking of starting why asked marjory unconcernedly coleman shot her a quick glance i believe my period of usefulness is quite ended he said with just a small betrayal of bitter feeling it is certainly true that you have had a remarkable period of usefulness to us said marjory with a slow smile but if it is ended you should not run away from us coleman looked at her to see what she could mean from many women these words would have been equal under the circumstances to a command to stay but he felt that none might know what impulses moved the mind behind that beautiful mask in his misery he thought to hurt her into an expression of feeling by a rough speech im so in love with nora black you know that i have to be very careful of myself oh said marjory never thought of that i should think you would have to be careful of yourself she did not seem moved in any way coleman despaired of finding her weak spot she was adamantine this girl he searched his mind for something to say which would be still more gross than his last outbreak but when he felt that he was about to hit upon it the professor interrupted with an agitated speech to marjory you had better go to your mother my child and see that you are all ready to leave here as soon as the carriages come up we have absolutely nothing to make ready said marjory laughing but ill go and see if mother needs anything before we start that i can get for her she went away without bidding goodbye to coleman the sole maddening impression to him was that the matter of his going had not been of sufficient importance to remain longer than a moment upon her mind at the same time he decided that he would go irretrievably go even then the dragoman entered the room we will pack everythingupon the horse everythingyes peter tounley came afterward you are not going to bolt yes im off answered coleman recovering himself for peters benefit see you in athens probably presently the dragoman announced the readiness of the horses coleman shook hands with the students and the professor amid cries of surprise and polite regret what going oldman really what for oh wait for us were off in a few minutes sorry as the devil old boy to see you go he accepted their protestations with a somewhat sour face he knew perfectly well that they were thinking of his departure as something that related to nora black at the last he bowed to the ladies as a collection marjorys answering bow was affable the bow of mrs wainwright spoke a resentment for something and noras bow was triumphant mockery as he swung into the saddle an idea struck him with over whelming force the idea was that he was a fool he was a colossal imbecile he touched the spur to his horse and the animal leaped superbly making the greeks hasten for safety in all directions he was off he could no more return to retract his devious idiocy than he could make his horse fly to athens what was done was done he could not mend it and he felt like a man that had broken his own heart perversely childishly stupidly broken his own heart he was sure that marjory was lost to him no man could be degraded so publicly and resent it so crudely and still retain a marjory in his abasement from his defeat at the hands of nora black he had performed every imaginable blockheadish act and had finally climaxed it all by a departure which left the tongue of nora to speak unmolested into the ear of marjory noras victory had been a serious blow to his fortunes but it had not been so serious as his own subsequent folly he had generously muddled his own affairs until he could read nothing out of them but despair he was in the mood for hatred he hated many people nora black was the principal item but he did not hesitate to detest the professor mrs wainwright coke and all the students as for marjory he would revenge himself upon her she had done nothing that he defined clearly but at any rate he would take revenge for it as much as was possible he would make her suffer he would convince her that he was a tremendous and inexorable person but it came upon his mind that he was powerless in all ways if he hated many people they probably would not be even interested in his emotion and as for his revenge upon marjory it was beyond his strength he was nothing but the complaining victim of nora black and himself he felt that he would never again see marjory and while feeling it he began to plan his attitude when next they met he would be very cold and reserved at agrinion he found that there would be no train until the next daybreak the dragoman was excessively annoyed over it but coleman did not scold at all as a matter of fact his heart had given a great joyus bound he could not now prevent his being overtaken they were only a few leagues away and while he was waiting for the train they would easily cover the distance if anybody expressed surprise at seeing him he could exhibit the logical reasons if there had been a train starting at once he would have taken it his pride would have put up with no subterfuge if the wainwrights overtook him it was because he could not help it but he was delighted that he could not help it there had been an interposition by some specially beneficent fate he felt like whistling he spent the early half of the night in blissful smoke striding the room which the dragoman had found for him his head was full of plans and detached impressive scenes in which he figured before marjory the simple fact that there was no train away from agrinion until the next daybreak had wrought a stupendous change in his outlook he unhesitatingly considered it an omen of a good future he was up before the darkness even contained presage of coming light but near the railway station was a little hut where coffee was being served to several prospective travellers who had come even earlier to the rendezvous there was no evidence of the wainwrights coleman sat in the hut and listened for the rumble of wheels he was suddenly appalled that the wainwrights were going to miss the train perhaps they had decided against travelling during the night perbaps this thing and perhaps that thing the morning was very cold closely muffled in his cloak he went to the door and stared at where the road was whitening out of night at the station stood a little spectral train and the engine at intervals emitted a long piercing scream which informed the echoing land that in all probability it was going to start after a time for the south the greeks in the coffee room were of course talking at last coleman did hear the sound of hoofs and wheels the three carriages swept up in grand procession the first was laden with students in the second was the professor the greek officer nora blacks old lady and other persons all looking marvellously unimportant and shelved it was the third carriage at which coleman stared at first be thought the dim light deceived his vision but in a moment he knew that his first leaping conception of the arrangement of the people in this vehicle had been perfectly correct nora black and mrs wainwright sat side by side on the back seat while facing them were coke and marjory they looked cold but intimate the oddity of the grouping stupefied coleman it was anarchy naked and unashamed he could not imagine how such changes could have been consummated in the short time he had been away from them but he laid it all to some startling necromancy on the part of nora black some wondrous play which had captured them all because of its surpassing skill and because they were in the main rather gullible people he was wrong the magic had been wrought by the unaided foolishness of mrs wainwfight as soon as nora black had succeeded in creating an effect of intimacy and dependence between herself and coleman the professor had flatly stated to his wife that the presence of nora black in the party in the inn in the world was a thiag that did not meet his approval in any way she should be abolished as for coleman he would not defend him he preferred not to talk to him it made him sad coleman at least had been very indiscreet very indiscreet it was a great pity but as for this blatant woman the sooner they rid themselves of her the sooner he would feel that all the world was not evil whereupon mrs wainwright had changed front with the speed of light and attacked with horse foot and guns she failed to see she had declared where this poor lone girt was in great fault of course it was probable that she had listened to this snaky tongued rufus coleman but that was ever the mistake that women made oh certainly the professor would like to let rufus coleman off scotfree that was the way with men they defended each other in all cases if wrong were done it was the woman who suffered now since this poor girl was alone far off here in greece mrs wainwright announced that she had such full sense of her duty to her sex that her conscience would not allow her to scorn and desert a sister even if that sister was approximately the victim of a creature like rufus coleman perhaps the poor thing loved this wretched man although it was hard to imagine any woman giving her heart to such a monster the professor had then asked with considerable spirit for the proofs upon which mrs wainwright named coleman a monster and had made a wry face over her completely conventional reply he had told her categorically his opinion of her erudition in such matters but mrs wainwright was not to be deterred from an exciting espousal of the cause of her sex upon the instant that the professor strenuously opposed her she becamean apostle an enlightened uplifted apostle to the world on the wrongs of her sex she had come down with this thing as if it were a disease nothing could stop her her husband her daughter all influences in other directions had been overturned with a roar and the first thing fully clear to the professors mind had been that his wife was riding affably in the carriage with nora black coleman aroused when he heard one of the students cry out why there is rufus colemans dragoman he must be here a moment later they thronged upon him hi old man caught you again where did you break to glad to catch you old boy how are you making it wheres your horse sent the horses on to athens said coleman he had not yet recovered his composure and he was glad to find available this commonplace return to their exuberant greetings and questions sent them on to athens with the groom in the mean time the engine of the little train was screaming to heaven that its intention of starting was most serious the diligencia careered to the station platform and unburdened coleman had had his dragoman place his luggage in a little firstclass carriage and he defiantly entered it and closed the door he had a sudden return to the old sense of downfall and with it came the original rebellious desires however he hoped that somebody would intrude upon him it was peter tounley the student flung open the door and then yelled to the distance heres an empty one he clattered into the compartment hello coleman didnt know you were in here at his heels came nora black coke and marjory oh they said when they saw the occupant of the carriage oh coleman was furious he could have distributed some of his traps in a way to create more room but he did not move chapter xxiv there was a demonstration of the unequalled facilities of a european railway carriage for rendering unpleasant things almost intolerable these people could find no way to alleviate the poignancy of their position coleman did not know where to look every personal mannerism becomes accentuated in a european railway carriage if you glance at a man your glance defines itself as a stare if you carefully look at nothing you create for yourself a resemblance to all woodenheaded things a newspaper is then in the nature of a preservative and coleman longed for a newspaper it was this abominable railway carriage which exacted the first display of agitation from marjory she flushed rosily and her eyes wavered over the cornpartment nora black laughed in a way that was a shock to the nerves coke seemed very angry indeed and peter tounley was in pitiful distress everything was acutely painfully vivid bald painted as glaringly as a grocers new wagon it fulfilled those traditions which the artists deplore when they use their pet phrase on a picture it hurts the damnable power of accentuation of the european railway carriage seemed to colemans amazed mind to be redoubled and redoubled it was peter tounley who seemed to be in the greatest agony he looked at the correspondent beseechingly and said its a very cold morning coleman this was an actual appeal in the name of humanity coleman came squarely to the front and even grinned a little at poor peter tounleys misery yes it is a cold morning peter i should say it to one of the coldest mornings in my recollection peter tounley had not intended a typical american emphasis on the polar conditions which obtained in the compartment at this time but coleman had given the word this meaning spontaneously every body smiled and at once the tension was relieved but of course the satanic powers of the railway carriage could not be altogether set at naught of course it fell to the lot of coke to get the seat directly in front of coleman and thus face to face they were doomed to stare at each other peter tounley was inspired to begin conventional babble in which he took great care to make an appear ance of talking to all in the carriage funny thing i never knew these mornings in greece were so cold i thought the climate here was quite tropical it must have been inconvenient in the ancient times when i am told people didnt wear near so manyerclothes really i dont see how they stood it for my part i would like nothing so much as a buffalo robe i suppose when those great sculptors were doing their masterpieces they had to wear gloves ever think of that funny isnt it arent you cold marjory i am jingo imagine the spartans in ulsters going out to meet an enemy in capeovercoats and being desired by their mothers to return with their ulsters or wrapped in them it was rather hard work for peter tounley both marjory and coleman tried to display an interest in his labours and they laughed not at what he said but because they believed it assisted him the little train meanwhile wandered up a great green slope and the day rapidly coloured the land at first nora black did not display a militant mood but as time passed coleman saw clearly that she was considering the advisability of a new attack she had coleman and marjory in conjunction and where they were unable to escape from her the opportunities were great to coleman she seemed to be gloating over the possibilities of making more mischief she was looking at him speculatively as if considering the best place to hit him first presently she drawled rufus i wish you would fix my rug about me a little better coleman saw that this was a beginning peter tounley sprang to his feet with speed and enthusiasm oh let me do it for you he had her well muffled in the rug before she could protest even if a protest had been rational the young man had no idea of defending coleman he had no knowledge of the necessity for it it had been merely the exercise of his habit of amiability his chronic desire to see everybody comfortable his passion in this direction was well known in washurst where the students had borrowed a phrase from the photographers in order to describe him fully in a nickname they called him lookpleasant tounley this did not in any way antagonise his perfect willingness to fight on occasions with a singular desperation which usually has a small stool in every mind where good nature has a throne oh thank you very much mr tounley said nora black without gratitude rufus is always so lax in these matters i dont know how you know it said coleman boldly and he looked her fearlessly in the eye the battle had begun oh responded nora airily i have had opportunity enough to know it i should think by this time no said coleman since i have never paid you particular and direct attention you cannot possibly know what i am lax in and what i am not lax in i would be obliged to be of service at any time nora but surely you do not consider that you have a right to my services superior to any other right nora black simply went mad but fortunately part of her madness was in the form of speechlessness otherwise there might have been heard something approaching to billingsgate marjory and peter tounley turned first hot and then cold and looked as if they wanted to fly away and even coke penned helplessly in with this unpleasant incident seemed to have a sudden attack of distress the only frigid person was coleman he had made his declaration of independence and he saw with glee that the victory was complete nora black might storm and rage but he had announced his position in an unconventional blunt way which nobody in the carriage could fail to understand he felt somewhat like smiling with confidence and defiance in noras face but he still had the fear for marjory unexpectedly the fight was all out of nora black she had the fury of a woman scorned but evidently she had perceived that all was over and lost the remainder of her wrath dispensed itself in glares which coleman withstood with great composure a strained silence fell upon the group which lasted until they arrived at the little port of mesalonghi whence they were to take ship for patras coleman found himself wondering why he had not gone flatly at the great question at a much earlier period indeed at the first moment when the great question began to make life exciting for him he thought that if he had charged noras guns in the beginning they would have turned out to be the same incapable artillery instead of that he had run away and continued to run away until he was actually cornered and made to fight and his easy victory had defined him as a person who had earlier indulged in much stupidity and cowardice everything had worked out so simply his terrors had been dispelled so easily that he probably was led to overestimate his success and it occurred suddenly to him he foresaw a fine occasion to talk privately to marjory when all had boarded the steamer for patras and he resolved to make use of it this he believed would end the strife and conclusively laurel him the train finally drew up on a little stone pier and some boatmen began to scream like gulls the steamer lay at anchor in the placid blue cove the embarkation was chaotic in the oriental fashion and there was the customary misery which was only relieved when the travellers had set foot on the deck of the steamer coleman did not devote any premature attention to finding marjory but when the steamer was fairly out on the calm waters of the gulf of corinth he saw her pacing to and fro with peter tounley at first he lurked in the distance waiting for an opportunity but ultimately he decided to make his own opportunity he approached them marjory would you let me speak to you alone for a few moments you wont mind will you peter oh no certainly not said peter tounley of course it is not some dreadful revelation is it said marjory bantering him coolly no answered coleman abstractedly he was thinking of what he was going to say peter tounley vanished around the corner of a deckhouse and marjory and coleman began to pace to and fro even as marjory and peter tounley had done coleman had thought to speak his mind frankly and once for all and on the train he had invented many clear expressions of his feeling it did not appear that he had forgotten them it seemed more that they had become entangled in his mind in such a way that he could not unravel the end of his discourse in the pause marjory began to speak in admiration of the scenery i never imagined that greece was so full of mountains one reads so much of the attic plains but arent these mountains royal they look so rugged and cold whereas the bay is absolutely as blue as the old descriptions of a summer sea i wanted to speak to you about nora black said coleman nora black why said marjory lifting her eyebrows you know well enough said coleman in a head long fashion you must know you must have seen it she knows i care for you and she wants to stop it and she has no right toto interfere she is a fiend a perfect fiend she is trying to make you feel that i care for her and dont you care for her asked marjory no said coleman vehemently i dont care for her at all very well answered marjory simply i believe you she managed to give the words the effect of a mere announcement that she believed him and it was in no way plain that she was glad or that she esteemed the matter as being of consequence he scowled at her in dark resentment you mean by that i suppose that you dont believe me oh answered marjory wearily i believe you i said so dont talk about it any more then said coleman slowly you mean that you do not care whether im telling the truth or not why of course i care she said lying is not nice he did not know apparently exactly how to deal with her manner which was actually so pliable thatit was marble if one may speak in that way he looked ruefully at the sea he had expected a far easier time well he began really interrupted marjory this is something which i do not care to discuss i would rather you would not speak to me at all about it it seems tootoobad i can readily give you my word that i believe you but i would prefer you not to try to talk to me about it oranything of that sort mother mrs wainwright was hovering anxiously in the vicinity and she now bore down rapidly upon the pair you are very nearly to patras she said reproachfully to her daughter as if the fact had some fault of marjorys concealed in it she in no way acknowledged the presence of coleman oh are we cried marjory yes said mrs wainwright we are she stood waiting as if she expected marjory to instantly quit coleman the girl wavered a moment and then followed her mother goodbye she said i hope we may see you again in athens it was a command to him to travel alone with his servant on the long railway journey from patras to athens it was a dismissal of a casual acquaintance given so graciously that it stung him to the depths of his pride he bowed his adieu and his thanks when the yelling boatmen came again he and his man proceeded to the shore in an early boat without looking in any way after the welfare of the others at the train the party split into three sections coleman and his man had one compartment nora black and her squad had another and the wainwrights and students occupied two more the little officer was still in tow of nora black he was very enthusiastic in french she directed him to remain silent but he did not appear to understand you tell him she then said to her dragoman to sit in a corner and not to speak until i tell him to or i wont have him in here she seemed anxious to unburden herself to the old lady companion do you know she said that girl has a nerve like steel i tried to break it there in that inn but i couldnt budge her if i am going to have her beaten i must prove myself to be a very very artful person why did you try to break her nerve asked the old lady yawning why do you want to have her beaten because i do old stupid answered nora you should have heard the things i said to her about what about coleman cant you understand anything at all and why should you say anything about coleman to her queried the old lady still hopelessly befogged because cried nora darting a look of wrath at her companion i want to prevent that marriage she had been betrayed into this avowal by the singularly opaque mind of the old lady the latter at once sat erect oh ho she said as if a ray of light had been let into her head oh ho so thats it is it yes thats it rejoined nora shortly the old lady was amazed into a long period of meditation at last she spoke depressingly well how are you going to prevent it those things cant be done in these days at all if they care for each other nora burst out furiously dont venture opinions until you know what you are talking about please they dont care for each other do you see she cares for him but he dont give a snap of his fingers for her but cried the bewildered lady if he dont care for her there will be nothing to prevent if he dont care for her he wont ask her to marry him and so there wont be anything to prevent nora made a broad gesture of impatience oh cant you get anything through your head havent you seen that the girl has been the only young woman in that whole party lost up there in the mountains and that naturally more than half of the men still think they are in love with her thats what it is cant you see it always happens that way then coleman comes along and makes a fool of himself with the others the old lady spoke up brightly as if at last feeling able to contribute something intelligent to the talk oh then he does care for her noras eyes looked as if their glance might shrivel the old ladys hair dont i keep telling you that it is no such thing cant you understand it is all glamour fascination way up there in the wilderness only one even passable woman in sight i dont say that i am so very keen said the old lady somewhat offended but i fail to see where i could improve when first you tell me he dont care for her and then you tell me that he does care for her glamour fascination quoted nora dont you understand the meaning of the words well asked the other didnt he know her then before he came over here nora was silent for a time while a gloom upon her face deepened it had struck her that the theories for which she protested so energetically might not be of such great value spoken aloud they had a sudden new flimsiness perhaps she had reiterated to herself that coleman was the victim of glamour only because she wished it to be true one theory however remained unshaken marjory was an artful rninx with no truth in her she presently felt the necessity of replying to the question of her companion oh she said carelessly i suppose they were acquaintedin a way the old lady was giving the best of her mind to the subject if thats the case she observed musingly if thats the case you cant tell what is between em the talk had so slackened that noras unfortunate greek admirer felt that here was a good opportunity to present himself again to the notice of the actress the means was a smile and a french sentence but his reception would have frightened a man in armour his face blanched with horror at the storm he had invoked and he dropped limply back as if some one had shot him you tell this little snipe to let me alone cried nora to the dragoman if he dares to come around me with any more of those parisian dude speeches ii dont know what ill do i wont have it i say the impression upon the dragoman was hardly less in effect he looked with bulging eyes at nora and then began to stammer at the officer the latters voice could sometimes be heard in awed whispers for the more elaborate explanation of some detail of the tragedy afterward he remained meek and silent in his corner barely more than a shadow like the proverbial husband of imperious beauty well said the old lady after a long and thoughtful pause i dont know im sure but it seems to me that if rufus coleman really cares for that girl there isnt much use in trying to stop him from getting her he isnt that kind of a man for heavens sake will you stop assuming that he does care for her demanded nora breathlessly and i dont see continued the old lady what you want to prevent him for anyhow chapter xxv i feel in this radiant atmosphere that there could be no such thing as warmen striving together in black and passionate hatred the professors words were for the benefit of his wife and daughterhe was viewing the skyblue waters of the gulf of corinth with its background of mountains that in the sunshine were touched here and there with a copperish glare the train was slowly sweeping along the southern shore it is strange to think of those men fighting up there in the north and it is strange to think that we ourselves are but just returning from it i cannot begin to realise it yet said mrs wainwright in a high voice quite so responded the professor reflectively i do not suppose any of us will realise it fully for some time it is altogether too odd too very odd to think of it cried mrs wainwright to think of it supposing those dreadful albanians or those awful men from the greek mountains had caught us why years from now ill wake up in the night and think of it the professor mused strange that we cannot feel it strongly now my logic tells me to be aghast that we ever got into such a place but my nerves at present refuse to thrill i am very much afraid that this singular apathy of ours has led us to be unjust to poor coleman here mrs wainwright objected poor coleman i dont see why you call him poor coleman well answered the professor slowly i am in doubt about our behaviour it oh cried the wife gleefully in doubt about our behaviour im in doubt about his behaviour so then you do have a doubt of his behaviour oh no responded mrs wainwright hastily not about its badness what i meant to say was that in the face of his outrageous conduct with thatthat woman it is curious that you should worry about our behaviour it surprises me harrison the professor was wagging his head sadly i dont know i dont know it seems hard to judge i hesitate to mrs wainwright treated this attitude with disdain it is not hard to judge she scoffed and i fail to see why you have any reason for hesitation at all here he brings this woman the professor got angry nonsense nonsense i do not believe that he brought her if i ever saw a spectacle of a woman bringing herself it was then you keep chanting that thing like an outright parrot well retorted mrs wainwright bridling i suppose you imagine that you understand such things men usually think that but i want to tell you that you seem to me utterly blind blind or not do stop the everlasting reiteration of that sentence mrs wainwright passed into an offended silence and the professor also silent looked with a gradually dwindling indignation at the scenery night was suggested in the sky before the train was near to athens my trunks sighed mrs wainwright how glad i will be to get back to my trunks oh the dust oh the misery do find out when we will get there harrison maybe the train is late but at last they arrived in athens amid a darkness which was confusing and after no more than the common amount of trouble they procured carriages and were taken to the hotel mrs wainwrights impulses now dominated the others in the family she had one passion after another the majority of the servants in the hotel pretended that they spoke english but in three minutes she drove them distracted with the abundance and violence of her requests it came to pass that in the excitement the old couple quite forgot marjory it was not until mrs wainwright then feeling splendidly was dressed for dinner that she thought to open marjorys door and go to render a usual motherly supervision of the girls toilet there was no light there did not seem to be anybody in the room marjory called the mother in alarm she listened for a moment and then ran hastily out again harrison she cried i cant find marjory the professor had been tying his cravat he let the loose ends fly what he ejaculated opening his mouth wide then they both rushed into marjorys room marjory beseeched the old man in a voice which would have invoked the grave the answer was from the bed yes it was low weary tearful it was not like marjory it was dangerously the voice of a hcartbroken woman they hurried forward with outcries why marjory are you ill child how long have you been lying in the dark why didnt you call us are you ill no answered this changed voice i am not ill i only thought id rest for a time dont bother the professor hastily lit the gas and then father and mother turned hurriedly to the bed in the first of the illumination they saw that tears were flowing unchecked down marjorys face the effectof this grief upon the professor was in part an effect of fear he seemed afraid to touch it to go near it he could evidently only remain in the outskirts a horrified spectator the mother how ever flung her arms about her daughter oh marjory she too was weeping the girl turned her face to the pillow and held out a hand of protest dont mother dont oh marjory oh marjory dont mother please go away please go away dont speak at all i beg of you oh marjory oh marjory dont the girl lifted a face which appalled them it had something entirely new in it please go away mother i will speak to father but i wonti canti cant be pitied mrs wainwright looked at her husband yes said the old man trembling go she threw up her hands in a sorrowing gesture that was not without its suggestion that her exclusion would be a mistake she left the room the professor dropped on his knees at the bedside and took one of marjorys hands his voice dropped to its tenderest note well my marjory she had turned her face again to the pillow at last she answered in muffled tones you know thereafter came a long silence full of sharpened pain it was marjory who spoke first i have saved my pride daddy buti havelosteverything else even her sudden resumption of the old epithet of her childhood was an additional misery to the old man he still said no word he knelt gripping her fingers and staring at the wall yes i have losteverythingelse the father gave a low groan he was thinking deeply bitterly since one was only a human being how was one going to protect beloved hearts assailed with sinister fury from the inexplicable zenith in this tragedy he felt as helpless as an old grey ape he did not see a possible weapon with which he could defend his child from the calamity which was upon her there was no wall no shield which could turn this sorrow from the heart of his child if one of his hands loss could have spared her there would have been a sacrifice of his hand but he was potent for nothing he could only groan and stare at the wall he reviewed the past half in fear that he would suddenly come upon his error which was now the cause of marjorys tears he dwelt long upon the fact that in washurst he had refused his consent to marjorys marriage with coleman but even now he could not say that his judgment was not correct it was simply that the doom of womans woe was upon marjory this ancient woe of the silent tongue and the governed will and he could only kneel at the bedside and stare at the wall marjory raised her voice in a laugh did i betray myself did i become the maiden all forlorn did i giggle to show people that i did not care noi did noti did not and it was such a long time daddy oh such a long time i thought we would never get here i thought i would never get where i could be alone like this where i couldcryif i wanted to i am not much ofa crier am i daddy but this timethistime she suddenly drew herself over near to her father and looked at him oh daddy i want to tell you one thing just one simple little thing she waited then and while she waited her fathers head went lower and lower of course you knowi told you once i love him i love him yes probably he is a rascal but do you know i dont think i would mind if he was aan assassin this morning i sent him away but daddy he didnt want to go at all i know he didnt this nora black is nothing to him i know she is not i am sure of it yesi am sure of it i never expected to talk this way to any living creature butyou are so good daddy dear old daddy she ceased for she saw that her father was praying the sight brought to her a new outburst of sobbing for her sorrow now had dignity and solemnity from thebowed white head of her old father and she felt that her heart was dying amid the pomp of the church it was the last rites being performed at the deathbed into her ears came some imagining of the low melan choly chant of monks in a gloom finally her father arose he kissed her on the brow try to sleep dear he said he turned out the gas and left the room his thought was full of chastened emotion but if his thought was full of chastened emotion it received some degree of shock when he arrived in the presence of mrs wainwright well what is all this about she demanded irascibly do you mean to say that marjory is breaking her heart over that man coleman it is all your fault she was apparently still ruffled over her exclusion when the professor interrupted her he did not speak with his accustomed spirit but from something novel in his manner she recognised a danger signal please do not burst out at it in that way then it is true she asked her voice was a mere awed whisper it is true answered the professor well she said after reflection i knew it i always knew it if you hadnt been so blind you turned like a weathercock in your opinions of coleman you never could keep your opinion about him for more than an hour nobody could imagine what you might think next and now you see the result of it i warned you i told you what this coleman was and if marjory is suffering now you have only yourself to blame for it i warned you if it is my fault said the professor drearily i hope god may forgive me for here is a great wrong to my daughter well if you had done as i told you she began here the professor revolted oh now do not begin on that he snarled peevishly do not begin on that anyhow said mrs wainwright it is time that we should be going down to dinner is marjory coming no she is not answered the professor and i do not know as i shall go myself but you must go think how it would look all the students down there dining without us and cutting up capers you must come yes he said dubiously but who will look after marjory she wants to be left alone announced mrs wainwright as if she was the particular herald of this news she wants to be left alone well i suppose we may as well go down before they went the professor tiptoed into his daughters room in the darkness he could only see her waxen face on the pillow and her two eyes gazing fixedly at the ceiling he did not speak but immedi ately withdrew closing the door noiselessly behind him i chapter xxvi if the professor and mrs wainwright had descended sooner to a lower floor of the hotel they would have found reigning there a form of anarchy the students were in a smoking room which was also an entrance hall to the dining room and because there was in the middle of this apartment a fountain containing gold fish they had been moved to license and sin they had all been tubbed and polished and brushed and dressed until they were exuberantly beyond themselves the proprietor of the hotel brought in his dignity and showed it to them but they minded it no more than if he had been only a common man he drew himself to his height and looked gravely at them and they jovially said hello whiskers american college students are notorious in their country for their inclination to scoff at robed and crowned authority and far from being awed by the dignity of the hotelkeeper they were delighted with it it was something with which to sport with immeasurable impudence they copied his attitude and standing before him made comic speeches always alluding with blinding vividness to his beard his exit disappointed them he had not remained long under fire they felt that they could have interested themselves with him an entire evening come back whiskers oh come back out in the main hall he made a ges ture of despair to some of his gaping minions and then fled to seclusion a formidable majority then decided that coke was a gold fish and that therefore his proper place was in the fountain they carried him to it while he strug gled madly this quiet room with its crimson rugs and gilded mirrors seemed suddenly to have become an important apartment in hell there being as yet no traffic in the dining room the waiters were all at liberty to come to the open doors where they stood as men turned to stone to them it was no less than incendiarism coke standing with one foot on the floor and the other on the bottom of the shallow fountain blasphemed his comrades in a low tone but with intention he was certainly desirous of lifting his foot out of the water but it seemed that all movement to that end would have to wait until he had successfully expressed his opinions in the meantime there was heard slow footsteps and the rustle of skirts and then some people entered the smoking room on their way to dine coke took his foot hastily out of the fountain the faces of the men of the arriving party went blank and they turned their cold and pebbly eyes straight to the front while the ladies after little ex pressions of alarm looked as if they wanted to run in fact the whole crowd rather bolted from this extraordinary scene there now said coke bitterly to his companions you see we looked like little schoolboys oh never mind old man said peter tounley well forgive you although you did embarrass us but above everything dont drip whatever you do dont drip the students took this question of dripping and played upon it until they would have made quite insane anybody but another student they worked it into all manner of forms and hacked and haggled at coke until he was driven to his room to seek other apparel be sure and change both legs they told him remember you cant change one leg without changing both legs after cokes departure the united states minister entered the room and instantly they were subdued it was not his lofty stationthat affected them there are probably few stations that would have at all affectedthem they became subdued because they unfeignedly liked the united states minister they were suddenly a group of wellbred correctly attired young men who had not put cokes foot in the fountain nor had they desecrated the majesty of the hotelkeeper well i am delighted said the minister laughing as he shook hands with them all i was not sure i would ever see you again you are not to be trusted and good boys as you are ill be glad to see you once and forever over the boundary of my jurisdiction leave greece you vagabonds however i am truly delighted to see you all safe thank you sir they said how in the world did you get out of it you must be remarkable chaps i thought you were in a hopeless position i wired and cabled everywhere i could but i could find out nothing a correspondent said peter tounley i dont know if you have met him his name is coleman he found us coleman asked the minister quickly yes sir he found us and brought us out safely well glory be to coleman exclaimed the minister after a long sigh of surprise glory be to coleman i never thought he could do it the students were alert immediately why did you know about it sir did he tell you he was coming after us of course he came tome here in athens and asked where you were i told him you were in a peck of trouble he acted quietly and somewhat queerly and said that he would try to look you up he said you were friends of his i warned him against trying it yes i said it was impossible i had no idea that he would really carry the thing out but didnt he tell you anything about this himself no sir answered peter tounley he never said much about it i think he usually contended that it was mainly an accident it was no accident said the minister sharply when a man starts out to do a thing and does it you cant say it is an accident i didnt say so sir said peter tounley diffidently quite true quite true you didnt butthis coleman must be a man we think so sir said be who was called billie he certainly brought us through in style but how did he manage it cried the minister keenly interested how did he do it it is hard to say sir but he did it he met us in the dead of night out near nikopolis near nikopolis yes sir and he hid us in a forest while a fight was going on and then in the morning he brought us inside the greek lines oh there is a lot to tell whereupon they told it or as much as they could of it in the end the minister said well where are the professor and mrs wainwright i want you all to dine with me tonight i am dining in the public room but you wont mind that after epirus they should be down now sir answered a student people were now coming rapidly to dinner and presently the professor and mrs wainwright appeared the old man looked haggard and white he accepted the ministers warm greeting with a strained pathetic smile thank you we are glad to return safely once at dinner the minister launched immediately into the subject of coleman he must be altogether a most remarkable man when he told me very quietly that he was going to try to rescue you i frankly warned him against any such attempt i thought he would merely add one more to a party of suffering people but the boys tellme that he did actually rescue you yes he did said the professor it was a very gallant performance and we are very grateful of course spoke mrs wainwright we might have rescued ourselves we were on the right road and all we had to do was to keep going on yes but i understand said the minister i understand he took you into a wood to protect you from that fight and generally protected you from all kinds of trouble it seems wonderful to me not so much because it was done as because it was done by the man who some time ago calmy announced to me that he was going to do it extraordinary of course said mrs wainwright oh of course and where is he now asked the minister suddenly has he now left you to the mercies of civilisation there was a moments curious stillness and then mrs wainwright used that high voice whichthe students believedcould only come to her when she was about to say something peculiarly destructive to the sensibilities oh of course mr coleman rendered us a great service but in his private character he is not a man whom we exactly care to associate with indeed said the minister staring then he hastily addressed the students well isnt this a comic war did you ever imagine war could be like this the professor remained looking at his wife with an air of stupefaction as if she had opened up to him visions of imbecility of which he had not even dreamed the students loyally began to chatter at the minister yes sir it is a queer war after all their bragging it is funny to hear that they are running away with such agility we thought of course of the old greek wars later the minister asked them all to his rooms for coffee and cigarettes but the professor and mrs wainwright apologetically retired to their own quarters the minister and the students made clouds of smoke through which sang the eloquent descriptions of late adventures the minister had spent days of listening to questions from the state department at washington as to the whereabouts of the wainwright party i suppose you know that you are very prominent people in the united states just now your pictures must have been in all the papers and there must have been columns printed about you my life here was made almost insupportable by your friends who consist i should think of about half the population of the country of course they laid regular siege to the de partment i am angry at coleman for only one thing when he cabled the news of your rescue to his news paper from arta he should have also wired me if only to relieve my failing mind my first news of your escape was from washingtonthink of that coleman had us all on his hands at arta said peter tounley he was a fairly busy man i suppose so said the minister by the way he asked bluntly what is wrong with him what did mrs wainwright mean they were silent for a time but it seemed plain to him that it was not evidence that his question had demoralised them they seemed to be deliberating upon the form of answer ultimately peter tounley coughed behind his hand you see sir he began there iswell there is a woman in the case not that anybody would care to speak of it excepting to you but that is what is the cause of things and then you see mrs wainwright iswell he hesitated a moment and then completed his sentence in the ingenuous profanity of his age and condition she is rather an extraordinary old bird but who is the woman why it is nora blaick the actress oh cried the minister enlightened her why i saw her here she was very beautiful but she seemed harmless enough she was somewhaterconfident perhaps but she did not alarm me she called upon me and i confess iwhy she seemed charming shes sweet on little rufus thats the point said an oracular voice oh cried the host suddenly i remember she asked me where he was she said she had heard he was in greece and i told her he had gone knighterranting off after you people i remember now i suppose she posted after him up to arta eh thats it and so she asked you where he was yes why that old flamingomrs wainwright insists that it was a rendezvous every one exchanged glances and laughed a little and did you see any actual fighting asked the minister no we only beard it afterward as they were trooping up to their rooms peter tounley spoke musingly well it looks to me now as if old mother wainwright was just a badminded old hen oh i dont know how is one going to tell what the truth is at any rate we are sure now that coleman had nothing to do with noras debut in epirus they had talked much of coleman but in their tones there always had been a note of indifference or carelessness this matter which to some people was as vital and fundamental as existence remained to others who knew of it only a harmless detail of life with no terrible powers and its significance had faded greatly when had ended the close associations of the late adventure after dinner the professor had gone directly to his daughters room apparently she had not moved he knelt by the bedside again and took one of her hands she was not weeping she looked at him and smiled through the darkness daddy i would like to die she said i thinkyesi would like to die for a long time the old man was silent but he arose at last with a definite abruptness and said hoarsely wait mrs wainwright was standing before her mirror with her elbows thrust out at angles above her head while her fingers moved in a disarrangement of her hair in the glass she saw a reflection of her husband coming from marjorys room and his face was set with some kind of alarming purpose she turned to watch him actually but he walked toward the door into the corridor and did not in any wise heed her harrison she called where are you going he turned a troubled face upon her and as if she had hailed him in his sleep he vacantly said what where are you going she demanded with increasing trepidation he dropped heavily into a chair going he repeated she was angry yes going where are you going i am going he answered i am going to see rufus coleman mrs wainwright gave voice to a muffled scream not about marjory yes he said about marjory it was now mrs wainwrights turn to look at her husband with an air of stupefaction as if he had opened up to her visions of imbecility of which she had not even dreamed about marjory she gurgled then suddenly her wrath flamed out well upon my word harrison wainwright you are of all men in the world the most silly and stupid you are absolutely beyond belief of all projects and what do you think marjory would have to say of it if she knew it i suppose you think she would like it why i tell you she would keep her right hand in the fire until it was burned off before she would allow you to do such a thing she must never know it responded the professor in dull misery then think of yourself think of the shame of it the shame of it the professor raised his eyes for an ironical glance at his wife oh i have thought of the shame of it and youll accomplish nothing cried mrs wainwright youll accomplish nothing hell only laugh at you if he laughs at me he will laugh at nothing but a poor weak unworldly old man it is my duty to go mrs wainwright opened her mouth as if she was about to shriek after choking a moment she said your duty your duty to go and bend the knee to that man yourduty it is my duty to go he repeated humbly if i can find even one chance for my daughters happiness in a personal sacrifice he can do no more than he can do no more than make me a little sadder his wife evidently understood his humility as a tribute to her arguments and a clear indication that she had fatally undermined his original intention oh he would have made you sadder she quoth grimly no fear why it was the most insane idea i ever heard of the professor arose wearily well i must be going to this work it is a thing to have ended quickly there was something almost biblical in his manner harrison burst out his wife in amazed lamentation you are not really going to do it not really i am going to do it he answered well there ejaculated mrs wainwright to the heavens she was so to speak prostrate well there as the professor passed out of the door she cried beseechingly but futilely after him harrison in a mechanical way she turned then back to the mirror and resumed the disarrangement of her hair she addressed her image well of all stupid creatures under the sun men are the very worst and her image said this to her even as she informed it and afterward they stared at each other in a profound and tragic reception and acceptance of this great truth presently she began to consider the advisability of going to marjdry with the whole story really harrison must not be allowed to go on blundering until the whole world heard that marjory was trying to break her heart over that common scamp of a coleman it seemed to be about time for her mrs wainwright to come into the situation and mend matters chapter xxvil when the professor arrived before colemans door he paused a moment and looked at it previously he could not have imagined that a simple door would ever so affect him every line of it seemed to express cold superiority and disdain it was only the door of a former student one of his old boys whom as the need arrived he had whipped with his satire in the class rooms at washurst until the mental blood had come and all without a conception of his ultimately arriving before the door of this boy in the attitude of a supplicant hewould not say it coleman probably would not say it butthey would both know it a single thought of it made him feel like running away he would never dare to knock on that door it would be too monstrous and even as he decided that he was afraid to knock he knocked colemans voice said come in the professor opened the door the correspondent without a coat was seated at a paperlittered table near his elbow upon another table was a tray from which he had evidently dined and also a brandy bottle with several recumbent bottles of soda although he had so lately arrived at the hotel he had contrived to diffuse his traps over the room in an organised disarray which represented a long and careless occupation if it did not represent tle scene of a scuffle his pipe was in his mouth after a first murmur of surprise he arose and reached in some haste for his coat come in professor come in he cried wriggling deeper into his jacket as he held out his hand he had laid aside his pipe and had also been very successful in flinging a newspaper so that it hid the brandy and soda this act was a feat of deference to the professors well known principles wont you sit down sir said coleman cordially his quick glance of surprise had been immediately suppressed and his manner was now as if the professors call was a common matter thank you mr coleman iyes i will sit down replied the old man his hand shook as he laid it on the back of the chair and steadied himself down into it thank you coleman looked at him with a great deal of expectation mr coleman yes sir i he halted then and passed his hand over his face his eyes did not seem to rest once upon coleman but they occupied themselves in furtive and frightened glances over the room coleman could make neither head nor tail of the affair he would not have believed any mans statement that the professor could act in such an extraordinary fashion yes sir he said again suggestively the simple strategy resulted in a silence that was actually awkward coleman despite his bewilderment hastened into a preserving gossip ive had a great many cables waiting for me for heaven knowshow long and others have been arriving in flocks tonight you have no idea of the row in america professor why everybody must have gone wild over the lost sheep my paper has cabled some things that are evidently for you for instance here is one that says a new puzzlegame called find the wainwright party has had a big success think of that would you coleman grinned at the professor find the wainwright party a new puzzlegame the professor had seemed grateful for colemans tangent off into matters of a light vein yes he said almost eagerly are they selling a game really called that yes really replied coleman and of course you know thaterwell all the sunday papers would of course have big illustrated articlesfull pageswith your photographs and general private histories pertaining mostly to things which are none of their business yes i suppose they would do that admitted the professor but i dare say it may not be as bad as you suggest very like not said coleman i put it to you forcibly so that in the future the blow will not be too cruel they are often a weird lot perhaps they cant find anything very bad about us oh no and besides the whole episode will probably be forgotten by the time you return to the united states they talked onin this way slowly strainedly until they each found that the situation would soon become insupportable the professor had come for a distinct purpose and coleman knew it they could not sit there lying at each other forever yet when he saw the pain deepening in the professors eyes the correspondent again ordered up his trivialities funny thing my paper has been congratulating me you know sir in a wholesale fashion and i thinki feel surethat they have been exploiting my name all over the country as the heroic rescuer there is no sense in trying to stop them because they dont care whether it is true or not true all they want is the privilege of howling out that their correspondent rescued you and they would take that privilege without in any ways worrying if i refused my consent you see sir i wouldnt like you to feel that i was such a strident idiot as i doubtless am appearing now before the public no said the professor absently it was plain that he had been a very slack listener imr coleman he began yes sir answered coleman promptly and gently it was obviously only a recognition of the futility of further dallying that was driving the old man onward he knew of course that if he was resolved to take this step a longer delay would simply make it harder for him the correspondent leaning forward was watching him almost breathlessly mr coleman i understandor at least i am led to believethat youat one time proposed marriage to my daughter the faltering words did not sound as if either man had aught to do with them they were an expression by the tragic muse herself colemans jaw fell and he looked glassily at the professor he said yes but already his blood was leaping as his mind flashed everywhere in speculation i refused my consent to that marriage said the old man more easily i do not know if the matter has remained important to you but at any rate ii retract my refusal suddenly the blank expression left colemans face and he smiled with sudden intelligence as if information of what the professor had been saying had just reached him in this smile there was a sudden be trayal too of something keen and bitter which had lain hidden in the mans mind he arose and made a step towards the professor and held out his hand sir i thank yod from the bottom of my heart and they both seemed to note with surprise that colemans voice had broken the professor had arisen to receive colemans hand his nerve was now of iron and he was very formal i judge from your tone that i have not made a mistakesomcthing which i feared coleman did not seem to mind the professors formality dont fear anything wont you sit down again will you have a cigar no i couldnt tell you how glad i am how glad i am i feel like a fool it but the professor fixed him with an arctic eye and bluntly said you love her the question steadied coleman at once he looked undauntedly straight into the professors face he simply said i love her you love her repeated the professor i love her repeated coleman after some seconds of pregnant silence the professor arose well if she cares to give her life to you i will allow it but i must say that i do not consider you nearly good enough goodnight he smiled faintly as he held out his hand goodnight sir said coleman and i cant tell you now mrs wainwright in her room was languishing in a chair and applying to her brow a handkerchief wet with cologne water she kept her feverish glarice upon the door remembering well the manner of her husband when he went out she could hardly identify him when he came in serenity composure even selfsatisfaction was written upon him he paid no attention to her but going to a chair sat down with a groan of contentment well cried mrs wainwright starting up well wellwhat he asked she waved her hand impatiently harrison dont be absurd you know perfectly well what i mean it is a pity you couldnt think of the anxiety i have been in she was going to weep oh ill tell you after awhile he said stretching out his legs with the complacency of a rich merchant after a successful day no tell me now she implored him cant you see ive worried myself nearly to death she was not going to weep she was going to wax angry well to tell the truth said the professor with considerable pomposity ive arranged it didnt think i could do it at first but it turned out i arranged it wailed mrs wainwright arranged what it here seemed to strike the professor suddenly that he was not such a flaming example for diplomatists as he might have imagined arranged he stammered arranged arranged what why i fixedi fixed it up fixed what up itit began the professor then he swelled with indignation why cant you understand anything at all ii fixed it fixed what fixed it fixed it with coleman fixed what with coleman the professors wrath now took control of him thunder and lightenin you seem to jump at the conclusion that ive made some horrible mistake for goodness sake give me credit for a particle of sense what did you do she asked in a sepulchral voice well said the professor in a burning defiance ill tell you what i did i went to coleman and told him that onceas he of course knewi had refused his marriage with my daughter but that now grrr said mrs wainwright but that now continued the professor i retracted that refusal mercy on us cried mrs wainwright throwing herself back in the chair mercy on us what fools men are now wait a minute but mrs wainwright began to croon oh if marjory should hear of this oh if she should hear of it just let her hear but she must not cried the professor tigerishly just you dare and the woman saw before her a man whose eyes were lit with a flame which almost expressed a temporary hatred the professor had left coleman so abruptly that the correspondent found himself murmuring half coherent gratitude to the closed door of his room amazement soon began to be mastered by exultation he flung himself upon the brandy and soda and negotiated a strong glass pacing the room with nervous steps he caught a vision of himself in a tall mirror he halted before it well well he said rufus youre a grand man there is not your equal anywhere you are a great bold strong player fit to sit down to a game with thebest a moment later it struck him that he had appropriated too much if the professor had paid him a visit and made a wonderful announcement he coleman had not been the engine of it and then he enunciated clearly something in his mind which even in a vague form had been responsible for much of his early elation marjory herself had compassed this thing with shame he rejected a first wild and preposterous idea that she had sent her father to him he reflected that a man who for an instant could conceive such a thing was a naturalborn idiot with an equal feeling he rejected also an idea that she could have known anything of her fathers purpose if she had known of his purpose there would have been no visit what then was the cause coleman soon decided that the professor had witnessed some demonstration of marjorys emotion which had been sufficiently severe in its character to force him to the extraordinary visit but then this also was wild and preposterous that coldly beautiful goddess would not have given a demonstration of emotion over rufus coleman sufficiently alarming to have forced her father on such an errand that was impossible no he was wrong marjory even indirectly could not be connected with the visit as he arrived at this decision the enthusiasm passed out of him and he wore a doleful monkish face well what then was the cause after eliminating marjory from the discussion waging in his mind he found it hard to hit upon anything rational the only remaining theory was to the effect that the professor having a very high sense of the correspond ents help in the escape of the wainwright party had decided that the only way to express his gratitude was to revoke a certain decision which he now could see had been unfair the retort to this theory seemed to be that if the professor had had such a fine conception of the services rendered by coleman he had had ample time to display his appreciation on the road to arta and on the road down from arta there was no necessity for his waiting until their arrival in athens it was impossible to concede that the professors emotion could be anew one if he had it now he must have had it in far stronger measure directly after he had been hauled out of danger so it may be seen that after coleman had eliminated marjory from the discussion that was waging in his mind he had practically succeeded in eliminating the professor as well this he thought mournfully was eliminating with a vengeance if he dissolved all the factors he could hardly proceed the mind of a lover moves in a circle or at least on a more circular course than other minds some of which at times even seem to move almost in a straight line presently coleman was at the point where he bad started and he did not pause until he reached that theory which asserted that the professor had been inspired to his visit by some sight or knowledge of marjory in distress of course coleman was wistfully desirous of proving to himself the truth of this theory the palpable agitation of the professor during the interview seemed to support it if he had come on a mere journey of conscience he would have hardly appeared as a white and trembling old man but then said coleman he himself probably exaggerated this idea of the professors appearance it might have been that he was only sour and distressed over the performance of a very disagreeable duty the correspondent paced his room and smoked sometimes he halted at the little table where was the brandy and soda he thought so hard that sometimes it seemed that marjory had been to him to propose marriage and at other times it seemed that there had been no visit from any one at all a desire to talk to somebody was upon him he strolled down stairs and into the smoking and reading rooms hoping to see a man he knew even if it were coke but the only occupants were two strangers furiously debating the war passing the ministers room coleman saw that there was a light within and he could not forbear knocking he was bidden to enter and opened the door upon the minister carefully reading his spectator fresh from london he looked up and seemed very glad how are you he cried i was tremendously anxious to see you do you know i looked for you to dine with me tonight but you were not down no i had a great deal of work over the wainwright affair by the way i want you to accept my personal thanks for that work in a week more i would have gone demented and spent the rest of my life in some kind of a cage shaking the bars and howling out state department messages about the wainwrights you see in my territory there are no missionaries to get into trouble and i was living a life of undisturbed and innocent calm ridiculing the sentiments of men from smyrna and other interesting towns who maintained that the diplomatic service was exciting however when the wainwright party got lost my life at once became active i was all but helpless too which was the worst of it i suppose terry at constantinople must have got grandly stirred up also pity he cant see you to thank you for saving him from probably going mad by the way he added while looking keenly at coleman the wainwrights dont seem to be smothering you with gratitude oh as much as i deservesometimes more answered coleman my exploit was more or less of a fake you know i was between the lines by accident or through the efforts of that blockhead of a dragoman i didnt intend it and then in the night when we were waiting in the road because of a fight they almost bunked into us thats all they tell it better said the minister severely especially the youngsters those kids got into a high old fight at a town up there beyond agrinion tell you about that did they i thought not clever kids you have noted that there are signs of a few bruises and scratches yes but i didnt ask well they are from the fight it seems the people took us for germans and there was an awful palaver which ended in a proper and handsome shindig it raised the town i tell you the minister sighed in mock despair take these people home will you or at any rate conduct them out of the field of my responsibility now they would like italy immensely i am sure coleman laughed and they smoked for a time thats a charming girlmiss wainwright said the minister musingly and what a beauty it does my exiled eyes good to see her i suppose all those youngsters are madly in love with her i dont see how they could help it yes said coleman glumly more than half of them the minister seemed struck with a sudden thought you ought to try to win that splendid prize yourself the rescuer perseus what more fitting coleman answered calmly well i think ill take your advice chapter xxviii the next morning coleman awoke with a sign of a resolute decision on his face as if it had been a development of his sleep he would see marjory as soon as possible see her despite any barbedwire entanglements which might be placed in the way by her mother whom he regarded as his strenuous enemy and he would ask marjorys hand in the presence of all athens if it became necessary he sat a long time at his breakfast in order to see the wainwrights enter the dining room and as he was about to surrender to the will of time they came in the professor placid and selfsatisfied mrs wainwright worried and injured and marjory cool beautiful serene if there had been any kind of a storm there was no trace of it on the white brow of the girl coleman studied her closely but furtively while his mind spun around his circle of speculation finally he noted the waiter who was observing him with a pained air as if it was on the tip of his tongue to ask this guest if he was going to remain at breakfast forever coleman passed out to the reading room where upon the table a multitude of great red guide books were crushing the fragile magazines of london and paris on the walls were various depressing maps with the name of a tourist agency luridly upon them and there were also some pictures of hotels with their ratesin francsprinted beneath the room was cold dark empty with the trail of the tourist upon it coleman went to the picture of a hotel in corfu and stared at it precisely as if he was interested he was standing before it when he heard marjorys voice just without the door all right ill wait he did not move for the reason that the hunter moves not when the unsuspecting deer approaches his hiding place she entered rather quickly and was well toward the centre of the room before she perceived coleman oh she said and stopped then she spoke the immortal sentence a sentence which curiously enough is common to the drama to the novel and to life i thought no one was here she looked as if she was going to retreat but it would have been hard to make such retreat graceful and probably for this reason she stood her ground coleman immediately moved to a point between her and the door you are not going to run away from me marjory wainwright he cried angrily you at least owe it to me to tell me definitely that you dont love methat you cant love me she did not face him with all of her old spirit but she faced him and in her answer there was the old marjory a most common question do you ask all your feminine acquaintances that i mean he said i mean that i love you and yesterdayno todayyes tomorrowwho knows really you ought to take some steps to know your own mind know my own mind he retorted in a burst of indignation you mean you ought to take steps to know your own mind my own mind you then she halted in acute confusion and all her face went pink she had been far quicker than the man to define the scene she lowered her head let me past please but coleman sturdily blocked the way and even took one of her struggling hands marjory and then his brain must have roared with a thousand quick sentences for they came tumbling out one over the other her resistance to the grip of his fingers grew somewhat feeble once she raised her eyes in a quick glance at him then suddenly she wilted she surrendered she confessed without words oh marjory thank god thank god peter tounley made a dramatic entrance on the gallop he stopped petrified whoo he cried my stars he turned and fled but coleman called after him in a low voice intense with agitation come back here you young scoundrel come baok here i peter returned looking very sheepish i hadnt the slightest idea you never mind that now but look here if you tell a single soulparticularly those other young scoundrelsill break i wont coleman honest i wont he was far more embarrassed than coleman and almost equally so with marjory he was like a horse tugging at a tether i wont coleman honest well all right then peter escaped the professor and his wife were in their sitting room writing letters the cablegrams had all been answered but as the professor intended to prolong his journey homeward into a month of paris and london there remained the arduous duty of telling their friends at length exactly what had happened there was considerable of the lore of olden greece in the professors descriptions of their escape and in those of mrs wainwright there was much about the lack of hairpins and soap their heads were lowered over their writing when the door into the corridor opened and shut quickly and upon looking up they saw in the room a radiant girl a new marjory she dropped to her knees by her fathers chair and reached her arms to his neck oh daddy im happy i im so happy whywhat began the professor stupidly oh i am so happy daddy of course he could not be long in making his conclusion the one who could give such joy to marjory was the one who last night gave her such grief the professor was only a moment in understanding he laid his hand tenderly upon her head bless my soul he murmured and soand sohe at the personal pronoun mrs wainwright lumbered frantically to her feet what she shouted coleman yes answered marjory coleman as she spoke the name her eyes were shot with soft yet tropic flashes of light mrs wainwright dropped suddenly back into her chair wellofallthings the professor was stroking his daughters hair and although for a time after mrs wainwrights outbreak there was little said the old man and the girl seemed in gentle communion she making him feel her happiness he making her feel his appreciation providentially mrs wainwright had been so stunned by the first blow that she was evidently rendered incapable of speech and are you sure you will be happy with him asked her father gently all my life long she answered i am glad i am glad said the father but even as he spoke a great sadness came to blend with his joy the hour when he was to give this beautiful and beloved life into the keeping of another had been heralded by the god of the sexes the ruthless god that devotes itself to the tearing of children from the parental arms and casting them amid the mysteries of an irretrievable wedlock the thought filled him with solemnity but in the dewy eyes of the girl there was no question the world to her was a land of glowing promise i am glad repeated the professor the girl arose from her knees i must go away andthink all about it she said smiling when the door of her room closed upon her the mother arose in majesty harrison wainwright she declaimed you are not going to allow this monstrous thing the professor was aroused from a reverie by these words what monstrous thing he growled why this between coleman and marjory yes he answered boldly harrison that man who the professor crashed his hand down on the table mary i will not hear another word of it well said mrs wainwright sullen and ominous time will tell time will tell when coleman bad turned from the fleeing peter tounley again to marjory he found her making the preliminary movements of a flight whats the matter he demanded anxiously oh its too dreadful nonsense lie retorted stoutly only peter tounley he dont count what of that oh dear she pressed her palm to a burning cheek she gave him a starlike beseeching glance let me go nowplease well he answered somewhat affronted if you like at the door she turned to look at him and this glance expressed in its elusive way a score of things which she had not yet been able to speak it explained that she was loth to leave him that she asked forgiveness for leaving him that even for a short absence she wished to take his image in her eyes that he must not bully her that there was something now in her heart which frightened her that she loved him that she was happy when she had gone coleman went to the rooms of the american minister a greek was there who talked wildly as he waved his cigarette coleman waited in wellconcealed impatience for the dvaporation of this man once the minister regarding the correspondent hurriedly interpolated a comment you look very cheerful yes answered coleman ive been taking your advice oh ho said the minister the greek with the cigarette jawed endlessly coleman began to marvel at the enduring good manners of the minister who continued to nod and nod in polite appreciation of the greeks harangue which coleman firmly believed had no point of interest whatever but at last the man after an effusive farewell went his way now said the minister wheeling in his chair tell me all about it coleman arose and thrusting his hands deep in his trousers pockets began to pace the room with long strides he said nothing but kept his eyes on the floor can i have a drink he asked abruptly pausing what would you like asked the minister benevolently as he touched the bell a brandy and soda id like it very much you see he said as he resumed his walk i have no kind of right to burden you with my affairs but to tell the truth if i dont get this news off my mind and into somebodys ear ill die its thisi asked marjory wainwright to marry me andshe accepted andthats all well i am very glad cried the minister arising and giving his hand and as for burdening me with your affairs no one has a better right you know since you released me from the persecution of washington and the friends of the wainwrights may good luck follow you both forever you in my opinion are a very very fortunate man and for her part she has not done too badly seeing that it was important that coleman should have his spirits pacified in part the minister continued now i have got to write an official letter so you just walk up and down here and use up this surplus steam else youll explode but coleman was not to be detained now that he had informed the minister he must rush off some where anywhere and dohe knew not what all right said the minister laughing you have a wilder head than i thought but look here he called as coleman was making for the door am i to keep this news a secret coleman with his hand on the knob turned im pressively he spoke with deliberation as far as i am concerned i would be glad to see a man paint it in red letters eight feet high on the front of the kings palace the minister left alone wrote steadily and did not even look up when peter tounley and two others entered in response to his cry of permission how ever he presently found time to speak over his shoulder to them hear the news no sir they answered well be good boys now and read the papers and look at pictures until i finish this letter then i will tell you they surveyed him keenly they evidently judged that the news was worth hearing but obediently they said nothing ultimately the minister affixed a rapid signature to the letter and turning looked at the students with a smile havent heard the news eh no sir well marjory wainwright is engaged to marry coleman the minister was amazed to see the effect of this announcement upon the three students he had expected the crows and cackles of rather absurd merriment with which unbearded youth often greets such news but there was no crow or cackle one young man blushed scarlet and looked guiltily at the floor with a great effort he muttered shes too good for him another student had turned ghastly pate and was staring it was peter tounley who relieved the ministers mind for upon that young mans face was a broad jackolantern grin and the minister saw that at any rate he had not made a complete massacre peter tounley said triumphantly i knew it the minister was anxious over the havoc he had wrought with the two other students but slowly the colour abated in one face and grew in the other to give them opportunity the minister talked busily to peter tounley and how did you know it you young scamp peter was jubilant ohi knew it i knew it i i am very clever the student who had blushed now addressed the minister in a slightly strained voice are you positive that it is true mr gordner i had it on the best authority replied the minister gravely the student who had turned pale said oh its true of course well said crudely the one who had blushed shes a great sight too good for coleman or anybody like him thats all ive got to say oh coleman is a good fellow said peter tounley reproachfully youve no right to say thatexactly you dont know where youd be now if it were not for coleman the response was first an angry gesture oh dont keep everlasting rubbing that in for heavens sake let upsupposing i dont know where id be now if it were not for rufus coleman what of it for the rest of my life have i got to the minister saw that this was the embittered speech of a really defeated youth so to save scenes he gently ejected the trio there there now run along home like good boys ill be busy until luncheon and idare say you wont find coleman such a bad chap in the corridor one of the students said offensively to peter tounley say how in hell did you find out all this so early peters reply was amiable in tone you are a damned bleating little kid and you made a holy show of yourself before mr gordner theres where you stand didnt you see that he turned us out because he didnt know but what you were going to blubber or somethingyou are a sucking pig and if you want to know how i find out things go ask the delphic oracle you blind ass you better look out or you may get a punch in the eye you take one punch in the general direction of my eye me son saidpeter cheerfully and ill distribute your remains over this hotel in a way that will cause your friends years of trouble to collect you instead of anticipating an attack upon my eye you had much better be engaged in improving your mind which is at present not a fit machine to cope with exciting situations theres coke hello coke hear the news well marjory wainwright and rufus coleman are engaged straight certainly go ask the minister coke did not take peters word is that so he asked the others so the minister told us they answered and then these two who seemed so unhappy watched cokes face to see if they could not find surprised misery there but coke coolly said well then i suppose its true it soon became evident that the students did not care for each others society peter tounley was probably an exception but the others seemed to long for quiet corners they were distrusting each other and in a boyish way they were even capable of maligant things their excuses for separation were badly made ii think ill go for a walk im going up stairs to read well so long old man so long there was no heart to it peter tounley went to colemans door where he knocked with noisy hilarity come in i the correspondent apparently had just come from the street for his hat was on his head and a light topcoat was on his back he was searching hurriedly through some papers hello you young devil what are you doing here peters entrance was a somewhat elaborate comedy which coleman watched in icy silence peter after a long and impudent pantomime halted abruptly and fixing coleman with his eye demanded well wellwhat said coleman bristling a trifle is it true is what true is it true peter was extremely solemn say me bucko said coleman suddenly if youve come up here to twist the beard of the patriarch dont you think you are running a chance all right ill be good said peter and he sat on the bed butis it true is what true what the whole hotel is saying i havent heard the hotel making any remarks lately been talking to the other buildings i suppose well i want to tell you that everybody knows that you and marjory have done gone and got yourselves engaged said peter bluntly and well asked coleman imperturbably oh nothing replied peter waving his hand onlyi thought it might interest you coleman was silent for some time he fingered his papers at last he burst out joyously and so they know it already do they welldamn themlet them know it but you didnt tell them yourself i quoth peter wrathfully no the minister told us then coleman was again silent for a time and peter tounley sat on the bed reflectively looking at the ceiling funny thing marjory way over here in greece and then you happening over here the way you did it isnt funny at all why isnt it because said coleman impressively that is why i came to greece it was all planned see whirroo exclaimed peter this here is magic no magic at all coleman displayed some complacence no magic at all just pure plain whatever you choose to call it holy smoke said peter admiring the situation why this is plum romance coleman im blowed if it isnt coleman was grinning with delight he took a fresh cigar and his bright eyes looked at peter through the smoke seems like it dont it yes regular romance have a drink my boy just to celebrate my good luck and be patient if i talk a great deal of mymyfuture my head spins with it he arose to pace the room flinging out bis arms in a great gesture god when i think yesterday was not like today i wonder how i stood it there was a knock at the door and a waiter left a note in colemans hand dear ruf uswe are going for a drive this afternoon at three and mother wishes you to come if you care to i too wish it if you care to yours marjory with a radiant face coleman gave the note a little crackling flourish in the air oh you dont know what life is kid ssteady the blues said peter tounley seriously youll lose your head if you dont watch out not i cried coleman with irritation but a man must turn loose some times mustnt he when the four students had separated in the corridor coke had posted at once to nora blacks sitting room his entrance was somewhat precipitate but he cooled down almost at once for he reflected that he was not bearing good news he ended by perching in awkward fashion on the brink of his chair and fumbling his hat uneasily nora floated to him in a cloud of a white dressing gown she gave him a plump hand well youngman she said with a glowing smile she took a chair and the stuff of her gown fell in curves over the arms of it coke looked hot and bothered as if he could have more than half wanted to retract his visit iawwe havent seen much of you lately he began sparing he had expected to tell his news at once no said nora languidly i have been resting after that horrible journeythat horrible journey dear dear nothing will ever induce me to leave london new york and paris i am at home there but here i why it is worse than living in brooklyn and that journey into the wilds no no not for me i suppose well all be glad to get home said coke aimlessly at the moment a waiter entered the room and began to lay the table for luncheon he kept open the door to the corridor and he had the luncheon at a point just outside the door his excursions to the trays were flying ones so that as far as cokes purpose was concerned the waiter was always in the room moreover coke was obliged naturally to depart at once he had bungled everything as he arose he whispered hastily does this waiter understand english yes answered nora why because i have something to tell youimportant what is it whispered nora eagerly he leaned toward her and replied marjory wainwright and coleman are engaged to his unfeigned astonishment nora black burst into peals of silvery laughter oh indeed and so this is your tragic story poor innocent lambkin and what did you expect that i would faint i thoughti dont know murmured coke in confusion nora became suddenly businesslike but how do you know are you sure who told you anyhow stay to luncheon dolike a good boy oh you must coke dropped again into his chair he studied her in some wonder i thought youd be surprised he said ingenuously oh you did did you well you see im not and now tell me all about it theres really nothing to tell but the plain fact some of the boys dropped in at the ministers rooms a little while ago and he told them of it thats all well how did he know i am sure i cant tell you got it first hand i suppose he likes coleman and coleman is always hanging up there oh perhaps coleman was lying said nora easily then suddenly her face brightened and she spoke with animation oh i havent told you how my little greek officer has turned out have i no well it is simply lovely do you know he belongs to one of the best families in athens hedoes and theyre richrich as can be my courier tells me that the marble palace where they live is enough to blind you and that if titles hadnt gone out of styleor somethinghere in greece my little officer would be a prince think of that the courier didnt know it until we got to athens and the little officerthe princegave me his card of course one of the oldest noblest and richest families in greece think of that there i thought he was only a bothersome little officer who came in handy at times and there he turns out to be a prince i could hardly keep myself from rushing right off to find him and apologise to him for the way i treated him it was awful and added the fair nora pensively if he does meet me in paris ill make him wear that title down to a shred you can bet whats the good of having a title unless you make it work chapter xxix coke did not stay to luncheon with nora black he went away saying to himself either that girl dont care a straw for coleman or she has got a heart absolutely of flint or she is the greatest actress on earth orthere is some other reason at his departure nora turned and called into an adjoining room maude i the voice of her companion and friend answered her peevishly what dont bother me im reading well anyhow luncheon is ready so you will have to stir your precious self responded nora youre lazy i dont want any luncheon dont bother me ive got a headache well if you dont come out youll miss the news thats all ive got to say there was a rustle in the adjoining room and immediately the companion appeared seeming much annoyed but curious well what is it rufus coleman is engaged to be married to that wainwright girl after all well i declare ejaculated the little old lady well i declare she meditated for a moment and then continued in a tone of satisfaction i told you that you couldnt stop that man coleman if he had feally made up his mind to youre a fool said nora pleasantly why said the old lady because you are dont talk to me about it i want to think of marco marco quoted the old lady startled the prince the prince cant you understand i mean the prince marco again quoted the old lady under her breath yes marco cried nora belligerently marco do you object to the name whats the matter with you anyhow well rejoined the other nodding her head wisely he may be a prince but ive always heard that these continental titles are no good in comparison to the english titles yes but who told you so eh demanded nora noisily she herself answered the question the english anyhow that little marquis who tagged after you in london is a much bigger man in every way ill bet than this little prince of yours butgood heavenshe didnt mean it why he was only one of the regular rounders but marco he is serious i he means it hed go through fire and water for me and be glad of the chance well proclaimed the old lady if you are not the strangest woman in the world id like to know here i thought what did you think demanded nora suspisciously i thought that coleman bosh interrupted the graceful nora i tell you what maude youd better try to think as little as possible it will suit your style of beauty better and above all dont think of my affairs i myself am taking pains not to think of them its easier mrs wainwright with no spirit of intention what ever had sit about readjusting her opinions it is certain that she was unconscious of any evolution if some one had said to her that she was surrendering to the inevitable she would have been immediately on her guard and would have opposed forever all suggestions of a match between marjory and coleman on the other hand if some one had said to her that her daughter was going to marry a human serpent and that there were people in athens who would be glad to explain his treacherous character she would have haughtily scorned the talebearing and would have gone with more haste into the professors way of thinking in fact she was in process of undermining herself and the work could have been retarded or advanced by any irresponsible gossipy tongue the professor from the depths of his experience with her arranged a course of conduct if i just leave her to herself she will come around all right but if i go striking while the iron is hot or any of those things ill bungle it surely as they were making ready to go down to luncheon mrs wainwright made her speech which first indicated a changing mind well what will be will be she murmured with a prolonged sigh of resignation what will be will be girls are very headstrong in these days and there is nothing much to be done with them they go their own roads it wasnt so in my girlhoodwe were obliged to pay attention to our mothers wishes i did not notice that you paid much attention to your mothers wishes when you married me remarked the professor in fact i thought that was another thing retorted mrs wainwright with severity you were a steady young man who had taken the highest honours all through your college course and my mothers sole objection was that we were too hasty she thought weought to wait until you had a penny to bless yourself with and i can see now where she was quite right well you married me anyhow said the professor victoriously mrs wainwright allowed her husbands retort to pass over her thoughtful mood they say they say rufus coleman makes as much as fifteen thousand dollars a year thats more than three times your income i dont know it all depends on whether they try to save or not his manner of life is no doubt very luxurious i dont suppose he knows how to economise at all that kind of a man usually doesnt and then in the newspaper world positions are so very precarious men may have valuable positions one minute and be penniless in the street the next minute it isnt as if he had any real income and of course he has no real ability if he was suddenly thrown out of his position goodness knows what would become of him still stillfifteen thousand dollars a year is a big incomewhile it lasts i suppose he is very extravagant that kind of a man usually is and i wouldnt be surprised if he was heavily in debt very heavily in debt still if marjory has set her heart there is nothing to be done i suppose it wouldnt have happened if you had been as wise as you thought you were i suppose he thinks i have been very rude to him well some times i wasnt nearly so rude as i felt like being feeling as i did i could hardly be very amiable of course this drive this afternoon was all your affair and marjorys but of course i shall be nice to him and what of all this nora black business asked the professor with a display of valour but really with much trepidation she is a hussy responded mrs wainwright with energy her conversation in the carriage on the way down to agrinion sickened me i really believe that her plan was simply to break everything off between marjory and coleman said the professor and i dont believe she had anygrounds for all that appearance of owning coleman and the rest of it of course she didnt assented mrs wainwright the vicious thing on the other hand said the professor there might be some truth in it i dont think so said mrs wainwright seriously i dont believe a word of it you do not mean to say that you think coleman a model man demanded the professor not at all not at all she hastily answered but one doesnt look for model men these days who told you he made fifteen thousand a year asked the professor it was peter tounley this morning we were talking upstairs after breakfast and he remarked that he if could make fifteen thousand a year like coleman hedive forgotten whatsome fanciful thing i doubt if it is true muttered the old man wagging his head of course its true said his wife emphatically peter tounley says everybody knows it well anyhow money is not everything but its a great deal you know well enough you know you are always speaking of poverty as an evil as a grand resultant a collaboration of many lesser evils well then but began the professor meekly when i say that i mean well money is money and poverty is poverty interrupted his wife you dont have to be very learned to know that i do not say that coleman has not a very nice thing of it but i must say it is hard to think of his getting any such sum as you mention isnt he known as the most brilliant journalist in new york she demanded harshly yyes as long as it lasts but then one never knows when he will be out in the street penniless of course he has no particular ability which would be marketable if he suddenly lost his present employment of course it is not as if he was a really talented young man he might not be able to make his way at all in any new direction i dont know about that said mrs wainwright in reflective protestation i dont know about that i think he would i thought you said a moment ago the professor spoke with an air of puzzled hesitancy i thought you said a moment ago that he wouldnt succeed in anything but journalism mrs wainwright swam over the situation with a fine tranquility wellii she answered musingly if i did say that i didnt mean it exactly no i suppose not spoke the professor and despite the necessity for caution he could not keep out of his voice a faint note of annoyance of course continued the wife rufus coleman is known everywhere as a brilliant man a very brilliant man and he even might do well inin politics or something of that sort i have a very poor opinion of that kind of a mind which does well in american politics said the professor speaking as a collegian but i suppose there may be something in it well at any rate decided mrs wainwright at any rate at that moment marjory attired for luncheon and the drive entered from her room and mrs wainwright checked the expression of her important conclusion neither father or mother had ever seen her so glowing with triumphant beauty a beauty which would carry the mind of a spectator far above physical appreciation into that realm of poetry where creatures of light move and are beautiful because they cannot know pain or a burden it carried tears to the old fathers eyes he took her hands dont be too happy my child dont be too happy he admonished her tremulously it makes me afraidit makes me afraid chapter xxx it seems strange that the one who was the most hilarious over the engagement of marjory and coleman should be colemans dragoman who was indeed in a state bordering on transport it is not known how he learned the glad tidings but it is certain that he learned them before luncheon he told all the visible employes of the hotel and allowed them to know that the betrothal really had been his handiwork he had arranged it he did not make quite clear how he had performed this feat but at least he was perfectly frank in acknowledging it when some of the students came down to luncheon they saw him but could not decide what ailed him he was in the main corridor of the hotel grinning from ear to ear and when he perceived the students he made signs to intimate that they possessed in common a joyous secret whats the matter with that idiot asked coke morosely looks as if his wheels were going around too fast peter tounley walked close to him and scanned him imperturbably but with care whats up phidias the man made no articulate reply he continued to grin and gesture pain in oo tummy mother dead caught the cholera found out that youve swallowed a pair of hammered brass and irons in your beer say who are you anyhow but he could not shake this invincible glee so he went away the dragomans rapture reached its zenith when coleman lent him to the professor and he was commissioned to bring a carriage for four people to the door at three oclock he himself was to sit on the box and tell the driver what was required of him he dashed off his hat in his hand his hair flying puffing important beyond everything and apparently babbling his mission to half the people he met on the street in most countries he would have landed speedily in jail but among a people who exist on a basis ofjibbering his violent gabble aroused no suspicions as to his sanity however he stirred several livery stables to their depths and set men running here and there wildly and for the most part futiltiy at fifteen minutes to three oclock a carriage with its horses on a gallop tore around the corner and up to the front of the hotel where it halted with the pomp and excitement of a fire engine the dragoman jumped down from his seat beside the driver and scrambled hurriedly into the hoiel in the gloom of which hemet a serene stillness which was punctuated only by the leisurely tinkle of silver and glass in the dining room for a moment the dragoman seemed really astounded out of specch then he plunged into the managers room was it conceivable that monsieur coleman was still at luncheon yes in fact it was true but the carriage was at the door the carriage was at the door the manager undisturbed asked for what hour monsieur coleman had been pleased to order a carriage three oclock three oclock the manager pointed calmly at the clock very well it was now only thirteen minutes of three oclock monsieur coleman doubtless would appear at three until that hour the manager would not disturb monsieur coleman the dragoman clutched both his hands in his hair and cast a look of agony to the ceiling great god had he accomplished the herculean task of getting a carriage for four people to the door of the hotel in time for a drive at three oclock only to meet with this stoniness this inhumanity ah it was unendurable he begged the manager he implored him but at every word the manager seemed to grow more indifferent more callous he pointed with a wooden finger at the clockface in reality it is thus that greek meets greek professor wainwright and coleman strolled together out of the dining room the dragoman rushed ecstatically upon the correspondent oh meester coleman the carge is ready well all right said coleman knocking ashes from his cigar dont be in a hurry i suppose well be ready presently the man was in despair the departure of the wainwrights and coleman on this ordinary drive was of a somewhat dramatic and public nature no one seemed to know how to prevent its being so in the first place the attendants thronged out en masse for a reason which was plain at the time only to colemans dragoman and rather in the background lurked the interested students the professor was surprised and nervous coleman was rigid and angry marjory was flushed and some what hurried and mrs wainwright was as proud as an old turkeyhen as the carriage rolled away peter tounley turned to his companions and said now thats official that is the official announcement did you see old mother wainwright oh my eye wasnt she puffed up say what in hell do you suppose all these jay hawking bellboys poured out to the kerb for go back to your cages my good people as soon as the carriage wheeled into another street its occupants exchanged easier smiles and they must have confessed in some subtle way of glances that now at last they were upon their own mission a mission undefined but earnest to them all coleman had a glad feeling of being let into the family or becoming one of them the professor looked sideways at him and smiled gently you know i thought of driving you to some ruins but marjory would not have it she flatly objected to any more ruins so i thought we would drive down to new phalerum coleman nodded and smiled as if he were immensely pleased but of course new phalerum was to him no more norless than vladivostok or khartoum neither place nor distance had interest for him they swept along a shaded avenue where the dust lay thick on the leaves they passed cafes where crowds were angrily shouting over the news in the little papers they passed a hospital before which wounded men white with bandages were taking the sun then came soon to the and valley flanked by gaunt naked mountains which would lead them to the sea sometimes to accentuate the dry nakedness of this valley there would be a patch of grass upon which poppies burned crimson spots the dust writhed out from under the wheels of the carriage in the distance the sea appeared a blue halfdisc set between shoulders of barren land it would be common to say that coleman was oblivious to all about him but marjory on the contrary the parched land the isolated flame of poppies the cool air from the sea all were keenly known to him and they had developed an extraordinary power of blending sympathetically into his mood meanwhile the professor talked a great deal and as a somewhat exhilarating detail coleman perceived that ms wainwright was beaming upon him at new phaleruma small collection of pale square villasthey left the carriage and strolled by the sea the waves were snarling together like wolves amid the honeycomb rocks and from where the blue plane sprang level to the horizon came a strong cold breeze the kind of a breeze which moves an exulting man or a parson to take off his hat and let his locks flutter and tug back from his brow the professor and mrs wainwright were left to themselves marjory and coleman did not speak for a time it might have been that they did not quite know where to make a beginning at last marjory asked what has become of your splendid horse oh ive told the dragoman to have him sold as soon as he arrives said coleman absently oh im sorry i liked that horse why oh because well he was a fine then he too interrupted himself for he saw plainly that they had not come to this place to talk about a horse thereat he made speech of matters which at least did not afford as many opportunities for coherency as would the horse marjory it cant be true is it true dearest i can hardly believe iti oh i know im not nearly good enough for you good enough for me dear they all told me so and they were right why even the american minister said it everybody thinks it why aren t they wretches to think of them saying such a thing as ifas if anybody could be too do you know she paused and looked at him with a certain timid challenge i dont know why i feel it butsometimes i feel that ive been ive been flung at your head he opened his mouth in astonishment flung at my head she held up her finger and if i thought you could ever believe it is a girl flung at a mans head when her father carries her thousands of miles away and the man follows her all these miles and at last her eyes were shining and you really came to greeceon purpose toto confess you knew it all the time confess the answer was muffled well sometimes i thought you did and at other times i thought youdidnt in a secluded cove in which the seamaids once had played no doubt marjory and coleman sat in silence he was below her and if he looked at her he had to turn his glance obliquely upward she was staring at the sea with womans mystic gaze a gaze which men at once reverence and fear since it seems to look into the deep simple heart of nature and men begin to feel that their petty wisdoms are futile to control these strange spirits as wayward as nature and as pure as nature wild as the play of waves sometimes as unalterable as the mountain amid the winds and to measure them man must perforce use a mathematical formula he wished that she would lay her hand upon his hair he would be happy then if she would only of her own will touch his hair lightly with her fingersif she would do it with an unconscious air it would be even better it would show him that she was thinking of him even when she did not know she was thinking of him perhaps he dared lay his head softly against her knee did he dare as his head touched her knee she did not move she seemed to be still gazing at the sea presently idly caressing fingers played in his hair near the forehead he looked up suddenly lifting his arms he breathed out a cry which was laden with a kind of diffident ferocity i havent kissed you yet
